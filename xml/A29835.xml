         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>We begin with Acids, where we find that every Acidity is a very great Ingredient in Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, all Acids being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for promoting and <U+017F>etting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward its journey and progre<U+017F>s; Thus an Acid humour prepar'd in the Stomach out of the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and therein for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on re<U+017F>erv'd, does both promote Dige<U+017F>tion, and the <U+017F>ubaction of
<pb facs="tcp:40826:15"/>
the <U+017F>ame, for all Acids which are reduced to a fluidne<U+017F>s having their Salts advanc'd, do both promote and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t Fermentations and di<U+017F><U+017F>olutions of the <U+017F>ame in our bodies, in which action both the Salt and the Sulphure with which our Nutriments were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleni<U+017F>ht, are hereby confringed in the Ventricle and reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minute Particles; and hence is it that Chyle it <U+017F>elf thus being fermented, does get a Creamy colour by its <U+017F>ulphureous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd with the Salts, and mixt with an acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But then how the<U+017F>e Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities do get into our Bodies, we no ways making u<U+017F>e of acid things, may thus be made good.

                  <p>Salines, experience teacheth us, do congregate into diver<U+017F>e Figures and Angles, and all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being naturally Saline, <U+017F>carce perceivable in the family of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; for Herbs have their fixt Salts from their Incinerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Volatil Salts are <U+017F>een extracted from the Blood of Animals by Sublimations; and Lixivial Salts being either fixt or volatile, do infring Acidity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate Flegm, correct acid and au<U+017F>teer Effects, hinder concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bile, correct ill Humours,

it acts accordingly in our Bodies, for when its <U+017F>aline Corpu<U+017F>cles be mixt with the re<U+017F>t and made ready for di<U+017F><U+017F>olution, then it <U+017F>hews it <U+017F>elf in the fir<U+017F>t concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animals, beginnings of Fermentations, and indige<U+017F>ted Formations of things, and this bears the name of Fu<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>When from the fir<U+017F>t rudiments of Motion the Saline Particles are <U+017F>een to a<U+017F>cend with <U+017F>ome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit having Sulphure thereto add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this invigorates the <U+017F>ame and gives it a volatization.</p>
                  <p>That properly called <hi>Fluor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> when the <U+017F>aline parts which were formerly collected with the Earth and Sulphure, are now a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated to the Spirit, and this knot of mixture being loo<U+017F>ned, it thereby gets its freedom, and being thus clear'd and freed whil<U+017F>t the major part of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <p>Acreds do <U+017F>hew their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from a Volatile Salt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete things, the which being di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd from their mixtures, do <U+017F>peedily lo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves; and hence is it that <U+017F>ome Herbs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though abounding with an acred Juice whil<U+017F>t green, when they grow dry they are perfectly <U+017F>een to lo<U+017F>e their Acredity, as is made good in Scurvey-gra<U+017F>s, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the like. Again, the volatile acred Salt being mixt with the Air in the Lungs and received into the Blood by In<U+017F>piration, or taken into the Stomach with our Nutriments, or <U+017F>uckt into the Body by its pores, or mixing it <U+017F>elf with the Liquors of the Glandules or the

Acreds al<U+017F>o in the time of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do contract the Ventricle and promote an expul<U+017F>ive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therein, moving the heat with more frequent contractions, making the Pul<U+017F>e bear a part with it, and the Blood being <U+017F>tagnated, does hereby grow more acred, and this runs it into Inflammation, and oft-times converts it into purulent or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Matter.</p>
                  <p>Au<U+017F>tere Acids do generally ari<U+017F>e in tho<U+017F>e bodies which are readie<U+017F>t inclinable to A<U+017F>tringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who<U+017F>e Particles are fill'd with many <U+017F>mall prickings clo<U+017F>ing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fibres, and as it were contracting the <U+017F>ame: Thus we <U+017F>ee au<U+017F>tere Acids do breed and produce Glutino<U+017F>ities of fluid things by a<U+017F>triction, re<U+017F>tore both

                  <p>Vi<U+017F>cid Juices do variou<U+017F>ly bring Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es upon our humane Bodies; Thus we <U+017F>ee that both <hi>Saliva,</hi> Pancreatick Juice, and <hi>Lympha,</hi> do err, and prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious by their vi<U+017F>cidities in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks, and the beginnings of Catarrhs are allowed to ari<U+017F>e from vi<U+017F>cid Nutriments and cold Air.

                  </p>
                  <p>Bitter Juices carry in them both Sulphure and Salt, wherein they are <U+017F>een very equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and do operate in the Blood as they do in compound Liquors, where contracting a new bitterne<U+017F>s by being either burnt in their Concoctions, or too much <U+017F>pent by evaporation; they do hence occa<U+017F>ion a kind of bitter <U+017F>moakine<U+017F>s which they <U+017F>eem to purcha<U+017F>e hereby, and bear the <U+017F>ame in their whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>Acerbs or tart and <U+017F>owre Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces generally are in their proper
<pb facs="tcp:40826:21"/>
nature very near in kin to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tere or a<U+017F>tringent Juices, and do hurt our Bodies by ob<U+017F>tructing our Pores, wherein having once got entrance, they are not very readily or ea<U+017F>ily to be thence di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; they bear up their tart and <U+017F>owre nature, and are not to be overcome with <U+017F>uch which are of a more <U+017F>weet con<U+017F>titution.</p>
                  <p>Unctuous or oily Juices are then allowed to be produced when the Particles of any Body are <U+017F>een <U+017F>phaerical and globular, neither bringing much di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or pricking, or tickling therewith. Sulphure being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ma<U+017F>ter in chief, and Oyl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to take fire, if it once a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umes it, it keeps the <U+017F>ame up and maintains it; and the Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivial Salt once joyn'd with Oyl as often as it is dige<U+017F>ted with any acid, it produceth a notable heat;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:21"/>
and thus the Blood <U+017F>o long as Choler is cheif ma<U+017F>ter in it, is <U+017F>een to turn <U+017F>aline and oily, Oyl and Fat being accounted the two chief ingredients of Bile.</p>
                  <p>Dulcorate Juices do declare them<U+017F>elves by their plea<U+017F>ant ta<U+017F>t which they carry in them, and when the <U+017F>aline Particles do grow equally together with the <U+017F>ulphureous Particles giving the later another nature, they are both <U+017F>een to run into obtu<U+017F>e <U+017F>treaks; and this alchalizated Spirit and fixt Salt, of what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <U+017F>oever it be mixt and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by long dige<U+017F>tion, does there produce and beget a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>Under In<U+017F>ipid Juices, if they may <U+017F>o be called, may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water, Rain, the White of an Egg, and tho<U+017F>e may then mo<U+017F>t properly be <U+017F>o termed
<pb facs="tcp:40826:22"/>
when the Particles of any Bodies are not always rendred with an a<U+017F>perate, but with levigated Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficials, in which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Earth and Water are predominant above the re<U+017F>t; and although indeed there's nothing in the world can really be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed In<U+017F>ipid, yet tho<U+017F>e are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <U+017F>een to carry that name which are altogether deprived of Sapour and Gu<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e Juices are thus <U+017F>een to bear concord and agreement in our Bodies, where we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>ee Sweets and Acids very well agreeing together, and Sweets and Au<U+017F>teers, the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hewn in Syrup of Citrons, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve of Wood Sorrel, Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the like; the later in Marmalade of Quinces, <U+017F>tewed Prunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:22"/>Sweets and Unctious may al<U+017F>o well enough agree in the Palate but not in the Stomach, they being very <U+017F>ubject to occa<U+017F>ion a vomiting and nau<U+017F>eou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>Sweets never agree with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, Bitters or Salines.</p>
                  <p>Bitter Juices never are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant to the Palate.</p>
                  <p>Salines always agree be<U+017F>t with acred things.</p>
                  <p>Acreds, A<U+017F>tringents, and <U+017F>harp Juices do well enough agree with Sweets but no others: Some of the<U+017F>e do take their names from Heat, being the uppermo<U+017F>t, as Acreds, Bitters, <U+017F>ome from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant Cold, as Acids, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acids, Au<U+017F>teers, Acerbs, or <U+017F>owre Juices; and others from moderate heat, as <U+017F>weet, vi<U+017F>cid, fat and in<U+017F>ipid, the fir<U+017F>t two of the<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Cold, the later two enjoying a better degree of heat:
<pb facs="tcp:40826:23"/>
And to conclude this, we may very well judge of the Juices in our Bodies, as we may ob<U+017F>erve them in ripe Fruits which are <U+017F>weet and grateful to the palate, yet <U+017F>owre while green, and dry of con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence; afterwards this dryne<U+017F>s leaving them, a <U+017F>ofter condition po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth the fruit, and when this change happens, this <U+017F>owerne<U+017F>s turns into <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s, and this <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s by time and maturity forgets its acidity and becomes <U+017F>weet. Thus <U+017F>alt and bitter things can no whit be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed agreeable with <U+017F>weets, which are allowed our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hers, for all Nutriment turns to Blood, and good Blood is hot, moi<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>weet; and therefore that Sapour which is neare<U+017F>t in kin to the Blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all que<U+017F>tion mu<U+017F>t be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mo<U+017F>t proper for Nutriment;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:23"/>
and this brings me into Natures third Office, wherein we <U+017F>hall view her excellent Liquids and and Bal<U+017F>amick Liquors, among<U+017F>t which are reckoned Chyle, Blood, Animal Spirits, Nervous Juice, <hi>Lympha,</hi> Salival Flegm, Choler, Pancreatick Juice, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Urine, and Sweat, they conducing towards our welfare, life, and motion.</p>
                  <p>Chyle therefore is a milky Juice like to that of Cream, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and excocted out of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments taken into the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the<U+017F>e Nutriments are dige<U+017F>ted in the Stomach after the manner of Fermentation and <U+017F>o become moi<U+017F>t, and Chyle thence extracted. What Fermentation is we have already in brief <U+017F>et down, we therefore next do proceed to the cau<U+017F>e of Chilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and this is taken from
<pb facs="tcp:40826:24"/>
its propriety of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of which, heat is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e operated in the Stomach than it is in the Heart; it takes its creamy colour from its <U+017F>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts, being di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd with its <U+017F>aline, and tho<U+017F>e mixt with the acid ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; for whatever Liquor is impregnated with Sulphure and volatile Salt, it gets hence a milky whitene<U+017F>s if any acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be poured to it. Blood is the Royal liquid Bal<U+017F>am, and the chief Fermentative liquor of the Body; the <U+017F>carlet Juice whereof is made in the Heart out of Chyle for the nutrition thereof, rai<U+017F>ed out of two Juices having a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> intermixt; Sulphure and Salt being its primary Particles, the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o being allowed Juices when they are produced into Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion for the Sanguinary ma<U+017F>s;
<pb facs="tcp:40826:24"/>
and hence the Chymi<U+017F>t gives the name of the <hi>Third Mercury,</hi> when he writes that there's no Body framed by Nature, but carrieth in it <hi>Mercury</hi> or Liquor, Sulphure or Oyl, <hi>Sal</hi> or Salt; Salt by Coagulation giving <U+017F>olidity to Bodies, Colour and Gu<U+017F>t; Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure tempering the coagulation of Salt with a benign mixture, and this allows the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>trength and tran<U+017F>mutation; and <hi>Mercury,</hi> like an Elixir, yielding vertue, vigour, and <U+017F>ecrets to the irriga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vital and Vegetative Liquor. Again the <U+017F>uperfluities of Salt are <U+017F>eparated by the Urine, Sulpure <U+017F>ecern'd by the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines, and <hi>Mercury</hi> the liquor of Nutriment <U+017F>ent into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if any <U+017F>uperfluous part thereof happens to keep behind, this is thrown out by Sweat through the Pores, and the Blood

are made in the Heart, for out of the permixture of the Salt, acid Particles with the <U+017F>ulphureous a red colour is rai<U+017F>ed, as is evidently made good in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>try by di<U+017F>tillation of <hi>Sal Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which contains many <U+017F>ulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Particles in it. Thus we <U+017F>ee Pale Con<U+017F>erves and Syrups, by having a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol added to them, thus runs them into a reddi<U+017F>h colour, and if any thing of Sulphur be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to added, it gives them a more deep ruddy <U+017F>tain. Thus if you mix any acid <U+017F>pirit with Blood, you'll find the Blood hereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more or le<U+017F>s coagulate; and this is thus made good, for if we take Oyl of Vitriol, or Sulphure <hi>per Campanum, Aqua Fortis.

<pb facs="tcp:40826:26"/>
into a Che<U+017F>nut colour; if we al<U+017F>o take <U+017F>weet Spirit of Salt, Juice of Lemons, di<U+017F>till'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and the like, who<U+017F>e acid Spirits are more temperate, the<U+017F>e will give the Blood the thickne<U+017F>s and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of a Syrup, its colour remaining altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable and no ways injured. And hence is it that the u<U+017F>e of Acids does keep Man from the Plague, not becau<U+017F>e according to the opinion of ill Authours, they are Inci<U+017F>ive and attenuant, but becau<U+017F>e they do keep up the natural con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of the Blood, and hinder the <U+017F>ame, by how much it is le<U+017F>s affected with an acid volatile Salt, or in an air in which we breath; and this was one cau<U+017F>e which made <hi>Sylvius,</hi> in the great Sickne<U+017F>s-time at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>terdam,</hi> before he ever vi<U+017F>ited his people which were troubled

<pb facs="tcp:40826:27"/>
Spirit of Vitriol, all its blackne<U+017F>s will <U+017F>oon leave it, and it turns as clear as Water. Tincture of Violets by adding a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol or Spirit of Sulphure, turns into an excellent Purple colour. A Knife after cutting of a Citron in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, unle<U+017F>s pre<U+017F>ently wiped and purged from the acid Juice of the Citron, will make it turn black. The<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>ions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors are al<U+017F>o very proper to be under<U+017F>tood, by which we may make <U+017F>ome probable conjectures compared herewith, with the Juices and Liquors in our Bodies.

                     <pb facs="tcp:40826:34"/>Sweat is <U+017F>een ever more <U+017F>alt in ta<U+017F>te, and hence this may be allowed the cau<U+017F>e thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that part of the Nutriment which was fre<U+017F>h and <U+017F>weet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted into Blood and Fle<U+017F>h, leaving this, and Sweat granted nothing el<U+017F>e than the part <U+017F>eparated and <U+017F>ecern'd from the former. This is <U+017F>een to ari<U+017F>e more in the upper parts of our Bodies than in the lower parts of the <U+017F>ame, they being more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully <U+017F>tockt with Spirits. And hence may we allow the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between heat and cold, the Pores being both opened by the one, and <U+017F>hut by the other, the one being but as Flame incen<U+017F>t into Air, the other nothing more than Air condens'd.</p>
                  <p>We next come to the Juices of the Glandules, and whereas they are various, <U+017F>o their u<U+017F>es
<pb facs="tcp:40826:35"/>
are al<U+017F>o accounted divers; and here therefore are we to enquire of what u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s they may be accounted after their <U+017F>ecretion from the Blood, and of what <U+017F>ervice they may be to the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Body; and he who examines them with a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye will find it no ea<U+017F>ie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to make out, e<U+017F>pecially if we look into their motions; for when the Liquor of the Conglobated Glandules is <U+017F>ent into the Thoracick Ducts, and mixt there with the Chyle, and to the chief parts of Nutriment, it marcheth along with the <U+017F>ame into the Jugular Vein, or left Subclavian, whence nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily with the de<U+017F>cendent Blood it marcheth thus confu<U+017F>e through the right ear of the Heart into its right Ventricle; and hence by no means allowed either
<pb facs="tcp:40826:35"/>
unu<U+017F>eful or excrementitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the excrementitious humors thus excreted from the Blood, having no further concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, are di<U+017F>patcht from the Body; the which is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t by the Urine in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys <U+017F>ecreted from the Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ma<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ent thence by the Ureters into the Bladder, whence by the laws of Nature it is thence di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>t from having any further concern with the Body. Thus the Juice of the Conglomerated Glandules effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed through peculiar <hi>Ductus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers Cavities of the Body, where they are allowed nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary for nouri<U+017F>hing <U+017F>ome parts thereof, is no ways to be thought excrementitious. Thus the Spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Maxillary Glands <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the Blood and <U+017F>ent forth into the Mouth and thence
<pb facs="tcp:40826:36"/>
di<U+017F>patcht into the Stomach, is no ways to be allowed excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious but very u<U+017F>eful; as is that of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and the like, already made good: Now there is a great di<U+017F>tinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Liquors of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globate and the Conglomerate Glandules, as I have <U+017F>hewn in their proper place; for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <U+017F>hews us, that out of the Conglobated Glandules, Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els do ari<U+017F>e, and <hi>Lympha</hi> it <U+017F>elf is prepared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and this partly bred from the acid part of the Blood <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the other part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the <U+017F>ound Glandules, and partly from the Animal Spirits <U+017F>ent through the Nerves thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therein permixt; and as the<U+017F>e Conglobate Glandules in the Body are either entire or ill affected, <U+017F>o this ill affection
<pb facs="tcp:40826:36"/>
may either ari<U+017F>e from the fault of Spirits, or the acidity of the Blood; or its <U+017F>ecretion from the <hi>Serum,</hi> wherein and whereby is made a permixture hereof with the Volatile or Animal Spirits: How many ways therefore this <hi>Lympha</hi> may be vitiated, no Man yet hath undertaken to <U+017F>hew, it being a matter not only of great difficulty, but very near in kin to impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility; for this preparation of Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Lympha,</hi> may be vitiated by being either more <U+017F>paring or more plentiful in quantity or quality, being more or le<U+017F>s acid, <U+017F>alt or glutinous, and the like: And although I may not have followed the exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of the Conglobated Glandules, yet I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trated <U+017F>ome of its mo<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maladies, made good by
<pb facs="tcp:40826:37"/>
Tumour, Induration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, all which are <U+017F>hewn in living Bodies, for dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies lo<U+017F>e both their heat and bulk. And hence it may be granted by how many ways the<U+017F>e Glandules are injured, the <hi>Lympha</hi> therein receeds from its pri<U+017F>tine <U+017F>tate and natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and becomes both <U+017F>alt and acid; and out of this <hi>Lympha</hi> thus di<U+017F>tributed and <U+017F>ent through the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els in the habit of the Body, the<U+017F>e being lacerated by Effu<U+017F>ion into the neighbouring parts, do there produce Pains and Tumors, the la<U+017F>t being the u<U+017F>ual product of Strumous effects. And as a <hi>Lympha</hi> in all the Conglobated Glandules is generated, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerated Glandules is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peculiar Liquor begot, carried through every of their
<pb facs="tcp:40826:37"/>
Cavities. Thus in the Mouth two <hi>Ductus</hi> do apparently <U+017F>hew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, called <hi>Salivales,</hi> throwing their plentiful Liquor into the Mouth, who<U+017F>e u<U+017F>es I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready de<U+017F>cribed. Out of the Bile, Pancreatick Juice, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livary Flegm, ari<U+017F>eth that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umviral humour which ha<U+017F>tneth the Liquor to the Heart, and gives it its natural con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence and coagulation to the Blood, and according as the Blood it <U+017F>elf is vitiated, this is co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with it, joyns in its vitiation, and where the<U+017F>e or any of them are exalted, they are <U+017F>een to create inte<U+017F>tine wars in us.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Glandules thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of, might be allowed Spinning or Unraveling, as it is the opinion of <U+017F>ome few of our late and be<U+017F>t Anatomi<U+017F>ts, this may very well make a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:40826:38"/>
for Conjecture, that any or all of either of the<U+017F>e Acids, Subacids, Salines, Sub<U+017F>alines, Au<U+017F>teres, Acreds, and the like Liquors or Juices, may run by or between the<U+017F>e loo<U+017F>e fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous Contextures, as through <U+017F>o many Trunks or Channels; wherein Nature may evince and declare her times and tides of ebbs and flowes of Sickne<U+017F><U+017F>es and Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the better circulations of Liquors and <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Juices, as well traced by the Lympheducts into the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>orts of Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, as that of the Blood by the Heart and its Arteries, into the Veins. And from hence for ought I know, may more proper Conjectures ari<U+017F>e how in Plenilunaries, the Brain <U+017F>hould be over<U+017F>tockt with Rheumati<U+017F>mes, Catarrhs, and

Cephalick Defluctions, how Apoplexies, Epilep<U+017F>ies, and Convul<U+017F>ive Motions <U+017F>hall more readily declare them<U+017F>elves then, and make their confident At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Man; how the Tydes become the pre<U+017F>ages of Sickne<U+017F>s as well as of Health, of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or Death.

                        <hi>Arantius</hi> is one who will have this to be a glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous part, and if we may credit him, he doth a<U+017F><U+017F>ign its compo<U+017F>ition to be framed out of three various <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances; for immediately under its membrane, there's <U+017F>omewhat of a pulpy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance about its root e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the other <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the

Tongue is framed of mo<U+017F>t thin and implext fibres, among<U+017F>t which is planted fat, peculiarly proper for keeping them moi<U+017F>t, and making them more fit for u<U+017F>e, and this may be one great cau<U+017F>e why he was <U+017F>o rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give it the name of a glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, and this his a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confirm with the<U+017F>e three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As the Tongue hath in its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance all kind of fibres, and the<U+017F>e <U+017F>o intertext, that they cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one from another, as may in other mu<U+017F>cles. Secondly, There's no ligamental fibres planted in the Tongue for its <U+017F>trength; as is in other mu<U+017F>cles. And his Third is, No mu<U+017F>cle ta<U+017F>teth, but the pulp of the Tongue is the in<U+017F>trument of Ta<U+017F>te, as <hi>Piccolom</hi>; and therefore <hi>Arantius</hi> affirms that the Tongue is no mu<U+017F>cle, but a glandule.<note place="margin">The Tongue proved to be a mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> But we on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <U+017F>hall find that the Tongue's fle<U+017F>hy part is mu<U+017F>culous, when as in all the differences of animal motion, to the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtile vowels, <U+017F>yllables, and pronouncing of Letters; all which do mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uddenly expre<U+017F>s the conceptions of the mind, never tired in their motion, being either contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                        </note> where he fir<U+017F>t convinces, That the fibres of the Tongue do evince it to be mu<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and that its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, for the mo<U+017F>t part thereof is mu<U+017F>culous, which appears from its various motions which it performs, and the variety of its fibres <U+017F>o diver<U+017F>ely intertext, do only <U+017F>uffice for the diver<U+017F>ity of its motions. Secondly, it's no ways nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that every Mu<U+017F>cle mu<U+017F>t needs have a <hi>Tendon,</hi> but that which hath a fle<U+017F>hy beginning may have the like end. Thirdly, That Nerves do pa<U+017F>s through its whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and this is perceived in a <hi>Hemeplegia,</hi> in which is <U+017F>een very oft one part may be <U+017F>ound, and the other perplexed with a Pal<U+017F>ey. And then la<U+017F>tly, the mu<U+017F>culous part of the Tongue doth not ta<U+017F>te, but the membrane which

and this is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that it <U+017F>hould be the in<U+017F>trument of Ta<U+017F>te, and if it be the in<U+017F>trument, it doth thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince its gift, which is by him called the fir<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e thereof.

faculty of Ta<U+017F>ting.

of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> as to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of u<U+017F>es given this Ductus, and the liquor which is kept in it, <hi>Regne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de Graaf</hi> hath at large in his Book <hi>De Succo Pancreatico</hi> declared, to which I <U+017F>hall recommend the Ingenuous Reader.

Others defend that it lets out the Chyle from the Inte<U+017F>tines; and this <hi>Baccius</hi> and <hi>Folius</hi> do vindicate, where they do <U+017F>tiffly maintain the Chyles pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out of the Inte<U+017F>tines to the Liver and Spleen by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick Ductus; and this al<U+017F>o is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the light of Sen<U+017F>e and Rea<U+017F>on, for none of this Juice is <U+017F>ent out of the Gut into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> but <U+017F>ent thence into the Guts. A Third <U+017F>ort do write that this part doth purge the Chyle, of which number is <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingius.</hi> But he is readily confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40826:108"/>
both by <hi>A<U+017F>ellius</hi> and <hi>Riolan,</hi> and others, and Experience doth joyn with them in their oppo<U+017F>ition; for this humour contained in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is never <U+017F>een bitter in ta<U+017F>te, and therefore can no ways be allowed acquaintance with Choler. Others there are who account it the bilious Ve<U+017F>icle of the Spleen, among<U+017F>t which the Worthy <hi>Bartholine</hi> appears, as to its conjunction therewith, as is <U+017F>een <hi>Anatom. cap.</hi> 13. where he writes, That Choler is expurged by this Ductus, and <U+017F>o will needs have it the Biliary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of the Spleen, being made for its u<U+017F>e. But this gets a <U+017F>peedy refutation al<U+017F>o, this Ductus not reaching the Spleen, neither hath the Spleen any commerce therewith, by having any of its Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els <U+017F>ent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into its Ductus, or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Others al<U+017F>o do write, That the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more feculent parts of the Blood are by the ordinary Law of Nature purged out into this. Of which opinion is <hi>Lindanus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That this doth purge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Blood, and this <U+017F>eems to carry but little truth in it. When as the Pancreatick juice, as oft as it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40826:108"/>
hath been truly collected, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like the <hi>Lympha</hi> of Wine; and therefore what can be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this excrementitious humour which he puts upon it? Others al<U+017F>o think that this part was formed for the reception of excrements which do fall from the Nerves: And this our worthy Countrey-man <hi>Wharton</hi> doth affirm in his <hi>Adenograph. cap.</hi> 13. where he writes, That this glandule doth admini<U+017F>ter as all the other glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules to the Nerves, being as an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory glandule, and doth receive the <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities from the Nerves, the which doth di<U+017F>patch thence by this proper Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el into the Inte<U+017F>tines. But becau<U+017F>e Nerves are made and framed for the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ing of the Animal Spirits, I cannot perceive how this mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man would have an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humour pa<U+017F>s through them, and why they <U+017F>hould be more depo<U+017F>ed into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> than into the Spleen, or any other part of the Body, I cannot well under<U+017F>tand; for the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is a long way from the Brain, and too long, I am afraid, to receive its excrement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his leave, his opinion mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40826:109"/>
meet with the <U+017F>ame contradiction as the former. Others al<U+017F>o do <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> both every u<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary humour is <U+017F>ecerned and <U+017F>eparated herein. And here <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius de le Boe</hi> gives the <U+017F>eventh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, who writes that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is carried from the Inte<U+017F>tines through this Ductus into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> nor that any unprofitable excrement is in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> <U+017F>ecreted by the <U+017F>ame to the Gut; but a laudable humour prepared out of the Blood and Spirits in it is thence carried to the Guts, and this he thinks mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it <U+017F>elf there with the other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And becau<U+017F>e perhaps he thought that nothing could be <U+017F>ent to the Guts, unle<U+017F>s fir<U+017F>t having pa<U+017F>t by the Stomach, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>uckt up by the <hi>Ductus Biliarius</hi> or <hi>Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and did le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>ider that not only in Intermitting Fevers the <U+017F>ick people are perplexed with various troubles about their Lumbar Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es relating thereto, as Hypochondriack affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced from the Scurvy, or a <hi>Cholera,</hi> accompanied with gripings and the like, <U+017F>ucceeding them, by

conglobated, and another in the conglomerated glandules; for that which is <U+017F>eparated in the congloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted glandules is always of one and and the <U+017F>ame nature; which is not only proved and made good by their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance being always alike, but by their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages by which they do exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and di<U+017F>charge the <U+017F>ame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, upon a <U+017F>trict enquiry we <U+017F>hall find that the liquor which ordinarily does proceed from the conglobated glandules hath more of <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and le<U+017F>s of acidity in it than that which comes from the conglomerated glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and yet that this hath more of acidity and <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s in it than tho<U+017F>e of the conglomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Salivals.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40826:140"/>
generally allowed a <hi>Gonorrheal</hi> Flux. For Phy<U+017F>icians and Chyrurgeons do not make any difference between this and the Seminal Flux, <U+017F>ave only that they do declare the one to be more virulent than the other. And that <U+017F>uch a Flux may happen, is proved from Tears and grief, in which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual plenty of Salival Matter, or pituitous Humour is excern'd by the vitiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Glandules. And that al<U+017F>o a great <hi>Colluvies</hi> of other humours by the illne<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules may hence be excern'd, nothing can contradict or gain-<U+017F>ay: for the Patient having taken any Medicine, this hath either <U+017F>pontaneou<U+017F>ly, or by <U+017F>ome way or other depo<U+017F>ed the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the<U+017F>e ill juices of the whole Body; the which al<U+017F>o may be allowed to have the <U+017F>ame property and place in this glandulous Body, e<U+017F>pecially it being debilitated by Venery, or any other Malignity. For our Humours do keep in our Bodies, like <hi>Theives</hi> in a Pri<U+017F>on, where when they do intend to get free thence, they do not begin their <hi>exit</hi> with the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t parts thereof, by undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, but do <U+017F>eize the weake<U+017F>t.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40826:140"/>
Thus ill Humours lodged in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, do not enter the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t parts thereof, but do force their malignity upon tho<U+017F>e parts which are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o the more ready to give them entertainment; neither doth Rea<U+017F>on only, but experience al<U+017F>o prove, that this glandulous Body may be thus affected. For there are many which by experience have te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that in di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting of dead Bodies they have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome affected with this <hi>Gonorrheal</hi> Flux, even to their Lives end. And for the confirming our Opinion hereof, we can make good by many examples, That tho<U+017F>e who have been great Riders, and <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <U+017F>haken by their Hor<U+017F>es, that they have by the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>uffered a kind of <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> much re<U+017F>embling a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> <U+017F>ave only, that this doth not <U+017F>o readily pro<U+017F>ternate the Faculties, nor proves <U+017F>o dangerous as may be made good by <hi>Bartholine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Anatom. reformat. cap.</hi> 23. where he writes of a certain <hi>Patavian,</hi> who above 30 years laboured under <U+017F>uch a Flux, without any detriment to his health.</p>

<U+017F>o general concern with the Sons and Daughters of Men; e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>ince there is <U+017F>carce any kind of Skill but may be learnt by Art, and brought into the Rules of a Curative Method, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Advantage of poor di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>ed Mortals.</p>
                  <p>It was a Law among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> That every new Act <U+017F>hould be heard with <U+017F>ilence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau<U+017F>e: which cu<U+017F>tom, as it gave a favourable and re<U+017F>pective ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the Actors thereof, and their Endeavours; <U+017F>o it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>ht and compleated the <U+017F>ame with an inevitable danger of di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for the future, if any lap<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ucceed. The truth is, Men of Learning, Rea<U+017F>on and Experience, and <U+017F>uch who have been free from Fumes, have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more encouraged the Indu<U+017F>trious
<pb facs="tcp:40826:151"/>
Hand: But we live now in <U+017F>uch an Age, that an Author mu<U+017F>t as well <U+017F>tudy the little Plau<U+017F>ibilities of the People, who are the great and brisk Ma<U+017F>ters of Fame, as the value of the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Matter, or the general good of the De<U+017F>ign, (the<U+017F>e being very kind and zealous where they affect, and as cruel and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous where they re<U+017F>olve to contradict) and where Men do once build their Wit upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, the be<U+017F>t Subject mu<U+017F>t hazard their Te<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>uffer their Cen<U+017F>ure. And this I have evermore ob<U+017F>erved, that never any yet entred the Li<U+017F>ts with an Ignorant Bugbear, but he lo<U+017F>t much by the Encounter.</p>
                  <p>But to leave the<U+017F>e: That I may <U+017F>omewhat relieve the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders patience, I <U+017F>hall enter the
<pb facs="tcp:40826:152"/>
Subject Matter of our Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, wherein although I may well enough agree with <hi>Columella</hi>'s Opinion, that <hi>Nihil perfectum aut à <U+017F>ingulari Indu<U+017F>triâ Con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> That no Man can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve all; yet I hope that Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not to be blamed that catcheth <U+017F>ome, although he may mi<U+017F>s others.

advance of publick good, I would willingly know where lies the Injury.</p>
                  <p>If in this al<U+017F>o I have <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>tep a<U+017F>ide from the Opinion of the Ancients as touching the<U+017F>e Strumous Effects and Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, I being rather inclined to rai<U+017F>e a new Pile of Matter for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Generation, yet I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I am not the fir<U+017F>t which have <U+017F>wum again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tream of their grave Suppo<U+017F>itions, or gray-headed Thoughts, I evermore having been conver<U+017F>ant in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery almo<U+017F>t from my Cradle, being the <U+017F>ixth Generation of my own Relations, all eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters of our Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ome of the latter of which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well known for their Parts and Skill by many of the mo<U+017F>t worthy and knowing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters

of our Society. I came ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly al<U+017F>o to the practice thereof in this great City, and have for above Twenty Four Years <U+017F>een the Practick, as well as read the Theorical Part thereof; and this not at Whiles and Intervals, but I had the Eye of the Ho<U+017F>pital as my fir<U+017F>t and early Gleanings: And <U+017F>ince I could write Man, the late Wars had my Skill <U+017F>hewn on my <U+017F>elf as well as many others who were committed to my Charge.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer our Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I have been ble<U+017F>t by my Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Command to attend as one of His Chyrurgeons at all Healings, (although the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t) and have <U+017F>een <U+017F>everal Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ands approach his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence for Ea<U+017F>e and Cure, I thought it my Duty as well as my Zeal

to <U+017F>earch into the Roads and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits of this Evil, which is <U+017F>een thus frequently to vi<U+017F>it the Court. And the only rea<U+017F>on which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to this Undertaking, was partly intended to prevent the tedious Journeys of many poor People, who unhappily have undertaken the <U+017F>ame upon pretence of their being troubled with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and partly to <U+017F>ecure His Maje<U+017F>ty from being cheated of His Gold: The fir<U+017F>t of which is intended and made good in this, the latter demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trated in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>I have herein therefore (kind Reader) pre<U+017F>ented thee with a more plain di<U+017F>covery of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, than hither hath as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the World, and this perform'd with that plain and

ea<U+017F>ie Dre<U+017F>s and Method, that the meane<U+017F>t Capacity may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a <U+017F>ufficient Judge in the de<U+017F>cription thereof by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinction to prevent confu<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>In this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e therefore is laid down the Name and Nature of Strumaes or Kings-Evil-Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, with all their Differences, Cau<U+017F>es, Signs, Pre<U+017F>ages and Cure, in a more full and ample draught than hath hitherto been ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented to publick view. And becau<U+017F>e I do not de<U+017F>ire to keep the Ingenuous Reader too long upon the Title, if he plea<U+017F>e to take an inward <U+017F>urvey of the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cau<U+017F>es of this Strumous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, he will find that I have introduced the Pox and Scurvy as two great Clubbers towards forming the <U+017F>ame, (e<U+017F>pecially in our days, where the Families of
<pb facs="tcp:40826:154"/>
Mankind are generally <U+017F>een more or le<U+017F>s tinged therewith) and do keep equal pace with the <U+017F>ame by Seminal Traduction: Both of which being much altered from their fir<U+017F>t Beings, by getting an acquaintance almo<U+017F>t with every Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, they having a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and common dependance one upon another, bred and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got from a tainted Fermentation in the Blood, and an Ebullition of vitiated Humours, by which a common exchange of Symptoms is kept up and maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, according to the Inclinations of <U+017F>uch weakly and debilitated Bodies on which they do make their entrance. But le<U+017F>t, kind Reader, I may be thought tedious in keeping thee too long in the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, I have this only to <U+017F>ay, That I have

<U+017F>pent this la<U+017F>t Summer with great <U+017F>atisfaction in examining and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Evil</hi> in all its Nooks and Corners. If thou finde<U+017F>t any thing in it worth thy acceptance, take it freely; and what is wanting in the Authors Capacity, make good in thy <U+017F>elf by a richer piece of Service.</p>

As young Children therefore are more cold, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o are they more moi<U+017F>t than elder; for the heat of the temperament is advanced from the time of the birth, even to Mans e<U+017F>tate.

And that the Members are made gro<U+017F>s by this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, is apparent by the Pu<U+017F>tles and Pu<U+017F>tulous <hi>Cutis,</hi> the Face oft-times <U+017F>een <U+017F>well'd, and the Body appearing Satyrick.

Liquor of the Blood, and turns it into an Acid Ichorous and Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <U+017F>tate; this will corrupt the whole Ma<U+017F>s of Blood: and this he further affirms, that the main cau<U+017F>e of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid <U+017F>tate of this Blood ari<U+017F>eth from the abatement of its Sulphur and Spirit, the which he confirms by comparing it with good Wine, which <U+017F>oon turns Acid upon its Sulphurous part, being <U+017F>tript from its Saline by Evaporation or otherwi<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>o that Salt which was formerly Volatile, becomes now fixt and Acid, which is the true cau<U+017F>e of its thus turning into Vinegar, which is made good by putting Vinegar to a Candles Flame, and you'll not <U+017F>ee it burn, it being robb'd of its Sulphur, and its Winey Spirit extinct, and the more this Sulphurous Matter and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is lo<U+017F>t, the nearer it is drawn from its true Body and Sub<U+017F>tance.</p>

                     <p>If the Scurvy be herewith compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, frequent loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s attends the Scrophulated Patient, with difficulty of breathing, many Athritick pains go along with this Evil, they have a more frequent and inequal Pul<U+017F>e, and frequent Palpitations of their Hearts. And where we meet Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes untoward and unlucky, this gives us no <U+017F>lender <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of <U+017F>ome ill lurking inwards, e<U+017F>pecially where they meet with a curted Neck, a <U+017F>hort and narrow Forehead, compre<U+017F>t Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and large Mandibles.

getting that familiarity and common dependance upon one another, that no mean Arti<U+017F>t may pretend to be a true Judge between them: for as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of Dyet, and Luxurious Debauch does as well procure a tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fermentation, as an Ebullition of ill and vitiated Humours, by which a common intercour<U+017F>e and exchange of Symptoms is kept up and maintained; <U+017F>o when the Evil hath got either a Pocky or Scorbutick Ferment going along with it, bred from a vitious Habit of Body, this may as readily be granted to be a <U+017F>harer of the whole; for the<U+017F>e two Ferments do put on other Formalities, whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed joyntly or <U+017F>eparately, and do di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves under the Habits of <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of <U+017F>uch weakly Bodies on which they do make their entrance, they <U+017F>ometimes appearing like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves when they march in the common road, but when the<U+017F>e Ferments do propagate them<U+017F>elves, they <U+017F>eldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like branches of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tock, but being tinctur'd in the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Body, they do a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hape of Di<U+017F>tempers as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <p>OF what great concern an inequal Nouri<U+017F>hment of Parts in this is, we have in our la<U+017F>t Chapter very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed: This pre<U+017F>ents you with the Signs of Strumaes, which gives the faire<U+017F>t view and figure of the Parts thus inequally di<U+017F>covered: where we <U+017F>hall meet with a greater fulne<U+017F>s in the lively Complexion of the Face, being compared with the other parts of the Body; and yet this more apparent in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons than in others, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e lying <U+017F>ometimes more ob<U+017F>cure before its publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and as it were unperceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore this may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as one of the Signs, which is a greater fulne<U+017F>s of Face, it being and appearing thus, whil<U+017F>t it is as it were

in the Embryo, and arrived at no great matter of growth, or hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance or matter to give it a greater being and bulk.</p>
                     <p>This again having got <U+017F>ome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance among<U+017F>t the Glands, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them, and advanceth into growth, it is mo<U+017F>t commonly <U+017F>een to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Ma<U+017F>toideal Mu<U+017F>cle of the Neck, and this requires time to give it <U+017F>uch a progre<U+017F>s, and where <U+017F>uch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is made thereof, this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly denotes the abode of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e.</p>

                        <hi>Rogerius</hi> gives us this method of them, and thus di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>heth them, by taking Leaves of Ground Ivy and Cedar, the which being beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and applied to the Scrophulated parts, if the Tumours <U+017F>hall hereupon be <U+017F>een to vani<U+017F>h and di<U+017F>appear in three days, its a perfect <U+017F>ign they are <hi>Glandulae,</hi> not <hi>Strumae:</hi> but if the Medicine thus applied does occa<U+017F>ion

                     <p>Again, the Signs of Strumaes are to be divided three ways, as con<U+017F>idering their Quality, Quantity and E<U+017F><U+017F>ence.

                     <p>The multiplicity of Strumaes, and their over<U+017F>preading the Body, and the extraneous heats which go along with them, do frequently <U+017F>hew that they are the product of interiour Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulaes, as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> ob<U+017F>erves. And

                        <hi>Cornelius Cel<U+017F>us</hi> writes, That Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes and <U+017F>ick People do give much trouble to the Phy<U+017F>itian and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; becau<U+017F>e let them be treated as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly Art can, and Nature likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>erve them, yet they will fly out again; and although the be<U+017F>t methods imaginable are u<U+017F>ed for their extirpation, yet we u<U+017F>ually find them relap<U+017F>e, and gain new birth again.</p>

                     <p>EVery Phy<U+017F>ician and Chirurgeon, according to the Rules of Art, ought diligently and prudently to contemplate on the Progno<U+017F>tick Signs of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, that he may the better be in<U+017F>tructed in fore<U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>everal events thereof; and here both <hi>Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<U+017F>is</hi> as well as <hi>Progno<U+017F>is</hi> is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be under<U+017F>tood, the one <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pre<U+017F>ent e<U+017F>tate, containing and declaring the Origination thereof; the other foretelling its growth, increa<U+017F>e and con<U+017F>ummation.</p>
                     <p>Fir<U+017F>t therefore, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being properly Natural, is mo<U+017F>t dangerous, and do <U+017F>eldom, if ever, end in health, without new eruptions: For <hi>Zaculus Lu<U+017F>itanus</hi> writes, that there is a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Excretion in the Seed, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40826:202"/>
occult quality infecting the <U+017F>ame, and inherent in it, which imprints the like Tincture in the Off-<U+017F>pring; for the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed defects of the Parents are derived by force of the Seed to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by which they do perfectly and exactly re<U+017F>emble their Behaviour, Gate, Countenance and Con<U+017F>titution. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome are very apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, If this were true, it would continue thus for ever; whereas others have as plainly <U+017F>een, that it hath mi<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>ame Stock, and hath only fixt upon others of the <U+017F>ame Family, the fir<U+017F>t Generation having <U+017F>ometimes been <U+017F>een wholly to mi<U+017F>s and e<U+017F>cape it, and this has given none of its appearance perhaps till it came to the Grandchildren of the <U+017F>ame Family.</p>
                     <p>Small and Superficial Strumaes are more healthful in Children, and more ea<U+017F>ie of Cure, than tho<U+017F>e that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, and more deeply fixed.</p>
                     <p>The more early the inva<U+017F>ion of Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes is after the Birth, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it carries with it; for hereby the Spirits are both robbed, and much weakned; we commonly al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing as they grow up, they are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40826:203"/>
therewith, and are better able, and more ea<U+017F>ily cured than younger Children.</p>
                     <p>That Struma which is bred natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from Parents is harder of cure, than that which is contracted by the meer errour of the Nur<U+017F>e or Mother.</p>
                     <p>Again, That Strumous effect which the Infant brings with him from his Mothers Womb, is of harder cure, and proves more de<U+017F>perate than that which is occa<U+017F>ioned by Air, Vi<U+017F>cous Diet, or any other outward Effect.</p>
                     <p>The greater the Heads of Infants and Children are, the <U+017F>horter their Necks, the more compre<U+017F>t Temples they have, and the wider Mandibles, the more <U+017F>ubject the<U+017F>e are to Strumous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es than others.</p>
                     <p>All tho<U+017F>e who do attain to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, do e<U+017F>cape the danger thereof, being carefully examined, unle<U+017F>s by chance <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be therewith adjoyned, or does afterwards come after it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb the Patient with a higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e.</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:40826:203"/>If the French Pox therefore be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with this Strumous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, be it either Hereditary, or contracted by Infection, it makes it almo<U+017F>t inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of remedy.</p>
                     <p>If the Scurvy al<U+017F>o be herewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, this does very much retard the cure, although not <U+017F>o much as the French Pox.</p>
                     <p>All Strumatical Tumours, either Internal or External, do not very much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend the hopes of Cure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwi<U+017F>e of them<U+017F>elves they are not ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ubdued in this tender age: for the external parts being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with pain, do wa<U+017F>te the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but the internal much more, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they do invade the noble parts with their weight and bulk.</p>
                     <p>Every Struma again is not to be overcome with ea<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>uch as do happen in Children are better mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than tho<U+017F>e which happen in old People.</p>

here (as I have already well noted) to frame our Medicines according to the Temperament, Strength and Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution with whom we are or <U+017F>hall be concerned: for we are not to deal with Children as we do with Men and Women, who have arrived at a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age and <U+017F>trength, who are as much different in the<U+017F>e, as they are in their age, complexion and abode.

increa<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Swellings. Our greate<U+017F>t advice in the u<U+017F>e of the Knife is to have a particular and <U+017F>pecial care to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els bordering upon the<U+017F>e parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nerves, Veins and Arteries, le<U+017F>t they being injured hereby, may give too apparent <U+017F>igns of danger <U+017F>ucceeding thereupon. For about the Neck every Anatomi<U+017F>t knows do lodge and are planted the Recurrent Nerves appointed for the voice ari<U+017F>ing from the <U+017F>ixth pair, the Jugular Veins, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotid Arteries, all which do require the care and caution of the Operator. <hi>Arnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de Villanovanus</hi> does therefore forbid the u<U+017F>e of Inci<U+017F>ion as much as in us lay, but when we are compell'd and forc'd to make u<U+017F>e thereof. <hi>Albuca<U+017F>is</hi> gives us this Method, that is, When we find Strumous Tumours which are good natur'd, and bears a kind di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition with them, who<U+017F>e colour is not much different from that of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> every way moveable, and no ways fixt or tyed to the Veins, Nerves or Arteries of the Neck, nor lodge <U+017F>o deep but that they may be reached with ea<U+017F>e here; and in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es as this is,<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod thereof thus <U+017F>hewn.</note> we may begin our Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection upwards, and <U+017F>o guide and trace our Knife to the lower part of the Body thereof, then dilating the Lips, the Glands are to be extracted with great care and caution, <U+017F>o as no Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be injured by the Operation; and if any Flux of Blood may happen in this Operation, it is pre<U+017F>ently to be <U+017F>topt with Re<U+017F>trictives; and this method is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecuted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40826:220"/>
till every part of the Ci<U+017F>tus, or Bags thereof are perfectly and throughly eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and extracted; the which being done, and the part clean, mundifie the Ulcer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t, incarn, and then induce a Cicatrice. And thus we have given you a Draught of curing Strumaes, or King-Evil-Swellings: To all which methods, if they will be <U+017F>o rebellious as not to yield, there is no other hope left of Cure but by the Hands of our Sacred Maje<U+017F>ty, whom God pre<U+017F>erve, that he may live many years to exerci<U+017F>e this Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty.</p>

                  <head>THE Royal Gift of Healing.</head>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. I. The Origination of this Healing Method proved.</head>
                     <p>THat <hi>England</hi> hath her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as well as any other Country or Nation what<U+017F>oever, is <U+017F>o great a Truth, that no con<U+017F>iderate Man can deny. And to view tho<U+017F>e many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempers which have lately crept into the World (altogether unknown to the Ancients) e<U+017F>pecially with us in <hi>Europe</hi>; as the <hi>French Pox, Scurvy, Rickets, Struma's,</hi> or <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> Swellings <U+017F>o commonly called, may well put a <U+017F>trange Face upon the Earth: Their proper Rea<U+017F>ons and Cau<U+017F>es being as yet lock'd up from Humane Under<U+017F>tanding. The truth is, whether the<U+017F>e do happen by vici<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Things, Sins of the People,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40826:245"/>
ill Habits, or wor<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>titutions, we cannot <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>atisfie. Sure I am, Sin is as great a procurer of this, as it is of any of the former Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; for we daily <U+017F>ee it <U+017F>porting its <U+017F>elf <U+017F>lighly under <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es to afflict the Sons of Men.</p>
                     <p>But having in my former Treati<U+017F>es been more large as touching this, I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ume, with hopes to offer, that there is no Chri<U+017F>tian <U+017F>o void of Religion and Devotion, as to deny a Gift of Healing: A Truth as clear as the Sun, continued and maintained by a continual Line of Chri<U+017F>tian Kings and Governors, fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed with the <U+017F>ame Chri<U+017F>tian Milk, which Divine Healing Faculty did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>e from the fir<U+017F>t time of Chri<U+017F>tianity, having thence been derived from the great God of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>Hence may we pre<U+017F>ume to take a view, and behold the great Monarch implanting Soveraign Dignity on his Earthly Maje<U+017F>ty; giving him his Laws, making him his Vicegerent, guarding his Tongue, pre<U+017F>erving his Lips, ble<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing his Hands with this Salutiferous Gift, and defending his Body from outward Injuries and private Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40826:245"/>
Thus we read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination lodgeth in the Kings lips, in Judgment <U+017F>hall not his mouth err,</hi> much le<U+017F>s his heart, which is governed and directed by the Almighty: For as the divi<U+017F>ion of Waters, <U+017F>o is the heart of the King in the hand of the Lord. And in another place, where there is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wi<U+017F>dom, it appears as the health of the Nation, much more in a wi<U+017F>e King, as the Foundation and Ba<U+017F>is of his People: For we are daily Witne<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e great and Divine favors which are tran<U+017F>mitted from above to his Sacred Maje<U+017F>ty, ever denyed to his Subjects, as being too High and Holy for their reach and capacity. Thus Nature her <U+017F>elf doth by a Chain of Cau<U+017F>es carry us up to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a Deity, by bringing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thinking Man to an Original of every <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful Individual by cour<U+017F>e of Generation.</p>
                     <p>And as to this great Gift of Healing, peculiarly given to his Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ties Royal hand, by the reception of the Holy Oyl which at his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he made u<U+017F>e of, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled him the Soveraign of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where I <U+017F>hall further <U+017F>atisfie, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40826:246"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as to their Kings, had the honor of receiving this Holy Oyl with their Sacred Titles, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally anointed in three parts, as hath been well noted. As fir<U+017F>t, on their Heads, to <U+017F>ignifie their Glory: Next, on their Brea<U+017F>ts, to <U+017F>hew their Sanctity; and then on their Arms, to denote their Power. And from hence did ari<U+017F>e the three equalizing Fames given to them, of being Holy, Sacred, and Divine. And from tho<U+017F>e early days, who<U+017F>e Power and Sanctity was ever given to their Sacred Per<U+017F>ons; <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hould dare to <U+017F>trike upon the Sacred Ground on which they did tread, <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e his hand for this his pre<U+017F>umption. And among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of his Divine Favors be<U+017F>towed upon him, let this Sanative Faculty among<U+017F>t all Mankind, be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned one, which doth denote both his Right, Title and Merit, and as a <U+017F>econd Gift given from Heaven, by tho<U+017F>e many Thou<U+017F>ands cured by him <U+017F>ince his happy Re<U+017F>toration; and this acknowledged not only by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons them<U+017F>elves who have been thus Cured, but by relation of Phy<U+017F>icians and Chirurgions, and others through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40826:246"/>
his univer<U+017F>al Realms and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: all which in a great mea<U+017F>ure doth declare his excellent Charity which <U+017F>weetens the Gift, as al<U+017F>o his Piety and Clemency in granting poor Souls his Sacred and ready Touch.</p>
                     <p>We come now to prove the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Healing Faculty,<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and this is proved out of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wi<U+017F>dom: To another, the word of Knowledge by the <U+017F>ame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: To another Faith by the <U+017F>ame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: To another the gift of Healing by the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>pirit: To another the working of Miracles: To another Prophe<U+017F>ie: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the di<U+017F>cerning of Spirits: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other divers Gifts of Tongues: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the interpretation of Tongues.</hi> And this Scripture alone is enough to prove a Gift of Healing.</p>
                     <p>The next Que<U+017F>tion which hence will ari<U+017F>e, is,<note place="margin">Whether every one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this Gift.</note> Whether every one may pretend to this Gift, or whether it be di<U+017F>tributive to all per<U+017F>ons at all times, and in all places? And this is as readily an<U+017F>wer'd as the former: For when our Saviour a<U+017F>cended up into Heaven, he gave Gifts unto men; as to <U+017F>ome the Gift of Wi<U+017F>dom, to <U+017F>ome the Gift of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40826:247"/>
Knowledge, to <U+017F>ome Faith, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Gift of Healing, and the like. And as in this no Man can affirm that he enjoys all the above-mentioned Qualities, <U+017F>o cannot any Man <U+017F>ay that he is <U+017F>tript of all.</p>
                     <p>In the fir<U+017F>t Face therefore of the Primitive Church, as an Orient Gem, or Fulgent Adamant, did this Gift of Healing appear with <U+017F>plendor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Form, <U+017F>o that the Church was perfum'd with its Divine Qualities, where was Wi<U+017F>dom declaring her <U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t the Learned, whil'<U+017F>t others did as readily demon<U+017F>trate their great Knowledge; <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hewing their Faith by their Works, others curing the Sick and the Lame: And whil'<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome lent the World the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, others as readily Prophe<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of things to come. And thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their variety of Gifts, they had diver<U+017F>ity of Names given them: <U+017F>ome being call'd Apo<U+017F>tles, <U+017F>ome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and others Prophets: <U+017F>ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in Virtue, others as richly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in this Gift of Healing. Thus when poor indigent Souls had <U+017F>ought out Remedy from Phy<U+017F>icians in vain, God in his own time <U+017F>ent them ea<U+017F>e by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40826:247"/>
the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his Holy Spirit, and made tho<U+017F>e rebellious Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which <U+017F>corn'd Medicine, and trampled on the be<U+017F>t of Remedies compo<U+017F>ed by the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>ician and mo<U+017F>t able Chirurgion, in a moment yield to Gods command, and retreat at His Maje<U+017F>ties Sacred Touch.</p>
                     <p>And might there any Que<U+017F>tion ari<U+017F>e about the fir<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>ician which cured by Touch, the An<U+017F>wer is very ready:<note place="margin">Chri<U+017F>t the fir<U+017F>t Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Healing.</note> The fir<U+017F>t and la<U+017F>t, the be<U+017F>t and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Recoverer of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es is our Saviour Chri<U+017F>t: For he a<U+017F>cended into Heaven, and gave gifts unto men: He pa<U+017F>t through <hi>Galilee</hi> and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Nations, curing tho<U+017F>e which were oppre<U+017F>t with evil Spirits, the which he di<U+017F>charged from them by his Virtue, and the Holy Spirit; and not only the<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>uch as were troubled with the Pal<U+017F>ie, Lepro<U+017F>ie, Lunacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Incurable by others, as you may <U+017F>ee Luke 6. and Matth. 6. v. 14, 15, 16. <hi>When Je<U+017F>us was come into</hi> Peters <hi>hou<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>aw his wifes mother laid <U+017F>ick of a fever; and he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e and mini<U+017F>tred unto them.

                     <p>WHat the <hi>Struma</hi> is, or <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> <U+017F>o commonly called from the Kings healing thereof by his Sacred Touch, I have already <U+017F>atisfied in my <U+017F>econd Book, wherein is <U+017F>hewn both its Definition, Cau<U+017F>es, Pre<U+017F>ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the unravelling this skain, <U+017F>pun out of <U+017F>o many fine threds, in which are found many knots about curing Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es curable or incurable: We mu<U+017F>t begin to unty it in its proper place, by examining its Age and Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> when he cured the Father of <hi>Publius</hi> of a Di<U+017F>entery and Fever, the Cure was admirable, although both the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es naturally curable: for a Fever we <U+017F>ee, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>o vexatious, its forc'd to quit its <U+017F>tation by true Phy<U+017F>ick and a right method u<U+017F>ed. The Di<U+017F>entery al<U+017F>o is as readily conquered and by the like
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40826:255"/>
means. When our Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Saviour al<U+017F>o cured the Pal<U+017F>ie, or the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy: No man can deny but that both the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es in them<U+017F>elves are curable, but our Saviour cured the<U+017F>e by his own Power, which by others were not to be performed but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, and therefore this ought not to be allowed an ordinary way of Healing.</p>
                     <p>Hence Chri<U+017F>t forbids not the curing of the Sick by the hands of Chri<U+017F>tian Kings, Princes and Governors,<note place="margin">Apo<U+017F>tles and good Chri<U+017F>tians allowed in former times to cure Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es.</note> who do follow his Rules by Prayer and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of Hands: For we have read of many Holy and Pious people who have cured Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es after <U+017F>everal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and where any thing of a Divine Influence is implanted, what <U+017F>hould deny the hand thereof to declare the <U+017F>ame? and although this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is natural, no que<U+017F>tion but this Method is <U+017F>upernatural, the which may be made good by Hi<U+017F>torical Illu<U+017F>trations. For as this <hi>Struma,</hi> or <hi>Kings Evil</hi> Swelling is a popular Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e (bred out of Matter and Blood, <U+017F>ent into the Glandules, and therein making a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bulk according to the Quantity

                     <p>Satan is a wonderful Arti<U+017F>t, and a great Profe<U+017F><U+017F>or of admirable Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri<U+017F>t and his followers, all which are not to be reckoned in the <U+017F>ame day with the <U+017F>ublime gifts of good Men.

and e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing of his Faith: The which al<U+017F>o is imitated by the wor<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort of Men, but in another form and manner. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, That Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Miracles do <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>hew San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, not make it, but Spiritual Gifts wrought in the Mind, do not <U+017F>hew the Virtue of Life, but do form it: But this is <U+017F>carce the property of any Saint. And St. <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> doth give a very good rea<U+017F>on for the <U+017F>ame, when he <U+017F>aith, The<U+017F>e Miracles are not given to all Holy men: Nor are the infirm to be deceived, for in the<U+017F>e acts are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good things <U+017F>hewn, than in the works of Ju<U+017F>tice, to which Eternal Life is compared. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apo<U+017F>tle rai<U+017F>ed the Dead, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did many Wonders which were beyond many Chri<U+017F>tians power and skill to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at or attain.

The true Rule therefore of Miracles is this, If God gives the power of doing good to any one, let him pro<U+017F>ecute the <U+017F>ame and pro<U+017F>per in the action.

This Book al<U+017F>o will <U+017F>hew its <U+017F>elf of great <U+017F>ervice and <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to other <U+017F>ucceeding Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for as Chirurgeons are no more Immortal than other Men, <U+017F>o we <U+017F>hall find that People do not always inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and dwell in one place, or part of the World; and he that perhaps might have lived this year in one County, may the next year live in another; and <U+017F>ince where-ever he lives, if he has the Evil, and be not cured thereof, and may in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gain a Certificate, and by that, Gold; <U+017F>o in another place where he goes to dwell, he may endeavour to procure another Certificate, and by this cheat the King of a <U+017F>econd piece; a trick not now to be learnt by many, but rather <U+017F>tudied by divers, who look more after the Gold than the Cure: for prevention of this, where any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hall come to the Chirurgeon, for the cure of <U+017F>uch Cheats, he may look over the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet

in his Book, and there <U+017F>ee if he can find the Name of him whom he may or <U+017F>hall <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect therein. I know of no other way imaginable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Cheat; and if there were <U+017F>uch who can find out a better, they would do great <U+017F>ervice to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Another advantage he will have hereby, when by this true account-keeping he may <U+017F>atisfie both His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty and the whole World how many are yearly Healed by His Sacred Hand.</p>
                     <p>Thus far have I pre<U+017F>umed to clear the method for poor Peoples making ready for their Journey towards their being healed: But after this, great care would be taken, (when they are arrived at their Happy Port, as I may well call it, it being the only aim they had in all their Travel) to meet with a quick di<U+017F>patch, in order to their <U+017F>peedy return, and not to be kept <U+017F>o long in Town till both their Money and Credit is gone, (which God knows among<U+017F>t the generality of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort is not much nor great) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth both require and merit a <U+017F>hort, ready, and <U+017F>peedy di<U+017F>patch.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40826:288"/>
But as the ca<U+017F>e now is, its harder to approach the Chirurgeon, than obtain a Touch; and more tire<U+017F>ome for them to wait day after day upon him, who<U+017F>e chief bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould be to attend their coming, than it was to get every thing in readine<U+017F>s for his di<U+017F>patch of them. But there may be a convenient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found out for this Evil al<U+017F>o, which is as bad, if not wor<U+017F>e, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Could His Maje<U+017F>ties Plea<U+017F>ure be known of his times of Healings for Summer, I mean at <hi>Whitehal, Wind<U+017F>or,</hi> and the like, publick Notice ought to be given hereof in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> by which all people may readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand His Maje<U+017F>ties Plea<U+017F>ure of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the times thereof, after which none <U+017F>hould dare to pre<U+017F>ume any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble.

order for a Healing, acquaint them thereof, and when they are to wait to be healed: This I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will be found an excellent, as well as joyful method to the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a great deal of ea<U+017F>e as well as <U+017F>atisfaction to the Chirurgion, and prove a <U+017F>ignal remedy of le<U+017F><U+017F>ening the ill opinion the Chirurgion goes under at their continual and tedious wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at his Hou<U+017F>e, and abate <U+017F>omwhat of the hard cen<U+017F>ure is put upon him by <U+017F>everal people.</p>

without any Gold at all given, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <U+017F>ame has been performed only by Silver, as <U+017F>hall be made good by <U+017F>everal Examples in the la<U+017F>t Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

And that Gold is not the great Ingredient in this Cure, may ea<U+017F>ily be thus proved, by calling into remembrance the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Times, when Tyrants turned this once happy Nation into an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Confu<U+017F>ion, and by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful up<U+017F>et High Court of Ju<U+017F>tice, or rather Inju<U+017F>tice, forced the be<U+017F>t of Kings, where He was wont to <U+017F>hew the Grandure of His Maje<U+017F>ty due to Princes, there to make His Funeral Pulpit, laying down the Sacred Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of His Greatne<U+017F>s, whereon the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40826:298"/>
En<U+017F>igns of Renown had formerly been planted, by their cur<U+017F>ed Hands, and compell'd to quit His three Nations by their mo<U+017F>t cur<U+017F>ed and barbarous Cruciations; and yet all this done under pretence of Devotion and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, bringing Him under their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Judgment, to <U+017F>ubmit to their bold and bloody A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>ination; in who<U+017F>e horrid Ma<U+017F><U+017F>acre, and after who<U+017F>e inhumane and barbarous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation, its pretious Blood left not its vigour which it kept whil<U+017F>t it was warm in His Purple Veins, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken up by Handkerchiefs, or collected by other things, with which the<U+017F>e Strumous Swellings being but touched, or therewith concerned, they have <U+017F>een <U+017F>uddainly to vani<U+017F>h and di<U+017F>appear: and this al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hall be made good by <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>ervations thereof in my la<U+017F>t Chapter. And if His Royal Corps, <U+017F>tript from Life, was thus accompanied with this Divine and Heavenly Virtue, what <U+017F>hall we think and <U+017F>ay of the Action perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Life, as by the Ble<U+017F>t and Sacred Hands of our Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign?

have <U+017F>uch as give this great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <U+017F>ame, to make tryal of a piece of their own Gold, in putting the <U+017F>ame about their own Necks, and <U+017F>ee then if this will in any mea<U+017F>ure an<U+017F>wer their de<U+017F>ired ends: The <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s I leave to them who <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew their folly as well as give them<U+017F>elves trouble to make <U+017F>uch a tryal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e two may be very well gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted convincing Arguments enough to prove the truth hereof: for this of His Maje<U+017F>ties pretious Blood was <U+017F>een done, and known to be performed in the mid<U+017F>t of the Kings Enemies, and in tho<U+017F>e times when Trayterous U<U+017F>urpers took leave to enter the Royal Throne; where not only the trouble<U+017F>ome Mobile, but the rigid Ma<U+017F>ters of Presbytery and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, were <U+017F>o far from agreeing and con<U+017F>enting to His Maje<U+017F>ties Healing Faculty, that the little Faith they had, they employed to confound the <U+017F>ame: <U+017F>uch were the great Reverence the<U+017F>e Rebellious Tribes gave to this Divine Virtue. And in this I may pre<U+017F>ume po<U+017F>itively to affirm, that <U+017F>uch as do not give Credance to the

King as Gods Vicegerent, and to the many thou<U+017F>ands cured thus by Him, they do, ever did, and ever <U+017F>hall be thought to give as little belief to God Him<U+017F>elf, let His Miracles be never <U+017F>o many, or never <U+017F>o great, <U+017F>uch being their churli<U+017F>h Humour, and ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions.</p>
                     <p>To the believing Man, I <U+017F>hall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Saint <hi>Chry<U+017F>o<U+017F>tom</hi>'s words, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40826:311"/>
but as he, when alive, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, although the wa<U+017F>hing with that Water did keep the Wounds clean, yet it did not <U+017F>top the increa<U+017F>e nor the pains: He then in di<U+017F>pair of all other help but from His Maje<U+017F>ties Touch, endeavored to procure that means of Gods mercy. But it being in the time when that Sacred Per<U+017F>on was removed from the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Wight,</hi> and brought through <hi>Winton</hi> (where this object of Charity dwelt) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the la<U+017F>t of his Sufferings.

The poor di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Man, on bended knees, at that time in the pre<U+017F>ence made <U+017F>everal Exclamations, and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed nearer to the King that he might procure notice from him, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>till loudly, <hi>God <U+017F>ave the King</hi>: which provok'd tho<U+017F>e inhumane At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, to deal with the Petitioner as they did with their Soveraign, barbarou<U+017F>ly: They <U+017F>trook him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him, and allowed him no opportunity to come within the good

Kings reach: The only effect was, that the importunate cries of him which was impatient to be denyed the la<U+017F>t hopes of ea<U+017F>e and life, made the good Prince ob<U+017F>erve him; and <U+017F>ince he could not be hindred from reaching him with his Prayers, he gave the weak and now di<U+017F>pairing Man his Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing, in the like words to the<U+017F>e: Friend, I <U+017F>ee thou art not permitted to come near me, and I cannot tell what thou woulde<U+017F>t have, but <hi>God ble<U+017F>s thee, and grant thy de<U+017F>ire</hi>; after which, the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>ed Man without the Kings <U+017F>troak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was forced to return to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that he had formerly wa<U+017F>ht his Soars with: But although the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he kept it in had been <U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Cup-board, and is to this day without any crack in it, yet the Water was much wa<U+017F>ted: The next day he found a greater decrea<U+017F>e in the Liquor, and <U+017F>o daily until it was dryed up. At length, the Bottle became <U+017F>cabbed in its <U+017F>ides, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Botches appeared in it, the gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Bottle breaking off through the round bubbles or botches that aro<U+017F>e in the Earth: And

as the<U+017F>e effects appeared in the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, the Face and Throat of the Patient healed with equal <U+017F>peed.

The effect hereof was as followeth: The Father being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempered and ill, keeps the Gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own neck, which kept him in health, and gave him <U+017F>peedy ea<U+017F>e and relief: The Son falling ill, he borrows his Fathers Gold from his neck, and puts it about his own, which likewi<U+017F>e gave him ea<U+017F>e and relief. The Father after this by leaving his Gold, had his Di<U+017F>temper <U+017F>eized him afre<U+017F>h, and then took the Gold again, and this made it as readily vani<U+017F>h. And thus by the intercour<U+017F>e or change of Gold from Father to Son, and from Son to Father, whoever of them kept the Gold, was defended again<U+017F>t any new approach or appearance of his Di<U+017F>temper; and this was kept and maintained by them for many years together.</p>

hard mea<U+017F>ure, with many prote<U+017F>tations of his Innocency with all or any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind, and that he <U+017F>hould think him<U+017F>elf utterly undone if he might not receive the honor of his Maje<U+017F>ties Touch with the re<U+017F>t of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, de<U+017F>iring nothing more, they all bringing their own Gold with them. The Serjeant having more pity on him than the Chirurgion, made his application to Dr. <hi>Erles</hi> on his behalf, that he would plea<U+017F>e to move the King for his being Healed; the which having done, and the King granting his de<U+017F>ire, The next time the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant came to the King with fre<U+017F>h Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he acquainted the Serjeant, that this poor man was perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and although his face was <U+017F>o mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trous to view, and accompanied with many deplorable and fetid Ulcers, that he was forced to cover them with green Silk, yet he received that great mea<U+017F>ure of health by His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty, as any one could expect to enjoy.</p>
                     <p>When the King was at <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> there was a Daughter or two of the Marque<U+017F>s of <hi>Cara<U+017F>ceens,</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor

her Di<U+017F>temper was concluded by both not to be the Evil; her Legs were both extraordinarily bli<U+017F>tered; her Stomach was <U+017F>o weak, that <U+017F>he for <U+017F>ome days could not eat any Dyet. I being upon pure Charity per<U+017F>waded by her earne<U+017F>t Intreaties and Reque<U+017F>ts to have her Toucht, the which on her bended Knees <U+017F>he humbly reque<U+017F>ted, with that perfect a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that could <U+017F>he attain it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould certainly gain her Cure; <U+017F>he at the publick Healing at <hi>Whitehal</hi> was Toucht by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ty: that very night <U+017F>he eat two Eggs, that for above ten days before nau<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated any Dyet. The day following <U+017F>he was Toucht again, and with it <U+017F>he received His Maje<U+017F>ties Gold: upon which her Sores and Bli<U+017F>ters in her Legs dryed up, <U+017F>he <U+017F>peedily thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amended, and within a very few days to admiration was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved from her Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and to this day is a vi<U+017F>ible Object of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ties great Cure, (the beginning and ending of which I <U+017F>aw) to His Sacred Thanks and Glory.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Whitacre</hi> of <hi>Winche<U+017F>ter</hi> I had this following, of a Child of one Mr. <hi>Harbins</hi> of the <U+017F>ame place, who

being perfectly blind with the Evil, and <U+017F>he being Toucht by His Sacred Maje<U+017F>ty for the <U+017F>ame at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> <U+017F>he immediately received great benefit thereby, and recovered her <U+017F>ight to that great degree, that walking the <U+017F>ame day along with her Mother by the Maypole in the <hi>Strand,</hi> <U+017F>he askt her Mother what that long Pole was for? which <U+017F>he thankt God <U+017F>he then perfectly <U+017F>aw, and hath continued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ever <U+017F>ince.</p>

                        <hi>Elizabeth Dewolders</hi> of <hi>Flu<U+017F>hing</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> was touched by the King for the Evil about thirteen years <U+017F>ince, who having many running Sores about her Neck, <U+017F>oon after her touching <U+017F>he immediately received benefit, and within a little while after her Sores perfectly dryed up. I <U+017F>aw this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man my <U+017F>elf, who came with her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter who was troubled with the Evil to be Toucht this in<U+017F>tant <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and <U+017F>he is perfectly healed, and hath continued <U+017F>o ever <U+017F>ince.</p>

was toucht about <hi>Ea<U+017F>ter,</hi> and every year about the <U+017F>ame time he meets with a fre<U+017F>h return hereof: he comes about forty miles, and every year he gains the Kings Touch, he receives Cure therewith, and goes home very well, and follows his Calling. This I had from Mr. <hi>Doublebrook,</hi> who is one of His Maje<U+017F>ties Yeoman-U<U+017F>hers, and who always brings him to the King to be Toucht.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Millart,</hi> one of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-U<U+017F>hers to the Yeomen of the Guard, I had this, of a poor Woman who was his next Neighbour, who being <U+017F>o grievou<U+017F>ly troubled with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sores about her Neck, that <U+017F>he was near wa<U+017F>ted and con<U+017F>umed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <U+017F>he was brought in a Chair to the King to be Toucht, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately found benefit thereby, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a <U+017F>hort time after <U+017F>he returned home to <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> perfectly recovered, and <U+017F>ince that <U+017F>ent him a Letter, with thanks, of her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well to this hour.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. <hi>Doublebrook</hi> I had this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing al<U+017F>o, of a Woman who came from <hi>Virginia,</hi> who<U+017F>e No<U+017F>e was almo<U+017F>t eaten away with the Evil, and her

Eyes con<U+017F>umed with that Humour, <U+017F>he being brought by him to the King to be Toucht, immediately received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby, and returned to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> <U+017F>ince, and as a token of Thanks to him, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him a Pair of Gloves, with a Letter, wherein <U+017F>he certified him that <U+017F>he was recovered from her Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and was perfectly healed. This he received from her within a year and a half after, from <hi>Virginia.</hi>

                     <p>I might have introduced many more Examples of the great Cures which have been performed by the Sacred Hands of our Kings and Queens: but I hope the<U+017F>e may be <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>atisfie the rea<U+017F>onable Man.</p>
