            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the happy Indu<U+017F>try of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (whereby we enjoy the benefit of <U+017F>o many u<U+017F>eful inventions) hath <U+017F>till left mater enough, for the contrivance and di<U+017F>covery of <U+017F>ucceeding times, cannot be better made appear, than by calling to mind, tho<U+017F>e many worthy improvements, which almo<U+017F>t all the more Liberal Arts, have received within the compa<U+017F>s of this la<U+017F>t Century, e<U+017F>pecially Phy<U+017F>ick, wherein Anatomy alone (I may truly <U+017F>ay) hath been inriched, by a full third part at lea<U+017F>t. And herein our own Countrymen, have been as <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully inqui<U+017F>itive, as any other their Contemporaries what<U+017F>oever. No wonder then if in <U+017F>uch an Age, I, imitating their example, have thought fit, to give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of my lei<U+017F>ure, to the world; but
<pb facs="tcp:41619:3"/>
that I offer it to the protection of <U+017F>o great a Patron; the rea<U+017F>ons, perhaps, are not <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t, as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. For as the Novelty of <U+017F>o unexpected a method, as I here propo<U+017F>e, will undoubtedly expo<U+017F>e it to the calumny of <U+017F>uch, who (rather than give them<U+017F>elves the trouble of examining the truth of it, being betimes per<U+017F>waded, that they already know as much as is to be learnt) will <U+017F>oon condemn it, both of folly and innovation.

               <hi>I</hi> Hold it not un<U+017F>uitable to our de<U+017F>ign in this Treati<U+017F>e (where I have <U+017F>o often occa<U+017F>ion to make mention of it) that <U+017F>omething be <U+017F>aid by way of Preface, concerning the Air. Not that I intend to treat of it's fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd qualities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which I leave to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philo<U+017F>ophers con<U+017F>ideration, much le<U+017F>s of the Ela<U+017F>tic power of it, in Pneumatick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; already <U+017F>o well performed by others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially by the Honorable <hi>Robert Boyl,</hi> in his mo<U+017F>t accurate Treati<U+017F>e on that Subject: my purpo<U+017F>e here being only to pre<U+017F>ent my Reader, with <U+017F>ome few ob<U+017F>ervables concerning Air, the better to confirm and illu<U+017F>trate, what follows in the Treati<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf: e<U+017F>pecially in the Chapter of Fermentation. Fir<U+017F>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Air is of <U+017F>ome very general u<U+017F>e, may well appear from its being <U+017F>o great in <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>biquitarian, as it is. No place almo<U+017F>t without it, no body (perhaps) but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating, more or le<U+017F>s, of it; in<U+017F>omuch, that
<pb facs="tcp:41619:4"/>
even in metals them<U+017F>elves, the <U+017F>ound of them, it reckoned an affection of the Air included in them. And if the tran<U+017F>parency of Bodies be to be imputed to their porou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, or rather to the <U+017F>treightne<U+017F>s or rectitude of their pores, (as its almo<U+017F>t generally agreed on by Modern Writers) it will follow, that there is a great proportion of Air in the harde<U+017F>t Gemmes. Which is yet more manifest in <U+017F>ofter <U+017F>tones, and becomes the cau<U+017F>e of their moldring and cracking (after they are taken out of the Quarrey, and expo<U+017F>ed to the weather) which <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>tones are very <U+017F>ubject to: For the impri<U+017F>oned Air, that while it was in the cold bowels of the Earth, lay very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<U+017F>ed or compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, afterward <U+017F>ymbolizing with the Air of a thinner Medium, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dilates its <U+017F>elf, and after <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>o weakens the continuity of parts, that at la<U+017F>t becoming too <U+017F>trong for it, the <U+017F>tone breaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many pieces, which will <U+017F>ooner happen if the <U+017F>ame be thrown into the fire: the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Air, in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>e, with much more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence dilating its <U+017F>elf, than in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. Plants <U+017F>eem to owe their very life and being to this included Air: for not ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving hearts, or other principal of motion in
<pb facs="tcp:41619:4"/>
them, (that we know of) for the di<U+017F>tributing of the Sap: the included Air <U+017F>eems to <U+017F>upply that defect, after this manner. In the day time, in hot weather, and generally as often as the Air of the Medium, is dilated or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: the Air included, in the body of every Vegetable, <U+017F>uffers after the <U+017F>ame manner, and has its dimen<U+017F>ions and tone varied. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<U+017F>e two con<U+017F>iderable effects follow, to wit, that upon the dilatation of the internal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air, the parts of the Vegetable are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tended (<U+017F>omewhat) according to their trinal dimen<U+017F>ion, whereby the Plant grows bigger and taller. And again, upon the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the internal Air, room is made for the water or <U+017F>ap, to ri<U+017F>e up, through the pores of the Plant, exactly after the manner of the Weather-gla<U+017F>s: where the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Air becomes the cau<U+017F>e of the a<U+017F>cent of the water. And thus according to the<U+017F>e periods of heat and cold, and the con<U+017F>equent rarity and den<U+017F>ity of the included Air, and that of the Medium; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Plant makes, as it were, <U+017F>o many meals, or is <U+017F>o often refre<U+017F>hed, by the a<U+017F>cending Sap, which a<U+017F>cent is al<U+017F>o not a little promoted, by tho<U+017F>e gentle Vibrations from the winds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the parts of Vegetables (and con<U+017F>equently
<pb facs="tcp:41619:5"/>
the included Air) are moderately compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and dilated reciprocally; wherrupon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid effects follow, even after the <U+017F>ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is <U+017F>aid of the Swing, and in the la<U+017F>t Chapter of this Treati<U+017F>e. The included Air <U+017F>erves likewi<U+017F>e in Vegetables (as in all other bodies) for the maturing and fermenting the juices in them, in <U+017F>uch manner as is hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. A farther confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be hence had, that the mo<U+017F>t vegetous plants, and <U+017F>uch as we call <hi>Ever-Greens,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound most with Air in them: as appears when they are thrown into the fire, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eruption of it. And there is, I think, no vegetable that has not one great pore or Pipe running from the root to the very top of it. Farther, in the Sea wrack, or <hi>Quercus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> 'tis obvious for every one to ob<U+017F>erve a very particular and curious contrivance of Nature, for the nouri<U+017F>hment of that plant, by the help of Air after this <U+017F>ort. The plant as always fa<U+017F>tened to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tone; and as it branches out, with jagged leafs, <U+017F>omewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embling tho<U+017F>e of the Oak: it hath <U+017F>everal little Bli<U+017F>ters or Bladders on it (<U+017F>ome where of I have <U+017F>een as big as a <U+017F>mall Pullets Egg.)

(and hangs in the water like a Net that hath Corks and Leads to it) whereupon the Plant is con<U+017F>iderably <U+017F>tretched; and again, upon the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>iding of the water, receives its nouri<U+017F>hment, as in the former in<U+017F>tance of other vegetables, though perhaps not from the root, being fa<U+017F>tened to a <U+017F>tone, but by the poro<U+017F>e <U+017F>urface of its body. And la<U+017F>tly, that there is much Air di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated through the bodies of Animals, is manife<U+017F>t from their food: herbs and water, both which participate of it in good quantity. A notable argument whereof in water, may be, that it doth upon <U+017F>uch ea<U+017F>ie terms ri<U+017F>e up in a vapour, and mingle its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible parts with the Air. For as the water grows warm, either by the heat of the Sun or fire, the <U+017F>mall parts of Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, make ha<U+017F>te to the top of the water, where they frame them<U+017F>elves, with <U+017F>ome of the water, into little bubbles; and are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the motion of the Air or Medium, like tho<U+017F>e bubbles made by Children, with Soap and water. And this perhaps may be one rea<U+017F>on, why Rain water is better for plants, then other water, becau<U+017F>e it has more air in it; a te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:41619:6"/>
whereof the Scale may afford us. And this is manifest in wine even to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e: from which (if it be brisk and fre<U+017F>h, and poured from on high, into a gla<U+017F>s) you <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee a great number of little bubbles, or floating parcels of Air ri<U+017F>e up, with <U+017F>uch force, as to mount neer a foot, above the <U+017F>urface of the wine. But it is not enough for us to have proved great quantities of Air in all mixed bodies, unle<U+017F>s it be at the <U+017F>ame time allowed us, that the Air be actually and formally there as in the Medium or open Air, <U+017F>uffering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el<U+017F>e but barely an impri<U+017F>onment, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement only, which is already <U+017F>ufficiently made out by the u<U+017F>es lately a<U+017F><U+017F>igned it in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, (unle<U+017F>s they may be otherways more commodiou<U+017F>ly explained) be<U+017F>ides, that the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of converting one <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, was yet never <U+017F>o clearly taught, as to become intelligible, and has at this day but few A<U+017F><U+017F>erters of it.</p>

the neerne<U+017F>s or remotene<U+017F>s of the Sun (the heart and Center of this worldly Sy<U+017F>tem in which we live) I thought it a matter worth my pains (though perhaps exceeding my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) to a<U+017F><U+017F>ay whether all fermentation, were not reducible to this <U+017F>imple motion of the Air, and did not depend on it, as on a general and more univer<U+017F>al cau<U+017F>e; which if I fail not in, it will be no very difficult matter, to reduce all other motions in the world, to that of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and probably to re<U+017F>olve many hard que<U+017F>tions, not as yet <U+017F>o rightly determined.

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41619:8"/>3 The mo<U+017F>t general properties of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation are the<U+017F>e: that the Ma<U+017F>s <U+017F>o fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <U+017F>uffers an eminent alteration in all its u<U+017F>ual wayes of affecting our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, as well in its fir<U+017F>t as <U+017F>econd qualities: they are either exalted or depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, they are <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times changed for their contrary, and in a word, relation being had to our e<U+017F>teem of things thus fermented, all fermentation may be <U+017F>aid to be either perfective or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructive, though in it <U+017F>elf it be but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued flux: as for in<U+017F>tance in an apple, or the like, that from a green au<U+017F>tere bud, fir<U+017F>t acquires its due perfection, and after by a continuation of that fermentation, that ripened it, at la<U+017F>t arrives at corruption, and <U+017F>o changes both its name and nature together.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Another eminent property of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that for the mo<U+017F>t part the Body fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented doth occupy more <U+017F>pace than the <U+017F>ame did before, which is very evident in the drowned bodies of men or other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which though at fir<U+017F>t they go to the bottom, yet after a certain time do <U+017F>lowly boye them<U+017F>elves up again to the top of the water, not for that the breaking of the

            <p n="7">7. Another very General property of Fermentation is, that all bodies, almo<U+017F>t by it, at la<U+017F>t become acide: as is manife<U+017F>t in all liquors, decoctions of fle<U+017F>h, or herbs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries, <U+017F>irups, &amp;c. by which acidity I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand not that <U+017F>owre ta<U+017F>te, ob<U+017F>ervable in mo<U+017F>t green fruits, which is rather to be termed acerbity, and differs as much from what we here <U+017F>peak of, as Agre<U+017F>ta (the juyce of green grapes expre<U+017F>t) doth from Vinegar.</p>

fermentation: which cannot be duely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed, to any other ingredient in mixt bodies, than to the air, for that it hath not yet been found, by <U+017F>ufficient experiment, that any body what<U+017F>oever is capable of rarifaction and conden<U+017F>ation; or dilation and con<U+017F>truction be<U+017F>ides air: as for Leaf Gold, what it got in one dimen<U+017F>ion, it lo<U+017F>t in the other, and all the parts of Gold calcined, do but equal the Ma<U+017F>s they were made of, no more than if the <U+017F>ame had been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an impalpable powder by means of a very fine file. The <U+017F>ame is to be under<U+017F>tood of water evaporated by heat: which is only a comminution of it, into exceeding <U+017F>mall parts, and no way a conver<U+017F>ion of it into air (as hath been formerly received) which is from hence evidenced, that <U+017F>uch vapours by the Alembic, are again reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <U+017F>ame liquors from whence they were fir<U+017F>t rai<U+017F>ed, viz. into Ro<U+017F>ewater or <U+017F>pirit of Wine, which were no more po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they had been really converted into air, then out of common air to draw Ro<U+017F>e-water or <U+017F>pirit of Wine, and if water, or milke or other liquor take up more room when boyling on the fire, then they did

            <p n="1">1. THe Stomack or Ventricle in animals, de<U+017F>igned by Nature for the Office of Chylification, commonly called the fir<U+017F>t Concoction (and which is, as it were, the root of all Vegetation or nutrition in them) <U+017F>eems at fir<U+017F>t birth but ill fitted for <U+017F>uch a work, till the Coats or Membrances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have been well <U+017F>tained or <U+017F>ea<U+017F>oned by the receipt of an aliment <U+017F>o prepared, that it want little more than warmth, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of that operation upon it, which is expected from the Stomack. And thus, for all animals that <U+017F>uck, Nature has provided for their fir<U+017F>t food, a kind of corrupted Milk, u<U+017F>ually called Bea<U+017F>tings, which gives, as it were, the fir<U+017F>t tincture to their tender Stomacks, and whereby they <U+017F>eem enabled to concoct more perfect Milk,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41619:17"/>
which they begin to draw after a day or two. Which Milk al<U+017F>o by degrees becomes more thick and harder of concoction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the encrea<U+017F>e of <U+017F>trength, in the <U+017F>tomack it <U+017F>elf, till by little and little, they begin to alter their diet, and for<U+017F>ake the Teat, for <U+017F>uch other food as is mo<U+017F>t proportionable to their re<U+017F>pective Natures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Tincture, thus imprinted on the Stomack, may very properly be termed a ferment, and <U+017F>eems to bear a ju<U+017F>t proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Leven, which is a <U+017F>mall part of the Ma<U+017F>s of Dough, <U+017F>uffered to grow <U+017F>owre, while the re<U+017F>t is converted into bread, which if not hindred, would have all turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into leven likewi<U+017F>e. Thus after the Chyle is conveyed from the Stomack into the Guts, from thence to be di<U+017F>tributed through the whole Body: <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall part that remains <U+017F>ticking to the coats of the Stomack, <U+017F>oon after acquires that acidity, due to all fermentation not interrupted: which after <U+017F>ome time begins to grieve and afflict the Stomack with its <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s: the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e whereof, we u<U+017F>ually call hunger: which <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of pain (or hunger) continues to grow more and more, (that which cau<U+017F>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41619:18"/>
it becoming <U+017F>till <U+017F>harper and <U+017F>harper) till by the reception of new aliment, the acidi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the <U+017F>aid Tincture or Leven, be <U+017F>o mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated and allayed, that the Stomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, healed by application of the<U+017F>e new, benigne, and uncorrupted juices, is no longer <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any pain or mole<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which then puts an end to the de<U+017F>ire of eating. But if food be forborn, or withheld, the pain <U+017F>o long encrea<U+017F>es, till it at la<U+017F>t de<U+017F>troys the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the part, and introduces a <U+017F>phalelus, Gangrene or Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Stomack: which is afterward <U+017F>oon conveyed to the heart and brain, by its communion of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and <U+017F>o at length becomes the death of the Animal. Which <U+017F>eems rather to be the cau<U+017F>e of death, in <U+017F>uch as peri<U+017F>h by hunger, than the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s or inanition of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which, though much exhau<U+017F>ted, are yet found in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, with a con<U+017F>iderable quantity of blood in them.

And it is no more than if you <U+017F>hould advi<U+017F>e the Hou<U+017F>e-wife, not to make any new Bread till the Leven be grown ripe, or <U+017F>owre enough to leven and ferment the Ma<U+017F>s of Dough. The <U+017F>econd Rule is, that we <U+017F>hould leave eating, with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall appetite to eat on; or that we <U+017F>hould ri<U+017F>e from Table with an appetite: the rea<U+017F>on is almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame with the former, and may well be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<U+017F>trated by the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tance, which is, that it is requi<U+017F>ite, the Leven <U+017F>hould bear <U+017F>ome ju<U+017F>t proportion, to the Ma<U+017F>s it is to ferment.

Nor does the generation of vital <U+017F>pirits <U+017F>eem to be the chief u<U+017F>e of the air in breathing, in regard it is not ea<U+017F>ie to conceive any <U+017F>uch contrivance in the lungs, that may <U+017F>erve for the letting in of air, into the veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which contain the blood, without endangering, contrariwi<U+017F>e, the effu<U+017F>ion of that precious juice, much le<U+017F>s has Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as yet, di<U+017F>covered any <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages unto us.

think it as true, that this is none of the principal u<U+017F>es of Re<U+017F>piration.

Before I come to deliver my own Opinion, I <U+017F>hall make a <U+017F>light digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion concerning the circulation of the blood, which will not a little illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate what we are about to <U+017F>ay concerning this Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis manife<U+017F>t in the circulation of the blood in Animals, that the blood is moved from the left Ventricle of the heart, through the great Artery, into all its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from whence it is brought back by the <U+017F>maller veins, which di<U+017F>charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves into the Vena Cava, from whence it is returned into the right Ventricle of the heart, from whence it is <U+017F>ent by the Vena Arterio<U+017F>a into the lungs, and <U+017F>o brought back again into the left Ventricle of the heart by the Arteria Veno<U+017F>a: And in this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41619:26"/>
circular motion of the blood, life chiefly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth: and if the <U+017F>ame by any chance <U+017F>hould cea<U+017F>e or intermit, though but for a very <U+017F>mall time (le<U+017F>s than a minute) death would unavoidably follow. In this motion of the blood, it is ob<U+017F>ervable fir<U+017F>t, that as the pul<U+017F>ation of the heart <U+017F>endeth it through the Arteries, into the whole habit of the body, <U+017F>o the return of it by the veins, <U+017F>eems to depend chiefly upon the tonical motion of the body; for the parts being extended by the flowing in of the blood, <U+017F>omewhat beyond their tone, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain gently <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ide, and thereby continue the intended cour<U+017F>e of the blood toward the heart again. An argument hereof is, that all Paralytick parts grow immediately cold, and that for no other rea<U+017F>on, than that the tonical motion, together with the power Locomotive, cea<U+017F>ing, the circulation is either very weakly, or not at all perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through that part, which then grows cold, for want of that con<U+017F>tant fre<U+017F>h <U+017F>upply of blood, which formerly kept it warm. But herein the tonical motion is not a little helped by exerci<U+017F>e and labour, which we find, by experience, to cau<U+017F>e the heart to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41619:26"/>
beat quicker and oftner, as al<U+017F>o to induce a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of breathing more frequently; and this it doth no otherwi<U+017F>e, than by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating this circular motion of the blood, which then enforceth the heart and lungs to double duty. Our <U+017F>econd ob<U+017F>ervable in this circular motion of the blood is, that there pa<U+017F><U+017F>es as much blood from the right Ventricle of the heart into the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gs, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pul<U+017F>e (taking one time with another) as is <U+017F>ent from the left Ventricle into all the parts of the body be<U+017F>ide. Nor can it be otherwi<U+017F>e, the left Ventricle being <U+017F>upplied from the lungs only; and the lungs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, not el<U+017F>ewhere than from the right Ventricle of the heart. So, that to continue this circular motion of the blood, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary, the <U+017F>upply neither exceed, nor come <U+017F>hort of that quantity, di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed from the left Ventricle of the heart, into the whole body (the Lungs excepted.) From hence it follows, that there flows a greater quantity of blood, by many degrees, into the lungs, than what is <U+017F>ufficient for its own private u<U+017F>e. As al<U+017F>o, that the blood in the lungs, mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, move very much fa<U+017F>ter, than it does in any part of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41619:27"/>
body: though we take for example, the great vein or artery them<U+017F>elves: and that, in the <U+017F>ame proportion, as the <hi>Vena Arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a,</hi> and <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a,</hi> are <U+017F>maller than the trunks of the fore<U+017F>aid great ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. For, let the <U+017F>ame quantity of liquor be conveyed through a pipe, who<U+017F>e capacity is but one fourth, or one tenth, <U+017F>o big as another pipe, through which the like quantity mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s in the <U+017F>ame time: and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the liquor mu<U+017F>t run four times, or ten times as fa<U+017F>t, through the <U+017F>maller pipe, as it does through the greater. And thus, it appears, that a very con<U+017F>iderable part of the Ma<U+017F>s of blood, is continually running through the Parenchyma of the lungs; and that, at a much <U+017F>wifter rate, than it doth, through any part of the whole body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Farther, before we proceed to treat of the u<U+017F>e of Re<U+017F>piration, it will not be ami<U+017F>s to con<U+017F>ider, what kind of motion that is which the lungs are exerci<U+017F>ed with, in breathing. Nor is it any other, than a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dilatation and con<U+017F>triction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the lungs are reciprocally opened and <U+017F>hut, <U+017F>omewhat after the manner, of a pair
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41619:27"/>
of Organ-Bellows: the air entring into them, when dilated or opened, and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding again, upon their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>iding. And this is what we call Re<U+017F>piration. Nor yet, does this reciprocation of the lungs, proceed from any power to move, they are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with of them<U+017F>elves. For, if we con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the frame and <U+017F>tructure of them, they will appear of a Parenchymous kind of <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, not much unlike the liver, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of Mu<U+017F>cles; without which, no local motion can be performed. We may conclude therefore, that the lungs are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by con<U+017F>ent, and that chiefly of the Diaphragme or Midriff, in a free and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary breathing. But, in any difficulty of breathing, as in the A<U+017F>thma, Tabes, violent exerci<U+017F>e, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only the Midriff, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t all the Mu<U+017F>cles of the trunk of the body, namely, tho<U+017F>e of the Belly, Che<U+017F>t and Shoulders, <U+017F>eem to afford their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, in this great work of Re<U+017F>piration. The motion of the Midriff is fir<U+017F>t down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whereupon the lungs follow, and the air is admitted, and again upwards; whereby the lungs are compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and the air excluded. Thus you <U+017F>ee, that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41619:28"/>
of the Midriff, <U+017F>o is its motion, <U+017F>omewhat different from that of other Mu<U+017F>cles: which, as being well known, we <U+017F>hall not need to <U+017F>pend longer time about, but come to the publick u<U+017F>e of the lungs, in the Oeconomy of our bodies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the circulation of the blood, we a<U+017F>cribed the reduction of it again into the right ventricle of the heart, to the Tonical motion of the body: where yet, as we have <U+017F>aid, the blood moves but very <U+017F>lowly, if compared, with that <U+017F>wift, and rapid moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is carried on with, through the lungs; where it moves, perhaps, ten times as fa<U+017F>t, as in any other part of the body; as has been already proved. Which notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we <U+017F>hall not be able, upon peru<U+017F>al of the <U+017F>tructure of the lungs, to conclude, that they are endowed with any con<U+017F>iderable tonical motion, as may be gathered, as well from their want of Mu<U+017F>cles, as for that their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, is very <U+017F>pongey and flaccid: and their common integument is but one thin membrane. Nor was it without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and that a mo<U+017F>t excellent de<U+017F>ign: that Nature thus contrived the lungs with little or no tonical motion in them. For fir<U+017F>t, had this Tone been equivalent to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41619:28"/>
Ma<U+017F>s of blood, to be returned by it; it would much have retarded the influx of the blood, into the lungs: and con<U+017F>equently, have hindered a great work of Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it there, as <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>hewed hereafter. But chiefly, for that it has largely <U+017F>upplied <U+017F>uch defect, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which becomes the cau<U+017F>e, both of dilating, and contracting the lungs; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the occa<U+017F>ion, and at the will and plea<U+017F>ure of the Animal. And this is, indeed, the fir<U+017F>t and principal Office of the lungs; as to what concerns their reciprocal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Namely, that upon the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>iding of them, in Re<U+017F>piration, the blood may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>queezed out of them, through the <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a,</hi> into the hearts left Ventricle. And becau<U+017F>e, the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the lungs is very tender; Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, that not the Diaphragme immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the air inclo<U+017F>ed in the cavity of the bre<U+017F>t (for this very purpo<U+017F>e only) being fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>treightened and crowded, as it were, together, by the motion of the Diaphragm upward, <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e this compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the lungs; while by its Ela<U+017F>tic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it endeavours to dilate it <U+017F>elf again, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41619:29"/>
its u<U+017F>ual dimen<U+017F>ions. Nor could any way of compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the lungs, (thereby to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of the <U+017F>uperfluous blood) have been contrived more equal: for this pent air, is as apt to pre<U+017F>s upon one part, as on another. Nor yet more gentle, and <U+017F>ecure: for what contact could have been more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, or le<U+017F>s apt, to wound the tender membrane of the lungs, than the air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>ed in the bre<U+017F>t about them? Nor need any doubt, but that the air, thus compre<U+017F>t and <U+017F>treightned, is of <U+017F>trength <U+017F>ufficient for this <U+017F>ervice: and that there is <U+017F>uch a Spring in the air; who, <U+017F>hall but con<U+017F>ider with what force, the air breaks forth of the Wind-gun, and other Pneumatic Engines. A farther confirmation hereof, may be had from hence: that <U+017F>uch wounds, as perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the bre<U+017F>t, if left open, but for a little time, do quickly cau<U+017F>e a difficulty of breathing<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and I do not much que<U+017F>tion, but if both <U+017F>ides of the bre<U+017F>t were perforated, it would as certainly di<U+017F>patch a man, as hanging; and that, almo<U+017F>t, in as <U+017F>hort a time.

               <note n="inter">N. 1.</note>THe Chyle, when <U+017F>eparated from the remaining unprofitable parts of our Aliment is, by proper ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of its own (the di<U+017F>covery of modern Anatomi<U+017F>ts) conveyed directly into the Subclavial veins, and from thence into the right Ventricle of the heart, where it is mingled with a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger quantity of blood, returning home by the great vein, together with which it is immediately tran<U+017F>mitted to the lungs, where (though it make great ha<U+017F>t through, and moves very impetuou<U+017F>ly, as has been <U+017F>aid, yet) by rea<U+017F>on of the length of the way, it continues a con<U+017F>iderable time, and is more perfectly mingled with the blood, and wrought up together with it, into one Ma<U+017F>s, and at the <U+017F>ame time, acquires both the name and form of blood (as Phy<U+017F>itians term it) and <U+017F>o is fitted for the heart, from thence to be di<U+017F>tributed to the re<U+017F>t of the body: where after what manner it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41619:32"/>
we <U+017F>ay not, as a thing already <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known, and whereof we have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our <U+017F>en<U+017F>e already.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Chyle is very ea<U+017F>ily mixt with blood, is evident, for that it is the matter whereof all blood is made, by a farther continuation, of that fermentation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, begun on it in the <U+017F>tomack. Nor yet is the proportion <U+017F>o great between them, but that upon mingling; the di<U+017F><U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of parts, becomes immediately the cau<U+017F>e of an extraordinary ebullition: which is very much encrea<U+017F>ed by the reciprocal motion of the lungs, whereby the blood is wrought almo<U+017F>t all into a froth or foam, by that time it gets into the left Ventricle of the heart. Which <U+017F>udden exce<U+017F>s of heat, is not unlike what happens upon the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling <U+017F>everal Chymical liquors together, as Spirit of Wine, and Spirit of Turpentine, and other <U+017F>uch like, where the heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <U+017F>o great, that it often endangers the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el they are contained in. And this is the cau<U+017F>e of that heat a while after meals di<U+017F>cernable in Hectical per<U+017F>ons, and others, otherwi<U+017F>e affected: and which in many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by flu<U+017F>hings in the face. Now that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41619:33"/>
the blood is wrought up to that froth, we <U+017F>peak of, during its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the lungs, is not only <U+017F>uitable to rea<U+017F>on, but appears mo<U+017F>t evidently, in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>anguine excretions from the lungs, which happen in con<U+017F>umptive per<U+017F>ons: nor does that frothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, then ob<U+017F>ervable, proceed from the mingling with it the air we breath, for that at one breathing out (or expiration) could not be <U+017F>ufficiently performed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The blood, by <U+017F>everal very learned men, has not unaptly been compared to wine; and in my Opinion, the Chyle may as properly be likened to the juice, newly pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed out of the Grapes: which if it were by certain intervals, in a due proportion, poured gently into new wine, or mu<U+017F>t, as it begins to cool, would again renew its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition, and continue the warmth of it, to what degree is requi<U+017F>ite, and that <U+017F>o long as this practi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall be continued. And from this Illu<U+017F>tration<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> may be clearly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity and u<U+017F>e of eating, at lea<U+017F>t within certain periods, or intervals: to wit, that by the frequent affu<U+017F>ion of Chyle, the blood may again recover its motion, warmth and vigour, without which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41619:33"/>
<U+017F>upply, it would <U+017F>oon langui<U+017F>h, cool and congeal, and con<U+017F>equently, death en<U+017F>ue. Now that the lungs are indeed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Officina Sanguinis,</hi> may be farther colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Con<U+017F>umptions of the lungs, wherein all parts of the body are <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extenuated, by the affection of the part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis probable, that the blood during its <U+017F>tay in the lungs, does not actually dilate it <U+017F>elf, and ri<U+017F>e into froth, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an aptne<U+017F>s <U+017F>o to do, as <U+017F>oon as it is at a little more liberty, as appears in blood <U+017F>pit out of them; and con<U+017F>equently; when it falls into the left Ventricle of the heart, it immediately dilates it <U+017F>elf with great force, in the manner of botled Beer; and in this manner does, for ought I know, in great part, become the cau<U+017F>e of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tole, or expan<U+017F>ion of the heart, which being extended, beyond its due and natural <U+017F>cituation, does again violently contract it <U+017F>elf, by a power almo<U+017F>t all bodies have of re<U+017F>toring them<U+017F>elves, and which we call the tone, or tonical motion. And as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve in a Switch bowed down, or in a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum removed out of its place, that they return beyond the perpendicular; <U+017F>o it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41619:34"/>
fares in this motion of the heart, whereby it is again more contracted, than is natural to it, and <U+017F>o of it <U+017F>elf returns again to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand it <U+017F>elf, and is again violently di<U+017F>tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before, by the influx of more <U+017F>pumy blood from the lungs. Now though it may be objected, that the pul<U+017F>e in the heart continues, many times, a long while, after it is taken out of the body; and when there is no longer any <U+017F>uch influx to be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the cau<U+017F>e of it. To this I an<U+017F>wer, that <U+017F>uch pul<U+017F>e, is what the Phy<U+017F>itians call the <hi>Myurus,</hi> or Mou<U+017F>e-tail, for that its Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromes, or differences, between greate<U+017F>t and lea<U+017F>t expan<U+017F>ion, do continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come le<U+017F>s and le<U+017F>s, even as it happens in <hi>Pendulums,</hi> once removed from the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, which continue their motion for a long time, after the hand is from them that fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>et them awork. At lea<U+017F>t this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition of the blood in the heart, <U+017F>eems not a little to contribute to the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <U+017F>trengthening of this pul<U+017F>ive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In contemplation of this <hi>Orga<U+017F>mus,</hi> or fury, as I may call it, in the blood i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the lungs, and now to be di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all parts of the body Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived

the Arteries with thick and double coats, the better to contain it: whereas the veins de<U+017F>igned for the carrying it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the heart, at what time the blood is very much cooled and tamed, are only made of <U+017F>ingle membranes, as being <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient now to hold it. And this is all the difference between Arterial and Venal blood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It <U+017F>eems of all other Opinions the mo<U+017F>t probable, that the blood, when arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the extremities of the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, is there <U+017F>hed upon the habit of the body, in the belly, or fle<U+017F>hy part of every Mu<U+017F>cle; each Mu<U+017F>cle having the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or likene<U+017F>s, of one of the quarters, or Acetabula in an Orange, or a Lemon; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of which, either by local or tonical motion, it is not hard to conceive, how the blood is again forced into the mouths of the veins; and after the <U+017F>ame manner has every Mu<U+017F>cle its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular membrane. And thus we find that blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth, upon pricking the fle<U+017F>h, in any place; although it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we <U+017F>hould always prick a vein or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: or we mu<U+017F>t conclude, there is nothing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41619:35"/>
el<U+017F>e in fle<U+017F>h, but a multitude of capillar veins and arteries, which were ab<U+017F>urd to be a<U+017F><U+017F>erted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To make <U+017F>hort: Life it <U+017F>elf is but a continuation of this vigorous fermentation of the blood, which is <U+017F>o long maintained, as the Ma<U+017F>s of blood is kept hot, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating through the veins and arteries; and if done by tho<U+017F>e means, and in that manner, which is <U+017F>uitable to Nature, <U+017F>o long the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is in perfect health. If it be too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fermented, or moved, it does, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, become the cau<U+017F>e of Fevers, and other acute di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: as contrariwi<U+017F>e, if the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation be too weak, from thence all chronical di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es take their original: and that particularly, according to the <U+017F>everal irregularities that may happen, either in exce<U+017F>s, or defect, in this fermentation and circular motion of the blood. We de<U+017F>cend not now to particulars, the mo<U+017F>t we aim at in this Treati<U+017F>e, being but a general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, either of preventing or curing di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, after a way not yet treated of.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Since the di<U+017F>covery of the circulation of the blood, it has been the Opinion of many great A<U+017F><U+017F>ertous of it, that where the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41619:35"/>
indication is of letting blood, it matters not out of what vein it be taken, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <U+017F>o many ounces be let out, as the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e requires. And this their A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion is made probable, by many arguments alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them for that purpo<U+017F>e; and but for the tonical motion of the habit of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would be as great a truth, as any is in Phy<U+017F>ick. But the tonical motion of the parts once admitted, We mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e grant, that tho<U+017F>e parts will empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves fir<U+017F>t, that lie neare<U+017F>t to the inci<U+017F>ion; as well, for that there is le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to force any liquor to a <U+017F>horter than a longer di<U+017F>tance: as al<U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e the more remote parts, or Mu<U+017F>cles, do exerci<U+017F>e a kind of Antipraxia, or Contranitency, and <U+017F>o become of mutual impediment one to the other: whereas the nearer parts, do almo<U+017F>t immediately di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves upon the Orifice, or inci<U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. From this tonical motion of the whole body, it happens, that any particular part is <U+017F>ometimes preternaturally <U+017F>welled, either from a <U+017F>troak, the application of cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, or generally any other cau<U+017F>e, which may weaken the tone of the part; for in

<U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>e, the heart continuing its motion, for the di<U+017F>tribution of the Ma<U+017F>s of humors, it is very ea<U+017F>ie to conceive, that more of them will pa<U+017F>s into that part, where lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance is made, than otherwi<U+017F>e would have happened, had the part continued in its natural tone and vigour.</p>
            <p n="9">9. From hence likewi<U+017F>e the rea<U+017F>on is to be <U+017F>ought, how it happens in letting blood, that <U+017F>o large a quantity <U+017F>hould in <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a time, i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out at the inci<U+017F>ion made in one vein, and that perhaps none of the large<U+017F>t. For if we duly con<U+017F>ider, how quickly a man may bleed to death, by the opening (for in<U+017F>tance) of a vein in his arm; we mu<U+017F>t conclude, that the blood pa<U+017F><U+017F>es not much fa<U+017F>ter through the heart, than it does at the <U+017F>ame time out at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice in his arm; and that con<U+017F>equently, there is but little blood received, during this evacuation, into the re<U+017F>t of the body, which doth then by its tone di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf (into the great vein) of its Plethora, or <U+017F>uperfluous blood<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the heart, toward the habit, the greate<U+017F>t part takes its way to the part, where the inci<U+017F>ion was made, it finding

there no other oppo<U+017F>ition, than what it has while it is trava<U+017F>ated from the arteries into the veins, through the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of their mouths, which yet is in part recompenced by the multitude of them. Now if it be agreed on, that in half an hour a man may bleed to death, or thereabout, if a vein in the arm be kept open: and that there will, in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>e, be about one half of his blood let out, computing what is likewi<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the capillar ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the habit of the body, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either that the whole Ma<U+017F>s is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circulated twenty four times in twenty four hours, or a natural day.

It is frequently <U+017F>een in hor<U+017F>es, that upon long and much labour, they lo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ight of their eyes; nay, I have known <U+017F>ome hor<U+017F>es that have lo<U+017F>t one or both eyes, with one days over-<U+017F>training, either by draught, or cour<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o became blinde of a <U+017F>udden. And then we commonly <U+017F>ay, they have drawn their eyes out: But how the eyes <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer, or what part they take in the labour, or violent exerci<U+017F>e of the body, is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily made out, unle<U+017F>s by this tonical motion of the body, which now becomes much <U+017F>trengthened by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent local motion, either in drawing, or running, whereby the Mu<U+017F>cles of the whole body are much more compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, than in their natural <U+017F>tate of re<U+017F>t, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently, do not only not admit of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ual quantity of blood and humours, due to them by circulation; but by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and frequent contraction, do return them back in much a larger proportion, than they now receive them; whereupon the lungs become over-charged, which cau<U+017F>es frequent breathing, and makes the pul<U+017F>e quicker and <U+017F>tronger than formerly, di<U+017F>tends the great vein and artery, with a

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41619:38"/>
how by very modern di<U+017F>covery, the Chyle is fir<U+017F>t mingled with the blood, in the axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary or <U+017F>ubclavial veins, from whence it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by the right Ventricle of the heart, through the lungs, into the left Ventricle; from thence to be di<U+017F>tributed into the whole body: One thing very remarkable will ari<U+017F>e to our ob<U+017F>ervation; namely, that what part of the blood is <U+017F>ent toward the head by the carotides or arteries of the neck, flows thither very crude, and accompanied with all its excrements, it having not yet received or <U+017F>uffered any depuration, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, from the Reins or Spleen, like that which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es into almo<U+017F>t all other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially the lower parts of the body (though indeed it <U+017F>eems not to be clean<U+017F>ed of the gall, till it returns home again through the liver.) Now though Natures purpo<U+017F>e herein be very ob<U+017F>cure, that the blood thus impure, <U+017F>hould be de<U+017F>igned for the <U+017F>ervice of the mo<U+017F>t Noble part, yet, that <U+017F>o it is, will farther appear, by the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Emunctories (or <U+017F>inks) wherewith the head is in a particular manner provided, as the ears, eyes, no<U+017F>e, palat; every of which, di<U+017F>charge the brain of a <U+017F>everal excrement,

and that no longer u<U+017F>eful to the body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what is <U+017F>ecerned by the palat, which is for the mo<U+017F>t part again returned to the <U+017F>tomack: for the better <U+017F>eparating of which, Nature has indu<U+017F>triou<U+017F>ly placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head, <U+017F>o many of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>erous ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, called the <hi>Ductus Salivares,</hi> which <U+017F>eem here to perform the <U+017F>ame Office, to that part of the blood <U+017F>ent to the head, which the Reins do execute, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Ma<U+017F>s. Hence no wonder it is; if exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive drinking do <U+017F>o much weaken the brain, cau<U+017F>e Catarrhs (which is nothing but an over-flowing of the <hi>Ductus Salivares</hi>) weaken all the faculties of the Soul and <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and at length, enervate the whole body, although, at the <U+017F>ame time, the Reins do their duty indifferently well; and this e<U+017F>pecially, if the native tone of the brain be weak, it being then <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s able to di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous excrements.

cannot be imagined, that the included air, is at all either dilated, or contracted: not the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e there is no room for it to expand it <U+017F>elf upon, nor yet the la<U+017F>t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ides of the Bottle are not apt to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ide, without which, no <U+017F>ufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on can be given, why the air, upon exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cold, <U+017F>hould quit any part of the place it formerly repleni<U+017F>hed.

All which di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are no other, than the effects the Medium hath upon the Air impri<U+017F>oned in our bodies; which if it finds the humors ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to a farther degree of fermentation, than what is con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with health, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Fever or Calenture in <U+017F>ome bodies; in others, a dangerous Flux: and in <U+017F>ome mo<U+017F>t violent Spa<U+017F>mes, upon the forcible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation either of the Air in the nervous parts, or of that, which may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be, in the <U+017F>paces between the Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
            <p n="8">8. From hence probably it is, that

the fruits of tho<U+017F>e hotter Countryes are <U+017F>o dangerous, e<U+017F>pecially to <U+017F>trangers; for that they are no <U+017F>ooner received into the body, but they are <U+017F>traightways very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently fermented (and after the <U+017F>ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ferment the juices of the body, to the di<U+017F>ordering of the whole frame) in <U+017F>o much, that the juice of <U+017F>ome plants, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a deadly poy<U+017F>on, as that of the Root of <hi>Yucca</hi> (while the <U+017F>olider parts are made into a kind of whole<U+017F>ome bread) and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, for no other venomous quality, than its over-active fermentation, whereby it not only di<U+017F>turbs, but de<U+017F>troys the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the body. All which, and much more of this kind, that might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <U+017F>eems in great part to depend upon the finene<U+017F>s, or rarity of the Medium, which lying lighter on liquors, and other bodies thus fermented, <U+017F>uffers them more ea<U+017F>ily, and more violently, to expand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, than, for the mo<U+017F>t part, is <U+017F>uitable with the health of <U+017F>uch as eat them, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in any con<U+017F>iderable quantity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And now from what hath hitherto been <U+017F>aid, it may <U+017F>eem exceeding probable, that the Air doth con<U+017F>iderably alter, and

            <p n="10">10. Now to the end we may not want the help of <U+017F>o generous a remedy; and for the better avoiding the fore-mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences in the u<U+017F>e of it. I hold it a matter of no <U+017F>mall compendium, in this place, briefly to <U+017F>et down, and <U+017F>hew the manner of a certain contrivance, how any per<U+017F>on may receive the benefit he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, upon removal from his abode, to any other place (with intent to change the air) and that almo<U+017F>t indifferently at any <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of the year, without <U+017F>o much as remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of his own hou<U+017F>e, or neglecting any occa<U+017F>ions what<U+017F>oever. Fir<U+017F>t therefore, in <U+017F>ome fit place neer, or adjoyning to your hou<U+017F>e, erect a convenient Room, of about

The door mu<U+017F>t be likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o contrived, that it may <U+017F>hut into its frame <U+017F>o exactly, that when it is made fa<U+017F>t, there may not be the lea<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>age left for the air to get in or out of the fore<U+017F>aid Chamber. The particular manner and contrivance of doing all which, I do not here <U+017F>et down, for that I doubt not, but there are ingenious Ma<U+017F>ons and Joyners, that will much exceed any directions, that I can be able to give them. Your Air-Chamber being thus made, you mu<U+017F>t farther provide your <U+017F>elf with a very large pair of Organ Bellows, which

This Brazen Pipe mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e have another Value to open inward, and both <U+017F>o contrived, that either of them may be <U+017F>et open at any time, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, while the other is imployed. The Bellows being thus fitted, and the door and windows clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut, you may at plea<U+017F>ure either fill the Chamber with Air, by force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what quantity you plea<U+017F>e, till there be twice or thrice as much as there was at fir<U+017F>t, ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the innermo<U+017F>t Value of the Brazen Pipe, before mentioned, mu<U+017F>t either be taken off, or kept con<U+017F>tantly open: but if air is to be forced into the Chamber, then the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will need to be turned the wrong <U+017F>ide upward; and the outward Value of the Bra<U+017F>s Pipe mu<U+017F>t be taken off, or kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the innermo<U+017F>t Value <U+017F>uffered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to play.

As to the particular application of the u<U+017F>e of the newly de<U+017F>cribed Domici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, or Air-Chamber, 'twill not be ami<U+017F>s to repeat, what we before a<U+017F><U+017F>erted in the precedent Chapter; namely, that as health it <U+017F>elf, is maintained by a due and <U+017F>uitable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41619:50"/>
fermentation of the humors in our bodies, and that within a certain latitude. So, if the irregularity of the <U+017F>aid motion, or fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, be great enough, to become the cau<U+017F>e of the manife<U+017F>t abolition, or weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, of any action of our bodies, the party <U+017F>o affected, is <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>ick, or di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed: and as all di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es may be divided into acute, whereto are tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>hort continuance to be referred (though they are not u<U+017F>ually termed Acute, taking the word more <U+017F>trictly) and Chronical affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: or el<U+017F>e (which comes to the <U+017F>ame thing) they may properly enough be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, participating of heat, or of cold. The former of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready defined, to depend upon <U+017F>uch an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular fermentation of the blood, and Ma<U+017F>s of humors, wherein the <U+017F>ame are more violently moved, than is con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with health: of which kind are all continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and intermittent Fevers, all Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mo<U+017F>t Fluxes, and <U+017F>everal other di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: and contrariwi<U+017F>e, all Chronical, or cold affections, <U+017F>eem to depend upon <U+017F>uch an irregularity of the fore<U+017F>aid Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the humors are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

Now the method of u<U+017F>ing this Domicil, or Air-Chamber, in general, will be this, that where the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>eems to depend upon a deficient Fermentation of the humors, in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>e, the Patient (being put into the <U+017F>aid Chamber, and the door clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut) <U+017F>hall, by degrees, di<U+017F>charge the <U+017F>ame, or force the air out; till having con<U+017F>iderably alter'd the tone, and rarified what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, he <U+017F>till finds him<U+017F>elf to breath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at lea<U+017F>t with no great difficulty; at what time he may ob<U+017F>erve, how low the water is de<U+017F>cended in his Regi<U+017F>ter, or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gla<U+017F>s, which will <U+017F>hew him how far he may <U+017F>afely, at another time, di<U+017F>charge the air, without danger of Cramping; which u<U+017F>es to en<U+017F>ue, if the air be too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rarified. On the other <U+017F>ide, if the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be Acute, and <U+017F>eem to depend upon the too violent Fermentation of the humors, then it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary the Chamber be well charged with air, to what degree

And here we are principally to provide, that no difficulty of breathing en<U+017F>ue, which oftner happens in this practi<U+017F>e of conden<U+017F>ed, than attenuated air. Now the term of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients continuance in the Chamber, at one time, is to be defined in Chronical di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as well from his own occa<U+017F>ions, as other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances; and generally two, three, or more hours, may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>ufficient, and that e<U+017F>pecially in the morning, when the u<U+017F>e of other Remedies are found mo<U+017F>t conducible.

There may, I doubt not, <U+017F>everal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther con<U+017F>iderable conclu<U+017F>ions be performed, by means of this contrivance: As al<U+017F>o, that the thing it <U+017F>elf is very capable of good improvement, as to the projection of it, far beyond that de<U+017F>cribed by us. All which, together with what hath been already <U+017F>aid, and undertaken by us, on the behalf of it.

            <p n="13">13. Among the improvements which this contrivance of an Air-chamber is probably capable of, it is in my judgement none of the lea<U+017F>t that may be obtained, by joyning the practi<U+017F>e of S. <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Statica,</hi> to this of ours. For as the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tran<U+017F>piration by the habit of the body (than which, nothing conduces more to the pre<U+017F>ervation of health, and prevention of di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es) is one of the mo<U+017F>t

con<U+017F>iderable among tho<U+017F>e many benefits we promi<U+017F>e our <U+017F>elves by it: So, if we <U+017F>hall have, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> directs, a <hi>Statera Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in our Air-chamber, it will be of very great con<U+017F>equence, for a<U+017F>certaining the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical u<U+017F>e of it, whereby it will become le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to gue<U+017F>s or hazard. For as the Weather-gla<U+017F>s, before-mentioned, will di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, the degrees of rarity and den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity, introduced in the inclo<U+017F>ed air: So the Balance, will with the <U+017F>ame exactne<U+017F>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, at what rate this <hi>Diaphoretical</hi> tran<U+017F>piration, is either improved or abated: and at the <U+017F>ame time give us the true weight (in Ounces and Drachmes) of tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which continually pa<U+017F>s that way.

For, motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <U+017F>o much (as has been <U+017F>aid) to the exciting of all fermentation, (which is vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Syrups, and other juices of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <U+017F>haken, and as a proof of it, that Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Wine, is accounted the be<U+017F>t, that upon <U+017F>haking bubbles and works mo<U+017F>t) no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable continuance of this moderate, reciprocal motion of the Swing, do by degrees, (though not <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly as in the fore-mentioned in<U+017F>tances of Syrups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becau<U+017F>e the humors in our bodies lie not <U+017F>o loo<U+017F>ely as they, in Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of gla<U+017F>s or <U+017F>tone) produce the <U+017F>ame effect, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve without, in other liquors. Nor is the fermentation (or call it concoction) of the humors in their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, hereby only advanced: But likewi<U+017F>e the di<U+017F>tribution of the fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>econd ways, (if I may <U+017F>o call them) is very much promoted: For

<U+017F>till, as the body is carried forward, <U+017F>o of ten are the Abdominal Mu<U+017F>cles, gently and equally compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, whereby the chyle is the more nimbly pretended from the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines forward, to mingle with blood. And again, upon the rece<U+017F>s of the body, the Abdomen being le<U+017F>s compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, than if the body <U+017F>et <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>cituation, is more dilated than u<U+017F>ually, and con<U+017F>equently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the chyle flowing, more plentifully from the <U+017F>tomack into the Inte<U+017F>tines. So that, if it come fa<U+017F>ter into the guts, and be driven fa<U+017F>ter out, it mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity follow, that the di<U+017F>tribution thereof <U+017F>hall be more readily performed.
