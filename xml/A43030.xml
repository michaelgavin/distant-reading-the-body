         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>How can they, <hi>He</hi> gravely an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the Common-wealth is <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with inte<U+017F>tine troubles; and I my <U+017F>elf as yet far from land, to<U+017F>t in that tempe<U+017F>tuous Ocean?

            <p>Here I an<U+017F>wering, <U+017F>aid, <hi>Sir,</hi> I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>oon afford you the Rea<U+017F>on of that happy Event; which is this: While
<pb facs="tcp:56144:3"/>
the greate<U+017F>t number of men flatter them<U+017F>elves with thoughts of growing wi<U+017F>e, by the notions of others Brains, and (without any addition, unle<U+017F>s the deceitful Glo<U+017F>s of different Phra<U+017F>e, and new Method) with o<U+017F>tentation obtrude upon the World the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ancients; it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways your choice, about the <U+017F>ecrets of Nature, to con<U+017F>ult Nature Her <U+017F>elfe. And this kind of Study ever hath as le<U+017F>s of Fallacy, <U+017F>o more of Delight: in regard, that frequently, while you are fixt upon the indagation of <U+017F>ome one thing, many others offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves to your ob<U+017F>ervation; and <U+017F>uch, perhaps, of which you had no thought to enquire. For, your <U+017F>elf (I well remember) was plea<U+017F>ed once to tell me, that you never yet Di<U+017F><U+017F>ected any Animal (and, indeed, you have di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ected very many) but you found in it <U+017F>omewhat beyond your expectation, and which you never <U+017F>o much as thought of before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56144:4"/>
'Tis true, replied <hi>He;</hi> it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been the delight of my Genius, to make <U+017F>trict In<U+017F>pection into Animals them<U+017F>elves: And I have con<U+017F>tantly been of opinion, that from thence we might acquire not only the knowledge of tho<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderable Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but even a certain Adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Supreme E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, the Creator. And, though I was ever ready to acknowledge; that many things have been di<U+017F>covered by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men of former times: Yet do I <U+017F>till believe, that the number of tho<U+017F>e things which remain yet concealed in the darkne<U+017F>s of Imperve<U+017F>tigable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is incomparably greater: nay, I cannot forbear frequently to wonder, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>mile at tho<U+017F>e, who per<U+017F>wade them<U+017F>elves, that all things were <U+017F>o con<U+017F>ummatly and ab<U+017F>olutely delivered by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle, Galen,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other great Name, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left to the <U+017F>uperaddition of
<pb facs="tcp:56144:4"/>
any, that <U+017F>ucceeded. Nature, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is Her <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t faithful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Her own <U+017F>ecrets: and what <U+017F>he exhibits, either more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more ob<U+017F>curely, in one kind, the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>he explains more largely and openly, in another. No man doubtle<U+017F>s, hath ever rightly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of the U<U+017F>e, or Office of any Part; who hath not in many Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, beheld, and with him<U+017F>elf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently con<U+017F>idered the Fabrick, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, annexed Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and other Accidents thereof. Tho<U+017F>e Ancient Oracles of Wi<U+017F>dom did terminate the knowledge, as of all Countries, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o of all Animals, Plants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whatever, allmo<U+017F>t with the narrow limits of <hi>Greece</hi> alone: But, to Us the whole Theatre of the World is now open, and, by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Travellers, we well know, not only the Place, Habits, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of its Inhabitants; but al<U+017F>o,
<pb facs="tcp:56144:5"/>
what Animals, what Vegetables, what Minerals every Region is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed withal. Nor is there any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <U+017F>o Barbarous, which hath not either by chance, or the con<U+017F>traint of <U+017F>ome inevitable nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, found out <U+017F>omething for the common u<U+017F>e and benefit of Mankind, which hath e<U+017F>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the invention of other Nations more Civilized. And <U+017F>hal we think that nothing of Commodity can accrue to the <U+017F>tock of Sciences, from the<U+017F>e Helps and Advantages: but that all the Fountains of Wi<U+017F>dom were drawn dry by the Fir<U+017F>t Ages? Certainly, this Fault is to be imputed to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Indu<U+017F>try; not at all to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>To this, another <hi>Evil</hi> hath adjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it <U+017F>elf; which is, that many, wanting the Experimental cognition of things, from the formerly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved veri<U+017F>imilitude of <U+017F>ome Opinion, afterwards boldly broach a po<U+017F>itive
<pb facs="tcp:56144:5"/>
Judgment thereupon, as if it were certainly known: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they are not only gro<U+017F>sly deluded them<U+017F>elves, but <U+017F>educe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers al<U+017F>o (who are not <U+017F>ufficiently circum<U+017F>pect) into Error.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e, and other Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of the like importance; flowing from the <hi>Doctor,</hi> with admirable readine<U+017F>s, as is cu<U+017F>tomary with Him; I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Him, <U+017F>aying: <hi>Sir,</hi> How free you are from all culpability in this kind, all, who know you, <U+017F>ufficiently under<U+017F>tand: and that's the rea<U+017F>on, why many Learned and Judicious Men, who are acquainted with your Unwearied Indu<U+017F>try, in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Philo<U+017F>ophy, greedily expect the Communication of your further Experiments.</p>
            <p>And would you then advi<U+017F>e me, (<U+017F>milingly replies the <hi>Doctor)</hi> to quit the tranquillity of this Haven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I now calmly <U+017F>pend my days: and
<pb facs="tcp:56144:6"/>
again commit my <U+017F>elf to the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ocean? You are not ignorant, how great troubles my <hi>Lucubrations,</hi> formerly publi<U+017F>hed, have rai<U+017F>ed. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, certainly, at <U+017F>ome times, to endeavour to grow wi<U+017F>e at home in private; then by the ha<U+017F>ty divulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <U+017F>uch things, to the knowledge whereof you have attained with va<U+017F>t labour, to <U+017F>tirr up Tempe<U+017F>ts, that may deprive you of your Lea<U+017F>ure and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for the future.</p>
            <p>Yea but (an<U+017F>wered I) <hi>to de<U+017F>erve well, and receive ill, is the u<U+017F>uall reward of Virtue:</hi> And the Winds, which rai<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e your troubles, have, like the Wind <hi>Caecias,</hi> drawn mi<U+017F>chief upon them<U+017F>elves.

Having returned Him very many thanks for <U+017F>o high a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; I took my leave, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:56144:7"/>
as another <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> enriched with the Golden Fleece. And when, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my return home, I had <U+017F>urveyed the Book; I could not but admire that <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a Trea<U+017F>ure had laien <U+017F>o long concealed: And that, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men arrogate <U+017F>o highly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, onely for the entertainment of their nan<U+017F>eating Readers, with Trifles and Toies, and Di<U+017F>hes twice (yea, an hundred times) brought to the Table before; the Mode<U+017F>ty of this Gentleman <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch, as to <U+017F>et <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a value upon the<U+017F>e His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ob<U+017F>ervations. And truly, when ever He hath been plea<U+017F>ed to give any of his own Inventions leave to <U+017F>ee the light, He hath not depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Him<U+017F>elf with O<U+017F>tentation, or <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, after the cu<U+017F>tome of many, as if an Oak had <U+017F>poken, or he had de<U+017F>erved a draught of Hen's-Milk: but, <hi>His</hi> Dictates were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and Merits above the reach
<pb facs="tcp:56144:7"/>
of Elogie, or Reward: but, with exceeding Mode<U+017F>ty, as if onely ca<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or without any difficultie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t, he had fallen upon the Di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of tho<U+017F>e My<U+017F>teries, which, indeed, he long <U+017F>earched into with profe<U+017F>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and <U+017F>tudy indefatigable.</p>
            <p>And this al<U+017F>o is an Argument of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Candour in Him; that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inwades the reputation of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but every where delivers his own judgement, in mild and friendly language. For, with him it is Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial, <hi>that That Cau<U+017F>e is worthy to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected for <U+017F>carcely good and profitable, which its Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for with brawling and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:</hi> But <hi>Truth can want no Patron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when it was ea<U+017F>ie to him, to have woven this whole Web, from materials of his own; <U+017F>uch was his care, for the prevention of Envy, that he yet cho<U+017F>e to follow the clue of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle</hi> and <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> as if he

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince many have reque<U+017F>ted, and <U+017F>ome have importuned mee; it will not, I hope, be unwelcome, (candid Reader) if what I have ob<U+017F>erved concerning the <hi>Generation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> out of Anatomical di<U+017F><U+017F>ections (for I have found the whole matter to be much different, from that which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, either by Philo<U+017F>ophers or Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) I expo<U+017F>e in the<U+017F>e Exercitations, in favour, and for the u<U+017F>e of the Lovers of Truth.</p>
            <p>All Phy<U+017F>itians, following <hi>Galen,</hi> teach, that out of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> mingled in <hi>Coition,</hi> according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant power of <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> the Child re<U+017F>embles either <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that Parent,</hi> and is al<U+017F>o either <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female.</hi> And <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they pronounce the <hi>Males Seed</hi> to be the <hi>Efficient</hi> cau<U+017F>e, and the <hi>Females</hi> the <hi>Materiall;</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes again the clean contrary.</p>

But <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> (Natures mo<U+017F>t diligent <U+017F>earcher) affirms that the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> are the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> and that <hi><U+017F>he</hi> contributes the <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> the <hi>form;</hi> and that forthwith after Coition, there is formed in the Womb out of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truous bloud, the Vital principle, and fir<U+017F>t particle of the future <hi>Foetus,</hi> (namely, the Heart, in Creatures that have bloud.)</p>
            <p>But that the<U+017F>e are fal<U+017F>e, and ra<U+017F>h a<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will <U+017F>oon appear; and will like clouds in<U+017F>tantly vani<U+017F>h, (when the light of Anatomical di<U+017F><U+017F>ection breaks forth) nor will they require any elaborate confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Reader, in<U+017F>tructed by his own eyes, <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover the contrary by ocular in<U+017F>pection; and <U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand, how un<U+017F>afe, and degenerate a thing it is, to be tutored by other mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, without making tryal of the things them<U+017F>elves: e<U+017F>pecially, <U+017F>ince <hi>Natures Book</hi> is <U+017F>o <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>legible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore exhibited to publick view, what in the<U+017F>e my <hi>Exercitations,</hi> I intend to deliver concerning the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Animals;</hi> not onely that po<U+017F>terity may thence di<U+017F>cern the certain and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent truth; but al<U+017F>o, and that cheifly too, that (by revealing the Method I u<U+017F>e in <U+017F>earching into things) I might propo<U+017F>e to
<pb facs="tcp:56144:13"/>
<U+017F>tudious men, a new, and (if I mi<U+017F>take not) a <U+017F>urer path to the attainment of knowledge.</p>
            <p>For although it be a more new and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult way, to find out the nature of things, by the things them<U+017F>elves; then by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, to take our knowledge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tru<U+017F>t from the opinions of Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: yet mu<U+017F>t it needs be confe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed, that the former is much more open, and le<U+017F><U+017F>e frandulent, e<U+017F>pecially in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets relating to <hi>Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any rea<U+017F>on, why any man <U+017F>hould be deterred by the trouble of it; if he will but <U+017F>o much as con<U+017F>ider with him<U+017F>elfe, that even life it <U+017F>elfe is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, by the never Wearied Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart. Nor truly would this journy pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o much of <U+017F>olitude and de<U+017F>art to us; did not mo<U+017F>t men by the cu<U+017F>tome (or fault rather) of the age wee live in, yeilding them<U+017F>elves up to <U+017F>lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e, de<U+017F>ire rather to erre with the many, then with the expen<U+017F>e of their paines and coine, endeavour to be wi<U+017F>e with the few: when notwith<U+017F>tanding the <hi>Ancient Philo<U+017F>ophers</hi> (who<U+017F>e indu<U+017F>try al<U+017F>o even we extol) went a quite contrary way to work; and by indefatigable toile <U+017F>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after <U+017F>everal experiments, have <U+017F>et
<pb facs="tcp:56144:13"/>
up a clear light to direct our <U+017F>tudies. So that, whatever notable and approved thing we have in Philo<U+017F>ophy, it all is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto us by the paines and indu<U+017F>try of ancient <hi>Greece.</hi> Yet when we content our <U+017F>elves with their di<U+017F>coveries, and calmly believe (which is meer <U+017F>leepine<U+017F>s) that there is now no more place for new inventions, the <U+017F>pritely edge of our owne wit langui<U+017F>heth, and we extingui<U+017F>h the lamp which they lighted to our hands. And certainly he alone wil grant, that the whole truth was ingro<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, (who is ignorant of the many noble di<U+017F>coveries, to pa<U+017F>s by other <hi>Arts)</hi> lately found out in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <hi>Anatomy.</hi> And this was cheifly done either by <U+017F>uch, who wholly intent upon <U+017F>ome one thing, did ca<U+017F>ually de<U+017F>cry <U+017F>ome other: or (which is more commendable) by tho<U+017F>e, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Natures conduct with their own eyes, have at length through a perplexed, but yet a mo<U+017F>t faithful tract, attained to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of Truth. And in <U+017F>uch an undertaking it is plea<U+017F>ant, not to be tyred onely, but even to faint away; where the Irke<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of Di<U+017F>covering is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompen<U+017F>ed by the di<U+017F>covery it <U+017F>elfe.

               <p>THough there be one onely roade to Science, namely, that by which we proceed from things <hi>more known,</hi> to things <hi>known le<U+017F>s;</hi> and from that which is <hi>more manife<U+017F>t,</hi> to that which is <hi>more ob<U+017F>cure;</hi> and though <hi>Univer<U+017F>als</hi> are chiefly known to us (for Science is begot by rea<U+017F>oning

For the <U+017F>ame things are not both known to us, and <U+017F>imply <U+017F>o too: wherefore we of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity mu<U+017F>t thus proceed; to wit, from tho<U+017F>e things which are by nature indeed more ob<U+017F>cure, but yet are more clearer to us; to tho<U+017F>e things which are more cleare and intelligible by nature.

Therefore wee mu<U+017F>t goe from Vniver<U+017F>als to Singulars: for the Whole is more known by <U+017F>en<U+017F>e: now an Vniver<U+017F>al is a certain Whole.</hi> As that in his Analyticks. <hi>Singulars are more known by</hi>

And although that Ratiocination is naturally fir<U+017F>t and more known, which is made by Syllogi<U+017F>me; yet that is more con<U+017F>picuous to us, which is made by Induction: and therefore we define Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars with more ea<U+017F>e, then Univer<U+017F>als: for there lyes more Aequivocation in Vniver<U+017F>als.

               <p>That which we have now delivered, hangs very well together, though at fir<U+017F>t it <U+017F>eem to cla<U+017F>h: becau<U+017F>e <hi>Generals</hi> are fir<U+017F>t collected from <hi>Singulars</hi> by <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>e,</hi> and <U+017F>o farre onely are <hi>more known to us,</hi> as an <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niver<U+017F>al</hi> is a certain <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>indi<U+017F>tinct</hi> thing; and that <hi>Whole</hi> is <hi>more known to us</hi> according to <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>e.</hi> For though in all knowledge, we begin from <hi>Sen<U+017F>e,</hi> becau<U+017F>e, (as the Philo<U+017F>opher <U+017F>aid before) <hi>Sen<U+017F>ible</hi> particulars are <hi>mo<U+017F>t known to Sen<U+017F>e;</hi> yet <hi>Sen<U+017F>ation</hi> it <U+017F>elfe is an <hi>Univer<U+017F>al</hi> thing. For (if you minde it well) though (while we perceive) that which is in the outward organ of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e be a <hi>Singular,</hi> as <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, a yellow colour, in the <U+017F>ight: yet that which is thence <hi>ab<U+017F>tracted</hi> by the <hi>internall <U+017F>en<U+017F>e,</hi> and is judged and apprehended by it, is an <hi>Univer<U+017F>al.</hi> Hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons, do at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant, ab<U+017F>tract <hi>divers <U+017F>pecies,</hi> and fa<U+017F>hion <hi><U+017F>everall notions,</hi> even of <hi>one and the <U+017F>ame Object.</hi> As it is evident in <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> who, though at the <hi><U+017F>ame time,</hi> and in the <hi><U+017F>ame place,</hi> all circum<U+017F>tances being alike, they behold <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the <U+017F>ame Object,</hi> yet each of them, be they never <U+017F>o many, expre<U+017F>s and de<U+017F>cribe it a <hi><U+017F>everal way,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:56144:15"/>
to the <U+017F>everal <hi>Ideas</hi> which they have drawn in their <hi>Phan<U+017F>ie.</hi> So that a Painter being to draw any one mans pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, though he take a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>everal draughts, will make them all <hi>di<U+017F>tinct fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and them too not onely differing from each other, but from the Archetype it <U+017F>elfe: yet with <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>tinction, that if you look upon each of them apart, you will think hee <U+017F>till brings the <U+017F>ame piece hee brought before: and yet <U+017F>et them all together and compare them, and you will plainely di<U+017F>cover a difference. Now the rea<U+017F>on of all this is, that in <hi>Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,</hi> or the <hi>act of Seeing,</hi> each particular by it <U+017F>elfe was <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>di<U+017F>tinct:</hi> which very particular, the Object being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (as <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hut your eies,) ab<U+017F>tracted in the <hi>Phan<U+017F>ie,</hi> or laid up in the <hi>Memory,</hi> is pre<U+017F>ented <hi>ob<U+017F>cure,</hi> and <hi>confu<U+017F>ed:</hi> nor is it any longer apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>particular,</hi> but as <U+017F>ome <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Univer<U+017F>al thing.</hi>

                  <hi>whom my minde takes a repre<U+017F>entation, which <U+017F>he indeavoureth to pattern in her work. So then your face, which is my director, &amp; which I labour to repre<U+017F>ent, is the Idea.</hi> And a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, he <U+017F>aith. <hi>In my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e even now I made u<U+017F>e of a picture-drawer, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate what I was <U+017F>peaking of. He, when he would paint</hi> Virgil, <hi>his eye is upon</hi> Virgil <hi>him<U+017F>elf:</hi> Virgils <hi>face is his Idea, and the Exemplar of his future de<U+017F>igne: now that which the Arti<U+017F>t takes from this Idea, and worketh off, is the Picture. If you demand the difference between the<U+017F>e two, it is this: the one is the Pattern, the other is the copy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Pattern, and layed upon the work: He imitates the one, and makes the other. A Statue hath a face, but that face is but the</hi> Idos, <hi>or repre<U+017F>entation: But the Exemplar which the Statuary copies out, hath a face, and that face is the Idaea. Doe you de<U+017F>ire a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication? take it thus. The</hi> Idos <hi>is that which you <U+017F>ee in the piece: the Idea is quite without the piece, and not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but al<U+017F>o had a being before the piece was at all.</hi> For tho<U+017F>e things that have been formerly ob<U+017F>erved, and either by u<U+017F>e, or cu<U+017F>tome have taken deep root in the minde of the Artificer, doe con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute art it <U+017F>elfe, and the Operative Habit: for <hi>Art it <U+017F>elf is nothing but the rea<U+017F>on of the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore other creatures have phan<U+017F>ies, and memories, but have no title to experience. But Men have Arts, and Ratiocination.

For by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience men gain both Art and Science. For Experience begets Art</hi> (as <hi>Polus</hi> rightly notes) but Inexperience, Chance.</p>
               <p>By which he clearly <U+017F>hews, that no man <note place="margin">Apud.

For without that, we think onely, or beleive: and <U+017F>uch a knowledge as that, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted other mens, rather then our owne. Wherefore fond and erroneous is that Method of <U+017F>eeking truth, in u<U+017F>e in our times: while mo<U+017F>t men diligently inquire, not what the truth is, but what other men
<pb facs="tcp:56144:20"/>
<U+017F>ay it is: and inferring Univer<U+017F>al conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions from particular premi<U+017F><U+017F>es, &amp; thence <U+017F>haping to them<U+017F>elves irrational deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they tran<U+017F>mit to us things like truth, for truth it <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that Sophi<U+017F>ters and halfe-knowing men, polling other mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <U+017F>aucily impo<U+017F>e them upon us for their own; (<U+017F>hifting onely the phra<U+017F>e and order, and adding <U+017F>ome impertinencies of their own) and render Philo<U+017F>ophy (which ought to be clear and per<U+017F>picu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) ob<U+017F>cure, intricate, and confu<U+017F>ed.

retreat, we may be confident we have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the principles them<U+017F>elves: and then it will appear, out of what <hi>fir<U+017F>t mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by what <hi>efficient,</hi> and what <hi>proce<U+017F><U+017F>ion</hi> the <hi>pla<U+017F>tick power</hi> hath its original; and then al<U+017F>o what progre<U+017F>s Nature makes in this work. For both the fir<U+017F>t, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter matter, appears the clearer (being <U+017F>tripped naked as it were) by Negation; and what<U+017F>oever is fir<U+017F>t made in <hi>Generation,</hi> that is, as it were, the <hi>material cau<U+017F>e</hi> of that which <U+017F>ucceedeth.

               <p>In the <U+017F>ame manner, before a <hi>Hen</hi> or <hi>Cock</hi> came to perfection, (and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a perfect Animal, that can beget its like) there was a <hi>Chicken;</hi> before that <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> there is <U+017F>een in the egge an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or <hi>Foetus;</hi> and before that <hi>Embryo, Hieronymus Fabricius Aquapendens</hi> hath de<U+017F>cried the

For he ought to have told us what daily changes his own eyes had di<U+017F>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the egge, ere ever the <hi>Foetus</hi> came to perfection.

It was, I <U+017F>ay, befitting <U+017F>o much diligence, to have acquainted us from the allegation of his own <U+017F>ight, what things in the egge are made fir<U+017F>t, what la<U+017F>t, and what happen together: and not to have confined him<U+017F>elf to the example of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships, and Hou<U+017F>es, to render a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conjecture and per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion only, of the order, and manner of forming the parts.</p>
               <p>We therefore (according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propo<U+017F>ed) will explaine, fir<U+017F>t in an <hi>Egge,</hi> and afterwards in other <hi>Conceptions</hi>

               <p>Now this indeed we could not perform in all kind of <hi>Animals;</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of them cannot be gotten; and others again are <U+017F>o exceeding <U+017F>mall, that our eyes can hardly di<U+017F>cern them.</p>
               <p>Let it <U+017F>uffice therefore that we have done it in <U+017F>ome creatures, which are more known to us; to who<U+017F>e platform, the fir<U+017F>t originals of all other creatures may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.

in the perfecter, more di<U+017F>tinct; and in tho<U+017F>e that are in our own power, &amp; conver<U+017F>ant among<U+017F>t us, more obvious: <U+017F>o that we have liberty (at plea<U+017F>ure) by <U+017F>earching into them, to re<U+017F>cue our ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from wavering he<U+017F>itation. And of this <U+017F>ort, in the race of <hi>Oviparous</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are Hens, Gee<U+017F>e, Pigeons, Ducks Ei<U+017F>hes, Shel-fi<U+017F>h of both kinds (as Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters, Oy<U+017F>ters, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Fi<U+017F>hes that have no <U+017F>hells at all, Frogs, Serpents: al<U+017F>o Infects, as Bees, Wa<U+017F>pes, Butterflies, Silkworms.

               <p>Having thorough in<U+017F>ight &amp; knowledge of the<U+017F>e things, we may then contemplate the ab<U+017F>tru<U+017F>e nature of the <hi>Vegetative Soul;</hi> and di<U+017F>cern in all creatures what ever, the <hi>manner, order,</hi> and <hi>cau<U+017F>es of their Generation:</hi> becau<U+017F>e all other creatures agree either <hi>generically,</hi> or <hi><U+017F>pecifically</hi> with the fore-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at the lea<U+017F>t with <U+017F>ome of them; and are procreated after the <U+017F>ame manner of generation, or el<U+017F>e in a manner proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to it.

            <p>I return now to the <hi>Ovary,</hi> and the upper part of the wombe of the Henne; in which the fir<U+017F>t rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Eggs</hi> are conceived, which are (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle)</hi> <U+017F>mall at fir<U+017F>t, and white; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ing, afterwards become of a pale yellow.</p>
            <p>As for this <hi>upper womb</hi> mentioned by <hi>Fabricius,</hi> the truth is, there is no <U+017F>uch thing at all, till the <hi>Henne</hi> have conceived, and hath the principles of <hi>Eggs</hi> within her, which may then be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>clu<U+017F>ter</hi> of wheals. And therefore he <U+017F>aith very rightly: <hi>The <U+017F>uperiour matrix is nothing el<U+017F>e but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t an infinite crowd of yolks, which are ama<U+017F>sed in one heap together, being of a round figure, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e magnitude; among<U+017F>t which there is a like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the greate<U+017F>t to the lea<U+017F>t, as between a grane of mu<U+017F>tard-<U+017F>eed and a walnut, or a medlar. This mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of yolks are united and knit together as it were upon a bunch: and therefore I call it a Vitellary, or a bunch of yolks, becau<U+017F>e it much re<U+017F>embles a bunch of grapes.</hi> As <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid of fi<U+017F>hes that want <U+017F>cales, where he writes, <hi>That their eggs are laid as if they were glewed together like grapes; for as in a bunch of grapes, the berries are <U+017F>ome bigge<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome le<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ome lea<U+017F>t of all, and each is tyed to its proper <U+017F>prig, <U+017F>o is it in the Vitellary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in Fi<U+017F>hes, Frogs, hard or cru<U+017F>ted Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<U+017F>h, and Snails, the matter is much otherwi<U+017F>e; for they contain in them <hi>Eggs</hi> of the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which being di<U+017F>charged, do grow alike, are perfected alike, and at the <U+017F>ame time produce yong ones. But in the <hi>Ovary</hi> of a <hi>Henne,</hi> and almo<U+017F>t of all other Oviparous creatures, there is a di<U+017F>tinct increa<U+017F>e of the yolkes, from almo<U+017F>t an invi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s, till they arrive to a complete magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: though the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>Hennes</hi> (not unlike the

eggs of tho<U+017F>e creatures which conceive and lay their egges together) are hatched into <hi>chickens</hi> in the <U+017F>ame ne<U+017F>t, almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time. Yet in <hi>Pigeons</hi> (which lay, and hatch onely <hi>two egges</hi> at a time) I have ob<U+017F>erved all the <hi>Eggs</hi> in the <hi>Ovary</hi> to be of a like magnitude, excepting only tho<U+017F>e two which were greater then the re<U+017F>t, and were now ready to de<U+017F>cend into the <hi><U+017F>econd uterus, or womb;</hi> <U+017F>o that of them there is great increa<U+017F>e, not by the multitude of their young at once, but by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of their repeated births, which happen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moneth. So in cartilaginous Fi<U+017F>hes; as the Thorn-back, the Fork-fi<U+017F>h, the Dog-fi<U+017F>h, &amp;c. two eggs are only ripe at a time, and falling down on both <U+017F>ides from the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left horn,</hi> they are cheri<U+017F>hed in the <hi>lower womb,</hi> and exclude their young alive (as the <hi>Viviparous</hi> creatures do:) yet in their <hi>Ovary</hi> they have almo<U+017F>t an infinite number of <hi>eggs,</hi> and of different dimen<U+017F>ions; in the Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back I have numbered above a hundred.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Eggs</hi> of other <hi>oviparous</hi> creatures are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfected when they are out of the <hi>womb,</hi> as the <hi>eggs</hi> of <hi>fi<U+017F>hes;</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t concocted, as the <hi>eggs</hi> of <U+017F>nailes, of hard <U+017F>hell-fi<U+017F>h, and of <U+017F>piders.

            </p>
            <p>This opinion of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> did for a long time prevaile with me, till I di<U+017F>covered the contrary by infallible experience. For I take it as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured truth, that the <hi>Egee-<U+017F>hell</hi> is mo<U+017F>t commonly hard even in the womb it<U+017F>elf. And I once <U+017F>aw an <hi>egge</hi> cut out of a live <hi>Henne,</hi> which had no <hi><U+017F>hell</hi> at all, but yet was througly drenched and begin with a glewey moi<U+017F>ture: and yet the egge never hardned at all, by the congelation, or evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moi<U+017F>ture about the <hi>Skin,</hi> (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have it) nor was it any whit altered by the <hi>ambient cold aire,</hi> but continued the tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e which it had in the <hi>womb.</hi> I have al<U+017F>o <U+017F>een a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied egge,</hi> which had a compleat hard <U+017F>hell, over which was a ca<U+017F>e made of a cuticular <U+017F>oft <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,</hi> which <hi>membrane</hi> did never congeal. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I have <U+017F>een an egge exactly <U+017F>urrounded with a <hi>Shell,</hi> <U+017F>ave only on the very top of the <hi>acute end</hi> of the egg, where remained a <U+017F>mal <U+017F>oft ri<U+017F>ing, <U+017F>uch a one as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> perhaps conceived to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the <hi>Navel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> <U+017F>eemeth to me to be in an errour; for though I was never <U+017F>o good at <U+017F>light of Hand, to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e an egge in the very laying, and <U+017F>o make di<U+017F>covery whether it was <U+017F>oft or hard; yet this I confidently pronounce, that the <hi>Shell</hi> is compounded within the <hi>womb,</hi> of a <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance there at hand for the purpo<U+017F>e: and that it is framed in the <U+017F>ame manner as the other parts of the <hi>egge</hi> are, by the <hi>Pla<U+017F>tick faculty:</hi> and the rather, becau<U+017F>e I have <U+017F>een an exceeding <U+017F>mall <hi>egge, (Fabricius</hi> calleth it <hi>Ovum Centeninum,</hi> and our Women call it the <hi>Cocks egge)</hi> which had

               <hi>Shell</hi> of its own, and yet was contained within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other egge, greater, and fairer then it, which egge al<U+017F>o had a Shell too. And this <hi>Egge</hi> I <U+017F>hewed <hi>King Charles my mo<U+017F>t gracious Ma<U+017F>ter,</hi> in pre<U+017F>ence of many others. And that very year, cutting up a large <hi>Limon,</hi> I found another <U+017F>mall, but yet a perfect <hi>Limon</hi> in it, which had al<U+017F>o a yellow <hi>rind:</hi> Which thing is now frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> as I am informed.</p>
            <p>It is the u<U+017F>ual errour of the <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers</hi> of the<U+017F>e times, to <U+017F>eek the diver<U+017F>ity of the <hi>cau<U+017F>es</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> out of the diver<U+017F>ity of the <hi>matter,</hi> from whence they <U+017F>hould be framed. So <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians</hi> affirm, that the different parts of the body are fa<U+017F>hioned and nouri<U+017F>hed by the different <hi>materials</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> or <hi>Seed;</hi> namely the <hi><U+017F>ofter parts,</hi> as the <hi>Fle<U+017F>h,</hi> out of a thinner matter; and the <hi>more earthy parts,</hi> as the <hi>Bones,</hi> &amp;c. out of gro<U+017F><U+017F>e, and harder. But this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour now too much received, we have confuted in another Place. Nor are they le<U+017F><U+017F>e deceived, who make all things out of <hi>Atomes,</hi> as <hi>Democritus;</hi> or out of the <hi>Elements,</hi> as <hi>Empedocles.</hi> As if (for<U+017F>ooth) <hi>Generation</hi> were nothing in the world, but a meer Separation, or Collection, or Order of things. I do not indeed deny, but that to the Production of one thing out of another, the<U+017F>e fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things are requi<U+017F>ite: But <hi>Generation</hi> her <U+017F>elf is a thing quite di<U+017F>tinct from them all.

            <p>In the meane while the <hi>Chalazae</hi> or <U+017F>eed-pearls, do decline on each <U+017F>ide from the two ends of the egge, towards the <U+017F>ides: and this proceedeth from the <U+017F>hifted <U+017F>cituation of the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk.</hi> So that one of the <hi>Chalazae</hi> de<U+017F>cendeth <U+017F>omething from the <hi>obtu<U+017F>e angle,</hi> and the other a<U+017F>cendeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, from the <hi>Acute;</hi> as in an <hi>Oblique Sphere,</hi> by how much one <hi>Pole</hi> is elevated above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> by <U+017F>o much is the other depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>

And now the Yolk (e<U+017F>pecially about that part where the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> re<U+017F>ideth) doth begin to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve and melt a litle, and the proper coat thereof (which in <U+017F>taler egges is remi<U+017F>s, <U+017F>lack, and wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled) groweth <U+017F>mooth and full; the Yolk it <U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eemeth to have regained the <U+017F>ame colour, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and inoffen<U+017F>ive ta<U+017F>te, which it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, when the <hi>egge</hi> was new.</p>

His Argument by which he would maintain the <hi>Chalazae</hi> to be <hi>Semen Galli,</hi> is exceeding <U+017F>lender, and that is, <hi>becau<U+017F>e egges which are de<U+017F>titute of the<U+017F>e</hi> Chalazae, <hi>are not fruitfull.</hi> Hee is much in the right; for indeed they are not <hi>Eggs</hi> without them.

I did al<U+017F>o doubt at the <U+017F>ame time, whether this <hi>Rudiment</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> had its exi<U+017F>tence <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, as the <hi>coagulation</hi> of the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> together with the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Punctum <U+017F>aliens</hi> had theirs, but was then imperciptible by rea<U+017F>on of its thinne<U+017F>s, and clearne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; till congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a gro<U+017F><U+017F>er <hi>film,</hi> it put on a more <U+017F>olid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted <hi>whitene<U+017F>s,</hi> by which it might be di<U+017F>cerned: while yet the <hi>Blood</hi> which is thicker and <U+017F>hining might be well perceived in the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> which is <U+017F>o <hi>diaphanous.</hi> But while<U+017F>t I con<U+017F>ider the matter more narrowly, I am fully <U+017F>atisfied, that the <hi>Blood</hi> hath a <hi>being,</hi> before <hi>any other part</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> be<U+017F>ides, and is the elder brother to all other parts of the <hi>foetus;</hi> and that from it, both the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> is con<U+017F>tituted, as al<U+017F>o the <hi>aliment</hi> by which it is <U+017F>upplied, is de<U+017F>umed, and is (if any thing be) the fir<U+017F>t <hi>genital particle.</hi> But how I am induced to this per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>hall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards copiou<U+017F>ly recited, when we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>primitive fructifying Part,</hi> the <hi>Innate Heat,</hi> and <hi>Radical Moi<U+017F>ture;</hi> and when al<U+017F>o wee <U+017F>hall re<U+017F>olve what is to be thought concerning the <hi><U+017F>oule,</hi> out of many <hi>Ob<U+017F>ervations</hi> conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>About <hi>this time,</hi> almo<U+017F>t every hour, all things appear larger and clearer, and more di<U+017F>tinct, and unfolded; and now there comes a nimble <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and many things appear one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of another.

            <p>We may al<U+017F>o make a que<U+017F>tion concerning each particular, whether that which confers the Ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, be ingenerated, or comes from without? Namely, whether it be transferred from the Egge to the Chicken; from the Hen to the Egge, and from the Cock to the Hen. For it <U+017F>eemes to be a thing <hi>ex Traduce;</hi> namely, which is transferred from the Cock to the Hen; and from Her to the Egge, the Womb, and the Ovary: From the Seed to the Plant, and back again from the Plant to the Seed. For this is common to all things that are perpetuated by Generation; namely, that their fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>ult from Seed. Now the Seed, the Conception, and the Egge are all of one and the <U+017F>ame kinde, and that which renders the<U+017F>e Fruitful, is in all of them the <U+017F>ame thing, or <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a like nature; and that is <U+017F>ome divine thing, and hath an analogy to the Heavens, to Art, Intellect, and Providence.

            <p>But the matter is much otherwi<U+017F>e, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Egge.

Nor are the Parts of the Egge (namely the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> and the <hi>Liquors)</hi> procured by any kind of Coagulation; nor is there found any thing like Coagulated Milk, as is clear and evident out of what hath pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed.

found in the <hi>Egg</hi> far remote from the <hi>Chicken,</hi> and <U+017F>till entire, being then depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed from the two ends of the <hi>egg</hi> to the <U+017F>ides, and do execute (as he al<U+017F>o confe<U+017F><U+017F>es) the office of <hi>Ligaments,</hi> to keep the <hi>Yolk</hi> in its true po<U+017F>ition within the <hi>White.</hi> Nor is that true neither, which <hi>Fabricius</hi> addes to ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion; namely, that the <hi>Chalazae</hi> are <U+017F>eated directly under the <hi>Obtu<U+017F>e Angle</hi> of the <hi>Egge.</hi> For after the fir<U+017F>t days <hi>Incubation</hi> the <hi>Liquors</hi> <U+017F>hift their <U+017F>tations; the Yolk is exalted, and the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae</hi> are depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed from both ends, as hath been <U+017F>aid.</p>
            <p>He is al<U+017F>o deceived, when he <U+017F>aith that the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae</hi> are parts of the <hi>Egge:</hi> for in truth, the <hi>egge</hi> is con<U+017F>tituted onely by the Yolk, and the White; but the <hi>chalazae,</hi> as al<U+017F>o the <hi>membranes,</hi> are onely certain litle <hi>Appendixes</hi> of the <hi>White,</hi> and nothing el<U+017F>e but meerly the <hi>extremities</hi> of the <hi>membranes</hi> contorted and twi<U+017F>ted, (as filaments or <U+017F>trings are twi<U+017F>ted into a Rope) that <U+017F>o they may the better pre<U+017F>erve the <hi>Liquors</hi> in their proper places, by a firmer tye.</p>
            <p>And therefore his Inference is infirme, when he <U+017F>aith: <hi>The chalazae are found to be in that part of the egg where the chicken is made, and therefore the chicken is made out of them.</hi> For even according to <hi>Fabricius</hi> him<U+017F>elf, that can no wayes be: who confe<U+017F><U+017F>es, that the <hi>chalazae</hi> are to be found in the two extremities of the <hi>egg,</hi> and yet denies, that the <hi>chicken</hi> is any where made, but onely in the <hi>Obtu<U+017F>e end</hi> of it: in which end truly, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>etting out towards the Generation of the Chicken, there is no <hi>chalazae</hi> to be found at all.

            </p>
            <p>Now I have made many <hi>di<U+017F><U+017F>ections</hi> of the<U+017F>e <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles,</hi> and have <U+017F>een a pretty large <hi>Belly</hi> in them, and in that <hi>Belly Guts,</hi> and a <hi>Liver,</hi> and a <hi>Heart</hi> panting; and al<U+017F>o I have di<U+017F>covered their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> too. But that which <hi>Fabricius</hi> takes for their <hi>Head,</hi> is their round figure, from which they are called <hi>Gyrini;</hi> becau<U+017F>e their form or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in <hi>gyrum vertitur,</hi> curles into a round. They have al<U+017F>o a <hi>Taile</hi> by which they <U+017F>wim, but legs indeed they want.

Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the fir<U+017F>t divi<U+017F>ion of a Chicken into his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Spine,</hi> that any way re<U+017F>embles this; which <U+017F>hould any way induce us to believe that the Chicken is made out of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a <hi>Tadpole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed farther in the confutation of this <hi>matter,</hi> the worth of <hi>Fabricius</hi> (a man <U+017F>o exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well skilled in <hi>Anatomy)</hi> forbids: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any great need, <U+017F>ince the thing is <U+017F>o evident in our <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory.</hi> He at la<U+017F>t concludes, that this his opinion is wondrous old, and was on foot in <hi>Ari<U+017F>totles</hi> dayes.

            </p>
            <p>But neither of the<U+017F>e opinions is true: for that the <hi>Grandines,</hi> or <hi>Chalazae</hi> (the Italians call them <hi>Galladura,</hi> and our Country-men the <hi>Treddle)</hi> do either proceed from the Cock, or are his <hi><U+017F>eed,</hi> is a

            </p>
            <p>Now the fore-<U+017F>aid Error being granted by all, (for an infallible <hi>principle)</hi> it is no great wonder, if afterwards (according to every mans particular conjecture) many fal<U+017F>e opinions do creep in. For
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56144:132"/>
they are quite be<U+017F>ide their mark, who conceive that after <hi>coition</hi> <U+017F>ome kinde of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance or matter doth remain, fit and convenient for the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>foetus,</hi> or fir<U+017F>t <hi>conception;</hi> or that any thing el<U+017F>e is formed in the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>womb,</hi> which may be of like u<U+017F>e with the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> which is <U+017F>owen in the bowels of the earth.

            <p>And therefore it is clear that <hi>Fabricius</hi> is out, when he <U+017F>aith, <hi>As a Viviparous animal is incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a litle quantity of <U+017F>eminal matter, but that which</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this therefore <U+017F>eemed an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Fabricius; Since there are three onely parts in the Egge; namely, the White, the Yolk, and the</hi> Chalazae: <hi>and the two fir<U+017F>t do only admini<U+017F>ter nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Chicken; it mu<U+017F>t needs be that the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae <hi>only are the matter, out of which the Chicken is con<U+017F>tituted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then it fell out, that this able <hi>Anatomi<U+017F>t</hi> (while he <U+017F>ought in the <hi>Egge</hi> <U+017F>ome convenient <hi>matter,</hi> out of which to con<U+017F>titute the <hi>Chicken)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

benighted by a vulgar Here<U+017F>ie, lo<U+017F>t his way. And this inconvenience doth likewi<U+017F>e befall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men more, who for<U+017F>aking that light, which the frequent <hi>di<U+017F><U+017F>ection</hi> of bodies, and the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e with <hi>Natures</hi> <U+017F>elfe would help them to, doe yet per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t to make di<U+017F>coveries out of their owne conjectures, or <U+017F>ome conceived probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the Authority of former Writers; when they them<U+017F>elves ought to look into the matter, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to it by their own <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. No wonder therefore that infinite errours, which were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over by common con<U+017F>ent from the fir<U+017F>t dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antiquity, are handed down even to our times: and that <U+017F>o by that means, men otherwi<U+017F>e very ingenious, are egregiou<U+017F>ly deluded; becau<U+017F>e they conceive it plentifull <U+017F>atisfaction of minde to them, that they finde it in Books, and have their memories well loaded with <U+017F>age <U+017F>entences.

            <p>To conclude therefore, there is in an <hi>Egge</hi> (as we have often <U+017F>aid) no di<U+017F>tinct part, or di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed matter, out of which the <hi>foetus</hi> may be formed and fa<U+017F>hioned: but as in the <hi><U+017F>eeds</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> there is a litle point or budding <U+017F>hot out; <U+017F>o is there in an <hi>Egge,</hi> a <U+017F>mall <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> or <hi>Macula,</hi> which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pired with <hi>pla<U+017F>tical</hi> endowments, enlarges it <U+017F>elf into the <hi>Oculus</hi> or <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> out of which, and in which, the <hi>primordia</hi> of the Chicken (namely the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Punctum <U+017F>aliens)</hi> are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nouri<U+017F>hed, and augmented, till they become a complete Chicken.

The Fir<U+017F>t is, when one thing is made of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is pre-exi<U+017F>tent; and thus a <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead</hi> is made out of <hi>Timber,</hi> and a <hi>Statue</hi> out of a <hi>Rock,</hi> where the whole <hi>Matter</hi> of the future fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick was exi<U+017F>tent and in being, before it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent <U+017F>hape, or any tittle of the de<U+017F>ign begun.

            <p>SInce I have propo<U+017F>ed <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> the chiefe<U+017F>t of the old <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers,</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> an eminent <hi>Anatomi<U+017F>t</hi> among<U+017F>t the Modern, to be my Leaders, that from them I might chiefly be enlightened concerning the <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and <U+017F>ince I cannot better my <U+017F>elf by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle,</hi> I have re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>et upon <hi>Fabricius,</hi> to <U+017F>ee what account he can give of it.</p>
            <p>Now he attempts to give re<U+017F>olution to three doubts ari<U+017F>ing in the ca<U+017F>e: namely, Fir<U+017F>t, What is the <hi>Efficient</hi> of the <hi>Chicken?</hi> and that he concludes to be the <hi>Males <U+017F>eed.</hi> 2. How this appears in the egg to be <U+017F>o, and by what means the Cocks <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> doth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56144:145"/>
rinder the <hi>egge fertile?</hi> La<U+017F>tly, In what Order are the parts of the <hi>Chicken</hi> procreated?</p>
            <p>As for the fir<U+017F>t, it appears out of our <hi>Ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that the <hi>Cock</hi> and his <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> are indeed the <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cau<U+017F>e</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> but not the <hi>adaequate cau<U+017F>e;</hi> but that the <hi>Henne</hi> al<U+017F>o comes in for a <U+017F>hare.</p>
            <p>In this place therefore we mu<U+017F>t chiefly enquire, how the <hi>Cocks <U+017F>eed</hi> doth fructifie the <hi>Egge,</hi> and rai<U+017F>e a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of it, which would el<U+017F>e be <hi><U+017F>ubventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> and <hi>improlifical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us give ear to <hi>Fabricius: Tho<U+017F>e creatures,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 38.</note> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>that are produced out of an egge, are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from tho<U+017F>e which are born out of <U+017F>eed; in this, that Oviparous creatures have a matter, out of which the Chicken is corporated, di<U+017F>tinct and <U+017F>eparate from the Agent: but Viviparous creatures have both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and efficient cau<U+017F>e adjoyned, and concorporated together. For the Agent in Oviparous creatures, is the <U+017F>eed of the Cock in the feathered kind, which neither is, nor can be in the Egge: but the matter out of which the Chicken is corporated, is the</hi> Chalaza. <hi>The<U+017F>e two are much di<U+017F>tant one from another; for the</hi> Chalaza <hi>is in the Yolk now formed, and fallen into the <U+017F>econd</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, <hi>and is adjoyned intimately to the egge: on the contrary, the Cocks <U+017F>eed remains neer the fundament, and is removed from the</hi> Chalaza <hi>by a large cha<U+017F>me, and yet by its irradiating faculty it fructifies both the</hi> Uterus, <hi>and all the egge. But in a Viviparous animal, the <U+017F>eed is both the Matter, and the Efficient too, both being contracted into one body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He <U+017F>eems to have introduced this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Oviparous</hi> and <hi>Viviparous Animals;</hi> that <U+017F>o he might countenance the opinion of <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians</hi> concerning the <hi>Generation of Man,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t not <U+017F>ubvert it; who conceive that the <hi><U+017F>eeds</hi> of both
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56144:146"/>
               <hi>Sexes,</hi> ejected together in <hi>coition</hi> are mingled, and according as the one prevailes over the other, <U+017F>o the one approves it <U+017F>elf the <hi>Efficient,</hi> and the other <U+017F>ubmits it <U+017F>elf to become the <hi>Matter;</hi> <U+017F>o that they both con<U+017F>piring together, do con<U+017F>titute the <hi>conception</hi> in <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he had ob<U+017F>erved, that neither <hi>Seed</hi> nor <hi>Blood</hi> is attracted by means of <hi>coition</hi> into the <hi>womb</hi> of the <hi>Hen,</hi> nor contained there, and could not believe, that any thing emitted from the <hi>cock</hi> in <hi>coition,</hi> could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly arrive <U+017F>o farre, nor could finde any thing in the <hi>Egge,</hi> that is adjoined to the <hi>males <U+017F>eed,</hi> he was enforced to doubt, how the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> (which is no where pre<U+017F>ent with, nor mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t the <hi>feminine geniture,</hi> nor is adjoined to it, nor doth <U+017F>o much as touch it at all) <U+017F>hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titute the <hi>Chicken,</hi> or fructifie the <hi>Egge?</hi> e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he had before delivered, that from <U+017F>ome premi<U+017F>ed <hi>coitions,</hi> all the <hi>eggs</hi> that were to be layed that year, were made <hi>prolifical.</hi> For how could it chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>eem impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that from the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> of the <hi>cock</hi> received in the <hi>Spring</hi> (but now departed, lo<U+017F>t, and con<U+017F>umed) the po<U+017F>thume <hi>eggs</hi> (layed po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Autumne)</hi> <U+017F>hould be rendered <hi>fruitfull,</hi> and produce <hi>chickens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he might rid his hands of this grand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, he coined the fore-<U+017F>aid di<U+017F>tinction; and to ratifie his opinion, he adds three farther A<U+017F><U+017F>erti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Fir<U+017F>t, that though the <hi>cocks <U+017F>eed</hi> were neither in the Egge, nor at any time in the Womb, nor adjoined to the <hi>material cau<U+017F>e,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals)</hi> yet it continues for a whole year in the <hi>hen.</hi> Secondly, to re<U+017F>erve this <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> in, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a dark perforation, neer the door of the Womb, wherein the <hi>cock</hi> <U+017F>hould depo<U+017F>ite his <hi><U+017F>eed,</hi> and in which (as in a <hi>pouch)</hi> it <U+017F>hould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56144:146"/>
that thence all the <hi>eggs</hi> might receive their fertility. La<U+017F>tly, though the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> in that <hi>pouch,</hi> neither touch the <hi>womb,</hi> the <hi>egge,</hi> nor the <hi>Ovary,</hi> that by that means it might fructifie the <hi>egge,</hi> or rai<U+017F>e a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of it; yet, he <U+017F>aith, that it gains addre<U+017F><U+017F>es into the very <hi>egge,</hi> by the in<U+017F>inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or irradiation of a certain <U+017F>piritual <hi><U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance</hi> in it, and by tho<U+017F>e arts doth fructifie the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> and <U+017F>o model a <hi>Chicken.</hi> And yet by that a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion lie <U+017F>eems to confirme <hi>Ari<U+017F>totles</hi> opinion (who a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures us that the <hi>female</hi> contributes the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>male</hi> the <hi>efficiency</hi> to <hi>generation)</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians</hi> po<U+017F>ition concerning the commixture of <U+017F>eeds: for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake he <U+017F>eems to have introduced his fore-<U+017F>aid di<U+017F>tinction between <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi> And that this his opinion may <U+017F>eem more probable, he recites what changes and alterations the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> re<U+017F>erved in the <hi>Te<U+017F>ticles</hi> and <hi><U+017F>eminary Ve<U+017F>icles,</hi> not yet emitted, doth procure in <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to take no notice that all this makes litle to his purpo<U+017F>e: (for the que<U+017F>tion in chief is not, How the <hi>Cocks <U+017F>eed</hi> doth render the <hi>egge</hi> fertile? but rather, How it doth frame and erect a <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge?)</hi> all tho<U+017F>e things which he hath conjured up to guard his opinion, <U+017F>eem for the mo<U+017F>t part fal<U+017F>e, or very <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious; as appears by our Ob<U+017F>ervations delivered in this <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that blinde perforation in the root of the <hi>rump</hi> (which he calls the <hi>pur<U+017F>e,</hi> or <hi>pouch)</hi> de<U+017F>tined to cubbard up the <hi>Cocks <U+017F>eed,</hi> nor is there (as we have <U+017F>aid) any <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> at all found in it: but it is an empty unprovided thing both in the <hi>Cock,</hi> and <hi>Henne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what he would have by his <hi><U+017F>piritual</hi> <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, and irradiation, he is yet to acquaint us, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56144:147"/>
al<U+017F>o what <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance hee under<U+017F>tands that to be, which he affirms, doth by its virtue vivifie the <hi>egg,</hi> Whether a <hi>corporeal,</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which <U+017F>hould proceed from the irradiation of the <hi><U+017F>eed,</hi> (which lies at roo<U+017F>t in the <hi>pouch)</hi> and (which is chiefly required) <U+017F>hould fa<U+017F>hion the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>egge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, in my minde, he <U+017F>aith no more in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance then this: <hi>It makes the Chicken, becau<U+017F>e it irradiates the Egge; and forms it, becau<U+017F>e it vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it:</hi> and <U+017F>o he labours to reveal and illu<U+017F>trate the ob<U+017F>cure manner of formation, by one more ob<U+017F>cure then it <U+017F>elf. For the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>cruple returns entire; namely, how the <hi>Cocks <U+017F>eed,</hi> a meer <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent,</hi> an <hi>external efficient,</hi> and disjoyned by place, remaining in the <hi>pouch,</hi> can fa<U+017F>hion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour parts (that is, the <hi>Heart, Liver, Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> &amp;c.) in the <hi>egge</hi> out of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> by <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation?</hi> Unle<U+017F>s he will have it <U+017F>itting in its chair of State, like the Creator of all, only by this word of comman, <hi>Fiant,</hi> Let all things be <U+017F>o; (namely the <hi>Bones</hi> for <hi>Support,</hi> the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> for <hi>Motion,</hi> the <hi>Organs</hi> for <hi>Sen<U+017F>e;</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> for <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Intrals</hi> for <hi>Concoction,</hi> and the like) and <U+017F>o order, and by its beams or influence con<U+017F>titute all things to their proper end, with providence, wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and art. For neither doth <hi>Fabricius</hi> expound the manner, nor yet demon<U+017F>trate the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> to be of <U+017F>uch force and virtue, that (without coming neer) it can effect all this; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince an <hi>egge</hi> can, by <hi>Incubation</hi> of a <U+017F>tranger fowle, or any other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tering warmth; as in <hi>dung,</hi> in a <hi>matt,</hi> or an <hi>oven,</hi> though never <U+017F>o remote from the <hi>pouch</hi> of its own <hi>mother-hen,</hi> be quickened, and produce a <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ame difficulty therefore lyes <U+017F>till upon our hands; namely, How the <hi>Cocks <U+017F>eed</hi> is the <hi>Efficient</hi>

               <hi>cau<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>Chicken?</hi> nor is it any whit <U+017F>alved by the influence of this <U+017F>piritual <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. For though we <U+017F>hould grant, that the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> is re<U+017F>erved in the <hi>pur<U+017F>e,</hi> and that by a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is,</hi> and <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,</hi> it did corporate the <hi>chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazae:</hi> yet the <U+017F>cruple would <U+017F>tick no le<U+017F>s by us; namely, How the <hi>Intrals</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> are model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the<U+017F>e things are long <U+017F>ince confuted by us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, when we are in que<U+017F>t of the <hi>efficient cau<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>Chicken,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t look for it in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and not dormant in a <hi>pouch;</hi> and for <U+017F>uch a one, which, though the <hi>egg</hi> now grown <U+017F>tale, were di<U+017F>tant many miles from the <hi>Hen,</hi> and laid under an other <hi>Hen</hi> (as a <hi>Turkey-hen,</hi> or <hi>African-hen)</hi> to be hatched; or (as in <hi>Aegypt)</hi> under warm <hi><U+017F>and,</hi> or <hi>dung,</hi> or in an <hi>Oven</hi> proper for the purpo<U+017F>e, would <U+017F>till rai<U+017F>e up a <hi>chicken,</hi> of the <U+017F>ame <hi><U+017F>pecies,</hi> and very like the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen</hi> that were its <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parents;</hi> or el<U+017F>e (in ca<U+017F>e the <hi>Cock</hi> were of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinde) a mungrel of-<U+017F>pring, of a mixt <hi><U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and re<U+017F>emblance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the knot remains to be united, which neither <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> nor <hi>Fabricius</hi> have loo<U+017F>ened; namely, How the <U+017F>eed of the <hi>Male,</hi> or Cock, doth produce the <hi>chicken</hi> out of the egge, or is to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Efficient cau<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>chicken,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially, <U+017F>ince it is neither pre<U+017F>ent, tangent, nor adjoined to the <hi>Egge?</hi> And though almo<U+017F>t all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Male,</hi> and its <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> are the <hi>Efficient cau<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> no man yet hath <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared, how it can be done, e<U+017F>pecially in our <hi>Hen-egg.</hi>

that the <hi>foetus,</hi> or any part of it is formed of the <U+017F>eed <U+017F>o entertained by the <hi>womb,</hi> or ca<U+017F>t into it: or, that the <hi><U+017F>eed</hi> of the <hi>Cock</hi> (as an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cau<U+017F>e,</hi> or <hi>Operatour)</hi> is any where re<U+017F>erved in the <hi>Hen,</hi> which (as he conceives) draws <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>nutriment</hi> from her into the <hi>Womb,</hi> to <hi><U+017F>upport</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> which it hath made.

            <p>He mi<U+017F>carries likewi<U+017F>e, when he goes about to illu<U+017F>trate his opinion concerning the <hi>Animal <U+017F>eed,</hi> by allu<U+017F>ion to that of <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Ma<U+017F>t:</hi> becau<U+017F>e he did not under<U+017F>tand the difference alledged by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> between the <hi>Geniture</hi> proceedings by <hi>coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the fir<U+017F>t conception made out of both Sexes; nor did ob<U+017F>erve that an egge might be fir<U+017F>t conceived in the <hi>Clu<U+017F>ter</hi> of the <hi>Vitellary</hi> (without the tran<U+017F>lation of any <hi>Geniture</hi> from Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male into the <hi>Uterus.)</hi> Nor did he apprehend that the <hi>Uterus,</hi> even for <U+017F>ome time after <hi>Coition,</hi> is quite void of any <hi>matter</hi> at all, either tran<U+017F>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Parents,</hi> or made by <hi>Coition,</hi> or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ioned

            <p>This is agreed upon by univer<U+017F>al con<U+017F>ent; that all <hi>Animals</hi> what<U+017F>oever, which ari<U+017F>e from Male and Female, are generated by the <hi>coition</hi> of both Sexes; and <U+017F>o begotten as it were <hi>per contagium aliquod,</hi> by a kind of <hi>contagion.</hi> In like manner as <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians</hi> ob<U+017F>erve, that contagious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es (as the <hi>Lepro<U+017F>ie,</hi> the <hi>Pox,</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Pthi<U+017F>ick)</hi> do propagate their infection, and beget them<U+017F>elves in bodies yet <U+017F>ound and untoucht, meerly by an <hi>extrin<U+017F>ecal contact;</hi> nay <U+017F>ometimes onely by the <hi>breath,</hi> and <hi>per</hi>

The cau<U+017F>e therefore of the continuity is the motion of the Univer<U+017F>e, but the declivity it <U+017F>elfe is the cau<U+017F>e of the Approach, and the Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es.

And when the Interval is inequal, the motion mu<U+017F>t be inequal too. If then he therefore generate becau<U+017F>e he approaches neerer: and cau<U+017F>e corruption, becau<U+017F>e he remotes and recedeth farther from the earth: Then it follows that if he often do generate, it is becau<U+017F>e he often approacheth: and if he often cau<U+017F>e corruption, it is becau<U+017F>e he often recedeth.

And this is manife<U+017F>t by many Ob<U+017F>ervations; but chiefly, in that <U+017F>ome <hi>living creatures</hi> (and <U+017F>uch too as have <hi>blood)</hi> live a good while without any <hi>pul<U+017F>e</hi> at all; and <U+017F>ome become like <hi>Anchorites</hi> all the <hi>Winter</hi> long, and yet <U+017F>urvive, though their <hi>Hearts</hi> within them do re<U+017F>pite all their <hi>motions,</hi> and their <hi>Lungs</hi> make <hi>Holy-day,</hi> and forbear <hi>re<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> like tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons, who in a <hi>Syncope, Lipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymia,</hi> or <hi>Hy<U+017F>terical pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions,</hi> lie half-dead without the motion of the Pul<U+017F>e.</p>

            <p>But if the <hi>blood</hi> were naturally de<U+017F>igned onely to the nouri<U+017F>hing of the <hi>body,</hi> it would be onely of a <U+017F>imilar con<U+017F>titution; like the <hi>Chyle,</hi> or <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>egge;</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t it would be a mixt body, being compounded of the fore<U+017F>aid <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>juyces,</hi>

            <p>Al<U+017F>o in <hi>breathing a Veine,</hi> this <U+017F>ort of <hi>blood</hi> (where of there is plenty in per<U+017F>ons of a <hi>hot tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,</hi> that are <U+017F>trong and fle<U+017F>hy) it <hi>darts</hi> it <U+017F>elf out in a longer <U+017F>tream, and more vehemency (as if it <U+017F>pirted out of a Syringe) &amp; hereupon we count it <hi>hotter,</hi> and more <hi><U+017F>pirital:</hi> as that <hi>geniture</hi> is counted mo<U+017F>t fertile &amp; fraught with <hi><U+017F>pirits,</hi> which leaps farthe<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t forcibly.</p>
            <p>And that this <hi>gelly</hi> doth much differ from that <hi>ichorous</hi> and <hi>watry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance,</hi> which (as being colder then the re<U+017F>t) <U+017F>inketh down to the bottom of the <hi><U+017F>awcer,</hi> is evident for two rea<U+017F>ons: for the <hi>watry</hi> and <hi>wa<U+017F>hy</hi> part is more crude and inconcocted, then that it may be wrought up into perfect <hi>blood.</hi> But the <hi>gelly,</hi> which is thicker and more <hi>fibrous,</hi> <U+017F>wimming above the <hi>lump</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> appeareth more concocted and elaborate then it.

The <hi>Yolk</hi> doth not remain entire after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ummation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> for a portion of it is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved in the fir<U+017F>t <hi>conformation</hi> of the Chicken; and it likewi<U+017F>e doth admit the <hi>propagations</hi> of the <hi>Veines</hi> (as well as the <hi>White)</hi> by which after it is now prepared, it becomes the Nutriment of the <hi>Foetus:</hi> yet certain it is, that the greate<U+017F>t part of it doth <U+017F>urvive the wa<U+017F>ted <hi>white,</hi> and that <U+017F>urviving <hi>part</hi> is entertained into the <hi>belly</hi> of the <hi>Chicken;</hi> and being attracted by the <hi><U+017F>mall branches</hi> of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> is at la<U+017F>t conveyed into the <hi>Liver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore a clear ca<U+017F>e, that the Chicken newly <hi>hatched,</hi> (while it is yet weak and tender) is nouri<U+017F>hed by the <hi>yolk.</hi> And as while he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the <hi>Egge,</hi> he was partly fed by the <hi>yolke,</hi> and partly by the <hi>whites,</hi> but chiefly by the ho<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the <hi>whites,</hi> which as they are in greater quantity, <U+017F>o are they <U+017F>ooner exhau<U+017F>ted: <U+017F>o in like manner, when he is now <hi>hatched,</hi> (at which time all his <hi>aliment</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through his <hi>Liver,</hi> and there receives a farther preparation) he is nouri<U+017F>hed partly by the <hi>yolk</hi> attracted from the Guts, and partly by the <hi>Chyle,</hi> which the <U+017F>everal propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Me<U+017F>eraick Veines</hi> <U+017F>uck into them<U+017F>elves; when there is in the <hi>yolk</hi> onely one propagation of the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> di<U+017F>tributed into it, and a litle onely of the <hi>yolk</hi> remaining. For <hi>Nature,</hi> as <hi>Nur<U+017F>es,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to wean their <hi>Infants</hi> by degrees, gives them other meats <U+017F>ometimes, that <U+017F>o they may the better endure the decay of the <hi>milk:</hi> <U+017F>o the <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> is trained by degrees, from <hi>meat</hi> of <hi>ea<U+017F>ier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi> to <hi>harder</hi> (as from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> to the <hi>Chyle.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore what we <U+017F>ee of the <hi>propagation</hi> of the <hi>Veines</hi> in the <hi>Egge,</hi> is done upon exceeding good grounds. For as <U+017F>oon as the <hi>Chicken</hi> begins fir<U+017F>t to be modelled, the <hi>Veines</hi> are then extended only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56144:172"/>
the <hi>Colliquamentum;</hi> by which the <hi>blood</hi> being fed and grown, adjoyns the re<U+017F>t of the <hi>body</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, to be brought up with him. Afterwards, the veines reach into the thinner <hi>white,</hi> from whence the Chicken receiveth his <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance, (while he yet re<U+017F>embleth a <hi>Gelly,</hi> or <hi>Mucilage,</hi> and a <hi>Maggot)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they <U+017F>pread into the <hi>thicker White,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non into the <hi>Yolk,</hi> that by that al<U+017F>o it may be entertained; and being as yet but tender, it is fed in part by the <hi>yolk</hi> (as by <hi>milke)</hi> hoarded up in the <hi>abdomen,</hi> and in part by <hi>food</hi> provided and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Hen,</hi> till it be able to <U+017F>eek abroad for nouri<U+017F>hment convenient, and can dige<U+017F>t it. So that through the whole <hi><U+017F>eries</hi> of Generation, <hi>Nature</hi> hath mo<U+017F>t prudently con<U+017F>idered of various Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proportionable to the various abilities of the <hi>Dige<U+017F>tive faculty</hi> of the future <hi>Foetus.</hi> For while it is yet <hi>feeble,</hi> <U+017F>he hath provided it milder diet, and <U+017F>olider meats for its <hi><U+017F>tronger</hi> capacity: and when it is now <hi>hearty</hi> enough, and can away with cour<U+017F>er cates, it is <U+017F>erved with commons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>werable to it.

As in party-coloured eggs, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal a<U+017F><U+017F>umes the Rudiments of its generation from the White, (for the animals beginning is in the hot part) and its aliment from the yolk. Therefore in hotter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, tho<U+017F>e two are re<U+017F>erved apart; namely, that from whence they take the beginning of their being, and that</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:56144:173"/>
               <hi>from whence they derive their aliment, and one of them is white, and the other yellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeares by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that the <hi>Chicken</hi> (and the <U+017F>ame thing <U+017F>hall afterwards be demon<U+017F>trated of all <hi>conceptions)</hi> as he re<U+017F>ults, or is framed from the <hi>implanted principle,</hi> or <hi><U+017F>oul</hi> of the <hi>egge,</hi> <U+017F>o he al<U+017F>o obtaines his nouri<U+017F>hment from the <hi>Egge</hi> too: wherefore he hath no need of a <hi>mother,</hi> as the <hi>Plants</hi> have of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is no truer of him, that he is <hi>nouri<U+017F>hed</hi> by his <hi>mothers blood,</hi> or <hi>lives</hi> by her <hi><U+017F>pirits;</hi> and <U+017F>o his own <hi>heart</hi> lies fallow and idle the while, then that he <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>perceives</hi> by his <hi>mothers organs,</hi> or is enlivened and takes growth from her <hi><U+017F>oul.</hi> But the ca<U+017F>e is plain, and all men acknowledge, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is fed by the <hi>Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els;</hi> and that the <hi>Venal branches</hi> di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated into the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Yolk,</hi> do hence derive <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance, which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewi<U+017F>e clear, that when the <hi>Chicken</hi> is now <hi>hatcht,</hi> or <hi>excluded,</hi> he is <U+017F>upplyed with provi<U+017F>ions, partly from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Chyle;</hi> and that they both pa<U+017F>s into the <hi>Liver</hi> by the <U+017F>ame <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> though by <U+017F>everal <hi>branches</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is al<U+017F>o clear, (to <U+017F>peak by the way) that the <hi>Chyle</hi> which nouri<U+017F>heth all <hi>living creatures,</hi> is tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the <hi>Me<U+017F>eraick Veins</hi> out of the <hi>Guts;</hi> and that there is no need to <U+017F>earch out new wayes (namely the <hi>Venae Lacteae)</hi> or to fan<U+017F>ie any other pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in <hi>grown bodies,</hi> be<U+017F>ides what we finde in the <hi>Egge</hi> and <hi>Chicken.</hi> But as for the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of that invention, we <U+017F>hall el<U+017F>ewhere di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that where<U+017F>oever the <hi>veines</hi> (and under that name the <hi>Arteries</hi> al<U+017F>o are here comprehended) do arrive to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Yolk,</hi> tho<U+017F>e parts <U+017F>eem to be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved, and put on a different look or appearance from the re<U+017F>t.

               <hi>The fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e Faculties, which is the Immutative or Alterative faculty, is wholly natural, and doth act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge at all; and taking to it <U+017F>elf, the hot, the cold, the moi<U+017F>t, and the dry parts, it alters the whole <U+017F>ubance of the</hi> Chalaza <hi>throughout, and by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, it doth change it into the parts of the Chicken; that is to <U+017F>ay, into Fle<U+017F>h, Bones, Gri<U+017F>tles, Ligaments, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, and into all the other <U+017F>imilar and <U+017F>imple parts of the Animal, or Chicken: and the Cocks <U+017F>eed doth by its proper ingenit heat and <U+017F>pirit, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, create, and produce them out of the Egge (that is, the</hi> Chalaza) <hi>by Alteration and Commutation; imparting to every one of them its proper <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and the proprieties belonging to that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. The Other faculty which is called Formative, and which makes the <U+017F>imilar parts di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar (be<U+017F>towing their beauty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, from convenient figure, ju<U+017F>t dimen<U+017F>ion, proper <U+017F>cite, and competent number) being much more noble then the former, and full of incomparable wi<U+017F>dom, doth not act Naturally, but by Election or Choice, Knowledg, and Under<U+017F>tanding. For truly this Formative faculty <U+017F>eems to be <U+017F>tored with mo<U+017F>t exact knowledg, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion, both of the future Action, and al<U+017F>o of the U<U+017F>e of every particular Part, and Organ. And thus of the fir<U+017F>t Action of the Egge, which is the generation of the Chicken, to who<U+017F>e celebration, both the <U+017F>eed of the Cock, as Agent, and Fructifier, and the</hi> Chalaza, <hi>is required, as the <U+017F>ubject Matter. Next comes Accreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is done by Nutrition; who<U+017F>e Faculties are the Attractive, the Retentive, the Dige<U+017F>tive, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ive faculties: and la<U+017F>tly, the Faculty of Appo<U+017F>ition, Agglutination, and A<U+017F><U+017F>imulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for this di<U+017F>tribution of the Actions, I conceive it neither to be right, nor u<U+017F>eful, nor pertinent in this place. Not <hi>Right;</hi> becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e actions, which he <U+017F>eems to hold to be di<U+017F>tinct, in

For though it be otherwi<U+017F>e in the Generation of tho<U+017F>e Animals which are framed by a <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho<U+017F>is;</hi> where all the parts are transformed, and lineated out of a <hi>pre-exi<U+017F>tent matter,</hi> which is large enough, and prepared before hand, (as when out of a Worme is made a Butterfly, and out of another Worme a Silk-Worme) yet in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Epigene<U+017F>is,</hi> the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is much otherwi<U+017F>e, nor is the proceeding there, as it is in <hi>Nutrition,</hi> which is performed by the divers <hi>actions</hi> of diver<U+017F>e <hi>parts,</hi> joining their confederate forces and helps together: namely, where the Aliment is fir<U+017F>t at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and retained; then concocted, then di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and at la<U+017F>t agglutinated. Nor is the <U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar con<U+017F>titution produced by the <hi>Alterative</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without all kind of providence (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have it) And the <hi>Organical,</hi> by the <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which imployes knowledge and providence in her undertakings. For Generation and Accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not made without Nutrition, nor Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or Augmentation, without Generation. For to Nouri<U+017F>h, is to <hi><U+017F>ub<U+017F>titute into the place of that which is lo<U+017F>t, as much, and <U+017F>uch as is lo<U+017F>t:</hi> namely, <hi>Fle<U+017F>h,</hi> or <hi>Nerves,</hi> into the <hi>roome</hi> of that <hi>Fle<U+017F>h,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e <hi>Nerves,</hi> which are impared. And what is this other, then to make <hi>Fle<U+017F>h,</hi> or <hi>Nerves?</hi> So likewi<U+017F>e <hi>Accretion</hi> is not without Generation: For all <hi>Natural bodies,</hi> are <hi>Augmented,</hi> by a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of tho<U+017F>e parts, of which they did con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t

before: and that according to all <hi>dimen<U+017F>ions:</hi> So that they at once do grow, are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed, and organized together,</p>
            <p>And now, to <hi>Generate a Chicken, is nothing el<U+017F>e, but to con<U+017F>titute all its parts, members and organs:</hi> which though they are made in order, and <U+017F>ome are <hi>po<U+017F>t-genit,</hi> or <hi>later productions</hi> then others (as the <hi>le<U+017F><U+017F>e principal parts,</hi> compared with the <hi>more principal)</hi> yet while the <hi>organs</hi> them<U+017F>elves are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed, their generation doth not proceed in <U+017F>uch <hi>order,</hi> that the <hi><U+017F>imilar parts</hi> mu<U+017F>t be fir<U+017F>t made, and the <hi>organical</hi> be afterwards compounded out of them: as if the compounding parts were fir<U+017F>t to exi<U+017F>t, and then the Compo<U+017F>ition to be rai<U+017F>ed out of them. For though the Head of the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the re<U+017F>t of its Trunck, or corporature (being fir<U+017F>t of a <U+017F>imilar con<U+017F>titution) do re<U+017F>emble a <hi>Mucus,</hi> or a <U+017F>oft <hi>glewey <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance:</hi> out of which afterwards all the <hi>parts</hi> are framed in their <hi>order:</hi> yet by the <U+017F>ame operation, and the <U+017F>ame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, they are together <hi>made</hi> and <hi>augmented:</hi> and as that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance re<U+017F>embling glew doth grow, <U+017F>o are the parts di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed. Namely, they are Generated, Altered, and formed at once: they are at once <U+017F>imilar and di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar: and from a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>imilar, is a great <hi>organ</hi> made. In the <U+017F>ame manner as out of the <U+017F>traw, the <U+017F>pike, reeds, and graines do ari<U+017F>e, and are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed: and as the Trees, when they <U+017F>hoot forth their young buds, do out of them, expand and produce flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, leaves, fruit, and at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eed.</p>
            <p>And this we have learnt out of tho<U+017F>e things which are con<U+017F>picuous in an egge, by diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of them. For by the effects, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or operations are perceived; by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the faculties, and by them, the Operatour
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56144:176"/>
or Efficient. Wherefore in the Generation of the Chicken, the actions or faculties of the <hi>Generant</hi> (which <hi>Fabricius</hi> recites; namely, the <hi>Immutative</hi> and <hi>Formative)</hi> do not differ <hi>Specie,</hi> nor yet <hi><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum prius &amp; po<U+017F>terius,</hi> but (as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> u<U+017F>eth to <U+017F>peak) <hi>ip<U+017F>o e<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> and <hi>ratione <U+017F>olum:</hi> not as it befals the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>nutritive faculty,</hi> after the birth, (to wit, Attraction, Concoction, Di<U+017F>tribution, and Appo<U+017F>ition) which performe their duties in <U+017F>everal places, and at <U+017F>everal times. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e the Generative faculty her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>hould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced al<U+017F>o to u<U+017F>e diver<U+017F>e in<U+017F>truments to perform her <U+017F>everal operations.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Fabricius</hi> affirms ami<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative Faculty doth operate by the qualities of the <hi>Elements,</hi> namely, Heat, Cold, Moi<U+017F>ture, and Dryne<U+017F>s: (as being its in<U+017F>truments) but that the formative works without them, and after a more divine manner: as if (for<U+017F>ooth) <U+017F>he did fini<U+017F>h her task, with meditation, choi<U+017F>e, and providence. For had he looked deeper into the thing, he would have <U+017F>een, that the Formative, as well as the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative faculty makes u<U+017F>e of hot, cold, moi<U+017F>t, and dry, (as her in<U+017F>truments) &amp; would have deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much divinity and skill, in Nutrition and Immutation, as in the operations of the Formative faculty her <U+017F>elf. For <hi>nature</hi> hath in<U+017F>tituted all tho<U+017F>e faculties for <U+017F>ome end; and doth every where work with providence, and under<U+017F>tanding. What<U+017F>oever it is which makes the <U+017F>eed of Plants fruitful, and doth exerci<U+017F>e a pla<U+017F>tick virtue in it: and that which in an <hi>egge</hi> executes the office of a mo<U+017F>t skilful Workeman, doth produce and build the parts, and by Calefying Refrigerating, Moi<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Drying, Concocting, Conden<U+017F>ing, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Softning, Di<U+017F><U+017F>olving, both Fa<U+017F>hion, and

            <p>I <U+017F>ay the Concocting, and Immutative; the Nutritive, and Augmenting faculties; (which <hi>Fabricius</hi> would have to bu<U+017F>ie them<U+017F>elves onely about Hot, Cold, Moi<U+017F>t, and Dry, without all knowledge) do operate with as much artifice, and as much to a de<U+017F>igned end, as the Formative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: which he affirms, to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the <hi>knowledge and fore-<U+017F>ight of the future action, and u<U+017F>e of every particular part, and Organ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Art of <hi>Phy<U+017F>ick,</hi> the <hi>Bakers</hi> and the <hi>Cooks <U+017F>light</hi> (which <U+017F>et on work, the hot, cold, moi<U+017F>t, and dry, and <U+017F>uch like natural In<U+017F>truments) doe no le<U+017F>s require the exerci<U+017F>e of rea<U+017F>on, then Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Trades, which either work with their own hand, (as the Smith, the Statuaries, and the Potters) or other artificial in<U+017F>truments.

            <p>Therefore if it be lawful for us to judge of the faculties by the operations; the Vegetal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do rather <U+017F>eem to be executed by Art, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Providence; then the very actions of the Rational <U+017F>oul, and the Mind, though in a mo<U+017F>t perfect man, the top and pinnacle of who<U+017F>e Knowledge and Under<U+017F>tanding, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts chiefly (according to <hi>Apollos</hi> verdit) in this, <hi>ut no <U+017F>eat <U+017F>e ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um,</hi> that he know him<U+017F>elf.

from whence they <U+017F>pring: and the parts (which we <U+017F>ee made already) are more intelligible in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then the actions which framed them.</p>
            <p>Nor do tho<U+017F>e things which are to be con<U+017F>idered and determined in the general ob<U+017F>ervation of all <hi>Animals,</hi> fall properly within the compa<U+017F>s of the <hi>particular generation</hi> of the <hi>Chicken</hi> out of the <hi>Egge.</hi> But of them more hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, we <U+017F>hall proceed to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>parts. It remaines,</hi> <U+017F>aith <hi>Fabricius, that we con<U+017F>ider and contemplate in what Order, that is, which part is made fir<U+017F>t, and which after in the Egge. In pro<U+017F>ecution whereof there are two foundations to be laid: one in re<U+017F>pect of the body: the other in relation to the incorporeal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as, the Nature or Soul. I call that</hi> (<U+017F>aith he) <hi>the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal foundation, which depends upon, and flowes from the Nature of the body: and whereof an in<U+017F>tance is ea<U+017F>ily deduced from things made by art: For, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very edifice doth fir<U+017F>t require a foundation, upon which the whole frame is to be laid and <U+017F>upported: whence the walls are <U+017F>et up, which do <U+017F>u<U+017F>taine the Floors and Roofe: and then the Hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff, and other furniture are introduced; <U+017F>o doth nature proceed in the Fabrick of Animals. For fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he laies the Bones as the foundation, that all the parts of the Body may grow to, hang, upon, and be e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed by them. Which bones are fir<U+017F>t made under another capacity. For <U+017F>ince Bones take their fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e from a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oft and membranous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and doe afterwards attaine their induration; therefore much time mu<U+017F>t be allotted to the Generation of the Bones, that <U+017F>o they may become the harde<U+017F>t parts; and hereupon they are begotten fir<U+017F>t. And for this rea<U+017F>on</hi> Galen <hi>did not compare the <U+017F>tructure of an Animal to every kind of building, but chiefly to that of a Ship. For,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:56144:178"/>
               <hi>and original of the Ship is the Keel, from which the <U+017F>ides, or planks imbowed, and placed at a di<U+017F>tance one from the other (like a Hurdle) are <U+017F>et up on both <U+017F>ides, that <U+017F>o the whole frame of the Ship may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fini<U+017F>hed out of the Keel, as a convenient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; So in the fabrick of an Animal, Nature fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tretcheth out the Chine bone, with the Ribbes drawn round it, as the Keel, and congruous principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>he foundeth and fini<U+017F>heth the whole Pile.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Experience</hi> doth abundantly confute this phan<U+017F>ie: for it is evident, that the <hi>Bones</hi> are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made la<U+017F>t of all. For the <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> the <hi>Skull</hi> and <hi>Teeth,</hi> are not made before the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles,</hi> and <hi>fle<U+017F>hey parts;</hi> but even after the nativity, in the tender, and (otherwi<U+017F>e) perfect <hi>foetus,</hi> they are onely <hi>Gri<U+017F>tles,</hi> and <hi>Membranes,</hi> and afterwards in tract of time arrive to the <hi><U+017F>olidity</hi> of <hi>Bones,</hi> as doth appear by <hi>Infants Skulls,</hi> and the <hi>Ribbes</hi> and <hi>Joints</hi> of <hi>Embryo</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>And though it be true, that the fir<U+017F>t platforme of the body appears like a Bent or incurved Keel, yet is it of a <U+017F>oft, mucous, and glutinous con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tence, no way re<U+017F>embling either the <hi>Nature, Con<U+017F>titution,</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Bone.</hi> As al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>mall <hi>Globous bodies</hi> which are its appendixes (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igned for the parts of the <hi>Head)</hi> have no <hi><U+017F>olidity</hi> at all in them, but are onely <hi>Ve<U+017F>icles</hi> <U+017F>tuffed with clear water, which are afterward transformed into the <hi>Braine, After-braine,</hi> and <hi>Eyes;</hi> and are at la<U+017F>t fenced with the <hi>Skull,</hi> namely, after the <hi>Bill,</hi> and <hi>Clawes</hi> have attained <hi><U+017F>olidity,</hi> and <hi>obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore this Contemplation of <hi>Fabricius</hi> is a <U+017F>leepy, and injurious one; He not con<U+017F>idering what really is done by <hi>nature</hi> in the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> but rather what nature according to his
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56144:179"/>
phan<U+017F>ie, ought to have done; as if Nature did imitate <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> were not rather <hi>Natures Ape.</hi> Which comming into his head, him<U+017F>elf afterwards <U+017F>aith, <hi>Satius fuerit dicere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is a more dilibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>

               <hi>a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion to <U+017F>ay, that Art was Natures Scholar, and wrought by her Copy: becau<U+017F>e as</hi> Galen <hi>every where pronounceth, Nature is of more Antiquity, and wi<U+017F>er in her productions then Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the <hi>bones</hi> are the foundation of the whole <hi>body,</hi> without which it can nor <U+017F>tand nor move: yet it is <U+017F>ufficient for them, if they are made together with tho<U+017F>e <hi>parts,</hi> which do rely upon them. For where the things which are to be upheld are not in being, the <hi>Props</hi> are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no purpo<U+017F>e. But nature doth nothing ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor con<U+017F>titutes <hi>parts,</hi> before there is u<U+017F>e of them. But all Animals attaine their parts, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as action and u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s is required of them. And therefore this fir<U+017F>t foundation of <hi>Fabricius</hi> his laying, countenanced by his own ob<U+017F>ervations in the <hi>Egge,</hi> and <hi>Galens <U+017F>imile,</hi> is clean demoli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He <U+017F>eems to come neerer the Mark, when hee <U+017F>aith, <hi>The other foundation of producing the parts in order, is de<U+017F>umed from Nature, that is, the <U+017F>oul; which is Queen Regent of the animal body. For <U+017F>ince there are two degrees of the <U+017F>oul, the Vegetal and Sen<U+017F>ative; and the Vegetal is,</hi> tempore &amp; naturâ prior, <hi>fir<U+017F>t both in time and nature, becau<U+017F>e it is common to the very Plants; doubtle<U+017F>s the In<U+017F>truments <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the Vegetal, are fir<U+017F>t to be made and fitted, before tho<U+017F>e that attend the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive and motive faculties: e<U+017F>pecially the more principal ones, and where the Queen keeps Court. Now the<U+017F>e are chiefly two, the Liver, and the Heart: the Liver as the throne of the Vegetal or Nutritive: and the Heart as that Mini<U+017F>ter of State,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:56144:179"/>
               <hi>who by his heat and warmth, doth enliven and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat both the Vegetal, and other Faculties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holds a <U+017F>trong league and confederacy with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getal. Wherefore if after three dayes Incubation, you di<U+017F>cern in that part of the egge where the Chicken is bred, the heart panting, (as</hi> Ari<U+017F>totle <hi>al<U+017F>o te<U+017F>tifieth) mu<U+017F>e not at it, but conclude that the heart relates to the vegetal Faculty, and is therefore the fir<U+017F>t begotten. Now it is al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>onant to Rea<U+017F>on, that the Liver al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hould be Twinne to the Heart, and born with it, but doth not appear, becau<U+017F>e he wants a palpitation, which the Heart hath. For even</hi> Ari<U+017F>totle <hi>him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>aith, That the Liver and the Heart are con<U+017F>tituted in the body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like grounds; <U+017F>o that if there be a Heart, there mu<U+017F>t be a Liver too. If therefore the Liver and Heart are fir<U+017F>t begotten, it al<U+017F>o followes, that the other Organs that are menial <U+017F>ervants relating to the<U+017F>e two, <U+017F>hould be begotten together with them; as, the Lungs for the Heart; and for the Liver, almo<U+017F>t all the parts which are contained in the Lower Belly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this is very wide from that <hi>order</hi> and <hi>progre<U+017F>s</hi> which we <U+017F>ee in the <hi>Egge.</hi> Nor is it true, that the <hi>Liver</hi> is born together with the <hi>Heart:</hi> nor will that <U+017F>hift <U+017F>erve his turn, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, <hi>Latere Jecur, quia non palpitat,</hi> that the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> lyeth concealed, becau<U+017F>e it is not expo<U+017F>ed by <hi>palpitation.</hi> For the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and the <hi>Carina,</hi> the <hi>Keel,</hi> are di<U+017F>cerned even from the very fir<U+017F>t, yet have they no <hi>palpitation.</hi> What impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to barre the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Lungs</hi> (if they are then in being) from being <hi><U+017F>een?</hi> Nay, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, in his <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Table,</hi> repre<U+017F>enting the <hi>fourth day,</hi> hath de<U+017F>cribed a <hi><U+017F>mall Point</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t, and yet he hath not <U+017F>ignified any <hi>palpitation</hi> belonging to it; nor did he own it for the <hi>Heart,</hi> but <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed it to be the <hi>fir<U+017F>t rudiment</hi> of the <hi>body:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Wherefore, either <hi>Fabricius</hi> is deceived, or doth deceive, where he <U+017F>aith, <hi>Pre<U+017F>ently in the fir<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s of generation, the Liver, Heart, Veines, Arteries, Lungs, and all the parts contained in the lower belly; likewi<U+017F>e the Keel, that is, the Head, with the Eyes, and the whole Spine and Che<U+017F>t, are born and framed.</hi> For the <hi>Heart, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> are perfectly <hi>di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hed,</hi> for <U+017F>ome time, before the <hi>Keel;</hi> and the <hi>Carina,</hi> or <hi>Keel,</hi> before the <hi>Eyes;</hi> and the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Bill,</hi> and <hi>Sides,</hi> before the Members contained in the <hi>lower belly:</hi> and al<U+017F>o the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> before the <hi>Liver,</hi> or <hi>Lungs,</hi> are di<U+017F>cerned.

So in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort in a conception, where the parts are all</hi> in potentiâ, <hi>the Principle is chiefly active.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Principle</hi> in an <hi>Egge</hi> (analogous to the <hi>blo<U+017F><U+017F>om</hi> of <hi>Plants)</hi> we with <hi>Fabricius</hi> call <hi>Macula,</hi> a <hi>Speck,</hi> or <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> a <U+017F>mall <hi>Cicatrice:</hi> which we have avouched to be the principal particle, in which all the other parts are <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> &amp; whence afterwards they ari<U+017F>e in their order.

the <hi>matter</hi> out of which the Parts are made: we pronounce the <U+017F>ame of the <hi>matter</hi> out of which they are augmented; namely, that the parts do a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume their Nouri<U+017F>hment out of that <hi>matter,</hi> in which all the Parts are <hi>in potentiâ,</hi> but none <hi>actu.</hi>

            <p>He goes on, to explain what Parts are generated before others; and that with a rea<U+017F>on not much unlike <hi>Fabricius</hi> his <hi>Fundamentum <U+017F>ecundum,</hi> his <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground or foundation, <U+017F>aying, <hi>Id cujus cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ, &amp; quod ejus causâ, differunt; &amp; alterum genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, alterum e<U+017F><U+017F>entiâ prius e<U+017F>t;</hi> namely, the <hi>End</hi> is fir<U+017F>t in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ence,</hi> in re<U+017F>pect of that thing which is made for the <hi>Ends</hi> <U+017F>ake; but That which is made for the <hi>Ends</hi> <U+017F>ake, mu<U+017F>t needs be fir<U+017F>t in <hi>Generation.</hi> And by that Argument <hi>Fabricius</hi> rightly inferrs, that tho<U+017F>e Parts which are <U+017F>ub<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the <hi>Vegetative <U+017F>oul,</hi> are all made before tho<U+017F>e which are <hi>in<U+017F>trumental</hi> to the <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>ative,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e that is <hi><U+017F>ubordinate</hi> to this.</p>
            <p>After this, he <U+017F>ubjoines the differences of <U+017F>uch things as are made for any <hi>End;</hi> namely, that <U+017F>ome things are in<U+017F>tituted for <U+017F>ome <hi>End</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the <hi>End</hi> doth en<U+017F>ue upon them: but <U+017F>ome, becau<U+017F>e they are <hi>In<U+017F>truments</hi> which the <hi>End</hi> makes u<U+017F>e of: and tho<U+017F>e he calls <hi>Genitalia,</hi> but the<U+017F>e, <hi>In<U+017F>trumentalia.</hi> For the End, <U+017F>aith he, in <U+017F>ome things is <hi>after,</hi> and in <U+017F>ome, <hi>before</hi> tho<U+017F>e things which are their <hi>cau<U+017F>es.</hi> For the <hi>Generant</hi> him<U+017F>elf, and that which he imployes in <hi>Generation,</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs exi<U+017F>t before that which is <hi>generated</hi> by them.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56144:183"/>
And therefore the Parts <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <U+017F>oul,</hi> are before tho<U+017F>e which are retained by <hi>Sen<U+017F>e,</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> But the Parts dedicated to <hi>Motion</hi> and the <hi>Sen<U+017F>es,</hi> are after the <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>itive</hi> and <hi>motive Faculties;</hi> as being <hi>in<U+017F>trumental,</hi> and made u<U+017F>e of by the <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>itive</hi> and <hi>motive Faculty.</hi> For by <hi>Natures Law,</hi> no Parts or In<U+017F>truments are made and con<U+017F>tituted, before there be <hi>imployment</hi> for them, and a <hi>faculty</hi> be ready at hand, to <U+017F>et them to work. So neither the <hi>Eye,</hi> nor the <hi>In<U+017F>truments</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> are <U+017F>et up, till the <hi>Brain</hi> is built, or the <hi>faculty</hi> be already provided, which is to See, or Move.</p>
            <p>In like manner, becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae pul<U+017F>antes</hi> do (as In<U+017F>truments) mini<U+017F>ter to the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi> and likewi<U+017F>e the whole Frame and Fabrick of the Heart (as we have evidenced in our Book <hi>de Motu Sanguinis)</hi> is In<U+017F>trumental; (namely, that the <hi>Blood</hi> may be continually hurried round the <hi>Body</hi> in a <hi>Circle)</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> <U+017F>eems to have a being both in Order of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> before the <hi>Heart;</hi> which he imployes as an In<U+017F>trument, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it al<U+017F>o, and doth per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t to <hi>nouri<U+017F>h,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey <hi>heat, <U+017F>pirits,</hi> &amp; <hi>life</hi> unto it by the <hi>Coronal Artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how this General Rule of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>prae-ordering</hi> of the Parts, doth appear to be true by <hi>Anatomical Ob<U+017F>ervation,</hi> we <U+017F>hall declare hereafter. In the mean time, we will enquire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner he him<U+017F>elf doth <U+017F>ufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Cau<U+017F>es</hi> of <hi>Priority,</hi> as I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>ay, in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, according to this <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the Principle</hi> (namely the <hi>Heart) are the Interiour parts begotten, before the exteriour; the <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, before the inferiour: for the inferiour are for the <U+017F>uperiours <U+017F>akes, as being their in<U+017F>trument: after the pattern ob<U+017F>erved in Plants, which <U+017F>hoot forth their Roots, before their Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:56144:183"/>
But <hi>Nature</hi> doth not u<U+017F>e that method in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor is the in<U+017F>tance alwayes true; for in <hi>Beanes, Ciches,</hi> and other Pul<U+017F>e, al<U+017F>o in <hi>Acornes</hi> or <hi>Ma<U+017F>t,</hi> and <hi>Corne,</hi> it is apparent that at the <U+017F>ame time, the <hi>Stalk</hi> <U+017F>hootes upward from the <U+017F>ame <hi>Bud,</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> downward. Likewi<U+017F>e <hi>Onions,</hi> and other <hi>bulbous</hi> plants, do germinate upwards before they fix downwards.</p>
            <p>But he adjoines another cau<U+017F>e of this order; to wit, <hi>Nature makes nothing <U+017F>uperfluous, nor nothing in vaine, whence it appears, that nothing is made by her, either before or after another, otherwi<U+017F>e then need requires.</hi> Namely, tho<U+017F>e parts are fir<U+017F>t genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who<U+017F>e u<U+017F>es and functions are fir<U+017F>t required: <U+017F>ome al<U+017F>o are <U+017F>ooner begun, becau<U+017F>e they call for more time to perfect them, that <U+017F>o they may be ready for the birth, together with others that are forwarder then they. As the <hi>Cook</hi> being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a fea<U+017F>t, where <U+017F>ome provi<U+017F>ions (by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>olidity) aske a <U+017F>lower fire, and longer time to prepare them, he laies them down to the fire fir<U+017F>t: but to tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>patched, and are dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a gentler heat, he applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe la<U+017F>t: and <U+017F>uch al<U+017F>o as are to be <U+017F>erved up in the fir<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e, he makes ready fir<U+017F>t, but tho<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>econd, la<U+017F>t. So likewi<U+017F>e nature, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Animals, is late ere <U+017F>he delineate the moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>oft, and fle<U+017F>hey parts, (as being quickly cooked, and reduced into <U+017F>hape) but for the hard and more <U+017F>olid (as the <hi>bones)</hi> becau<U+017F>e they exact a large Evaporation, and Ex<U+017F>iccation, and their matter continues long indige<U+017F>ted, to them <U+017F>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>es her <U+017F>elfe fir<U+017F>t of all. <hi>For in the Braine al<U+017F>o,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>the <U+017F>ame falls out, namely, that at fir<U+017F>t it is very moi<U+017F>t, and great in quantity: but anon, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity evaporating, and being concocted, it growes</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:56144:184"/>
               <hi>more <U+017F>olid, and <U+017F>o the quantity of the Head, and Eyes, do abate. In the beginning therefore, the Head <U+017F>eems very bigge</hi> (in compari<U+017F>on of all the re<U+017F>t of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which it much exceeds in <hi>bulke) by rea<U+017F>on of the Braine: and the eyes very large, by rea<U+017F>on of the humour conteined in them. But yet the eyes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected la<U+017F>t; becau<U+017F>e even the Braine it <U+017F>elfe is long ere it grow to a con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence. For it is long ere it get the ma<U+017F>tery, and drein the water, and e<U+017F>pecially in a Man. For the</hi> Sinciput <hi>is la<U+017F>t confirmed of all the Bones; for that bone is yet <U+017F>oft, even when the Child is born into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He al<U+017F>o proceeds to another rea<U+017F>on; namely, that the parts are framed of different materials. <hi>The more noble parts,</hi> (<U+017F>aith he) <hi>and tho<U+017F>e that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the worthie<U+017F>t principles, are con<U+017F>tituted of the concocted, pure<U+017F>t, and chiefe<U+017F>t aliment: the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary parts, made for their <U+017F>akes, are fa<U+017F>hioned out of the ba<U+017F>er matter, the reliques, and dregs. For Nature, like a prudent Ma<U+017F>ter of a Family, lo<U+017F>eth nothing, out of which he can make any advantage, but <U+017F>o manages the matter in his hou<U+017F>e, that his Children may fare be<U+017F>t, his Servants harder then they, and the <U+017F>craps or refu<U+017F>e thrown to the Dogs. As therefore,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremento jam addito, mens advena facit haec, <hi>that is,</hi> (as I interpret it) a prudent man grown to years of di<U+017F>cretion, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>es thus of his Charge; <hi>So in the framing of things, Nature (by an inbred wi<U+017F>dome and prudence) formes the fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the in<U+017F>truments of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, out of the mo<U+017F>t refined mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the</hi> Bones, Nerves, Hair, Nailes, Hoofes, <hi>and the like, out of the Dregs,</hi> (that is the refu<U+017F>e, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders, or fragments) <hi>And therefore the<U+017F>e are made la<U+017F>t, when nature hath now good <U+017F>tore of cour<U+017F>e materials. And after this,</hi> he di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>heth <hi>of two <U+017F>orts of Aliment; one of Nutrition, the other of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:56144:184"/>
               <hi>That of Nutrition,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>doth <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a being to the whole, and all the parts, that of augmentation procureth an acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to what we finde in the <hi>Egge;</hi> where the White (as the more <hi>refined Aliment)</hi> relates to the <hi>fir<U+017F>t Nutrition</hi> of the Chicken; the Yolk to its augmentation. And the thinner White (as hath been <U+017F>hewed) conduceth to the formation of the Fir<U+017F>t, and nobler Parts; but the Cour<U+017F>er, and the Yolk, to the augmentation of the Nobler, and formation of the more Ignoble. For, he <U+017F>aith, <hi>the Nerves are framed as the Bones, out of the <U+017F>eminal and nutritive excrement. But the</hi> Nailes, Haire, Spurres, <hi>and all like the<U+017F>e, are formed out of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and adventitious meats; which the</hi> Foetus <hi>both receives from the Mother, and al<U+017F>o doth provide of it <U+017F>elfe.</hi> And after this he at la<U+017F>t gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, why <hi>Man</hi> (<U+017F>ince other <hi>Animals</hi> are provided with their Garments, and Weapons at <hi>Natures</hi> price) <U+017F>hould be borne naked, and unarmed; namely, that tho<U+017F>e kind of parts are con<U+017F>tituted of the <hi>excrementitious parts,</hi> and reliques, but the materials of <hi>Men</hi> are purer, in which there is very litle terrene, or crude excrement to be found.</p>
            <p>And thus far have we made u<U+017F>e of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Order of Generation: where all <U+017F>eems to be bottomed upon one foundation; namely, <hi>Natures Perfection;</hi> which in all her Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip, hath nothing <hi><U+017F>hort,</hi> nor nothing <hi><U+017F>uperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but always di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth matters for the be<U+017F>t. And therefore no parts had been precedent or <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equent to one another, if it had been more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to have formed them altogether; which is to be under<U+017F>tood of Her, as often as <U+017F>he acts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by choice. For <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he acts other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56144:185"/>
being as it were under con<U+017F>traint, and put be<U+017F>ide her purpo<U+017F>e; which happens, when either by defect of matter, or <U+017F>uperfluity thereof, or by the default of her in<U+017F>truments, or <U+017F>ome outward impediments, <U+017F>he is hindered in her work, and fru<U+017F>trated of her aime, or end. And hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>ometimes, that the <hi>final parts</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before the <hi>In<U+017F>trumental:</hi> I call tho<U+017F>e <hi>final parts,</hi> which employ others, (as their in<U+017F>truments.)</p>
            <p>And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome parts are Genital parts, which Nature <U+017F>ets to work about the Generation of other parts, or el<U+017F>e to remove <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in her proceedings, which in ca<U+017F>e they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, the Generation may be retarded: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are under another capacity: therefore it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that according to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the matter, and other requi<U+017F>ites, the parts are diver<U+017F>ly made <U+017F>ome after other, and <U+017F>ome of them are in hand before, but are not fini<U+017F>hed till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: <U+017F>ome are begun and fini<U+017F>hed before others are begun, and others are as <U+017F>oon begun as their fellows, but fini<U+017F>hed after them. And therefore in the generation of <U+017F>ome <hi>Animals,</hi> the <U+017F>ame order is not always ob<U+017F>erved, but it is much different and various; and in <U+017F>ome no order at all: but all the parts are begun, and fini<U+017F>hed at a heat: namely by a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is,</hi> as we <U+017F>hewed. And la<U+017F>tly, hence it happens that the <hi>Primogenit part</hi> is <U+017F>uch, that in it is concluded both the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and the <hi>End;</hi> as well that for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake all are made (namely the <hi><U+017F>oul)</hi> as al<U+017F>o that which is its cau<U+017F>e in chief, and Genital part. The Heart therefore (or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, the <hi>Blood)</hi> is the fir<U+017F>t throne of the <hi>Soul;</hi> the fountain of life; the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tal fire; the Genital warmth; and the very <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum Innatum;</hi> the fir<U+017F>t Efficient of all his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tring

parts, having atcheived the <U+017F>oul for his end, which commands them all as her leige-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

The Interiour parts are Univer<U+017F>ally generated, after the Order propo<U+017F>ed: for in all Animals (which I ever diffected) they are framed after the <U+017F>ame Manner, and Order: and e<U+017F>pecially in the more perfect, in Four-footed Bea<U+017F>ts, and <U+017F>o in Man him<U+017F>elf; In whom the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, and Guts, appear framed, and augmented in the Second, Third, and Fourth Moneths, at which times they are white, as al<U+017F>o the whole Body. And hereupon the <hi>fir<U+017F>t days</hi> are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>in lacte dies,</hi> the Dayes in the Milk; for the Bowels, and all the other parts appeare <hi><U+017F>permatical,</hi> except onely the <hi>Veines,</hi> and chiefly tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Navel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Umbilical Arteries</hi> are, I conceive, framed after their Name-<U+017F>akes, the <hi>Veines;</hi> becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>carce to be found in the <hi>fir<U+017F>t moneths,</hi> and take their Original from the Branches which de<U+017F>cend to the <hi>Thighes:</hi> And therefore, I conceive, they are not con<U+017F>tituted before that part of the <hi>body,</hi> (from whence they are derived.) But the <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veines</hi> are con<U+017F>picuous long before any part of the Body is in hand.</p>
            <p>What I have now delivered, hath been ratified out of many <hi>di<U+017F><U+017F>ections</hi> of humane <hi>Embryo's</hi> of (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t) all <U+017F>izes: for I have ob<U+017F>erved them from the bigne<U+017F>s of a <hi>Tad-pole,</hi> till they became of the longitude of <hi><U+017F>even</hi> or <hi>eight fingers</hi> breadth, and <U+017F>o upwards to the Birth. And e<U+017F>pecially in the <hi><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third,</hi> and <hi>fourth moneths;</hi> at which times the greate<U+017F>t Alterations befall them, and the progre<U+017F>s of Generation is mo<U+017F>t evident.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in a <hi>humane Embryo</hi> of <hi>two moneths</hi> old, tho<U+017F>e very things which we have related in the <hi><U+017F>econd Proce<U+017F>s,</hi> do appear begun. For in the <hi>fir<U+017F>t moneth</hi> I conceive there is <hi>litle</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> of the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56144:189"/>
               <hi>foetus</hi> extant in the womb; at lea<U+017F>t I never found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. But that moneth expiring, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <U+017F>een a conception ca<U+017F>t out (like to that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> relates to have fallen from the Min<U+017F>trell) of the bigne<U+017F>s of a <hi>Phea<U+017F>ants,</hi> or <hi>Pigeons egge,</hi> and it was of an <hi>Oval</hi> figure, ju<U+017F>t like an <hi>Egg</hi> with the <hi>Shell</hi> pilled off; but the thicker mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane (called <hi>Chorion)</hi> encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing it, was plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tered on the out <U+017F>ide, as it were, with a <hi>mucous <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,</hi> (e<U+017F>pecially in the <hi>obtu<U+017F>er end)</hi> but within it was <hi><U+017F>lippery,</hi> being full of <hi>clear</hi> and <hi><U+017F>tiff</hi> water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing el<U+017F>e at all.</p>
            <p>In the <hi><U+017F>econd moneth,</hi> I have often <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch a kinde of <hi>Egg</hi> (but larger) ejected upon <hi>indications</hi> of <hi>Abortment,</hi> namely the <hi>Lochia ichoro<U+017F>a;</hi> and it hath been <U+017F>ometimes <hi>entire,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes <hi>broken,</hi> covered over with clotted <hi>blood.</hi> Within, it was <hi><U+017F>mooth</hi> and <hi><U+017F>lippery,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> adhering without, and its form was like the other. In <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have found a <hi>foetus,</hi> in other, none. That <hi>foetus</hi> hath been of the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>nail</hi> of the <hi>litle finger,</hi> but the <U+017F>hape was like a <hi>litle frog,</hi> <U+017F>ave onely that the <hi>head</hi> was great, and the <hi>leggs</hi> extremly <hi><U+017F>hort:</hi> ju<U+017F>t like the <hi>Tadpoles</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> which when their <hi>limbs</hi> begin to <hi><U+017F>hoot</hi> out, they loo<U+017F>e their tail, and put on the <hi><U+017F>hape</hi> of <hi>Frogs.</hi> All its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance was white, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft and gellyi<U+017F>h, that unle<U+017F>s it were ca<U+017F>t into clear water, you could not hold it in your hand. The face was like that of other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,</hi> as of a <hi>Dog,</hi> or <hi>Cat,</hi> without <hi>lips,</hi> and a <hi>wide mouth</hi> from one care to the other.</p>
            <p>Divers Women, who<U+017F>e <hi>Conception</hi> (like an addle <hi>Egge)</hi> is fruitle<U+017F>s, and without a <hi>Foetus,</hi> do <U+017F>uffer <hi>abortion</hi> the third moneth. I have often di<U+017F><U+017F>ected an <hi>abortion</hi> of that <hi>age</hi> (being of the bigne<U+017F>s of a <hi>Goo<U+017F>e-egg)</hi> wherein was a <hi>foetus,</hi> di<U+017F>tinct in all its

parts; though their form was rough, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hapen, The Head, Eyes, and Limbs appeared, but the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> were confu<U+017F>ed: having no <hi>bones,</hi> but in their places, certain <hi>Lineaments,</hi> and <U+017F>ofter <hi>Gri<U+017F>tles,</hi> as it were; the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Heart was mo<U+017F>t white, having two <hi>Ventricles</hi> of equal magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and thickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and a double <hi>Cone,</hi> like two <U+017F>mall <hi>Twin-kernels</hi> of a <hi>Nut;</hi> the <hi>Liver</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous litle, and al<U+017F>o white.

            <p>In all the<U+017F>e kinde of <hi>Conceptions</hi> (as many as I have <U+017F>een) I <U+017F>till found the <hi>ambient membrane</hi> fraught with a va<U+017F>t quantity of <hi>watry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance:</hi> in which the floating <hi>Embryo</hi> is <U+017F>o exceeding <U+017F>mall, compared with the <hi>place</hi> where his abode is, and hath withall <U+017F>o long and winding a <hi>Navel;</hi> that tho<U+017F>e <hi>waters</hi> ought not upon any tearms to bee thought the <hi><U+017F>weat,</hi> or <hi>Urine</hi> of the <hi>Embryo;</hi> but more probably, his <hi>nutriment,</hi> provided by nature (like the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> in the <hi>Egge.)</hi> For I could finde no indication to induce me to believe, that that <hi>conception,</hi> or <hi>Egge</hi> had any connexion to the <hi>Womb:</hi> onely the outward <hi><U+017F>uperficies</hi> of the <hi>obtu<U+017F>er end,</hi> looked <U+017F>omething more wrinckled and thick; like the fir<U+017F>t intention of a future <hi>placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover tho<U+017F>e Conceptions appeared to mee, like certain <hi>egges,</hi> which were onely to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured within the <hi>Womb,</hi> but to be nouri<U+017F>hed (like the <hi>Henne-egge)</hi> by their owne <hi>projection,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<U+017F>try.</p>
            <p>Now in the <hi>fourth moneth,</hi> you would admire how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> is improved; for by this, it is encrea<U+017F>ed from a <hi>Thumb-length</hi> to a <hi>Span:</hi> and

all his members appear <hi>di<U+017F>tinct,</hi> and have a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Blood;</hi> the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> and the <hi>Bones</hi> are now apparent; and al<U+017F>o the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Nailes;</hi> and the <hi>Embryo</hi> begins to be<U+017F>tirre him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>oundly. Yet the <hi>Head</hi> is <U+017F>till very bigge; and the <hi>Face</hi> without <hi>Lips, Cheeks,</hi> or <hi>No<U+017F>e:</hi> the <hi>cha<U+017F>m</hi> of the <hi>Mouth</hi> is very large, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pace is half <U+017F>upplied by the <hi>Tongue;</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> <U+017F>mall, and without <hi>Lids;</hi> the middle part of the <hi>Fore-head,</hi> and all the upper-part of the <hi>Head</hi> is covered with a <hi>Membrane,</hi> which is not as yet <hi>cartilaginous,</hi> <U+017F>o far is it from being <hi>Boney:</hi> but the hinder part of the <hi>Head</hi> is <U+017F>omething hard, and <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> implying that the <hi>Skull</hi> beginnes to grow <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genitals</hi> likewi<U+017F>e did appear, but the <hi>Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were <U+017F>eated within the <hi>Abdomen</hi> (where in <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> the <hi>Uterus</hi> re<U+017F>ideth) the <hi>Scrotum</hi> remaining empty.

            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Placenta</hi> was enlarged, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the <hi>Womb;</hi> comprehending almo<U+017F>t halfe the <hi>Conception;</hi> appearing to my eye like a <hi>Tumor,</hi> or <hi>fle<U+017F>hey excre<U+017F>cence</hi> of the <hi>Womb:</hi> its <hi>Gibbous part</hi> did <U+017F>tick <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, even throughout its whole extent, to the <hi>Womb,</hi> which was now grown thicker. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Placenta</hi> the litle <hi>Umbilical branches</hi> (like <U+017F>lender rootes into the Earth) did in<U+017F>inuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves: and by its mediation the <hi>Conception</hi> was now fir<U+017F>t tyed to the <hi>Womb.</hi>

            <p>The large and fluid <hi>Braine</hi> re<U+017F>embled <hi>Chee<U+017F>e-Curd,</hi> and was embroidered with larger Veines. The two <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> both of the <U+017F>ame magnitude, and their walls equally thick. In the

Region of the <hi>Brea<U+017F>t</hi> within the <hi>Ribs,</hi> I <U+017F>aw three hollow places, and tho<U+017F>e not much unlike each other: the lowe<U+017F>t of which, the <hi>Lungs</hi> having <hi>Blood</hi> in them, and of like complexion with the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Kidnies,</hi> did inhabit: the middle was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Pericardium:</hi> but the upper was filled with that large <hi>Glandule</hi> which we call <hi>Thymus,</hi> the <hi>Sweet-Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Stomack</hi> was <hi>Chyle,</hi> of like <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance to that in which the <hi>Embryo</hi> <U+017F>wims: There was al<U+017F>o a coagulated <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance which was white, like to tho<U+017F>e white curded pollutions which the <hi>Midwife</hi> wa<U+017F>heth off from the <hi>Infant</hi> (e<U+017F>pecially from the foulds of the <hi>Skin)</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as it is borne.

            <p>The <hi>Reines</hi> at this time are not formed into a <hi>gibbous figure,</hi> as it is when men are grown, but are moulded of <U+017F>everal <hi>gobbets</hi> (as you <U+017F>ee in a <hi>Calfe,</hi> and in a <hi>Sturgeon)</hi> as if to every <hi><U+017F>prig</hi> or <hi>divaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Ureters,</hi> there were a <hi>gobbet</hi> or <hi>Teat,</hi> out of which their <hi>Orifices</hi> did draine the Urine.

            <p>And here we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve by the way, that in every <hi>Humane Foetus</hi> that is lively and well, perfect <hi>Milk</hi> is found; wherewith chiefly the <hi>Glandule Thymus,</hi> or the <hi>Sweet-bread</hi> is <U+017F>tored.

            </p>
            <p>And that it may plainly appear, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is <U+017F>o plenteous in the <hi>Conception)</hi> is no excrement di<U+017F>charged by the <hi>Embryo,</hi> as either his Sweat, or Urine; it is le<U+017F><U+017F>e (in proportion) neer the birth (when the <hi>foetus</hi> is now more grown, and upon that account doth accumulate more excrement, becau<U+017F>e he requires more nouri<U+017F>hment) then in the <hi>fir<U+017F>t moneths</hi> of <hi>pregnation.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, at that time his <hi>bladder</hi> is full, and di<U+017F>tended with Urine.

            </p>
            <p>And let this <U+017F>uffice, concerning what we have ob<U+017F>erved in a <hi>humane Foetus,</hi> <U+017F>o farre forth as it relates to the knowledge of the Order of the Parts.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth and la<U+017F>t Proce<U+017F>s, the parts of meaner rank and condition are formed: <U+017F>uch as do not <U+017F>imply relate to the very being, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of the Animal, but onely <hi>ad tutelam,</hi> to

            <p>For that kind of <hi>Safe-guard</hi> or <hi>Defence,</hi> the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t part (namely the <hi>Skin)</hi> is chiefly con<U+017F>tituted, and all that proceeds out of it, as the <hi>Scarfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,</hi> the <hi>Haire, Wool, Plumes, Scales, Shells, Clans, Hoofs,</hi> and the like. And indeed it is a prudent contrivance of <hi>Nature</hi> (who never makes any thing indi<U+017F>creetly,) to beget tho<U+017F>e parts la<U+017F>t of all, whereof <U+017F>he hath no u<U+017F>e till after nativity.

            <p>Now the <hi>Down</hi> <U+017F>tarts up in the Chicken after the Fourteenth day, when the <hi>Foetus</hi> is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and provided with all his parts.

            <p>The Feathers differ from Quills, in form, u<U+017F>e, and place of Production.

            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> (as <hi>Fabricius</hi> ob<U+017F>erves) <hi>as he con<U+017F>titutes a kind of twofold nature of the egge, and a kind of twofold Egge in the<U+017F>e creatures; <U+017F>o he laies down a twofold action, and a twofold Animal produced by it. For</hi> (<U+017F>aith he) <hi>out of the fir<U+017F>t egges, which are the fir<U+017F>t rudiments of the Generation, a Worm con<U+017F>tantly doth proceed: namely, out of the Egges of Files, Ants, Bees, Silk-wormes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in which a certain fluid matter is conteined, and out of all that fluid matter is the Worme made. But out of the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Egges, which are layed by the Worm him<U+017F>elfe, the Butterflie is born, and proceeds; that is, a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi>

               <hi>Animal, which is concluded in a kind of Shell, Skin, little bag, or egge, and when that bag is broken it departs thence as</hi> Ari<U+017F>totle <hi>delivereth concerning the Locu<U+017F>ts egges.</hi> La<U+017F>tly the<U+017F>e are perfected by a <hi><U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion</hi> of <hi>parts;</hi> but they (namely, <U+017F>uch as are generated by a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is)</hi> are made intire at once.

            <p>Now <U+017F>ome Paradoxes do here ari<U+017F>e to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.

            </p>
            <p>But this is mo<U+017F>t manife<U+017F>t, where the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> lives by a <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of forms; (as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>peaks) as for example, <hi>Out of a Canker-worm, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia, and then a Butterfly.</hi> For the <U+017F>ame <hi>Efficient, Nutritive,</hi> and <hi>Pre<U+017F>erving principle,</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be in each of the<U+017F>e: unle<U+017F>s we will place one <U+017F>oul in the <hi>Boy,</hi> another in the <hi>Young man,</hi> and a third in the <hi>Old:</hi> or affirm, that the Canker-worm, and that worm which becomes a Silk-worm, al<U+017F>o the Silk-worm, and the Butterfly, have the <U+017F>ame form, of which matter <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> hath accurately written, and whereof more largely hereafter.</p>
            <p>Again, it <U+017F>eems a <hi>Paradox,</hi> that the <hi>blood</hi> <U+017F>hould be made, and move, and be endowed with <hi>Vital <U+017F>pirits,</hi> before any <U+017F>anguifying, or <hi>Motive Organs</hi> are con<U+017F>tituted at all.</p>
            <p>Nor is it le<U+017F>s new and unheard of, that there <U+017F>hould be <hi>Sen<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> before his <hi>brain</hi> is made; for the <hi>Foetus moves, contracts,</hi> and <hi>extends</hi> him<U+017F>elf, when there is nothing yet appears for a <hi>brain,</hi> but clear <hi>water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides, the <hi>body</hi> is nouri<U+017F>hed and encrea<U+017F>ed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Organs</hi> dedicated to Concoction (namely

            <p>The Excrements of the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> (namely in the <hi>Guts,</hi> and the two <hi>bladders,</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> one, the other of <hi>Gall)</hi> are coetaneous to the <hi>concocting In<U+017F>truments</hi> them<U+017F>elves.

            </p>
            <p>Concerning which <hi>Re<U+017F>emblance,</hi> we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what <U+017F>hould be the cau<U+017F>e why the <hi>Foetus</hi> <U+017F>ometimes re<U+017F>embles the <hi>Father,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes the <hi>Mother,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o the <hi>Progenitors,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e either of the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mothers</hi> <U+017F>ide?

Now it is evidently natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to mollifie and relax tho<U+017F>e parts. For, if the <hi>Midwife</hi> do di<U+017F>cover the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Matrix</hi> become <U+017F>oft and loo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he laies it down for an infallible <U+017F>ign of the approaching <hi>delivery,</hi> though the <hi>Waters</hi> are not yet broken.

            <p>And by the like <hi>Experience,</hi> I pronounce, the <hi>Ossa pubis</hi> to be often loo<U+017F>ened one from another in <hi>delivery,</hi> their <hi>cartilaginous</hi> connexion being mollified, and all the <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>Lower Belly</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculou<U+017F>ly dilated; and this not by the profu<U+017F>ion of the <hi>Watry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance,</hi> but of their own accord, as ripe <hi>fruits</hi> u<U+017F>e to revolt or open, to make room for the <hi>Exclu<U+017F>ion</hi> of their <hi><U+017F>eeds.</hi> But how much the <hi>Coccyx</hi> may retard the <hi>delivery,</hi> is clear in <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed bea<U+017F>ts,</hi> that have <hi>Tailes;</hi> for they can neither <hi>bring forth young,</hi> nor di<U+017F>load the <hi>excrements</hi> of the <hi>Guts,</hi> unle<U+017F>s they remove their <hi>Taile;</hi> which if you depre<U+017F>s with your <hi>hand,</hi> you hinder the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the <hi>Excrement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, that is accounted the mo<U+017F>t <hi>Natural Delivery,</hi> when the <hi>Foetus</hi> and <hi>Secundines</hi> with the <hi>Watry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance</hi> (that is, the <hi>Entire Egge)</hi> get forth together.

            <p>Nay, A <hi>New-born Child</hi> is more exact at <hi><U+017F>ucking,</hi> then a grown <hi>body,</hi> or him<U+017F>elf either if he di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it but a few days.

the Nipple, he <U+017F>till draws it into his <hi>mouth,</hi> and by the aid of his <hi>tongue,</hi> and <hi>palate,</hi> he <U+017F>ucks the milk, as if he chewed it; with farre more earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>light, then a <hi>grown body.</hi> Wherefore he <U+017F>eems to be good at it of old, and to have practi<U+017F>ed it in the <hi>womb;</hi> for we <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>oon he unlearns it by di<U+017F>continuance.</p>
            <p>By the<U+017F>e and other <hi>Ob<U+017F>ervations</hi> it is probable, that the Chicken is fed two waies in the <hi>Egge,</hi> namely, both by the <hi>Umbilical,</hi> and the <hi>Me<U+017F>eraick Veiues:</hi> by the former, he attracts well dige<U+017F>ted <hi>aliment,</hi> whereby the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>primogenit parts</hi> are con<U+017F>tituted, and encrea<U+017F>ed; by the other, Chyle, which conduces to the <hi>fabrick,</hi> and <hi>augmentation</hi> of the other <hi>parts.</hi>

            <p>Now, perhaps the rea<U+017F>on may <U+017F>eem ob<U+017F>cure, wherefore the <U+017F>ame <hi>Agent</hi> <U+017F>hould out of the <U+017F>ame <hi>Matter</hi> proceed to a diver<U+017F>e manner of <hi>Nutrition:</hi> (when <hi>Nature</hi> doth nothing in vain) yet we will endeavour to di<U+017F>cover the rea<U+017F>on.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Part</hi> which is attracted by the <hi>Umbilical Veines,</hi> is the purer and <U+017F>incerer part: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> wherein the <hi>Foetus</hi> floats, is a kind of crude <hi>milk,</hi> without cream, deprived of its purer part. The more <hi>pure</hi> part therefore <U+017F>tands in no need of farther <hi>concoction,</hi> as the other doth, which therefore is received into the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and there <hi>chylified.</hi> The thin, and crude <hi>milk,</hi> <U+017F>uch as is found in the <hi>brea<U+017F>t</hi> pre<U+017F>ently after delivery, is like this. For the di<U+017F><U+017F>olved <hi>White</hi> of an <hi>Egg,</hi> and the <hi>crude</hi> and <hi>watry milk</hi> in the <hi>brea<U+017F>t</hi> or <hi>udder,</hi> are of the <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ame <hi>colour, ta<U+017F>te,</hi> and <hi>con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence.</hi> Al<U+017F>o the fir<U+017F>t <hi>milk</hi> given, is <U+017F>erous, and <hi>watry;</hi> and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Childe-bed</hi> do milk a kinde of water out of their <hi>brea<U+017F>ts,</hi> before the <hi>milk</hi> is concocted, and perfectly <hi>white.</hi>

For by this means all the parts of the Animal, may cater and procure for them<U+017F>elves a convenient and familiar nutriment.</hi> For we do by no means con<U+017F>ent, that the diver<U+017F>e parts of the <hi>egge,</hi> are ordeined to nouri<U+017F>h the diver<U+017F>e parts of the <hi>chicken,</hi> having formerly <U+017F>hewed, that the <hi>Heart, Lungs, Reins, Liver, Mu<U+017F>cles, Ligaments,</hi> and all the <hi>parts</hi> of the whole <hi>body,</hi> do appear <hi>white</hi> and <hi>bloodle<U+017F>s</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>And upon this argument of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> it would in<U+017F>ue, that the <hi>Heart, Lungs, Liver, Spleen,</hi> &amp;c. are not <hi>Spermatical parts,</hi> or con<U+017F>tituted out of the <hi>Seed:</hi> (which he will upon no terms con<U+017F>ent to) becau<U+017F>e they al<U+017F>o are afterwards fed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed by <hi>Blood;</hi> for all things are made, and nouri<U+017F>hed by one and the <U+017F>ame thing; becau<U+017F>e nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is onely a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titution of a like <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance into the room of that which is lo<U+017F>t.</p>

how (when the white is now clean exhau<U+017F>ted) the cold, and white parts (namely, the <hi>Ligaments, Bones, Brain, Spinal-Marrow,</hi> &amp;c.) are likewi<U+017F>e nouri<U+017F>hed, and inlarged by the <hi>Yolk,</hi> the <hi>Yolk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no le<U+017F>s a di<U+017F>proportionated aliment to the<U+017F>e, then the <hi>White</hi> is to the hot, red, and <U+017F>anguineous parts.</p>
            <p>Nay, according to the fore-cited opinion, the hot, and <U+017F>anguineous parts are to be the po<U+017F>t-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit parts, or born la<U+017F>t: that is, the Fle<U+017F>h after the Bones; the Liver, and the Lungs after the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Guts: and the cold parts of the <hi>body</hi> are to be upon the Forge all the <hi>while</hi> the <hi>White</hi> is con<U+017F>uming; and after them the <hi>hot,</hi> when the <hi>Yolk</hi> begins to decline and wa<U+017F>h it <U+017F>elf away to <U+017F>upply their growth: <U+017F>o that all the parts could not po<U+017F><U+017F>iby ari<U+017F>e out of the <U+017F>ame <hi>Whites.</hi> But all the<U+017F>e matters are confuted by ocular experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <hi>very wonderful both in the Yolk and White; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being blood, yet they are <U+017F>o neer of kin to blood, that they are but little different from it, and</hi>

               <hi>a <U+017F>mall matter keeps them from being, very blood it <U+017F>elfe: and therefore a little paines, and a <U+017F>lender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction <U+017F>ufficeth to convert them into blood. And this is the rea<U+017F>on why we alwaies di<U+017F>cover tho<U+017F>e Veins and Arteries which are propagated into the membranes of the Yolk and White to be full of blood; and yet the Yolk and White abide <U+017F>till in their own nature: but <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as either of the two is attracted into the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it pre<U+017F>ently tran<U+017F>forms into blood; <U+017F>o neer allyed are they to blood.</hi>

            <p>Hereupon <hi>Fabricius</hi> provides for his retreat: <U+017F>aying, <hi>Though all this be true, yet we are to conceive,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that this <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which is attracted from the Yolk and White by the Veins, is blood in that maner only, as Chyle is in the Me<U+017F>eraick Veins; in which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing di<U+017F>coverable but meer blood; whereas the Chyle hath onely received the <U+017F>hadow of blood, and is to be compleated in the Liver; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance attracted by the Veins out of the Yolk and White, pre<U+017F>ently puts in the <U+017F>hadow and re<U+017F>emblance of blood,</hi> &amp;c. Well, be it <U+017F>o: yet though he lurk in this <U+017F>hadow, he doth not <U+017F>alve the doubt, which is, why the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <U+017F>anguineous parts may not, for the fore-cited rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, be as well nouri<U+017F>hed by the <hi>White</hi> as the <hi>Yolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he had <U+017F>aid, that the hotter <hi>parts,</hi> are rather

nouri<U+017F>hed by that <hi>blood</hi> (or Aliment conteined in the <hi>blood,</hi> which is proportionable to the <hi>Chyle)</hi> which is attracted out of the <hi>Yolk,</hi> then out of the <hi>White:</hi> and <U+017F>o on the contrary, that the cold parts are <U+017F>upplied rather by that Nutriment which the Veins tran<U+017F>port from the <hi>White,</hi> then from the <hi>Yolk,</hi> I <U+017F>hould not have much oppo<U+017F>ed him.</p>
            <p>The main thing that di<U+017F>turbs him in this bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, is this, how the <hi>Blood</hi> can be made in the <hi>Egge;</hi> or what Artificer can transform the two Liquors into <hi>blood,</hi> when there is yet no <hi>Liver</hi> in Being? For he could not <U+017F>ay that the <hi>blood</hi> in the <hi>Egge</hi> is derived from the <hi>Mothers blood.</hi> But <U+017F>aith, <hi>This blood is rather wrought in the Veins then in the Liver: but it becomes a bone, a gri<U+017F>tle, or fle<U+017F>h,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the parts them<U+017F>elves, where it is exactly concocted, and a<U+017F><U+017F>imulated,</hi> without any farther addition at all; not <U+017F>ignifying by whom the <hi>blood</hi> which is in the Veins di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed both into the <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> is concocted, elaborated, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when as yet no <hi>Liver</hi> at all is extant, or any particle of the <hi>body,</hi> that might concoct or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it. And when he had formerly <U+017F>aid, that the cold parts are nouri<U+017F>hed by the <hi>White,</hi> the hot by the <hi>Yolk;</hi> not mindful of his a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, he here concludes the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <U+017F>ame <hi>blood</hi> doth tran<U+017F>migrate into <hi>bones, gri<U+017F>tles, fle<U+017F>h,</hi> and other parts.</p>
            <p>But he lets that grand difficulty, which <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>ouiets the Phy<U+017F>itians minds, glide by in <U+017F>ilence, without taking any knowledge of it: namely, how the <hi>Liver</hi> can be the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>blood:</hi> <U+017F>eeing that <hi>blood</hi> is not onely found in the <hi>egge,</hi> before any one of the <hi>bowels</hi> are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all: but Phy<U+017F>itians them<U+017F>elves do teach,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56144:210"/>
that all the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance or <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>bowels</hi> them<U+017F>elves, are meerly <U+017F>o many <hi>affu<U+017F>ions;</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of <hi>blood.</hi> Is the <hi>Effect,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of its own <hi>Efficient?</hi> If the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> is made of <hi>blood,</hi> how can the <hi>Liver</hi> be the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the in<U+017F>uing pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are of the <U+017F>ame batch, where he <U+017F>aith: <hi>There is al<U+017F>o another u<U+017F>e of the White, when it is now <U+017F>egregated from the Yolk: namely, that the foetus may <U+017F>wimme in it, and <U+017F>o be <U+017F>u<U+017F>teined, le<U+017F>t tending downwards by his own weight, hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to one part rather then another, and <U+017F>o drawing the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els along with him, might break them in <U+017F>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and to this u<U+017F>e the purity and tenacity of the White do conduce. For if the</hi> foetus <hi><U+017F>hould take up his re<U+017F>idence in the Yolk, he would ea<U+017F>ily de<U+017F>cend down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>order and break the Yolk al<U+017F>o.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very weak con<U+017F>truction this! For what doth the purity of the <hi>White</hi> availe to the <U+017F>u<U+017F>tentation of the Chicken?

            </p>
            <p>But the rea<U+017F>on of that a<U+017F>cent of the Yolk is this; the <hi>Macula</hi> or litle <hi>cicatrice</hi> which appears in the <hi>coat</hi> of the Yolk, is by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>pirituous <hi>colliquamentum</hi> which is bred in it, dilated; and thereupon requiring more roome, doth tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Obtu<U+017F>e Angle of the <hi>Egge:</hi> and <U+017F>o like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e that portion of the Yolk and White which is melted, is di<U+017F>tended, and being now grown more concocted and <U+017F>pirituous, doth <U+017F>wimme upon the other parts that remaine crude: as tho<U+017F>e parts of water which are warmed in any ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, ari<U+017F>e from the bottome up to the top: an experiment approved by all Phy<U+017F>itians, who holding the <hi>Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> conteining a thick and troubled <hi>Urine</hi> in warm water, do perceive the upper part thereof, to clear and grow tran<U+017F>parent fir<U+017F>t.

               <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth indeed highly extoll the <hi>Chala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zae,</hi> (as tho<U+017F>e parts out of which he conceived the Chicken was framed) but as for the <hi>Macula,</hi> or <hi>litle Cicatrice,</hi> which is bred adhering to the <hi>tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of the <hi>yolk;</hi> he concludes it to be a u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s thing, e<U+017F>teeming it to be no more then a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or remainder of the <U+017F>talk broken off from the <hi>Vitellary,</hi> or <U+017F>uperiour <hi>Uterus</hi> of the <hi>Hen.</hi> For (according to his per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion) the <hi>yolk</hi> did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

attract its <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance through that <hi><U+017F>talk,</hi> or the <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through it; but the <hi>yolk</hi> being now no longer nouri<U+017F>hed by the <hi>Hen,</hi> but disjoined from the <hi>Ovary,</hi> there <U+017F>till continues a <U+017F>ign or track of the former conjunction, and the benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby.</p>
            <p>But I on the contrary apprehend, that there is no other u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Chalazae,</hi> beyond that which I formerly ob<U+017F>erved; namely, that they <U+017F>hould be as the <hi>Poles</hi> of that <hi>Microco<U+017F>me,</hi> and the ends or connexions of all the <hi>membranes</hi> wound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the <hi>liquors</hi> are not onely continued each in their proper places, but al<U+017F>o retain a ju<U+017F>t and convenient po<U+017F>ition in relation to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But as for the fore-<U+017F>aid <hi>Macula,</hi> I am certain, that it is of the greate<U+017F>t concern and con<U+017F>equence of all; as being the chief Center of the <hi>Egg,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Innate heat</hi> hovers and lurks, and out of which, as out of the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>park, the <hi><U+017F>oul</hi> her <U+017F>elf is lighted; and la<U+017F>tly, for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake, all the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi> and their re<U+017F>pective coverings are con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made.</p>
            <p>Heretofore, indeed, I was of <hi>Fabricius</hi> his mind, deeming this litle <hi>Cicatrice</hi> to be nothing el<U+017F>e but the remainder or track of the <U+017F>talk broken of; but afterwards, upon more accurate ob<U+017F>ervation, I di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that the <U+017F>talk, whereunto the <hi>yolk</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, is not in<U+017F>erted into any litle cranny or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>yolk</hi> (as it is with the <U+017F>talks of <hi>Apples,</hi> and <hi>Plumms)</hi> and that <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome track or print of the connexion or dependance which the <hi>yolk</hi> once had upon the <hi>Ovary,</hi> <U+017F>hould continue in it; but that the <U+017F>talk, before it arrives to the Yolk from the Clu<U+017F>ter, is all the way dilated into a round, (like a litle trumpet) that <U+017F>o it may encompa<U+017F>s

the <hi>horizon,</hi> or the circle of the Yolk, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it into two <hi>parts;</hi> (as the <hi>Tunica Amphible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troides,</hi> or tunicle which re<U+017F>embleth a litle round Ca<U+017F>ting-Net, doth the Egg) <U+017F>o that the <U+017F>uperiour part of the Yolk, or Hemi<U+017F>phere, which looketh towards the Clu<U+017F>ter, is quite free from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact or coherence of the <U+017F>talk, &amp; yet the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Macula,</hi> or litle <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> is <U+017F>eated upon the <U+017F>uperiour part of that litle cup, or portion of the <hi>membrane</hi> of the Yolk; (<U+017F>omething inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <U+017F>ide) <U+017F>o that this <hi>Macula</hi> can upon no terms be <U+017F>aid to be the print of the <U+017F>talk broken off from the Yolk.

            <p>THus farre have we proceeded in the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Oviparous Animals;</hi> it follows, that we now produce our Ob<U+017F>ervations, concerning the other <hi><U+017F>pecies</hi> of Viviparous productions: wherein we have found very many things which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the <U+017F>ame with tho<U+017F>e which occurre in the <hi>Egge;</hi> which we have reduced hither to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted, and come la<U+017F>t to be delivered. Which, though they are paradoxical, and run counter to the common received tenets, yet are they, if my judgment fail me not, entirely con<U+017F>onant to the Truth.</p>
            <p>Among<U+017F>t <hi>Viviparous Animals,</hi> Man is the chief, and mo<U+017F>t perfect of all: next him (that we may proceed from <U+017F>uch as are more known) are ranked tho<U+017F>e creatures that are more <U+017F>ociable &amp; obvious: (whereof <U+017F>ome are <hi><U+017F>olidipeda,</hi> whole-hoofed; as the <hi>Hor<U+017F>e,</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>s:</hi> <U+017F>ome are <hi>Bi<U+017F>ulca,</hi> cloven foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as the <hi>Oxe,</hi> the <hi>Goat,</hi> the <hi>Sheep,</hi> the <hi>Hogg,</hi> and the <hi>Deer:</hi> others <hi>fi<U+017F><U+017F>ipeda, <U+017F>ive digitatis pedibus,</hi> Creatures who<U+017F>e feet are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into <hi>Toes;</hi> as the <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Cat,</hi> the <hi>Cony,</hi> the <hi>Mou<U+017F>e,</hi> and the like; out of the manner of who<U+017F>e <hi>generation,</hi> we may conclude concerning the <hi>generation</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi> Wherefore, (as we have done in the <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory</hi> of the <hi>Egge,</hi> <U+017F>o) we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ingle out <U+017F>ome one kinde of the<U+017F>e, as an <hi>Exemplar</hi> or Repre<U+017F>entative of all the re<U+017F>t; which, as being mo<U+017F>t known to us, will give light to the re<U+017F>t, and

            <p>I have already given you the rea<U+017F>on, why I have drawn out documents concerning all other <hi>Egges,</hi> from the <hi>Egges</hi> of <hi>Hens:</hi> namely becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e are cheap, and every mans purcha<U+017F>e; and upon that <U+017F>core we our <U+017F>elves had the advantage to make the more diligent di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers al<U+017F>o have the better opportunity to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the truth of our doctrine.</p>
            <p>But there is more difficulty in the <U+017F>earch into the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Viviparous Animals:</hi> for we are almo<U+017F>t quite debarred of di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting the humane <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus:</hi> and to make any inquiry concerning this matter, in <hi>Hor<U+017F>es, Oxen, Goats,</hi> and other Cattel, cannot be without a great deal of paines and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>e.

            <p>Why <U+017F>ome <hi>Animals</hi> are <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and all do not produce their <hi>Foetus</hi> alive, <hi>Fabricius</hi> offers this rea<U+017F>on: namely, becau<U+017F>e <hi>egges</hi> (if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Uterus</hi> till the <hi>Pullus</hi> were hatched) would by their weight prejudice the flight of <hi>Birds.</hi> And al<U+017F>o in <hi>Serpents,</hi> or creeping things the multitude of <hi>egges</hi> would be an impediment to their winding motions.

The <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> being laied open immediately after the killing of the <hi>Deere,</hi> I have often di<U+017F>covered a <U+017F>low waving motion, (<U+017F>uch a one as is <U+017F>een in the bottom of a creeping <hi>Snailes</hi> belly) as if the <hi>Womb</hi> were <hi>Animal in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali,</hi> one living creature in another; and had a peculiar independent motion of its own.</p>
            <p>Such a kind of motion as this, I have (as I mentioned but now) often ob<U+017F>erved in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines of creatures di<U+017F><U+017F>ected alive: &amp; the <U+017F>ame may be experimented both by the te<U+017F>timony of the <U+017F>ight and touch, in live <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Conies,</hi> though you di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ect them not. I have likewi<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erved the <U+017F>ame kind of motion, in the <hi>Te<U+017F>ticles</hi> and <hi>Scrotum</hi> of the <hi>Males;</hi> and I have known <U+017F>ome <hi>Women,</hi> whom <U+017F>uch palpitations have deluded with the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child.

            <p>A little while after the fore<U+017F>aid <hi>Extuberance</hi> of the interiour <hi>coat</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> begins to <U+017F>hrink, and le<U+017F><U+017F>en: and in <U+017F>ome, (but that is rare,) a certain <hi>purulent matter</hi> doth <U+017F>tick to the fides, (in

manner of <U+017F>weat) <U+017F>uch as is vi<U+017F>ible in wounds, and ulcers, when they are <U+017F>aid to be <hi>Concocted,</hi> and ca<U+017F>t forth a white, <U+017F>mooth, and equall matter. When I fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covered this kind of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, I was in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, whether I <U+017F>hould conceit it to be the <U+017F>eed of the <hi>Male,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <hi>concocted <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ing from it.

            <p>This alteration in the Womb when I had often di<U+017F>covered to His Maje<U+017F>ties <U+017F>ight (as the fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ay towards <hi>impregnation)</hi> and having likewi<U+017F>e plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hewed that all this while no portion of <hi><U+017F>eed,</hi> or <hi>conception</hi> either was to be found in the <hi>Womb;</hi> and when the King him<U+017F>elf had communicated the <U+017F>ame as a very wonderful thing to diver<U+017F>e of his followers, a great debate at length aro<U+017F>e: The Keepers and the Hunt<U+017F>men concluded, fir<U+017F>t, that this did imply, that their conception would be late that year, &amp; thereupon accu<U+017F>ed the drougth; but afterwards when they under<U+017F>tood that the <hi>rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time</hi> was pa<U+017F>t, and gone; and that I <U+017F>tood <U+017F>tiffly upon that, they peremptorily did affirm, that I was fir<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>taken my <U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>o had drawn the King into my error; and that it could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be, but that <U+017F>omething at le<U+017F>t of the

            <p>In <hi>Bitches, Conies,</hi> and <U+017F>everal other <hi>Animals,</hi> I have certainly di<U+017F>covered, that nothing after <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to be found in their <hi>Vterus,</hi> for many daies together.

nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily in being, pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Coition.</hi> And hence it follows, that it is not true, that in a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifical coition,</hi> any matter is ready at hand in the <hi>Vterus,</hi> which matter or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, the <hi>Ma<U+017F>culine <U+017F>eed</hi> <U+017F>hould concoct, coagulate and fa<U+017F>hion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into an actual generation, or by drying its outward Superficies, Form, and After-birth to wrap it in. For nothing at all is to be found in the <hi>Womb</hi> for many days together, even to the twelfth of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is al<U+017F>o evident, that all <hi>Females,</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>coition,</hi> do not effund a <U+017F>eed into the <hi>Vterus;</hi> for neither in Hinds, or Does, or <U+017F>everal other <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals,</hi> is there any track or <U+017F>igne of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Seed,</hi> or <hi>Men<U+017F>truous blood.</hi> But what it may be, which flowes from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>alacious <hi>Women</hi> in <hi>Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as well as from <hi>Men,</hi> which procures plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure to them, and a kind of re<U+017F>olution of their <hi>Spirits;</hi> as al<U+017F>o whether it do nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily conduce to the <hi>Conception;</hi> likewi<U+017F>e whether it do proceed from the <hi>Te<U+017F>ticles,</hi> or whether it bee <hi><U+017F>eed,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>prolifical</hi> or not, we have el<U+017F>ewhere di<U+017F>covered.</p>

            <p>I return to the Birth, which <hi>Fabricius</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to come to pa<U+017F>s (be<U+017F>ides the fore-mentioned nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Re<U+017F>piration, and want of Su<U+017F>tenance) <hi>becau<U+017F>e the Foetus being grown bigger, doth pre<U+017F>s out by his weight; and al<U+017F>o can be no longer conteined within, by rea<U+017F>on of his large bulk; and likewi<U+017F>e,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>the Excrements are <U+017F>o multiplied, that there is no longer place for them in the membranes.</hi> But we have already proved, that the <hi>humours</hi> in the Wombe are not <hi>Excrementitious.</hi> Nor is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on deduced from the Weight and Magnitude of the <hi>Foetus</hi> more available then the former: for the <hi>Foetus</hi> <U+017F>wimming aloof in the <hi>humours,</hi> is <U+017F>carce any burden at all to the <hi>After-birth</hi> or <hi>Womb;</hi> for <U+017F>ome <hi>Infants</hi> of nine moneths are very litle, and le<U+017F>s then <U+017F>ome others of eight moneths onely, yet can they no longer <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the Womb. And as to the Weight, <hi>Twins</hi> of eight moneths do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate any one <U+017F>ingle <hi>Foetus</hi> what<U+017F>oever, though of nine moneths abode in the Womb, yet are they not born till the nineth moneth. Nor can we quarrel at the <U+017F>carcity of Aliment: <U+017F>ince at that time there is entertainment enough even for <hi>Twins,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes for more <hi>Infants:</hi> and al<U+017F>o the milk which is conducted to the Brea<U+017F>ts of Women in <hi>Child-bed,</hi> being recalled to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> would as conveniently <U+017F>upply the <hi>foetus</hi> in the Womb, as out of it.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hall rather impute the <hi>cau<U+017F>e</hi> of <hi>being born,</hi> to the juice conteined in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> which being

mo<U+017F>t proportionate to the nouri<U+017F>hing of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> doth either much faile, or el<U+017F>e is depraved by the admixture of the <U+017F>uperfluities. As I have al<U+017F>o hinted before.</p>
            <p>But as for the diver<U+017F>ity of <hi>going with Child,</hi> which is contrary to the time allotted by Nature (which diver<U+017F>ity doth chiefly re<U+017F>pect Women) I do a<U+017F>cribe it to the cu<U+017F>tome of living, the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the con<U+017F>titution, and the <U+017F>everal pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions incident to Women. And therefore tho<U+017F>e tame Animals, which live among<U+017F>t us, by rea<U+017F>on of their lazy lives, and plenty of food, are of more incertainty in their times of Coition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, then wild Bea<U+017F>ts, which live according to Natures intent. Likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ickly Women have ea<U+017F>ier and greater di<U+017F>patch in their <hi>Travaile,</hi> then others: but it falls out clean contrary to <U+017F>uch Women, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>trength is very much con<U+017F>umed. For the <U+017F>ame thing befalls them, as happeneth to <hi>Plants,</hi> who<U+017F>e fruits and <U+017F>eeds, do more <U+017F>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <U+017F>eldom arrive to maturity in cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, then to other <hi>Plants</hi> of the <U+017F>ame kind which are in a fat and warm <U+017F>oile.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Orenges</hi> in <hi>England</hi> adhere to the trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t two whole years together, before they come to maturity: and <hi>Figgs</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>carce ever arrive at any perfection here, which are ripe in <hi>Italy</hi> twice or thrice a year. And the like befalleth the fruits of the <hi>Womb;</hi> namely, the <hi>Foetus</hi> is brought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity <U+017F>ooner or later, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>carcity or plenty of Aliment, the imbecillity, or <U+017F>trength of the body, and the orderly or inordinate regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life (according to the <U+017F>ix non-naturall things recited by Phy<U+017F>itians.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> hath de<U+017F>cribed the Manner of the Birth, thus: <hi>The Womb being dilated by the weight</hi>

And therefore, whereas before, neither the Excrements, by means of their abundance, nor the</hi> Foetus <hi>by rea<U+017F>on of his weight could be contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any longer, the</hi> Uterus <hi>being more <U+017F>treightned and drawn together then it was, can be much le<U+017F>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to contein them, and therefore fir<U+017F>t the membranes as being the weaker parts, and more di<U+017F>tended, do break, and the humour which is mo<U+017F>t fluxile, doth fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s out to make the parts glibbe.

            <p>By which words he de<U+017F>cribes the ejectment of the Excrements of the Guts, and an Abortion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a Natural Birth: for though the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> in Women do for the mo<U+017F>t part break, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>load the Water before the Birth; yet that is not always <U+017F>o: for other Animals do not bring forth as they do, but produce the Entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception together, (namely the <hi>foetus</hi> together with the <hi>Secundines)</hi> as we may ob<U+017F>erve in <hi>Ewes, Mares, Bitches,</hi> and other Animals: and e<U+017F>pecially in the <hi>Viper,</hi> which doth conceive within an Egge which is of one onely colour, having a <U+017F>oft <U+017F>hell (<U+017F>uch as the <hi>humane conception</hi> is) and continueth that Conception <U+017F>o long within her, until a <hi>foetus</hi> be formed thereout, which <U+017F>he doth produce wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

up in a membrane, which membrane (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle)</hi> is broken up the third day. And yet it <U+017F>o happeneth, <U+017F>ometimes, that the young <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o it is no novelty to experienced Midwives, that their Women do <U+017F>ometimes bring forth their Conceptions whole, and entire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breach in the Membranes at all. And this kind of birth <U+017F>eemeth to me the mo<U+017F>t <hi>Natural;</hi> wherein the <hi>foetus</hi> (like a <hi>mellow fruit</hi> which drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth from the <hi>tree,</hi> without <U+017F>haking out its <U+017F>eed before the time a<U+017F><U+017F>igned by <hi>nature)</hi> is born with the <hi>Secundines</hi> embracing it. But, where it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwi<U+017F>e to pa<U+017F>s, and the After-burden doth adhere to the <hi>Uterus</hi> after the Child is borne: it is oftentimes hardly divided from it, and doth induce evil <hi>Symptomes,</hi> which are accompanied with noi<U+017F>ome <U+017F>mells, and <U+017F>ometimes with a <hi>Gangreen,</hi> whereby the Mother is brought into imminent danger.</p>
            <p>Becau<U+017F>e therefore the <hi>Birth</hi> de<U+017F>cribed by <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> is not agreeable to all kinds of <hi>Births,</hi> but onely to Women, and not to all their Births nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to <U+017F>uch onely who<U+017F>e Births are prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as it were forced: it is to be ranked rather among<U+017F>t <hi>preternatural, precipitate,</hi> and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort abortive productions.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Genuine Birth,</hi> therefore, two <note place="margin">Two things required in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Birth.</note> things are required, which are a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant the one to the other, that is to <U+017F>ay, the Woman in travaile, and the <hi>Foetus</hi> which is to be produced. Both which, except they be ripe for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, the Birth is hardly <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful. For if the <hi>Foetus</hi> being di<U+017F>quiet, and coveting to be enlarged, doe prevent his parent by exciting her, and offering
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:56144:265"/>
violence to her womb: or if the Mother, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the infirmity of her retention, (as if her womb were di<U+017F>turbed with a kind of nau<U+017F>eou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s) or by <U+017F>ome nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of expul<U+017F>ion, be before hand with the Infant, the Birth is to be reputed a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e or Symptome, rather then a Natural and critical Production. As al<U+017F>o when <U+017F>ome parts of the conception e<U+017F>cape out, and others are <U+017F>til retaind within: namly, if the <hi>Foetus</hi> attempt a departure ere the After-burden be di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed from the <U+017F>ides of the Womb; or el<U+017F>e the After-burden, on the contrary, be loo<U+017F>e from the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> being not rightly compo<U+017F>ed, nor the <hi>Uterus</hi> relaxed for the accommodation of the work. And therefore the younger, more giddy, and officious Midwives are to be rebuked; which, when they hear the woman in travaile, cry out for paine, and call for help; le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem unskilful at their trade, and le<U+017F>s bu<U+017F>ie then comes to their <U+017F>hare, by daubing over their hands with oyles, and di<U+017F>tending the parts of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> do mightily be<U+017F>tirre them<U+017F>elves, and provoke the expul<U+017F>ive faculty by medicinal poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <U+017F>o that being impatient of a competent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, by their de<U+017F>ire to ha<U+017F>ten and promote the Birth, they do rather retard and pervert it, and make it an unnatural and difficult delivery; and leaving the Membranes, or <U+017F>ome part of the <hi>After-burden</hi> <U+017F>till adhering to the Womb, they do both expo<U+017F>e the poor women to the injuries of the Aire; and vainly per<U+017F>wading them to their three-legged <U+017F>toole, weary them out, and bring them in danger of their lives. It is much happier with poor women, and tho<U+017F>e that dare not own their great bellies, where the Midwives help is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver required; for the longer they retain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard

the Birth, the ea<U+017F>ier, and more <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfull proves the delivery.</p>
            <p>And therefore there are chiefly two <U+017F>orts of Unnatural Births; namely when the <hi>foetus</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>born before,</hi> or <hi>after the time</hi> allotted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: (and this is a kinde of Abortive Birth) and the Birth proves difficult and painful, becau<U+017F>e it doth not <U+017F>ucceed in that manner, and order as it ought to do: or el<U+017F>e is hindered by <U+017F>ome bad <hi>Symptomes:</hi> which cometh to pa<U+017F>s cheifly for two rea<U+017F>ons: namely, in that the Mother doth faile in her expul<U+017F>ive office, or el<U+017F>e that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is him<U+017F>elf but <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>o doth not promote his own relea<U+017F>e: for a facile and natural delivery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth upon the endavour and joint furtherance of both parties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth a<U+017F>cribe the work of bringing forth to the <hi>Uterus, to which performance,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Lower Belly, and the Midrifle are a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tants.</hi> But when I con<U+017F>ider the matter throughly, the throws of the woman in travaile do <U+017F>eem to proceed from the Motion and Agitation of all the Body, (ju<U+017F>t as we find it in Sternutation.) I knew a young Woman, which by rea<U+017F>on of her extream torment in her travaile fell into a Sowne; and became in<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>o con<U+017F>ternated, <U+017F>tupid, and <U+017F>lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that nothing could recover her. I being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to her cure (finding that <hi>Cly<U+017F>ters,</hi> and other proper remedies had been applied to no purpo<U+017F>e, and that nothing could go down her throat) I put up a feather which was dipped in a <U+017F>trong <hi>Sneezing medicine,</hi> into her <hi>No<U+017F>e;</hi> by which being moved (though <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o overwhelmed with a deep <U+017F>tupidity, that <U+017F>he could neither <hi><U+017F>neeze,</hi> nor be <hi>awaked)</hi> <U+017F>he began to be <U+017F>eized by a kind of <hi>general Convul<U+017F>ion,</hi> all her <hi>body</hi> over, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

at the <hi><U+017F>houlders,</hi> did by degrees extend it <U+017F>elf to the <hi>lower parts.</hi> But as often as I applied this <hi>provocation</hi> to her, her delivery was advanced and came on, and at la<U+017F>t, the Mother being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it her <U+017F>elf, and remaining <U+017F>till in her <U+017F>leepy condition, a healthy and <U+017F>prightly Child was <hi>born</hi> into the world.</p>
            <p>We may ob<U+017F>erve the manner of their <hi>throwes,</hi> in other <hi>Animals:</hi> (as in the <hi>Ewe,</hi> the <hi>Bitch,</hi> and in great <hi>Cattel)</hi> wherein we <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover that it is not by the <hi><U+017F>ole action</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or <hi>Belly</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but is the joint conflict of <hi>all the whole body.</hi> And how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth conferre to the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeration</hi> and <hi>facilitating</hi> of his owne <hi>Birth,</hi> is cheifly <hi>evident</hi> in <hi>Oviparous Creatures:</hi> for it is apparent that the <hi>Foetus</hi> it <U+017F>elf, and not the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> doth break through the <U+017F>hell.

            <p>But how great furtherance the <hi>foetus</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to its own <hi>Birth,</hi> <U+017F>everal ob<U+017F>ervations doe clearly evince. A certain <hi>Woman</hi> here among<U+017F>t us (I <U+017F>peak it knowingly) was, (being dead over night) left alone in her Chamber: but the next morning an Infant was there found between her <hi>Leggs,</hi> which had by his own force wrought his <hi>relea<U+017F>e. Gregorius Nymmanus,</hi> hath collected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine examples of this nature out of approved Authors.</p>
            <p>I al<U+017F>o knew a <hi>Woman,</hi> who had all the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part of the neck of her <hi>Womb</hi> excoriated and torne, by a <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>painful delivery:</hi> <U+017F>o that her time of <hi>Lying in</hi> being over, though <U+017F>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Child againe afterward, yet not onely the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> neer the <hi>Nymphae</hi> did clo<U+017F>e together, but all the whole <hi>Cavity</hi> thereof, even to the <hi>inner Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> whereby there was no entrance even
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:56144:267"/>
for a <U+017F>mall <hi>probe,</hi> nor yet any egre<U+017F>s to her <hi>u<U+017F>ual fluxes.</hi> Hereupon the time of her delivery being now arrived, the poor <U+017F>oul was lamentably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and laying a<U+017F>ide all expectation of being delivered, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>igned up her keys to her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and <U+017F>etting her affairs in order, <U+017F>he took leave of all her friends. When behold, beyond expectation, by the <U+017F>trong conte<U+017F>t of a very lu<U+017F>ty Infant, the whole tract was forced open, and <U+017F>he was miraculou<U+017F>ly <hi>delivered;</hi> the lu<U+017F>ty Child pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>author of his own,</hi> and <hi>his Parents life,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age open for the re<U+017F>t of his Brethren who <U+017F>hould be borne in time to come. For, proper applications being admini<U+017F>tered, his Mother was re<U+017F>tored to her former health.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hall adde one example more memorable then this. The Queen had an exceeding white <hi>Mare,</hi> excellently <U+017F>haped, pre<U+017F>ented unto her: who<U+017F>e <hi>genitall parts</hi> (le<U+017F>t by going to Hor<U+017F>e <U+017F>hee might endanger the beauty of her proportions, and become unfit for u<U+017F>e) were, as the cu<U+017F>tome is, locked up all with iron rings. Notwith<U+017F>tanding which, this <hi>Mare</hi> (by what accident I cannot tell, nor could the Groomes inform me) was made <hi>big with Foale:</hi> and at la<U+017F>t, when they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no <U+017F>uch matter, <U+017F>he foaled by night, and the <hi>Foale</hi> was found alive next morning by the <hi>mares</hi> <U+017F>ide. When I came to heare thereof, I went pre<U+017F>ently to the Stables, and <U+017F>aw both the <hi>labia</hi> of the <hi>lap,</hi> which were locked up with <hi>rings,</hi> and all the <hi>privity</hi> towards the left <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>o torne and dilacerated from the <hi>right haunch-bone,</hi> that the unity of that mo<U+017F>t tight part being di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, by the incredible force of the young <hi>Foale,</hi> hee might ea<U+017F>ily finde a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through that wide gap. So forcible is the vigour and efficacy of a <hi>mature</hi> and <hi>liuely Foetus.</hi>

But on the contrary, in ca<U+017F>e the <hi>Foetus</hi> be <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and langui<U+017F>hing, or borne before its time; it is not properly a <hi>birth,</hi> but an <hi>abortment:</hi> and the <hi>Foetus</hi> is rather <hi>ejected,</hi> then <hi>borne:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he be now <U+017F>ome dayes old, he will neither take the <hi>brea<U+017F>t</hi> kindly, nor depo<U+017F>ite his <hi>excrements</hi> as he ought to doe.</p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Uterus</hi> hath its <U+017F>hare in this bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of <hi>Delivery:</hi> as <U+017F>hall appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example. A poor woman, who was a <hi>Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s,</hi> did for a long time labour under the <hi>Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down,</hi> or precipitation of her <hi>wombe,</hi> and the <hi><U+017F>heath</hi> thereof did hang down to the bigne<U+017F>s of ones <hi>fi<U+017F>t,</hi> and at length, u<U+017F>ing no applications to it, her grief grew <U+017F>o forcible upon her, that it now begun to re<U+017F>emble a <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the skin being rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and <U+017F>qualid; and yet found now le<U+017F>s paine or trouble in it, then <U+017F>he was formerly u<U+017F>ed to find, when it newly bore down. But, <U+017F>he asking my advice, I coun<U+017F>elled her to keep her <hi>Bed</hi> for <U+017F>ome certain dayes, and to mollifie the <hi>dryer parts</hi> thereof with <hi>fomentations,</hi> and <hi>oyntments,</hi> and <U+017F>o when her <hi>wombe</hi> was reduced into her <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to keep it <U+017F>till up with <hi>pe<U+017F><U+017F>aries</hi> and <hi><U+017F>wathes,</hi> till by the u<U+017F>e of drying and <U+017F>trengthening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies it was confirmed and <U+017F>etled in its <hi>proper place.</hi> The cure did for <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>ucceed to our wi<U+017F>h; but <U+017F>he being poor, was fain to fall to her calling again, to get money, and <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting her appointed <hi>applications,</hi> <U+017F>he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>relap<U+017F>e,</hi> and endured it pretty well, her <hi>womb</hi> <U+017F>ometimes retiring back again, and <U+017F>ometimes continuing quite out; but for the mo<U+017F>t part, at night <U+017F>he did reduce it, and there it remained for <U+017F>ome time. But after many dayes, <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf to me again, complaining that her

And yet applying <U+017F>ome <hi>oyntments</hi> which I had pre<U+017F>cribed, <U+017F>he had forced it in againe, but her cure did not continue long: for no <U+017F>ooner did <U+017F>he ri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>tand upon her leggs, and <U+017F>o goe about her work, but her <hi>wombe</hi> did pre<U+017F>ently, by rea<U+017F>on of its <hi>bulke</hi> and <hi>weight,</hi> di<U+017F>turbe her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and would ea<U+017F>ily beare downe upon any occa<U+017F>ion.

            <p>Wherefore, in my judgment, the <hi>Coat</hi> which <hi>Fabricius</hi> calls <hi>Allantoides,</hi> is the meer <hi>Chorion:</hi> and yet the <hi>Antients</hi> called it <hi>Allantoides,</hi> from the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of a <hi>double-pudding,</hi> which it doth re<U+017F>emble.

            </p>

            <p>And therefore that <hi>Coat</hi> which <hi>Fabricius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Allantoides,</hi> I either conceive to be the <hi>Choriou,</hi> or that <U+017F>omething praeter-natural had befalne <U+017F>ome <hi>Animal</hi> which he had <U+017F>een.

But (both with the <hi>Antients,</hi> and the <hi>whole School</hi> of <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians)</hi> he doth confe<U+017F>s, that the <hi>Chorion</hi> doth contain Urine; where hee <U+017F>aith, that <hi>two humours</hi> are about the <hi>foetus,</hi> the one being <hi>Sweat,</hi> which is in the <hi>Amnion,</hi> the other <hi>Urine,</hi> which is contained in the <hi>Chorion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it is manife<U+017F>t, that the <hi>Antients</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood one &amp; the <U+017F>ame <hi>membrane</hi> under a double compellation; namely, in <hi>cloven-footed bea<U+017F>ts,</hi> (in whom alone it is found) they called it <hi>Allan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of its <hi>figure:</hi> but in other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> they called it <hi>Chorion,</hi> from its <hi>emploiment,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they conceived it was de<U+017F>igned for the entertainment of the Urine.

confe<U+017F>s that this <hi>Coat</hi> is neither found in a <hi>Man,</hi> nor any other <hi>Animals.</hi> For what need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Coat</hi> to entertain the Urine, when that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by their own confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, is already executed by the <hi>Chorion?</hi> And indeed, there can no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable rea<U+017F>on be alledged why that <hi>coat</hi> <U+017F>hould be found in <hi>Sheep, Goats,</hi> and other <hi>bea<U+017F>ts</hi> which cleave the <hi>hoof,</hi> and not al<U+017F>o in <hi>Dogs, Cats, Mice,</hi> and <hi>Others.</hi> For if it were in<U+017F>tituted for the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Urine, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that the <hi>foetus</hi> of <hi>Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Cowes,</hi> <U+017F>hould either abound with greater plenty of Urine then other <hi>animals</hi> which have <hi>Teeth</hi> in both <hi>Jawes;</hi> or el<U+017F>e, that there are three diver<U+017F>e kindes of <hi>humours;</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t two Receptacles of the <hi>Urine.</hi> For this I am <U+017F>ure, that the <hi>Chorion</hi> is from the fir<U+017F>t beginning full of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But I do not here intend to di<U+017F>pute contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ies, I <U+017F>hall rather rehear<U+017F>e what I have found by experience.</p>

            <p>There came forth a Book of late, wrote by <hi>Adrianus Spigelius,</hi> entituled <hi>De formato Foetu,</hi> of the formed <hi>foetus:</hi> wherein he treateth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the U<U+017F>e of the Umbilical Arteries; and doth demon<U+017F>trate by powerful arguments, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth not receive its Vital Spirits by the Arteries from the <hi>Mother:</hi> and hath fully an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tho<U+017F>e arguments which are alledged to the contrary.

               <hi>FAbricius</hi> hath indeed recounted many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous things, concerning the <hi>Birth,</hi> but wee meet with more things worthy our wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Conception.</hi> It is indeed a dark, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cure bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; however we <U+017F>hall adventure to propo<U+017F>e <U+017F>omething in a <hi>problematical</hi> way, in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort that it <U+017F>hall appeare we doe not onely goe about to <U+017F>ubvert other mens opinions, but al<U+017F>o to di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>e our owne. And yet what<U+017F>oever falleth from me concerning this <U+017F>ubject, I de<U+017F>ire may not be <U+017F>o taken, as if I conceived them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by an <hi>Oracle;</hi> but that liberty which I freely allow all other men, I doe of right chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to my <U+017F>elf; that <U+017F>o I may offer tho<U+017F>e things as true, which <U+017F>eem probable in <U+017F>uch dark mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, until <U+017F>uch time as they can be convinced of fal<U+017F>ity or errour.</p>
            <p>This imployment doth chiefly relate to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> without who<U+017F>e <hi>preparations</hi> and <hi>functions,</hi> you may in vaine expect a <hi>Conception.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it is certaine, that the <hi>Geniture</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> doth not <U+017F>o much as reach to the <hi>cavity</hi> of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> much le<U+017F>s abide there for any time; that <hi>geniture</hi> doth derive <hi>foecundity</hi> to the <hi>Uterus</hi> only by a kinde of <hi>contagion,</hi> (not as if it were now <hi>tangent,</hi> and <hi>operating,</hi> but becau<U+017F>e it hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>touched.)</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> or <hi>Female</hi> doth <U+017F>eem after the <hi><U+017F>permatical, contact</hi> (in <hi>coition)</hi> to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the <U+017F>ame manner, and to be rendered <hi>prolifical,</hi> by no <hi><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible corporeal Agent,</hi> as the <hi>Iron</hi>

touched by the <hi>Load<U+017F>tone,</hi> is pre<U+017F>ently indowed with the virtue of the <hi>Load<U+017F>tone,</hi> and doth draw other iron-bodies unto it.

            </p>
            <p>But I cannot but wonder, where that <hi>faculty,</hi> (when the act of <hi>coition</hi> is fini<U+017F>hed, before the production of the <hi>Egge</hi> or <hi>Conception</hi> doth re<U+017F>ide? and to what that <hi>active vertue</hi> of the <hi>Male</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted? namely, whether to the <hi>Uterus</hi> alone, or to the whole <hi>Female?</hi> or rather, primarily to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> but <U+017F>econdarily to the <hi>Female?</hi> or la<U+017F>tly, whether, as we <U+017F>ee with our <hi>eyes,</hi> and think with our <hi>braines,</hi> <U+017F>o a <hi>female</hi> doth conceive with her <hi>Vterus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the <hi>female</hi> <U+017F>ometimes (conceiving after <hi>coition)</hi> doth not produce a <hi>Foetus:</hi> yet we know that tho<U+017F>e <hi>Symptomes</hi> did en<U+017F>ue, which gave a cleare te<U+017F>timony of a <hi>conception</hi> <U+017F>et on foot, (though it came to nothing.) Your litle <hi>Bitches</hi> which are kept too plentifully, and thereupon admit <hi>coition</hi> (without <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s) are notwith<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ob<U+017F>erved to be <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h about the ju<U+017F>t time whereat they ought to <hi>puppy,</hi> and bark as if they were in <hi>di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,</hi> and likewi<U+017F>e filtch away the young <hi>whelps</hi> from another <hi>Bitch,</hi> and lick them over and cheri<U+017F>h them, (as tenderly as if they were their own natural productions) and fight eagerly to keep them from the true <hi>Parent.</hi> Nay <U+017F>ome of them have <hi>milk,</hi> or <hi>bee<U+017F>tings</hi> (as they call it) in their <hi>teats;</hi> and are obnoxious to the di<U+017F>tempers incident to tho<U+017F>e that have really <hi>pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied;</hi>

            <p>And from this Appetite or Conception it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pa<U+017F>s, that the female doth produce an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pring like the male Genitor. For as we, from the Conception of the Form, or Idea, in the Braine, do fa<U+017F>hion a form like to it in our works, <U+017F>o doth the Idea or Species of the Genitor, re<U+017F>iding in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> by the help of the formative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, beget a <hi>Foetus</hi> like the Genitor him<U+017F>elf; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by implanting that <hi>Immaterial <U+017F>pecies</hi> which it hath, upon its Workman<U+017F>hip.
