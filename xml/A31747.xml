         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any will perhaps wonder, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>o many famous Authours,
Antient and Modern, who have
written of <hi>VIPERS,</hi> I <U+017F>hould
yet undertake to labour in an
Argument, which in all likelihood they <U+017F>hould
have exhau<U+017F>ted. But if reflexion be made
on the many wonders, that are found in the
Body of this Animal, it will be ea<U+017F>ily granted,
that it cannot be inquir'd into with too much
exactne<U+017F>s, and that it is not a work, that can
be fini<U+017F>h't at one or two <U+017F>ittings.</p>
            <p>What Ob<U+017F>ervations have been left us by
knowing men, although they be not carried to
their perfection, may be very u<U+017F>eful to tho<U+017F>e,
that are come after them, to make them di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what had e<U+017F>caped their diligence. And
without this aid, I <U+017F>hould not have had the
<pb facs="tcp:60888:4"/>
confidence of undertaking this Work; in which
I have propos'd to my <U+017F>elf three main things,
that may much contribute to the illu<U+017F>tration
of the Hi<U+017F>tory concerning <hi>Vipers.</hi> The <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi>
is, to examine <U+017F>undry Ob<U+017F>ervations of the
Antients, which have hitherto pa<U+017F>s'd for
true, though mo<U+017F>t of them are not <U+017F>o. The
<hi><U+017F>econd,</hi> to give an accompt of other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations,
which have been unknown to our
Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors. The <hi>third,</hi> to find in the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
which cau<U+017F>eth <U+017F>o many mi<U+017F>chiefs, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Remedies again<U+017F>t its Biting, which
had not been di<U+017F>cover'd before, and may
<U+017F>erve to overcome many trouble<U+017F>om Di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which the ordinary Remedies were not
able to conquer.</p>
            <p>The Enterpri<U+017F>e, certainly, is bold; and,
I confe<U+017F>s, I <U+017F>hould never have compa<U+017F>s'd it,
what hope <U+017F>oever I might have conceived
of it, had I not been a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by <U+017F>ome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Phy<U+017F>itians, who<U+017F>e light hath been very
helpful to me.</p>
            <p>Their Mode<U+017F>ty permits not, I <U+017F>hould here
name them; it <U+017F>ufficeth the Publick to
know, that a good part of the rare things
in this Treati<U+017F>e is due to them. They had
the kindne<U+017F>s to meet often at my Hou<U+017F>e for
the <U+017F>pace of three months, and there to <U+017F>ee
<pb facs="tcp:60888:4"/>
made exact Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of <hi>Vipers,</hi> which by
my care were brought to me from all Parts
of this Kingdom; and to <U+017F>ee al<U+017F>o Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
tryed of their biting, upon divers A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
and to examine their Bodies, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
open'd after their death, to di<U+017F>cover
the true cau<U+017F>e of it; and to pre<U+017F>cribe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
an<U+017F>werable to their Conjectures,
and to take notice of the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of the
<U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>In di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting all the<U+017F>e <hi>Vipers,</hi> we were
willing to <U+017F>ee the parts, which Authors have
taken notice of, and which have al<U+017F>o been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented
in the Books of <U+017F>ome of them:
And comparing them with the Natural ones,
that were before our Eyes, we found great
omi<U+017F><U+017F>ions of very con<U+017F>iderable parts; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of <U+017F>ome imaginary ones, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>entations
and <U+017F>cituations of <U+017F>everal that
were ill de<U+017F>igned, and ill enough placed. It
was thought fit, I <U+017F>hould endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<U+017F>omething more accompli<U+017F>h't: And
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> who<U+017F>e skill and dexterity in
the Art of De<U+017F>igning and Graving is known
and e<U+017F>teem'd of all the World, in things of
a far <U+017F>ublimer nature than the Anatomy of
<hi>Vipers,</hi> being happily pre<U+017F>ent at one of our
meetings, and taking great plea<U+017F>ure to oblige
<pb facs="tcp:60888:5"/>
his Friends, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed from that very time,
that he was very willing to <U+017F>econd my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions:
And having received from me
a <U+017F>ufficient number of Subjects, hath taken
the pains to de<U+017F>ign them after the life, and
thereupon to grave all the con<U+017F>iderable parts
of this Animal. In a word, I have omitted
nothing of what might render my De<U+017F>ign an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>werable
to the wi<U+017F>hes of all Learned and
Curious men.</p>
            <p>Now as tho<U+017F>e, who, <U+017F>peaking of a matter
that hath been often handled by others, cannot
but mu<U+017F>t often repeat again, what hath been
already <U+017F>aid of it; I thought, I was not to
<U+017F>cruple to enlarge my <U+017F>elf a little, that I
might not give an imperfect Anatomy of
the <hi>Viper,</hi> of which it was fit enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribe
as well the great number of the true
parts, that have been known to our Ance<U+017F>tors,
as the new ones, by me found after them.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>ay nothing of my way of Writing.
From a per<U+017F>on of my profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, you are not
to expect the Elegancy and Purity of our
Tongue. I thought it enough for me, to
deliver my <U+017F>elf clearly and intelligibly,
which is, in my opinion, all that could be
expected from me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60888:5"/>
For the re<U+017F>t, I think, I am the fir<U+017F>t, that
hath given to <hi>France</hi> a <hi>Treati<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
in its Native Language. Tho<U+017F>e who
under<U+017F>tand no other Languages, may think
them<U+017F>elves obliged by it, in regard they
would el<U+017F>e have been ignorant of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of things, that de<U+017F>erve to be known.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not, what ground
the Antient Writers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Animal had, to
<U+017F>ay, that in the Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
the Male did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ert
his Head into the
throat of the Female, and
there emitted his <U+017F>eed, thence falling into
her <hi>Matrix,</hi> where <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t did form Eggs
and then Young Vipers: That the Female,
finding a titillation from the emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
the <U+017F>eed, <U+017F>napp'd off with her teeth the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60888:14"/>
head of the Male, and <U+017F>o kill'd him; and
that the Young Vipers, being ready to be
brought forth, did pierce the Womb and
the <U+017F>ides of their Damm, to make a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
for them<U+017F>elves; <U+017F>o that by killing her,
they revenged in <U+017F>ome manner the death of
their Sire.</p>
               <p>I confe<U+017F>s, that this Story, or Tale rather,
having neither rea<U+017F>on nor experience on its
<U+017F>ide, I cannot take the part of tho<U+017F>e Authors.
I e<U+017F>teem, that a Viper, which is a kind of
creeping Serpent, is indeed procreated by
the conjunction of Male and Female; but this
is done by means of the Organs de<U+017F>igned for
Generation; of which we <U+017F>hall make a de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
in their proper place, and which
this Animal hath common with all others,
and that more in number, than mo<U+017F>t Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>The Viper differs from other Serpents,
not only in this, that it creeps more <U+017F>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and jumps not; but chiefly herein, that
its little ones receive their perfection in the
womb, and come forth alive after the u<U+017F>ual
manner; whereas the Femals of other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
lay Eggs, which they incubate,
and hatch, either in the Sun, or in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60888:14"/>
The Viper is by many taken for an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of malice and cruelty; but in reality
<U+017F>he is guilty of no <U+017F>uch thing, if <U+017F>he be not
hurt or vex'd; for, if <U+017F>he be, <U+017F>he becoms fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
aud bites very piercingly: but <U+017F>he
never a<U+017F><U+017F>aults Man or bea<U+017F>t, except <U+017F>he be
angred. And if at times it happen, that
<U+017F>he bites <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>on or other <U+017F>leeping in
the field, certainly that Body mu<U+017F>t have
thru<U+017F>t or otherwi<U+017F>e hit her; for el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
would never have bit him.</p>
               <p>It may very well be <U+017F>aid, that by that
means the Stratagem of <hi>Annibal</hi> <U+017F>ucceeded,
when he cau<U+017F>ed a quantity of earthen Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
fill'd with Vipers to be thrown into the
Shipps of the King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
in regard that on the one hand the
Pots being broken, did hurt and anger the
Vipers, and <U+017F>tirr'd them up to bite what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was within the reach of their teeth; and
on the other, the <U+017F>ight of the<U+017F>e creeping
Creatures, <U+017F>cattered about here and there in
the Ships, frighted the Souldiers and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
them, <U+017F>o that they could not fight.</p>
               <p>Mean time a Viper attacks and kills tho<U+017F>e
Animals, which <U+017F>he means to devour for
her nouri<U+017F>hment, as Spani<U+017F>h Flyes, Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Froggs, Mice, Moles, Lizzards and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60888:15"/>
like; which <U+017F>he <U+017F>wallows whole, after <U+017F>he
hath kill'd them with her bigger Teeth.
The <U+017F>maller prey <U+017F>he <U+017F>ends down whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her <U+017F>tomach; the bigger <U+017F>he partly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in her <U+017F>tomach, partly in her wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and.</p>
               <p>There can hardly be made any perfect
dige<U+017F>tion in the Stomach of Vipers, both
becau<U+017F>e the heat is there not well united, by
rea<U+017F>on of the great aperture, there is at the
mouth, where the Oe<U+017F>ophagus or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
ends; and becau<U+017F>e they have not moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
enough to help the fermentation and
the Concoction of food. But yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not * the conveyance of the Juyce and
of the fine<U+017F>t part of the <U+017F>wallow'd animals
into all the parts of their body for nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Which is not performed but in the
<U+017F>pace of many days, during which, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
and <U+017F>uperfluities of the nutriment
are carried into the Gutts, whence the gro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er
parts of them are ca<U+017F>t out again by the
mouth. This we have lately ob<U+017F>erv'd in a
great part of the body of a Lizzard, which
a Viper vomited up twelve days after <U+017F>he
was taken; where we <U+017F>aw, that, of the head
and of the fore-leggs, and of that part of
the body contiguous to them, and which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60888:15"/>
could conveniently be placed in the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
of the Viper, there re<U+017F>ted little more
than the Bones; but that a great part of
the trunk, together with the hind-leggs,
and the whole taile, were in a manner in a
condition, as if the Viper had <U+017F>wallow'd
them that day, as appears in the 2d Figure.
But we were <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, among other things,
to <U+017F>ee, that the parts, which could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <U+017F>tomach, and had remained in the
<hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagus,</hi> had kept <U+017F>o long well, I mean,
without <U+017F>uffring any alteration in the skin;
although tho<U+017F>e underneath had contracted
<U+017F>ome lividne<U+017F>s, which perhaps was an effect
of the venemou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the biting.</p>
               <p>Vipers can live for many months without
any food, and after they are once taken,
they eat no more, living then only upon
the Air, they take in. And although they
be greedy enough of Lizzards, when at
liberty, yet I have found, that having
thrown Lizzards alive into a barrel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I kept a good number of living Vipers,
and leaving them there whole days and
nights, the Vipers did no hurt at all to the
Lizzards.</p>
               <p>The Sub<U+017F>tance of Vipers is vi<U+017F>cous and
compact, and peri<U+017F>heth not but very <U+017F>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60888:16"/>
and difficultly. Their Skin is <U+017F>caly, which
defends them from the injuries of the Air,
and maketh that the Spirits unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<U+017F>o firmly to the body, that 'tis hard
for them to quit it; and we <U+017F>ee, that they
remain yet many hours in the Head and in
all the parts of the trunk, after tis flead,
emptied of all the gutts, and cut in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pieces: And this is the cau<U+017F>e, that the
motions and windings <U+017F>o long continue in
them; that the Head is able to bite, and
its biting as dangerous, as when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was entire; and that the Heart, even
after it is pull'd out of the body, and <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the other inward parts, keeps its
beating for many hours. Whence it may
be concluded, that the Viper, which is
compo<U+017F>ed of parts <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in which are found <U+017F>uch perfect
Spirits, can impart to Man what it hath
mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>ht and in <U+017F>o great abundance:
So that we need not wonder, if we find the
remedies, we draw from its body, are of a
not-ordinary vertue.</p>
               <p>A Viper voids not much excrement,
and what <U+017F>he voyds is not offen<U+017F>ive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
that of <hi>Snakes</hi> <U+017F>tinks much, and hath the
<U+017F>mell of <U+017F>tale and corrupt Urine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60888:16"/>
have we ever found any ill <U+017F>mell in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, wherein we u<U+017F>ed to
keep Vipers alive, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome viper or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had been dead and putrifyed. For my
part, I have never received any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from any ill air, which <U+017F>ome pretend to
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue forth at the opening of tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</p>
               <p>Vipers make no holes in the Earth to hide
them<U+017F>elves in, as other Serpents do; but
ordinarily they hide them<U+017F>elves under
<U+017F>tones or old ruines, where they may be
often found heaped up and wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in clu<U+017F>ters. When 'tis fair weather, they
love to lurk under bu<U+017F>hes and tufted plants.</p>
               <p>They commonly couple twice a year, the
fir<U+017F>t time in the month of <hi>March;</hi> and they
goe with their young ones 4. or 5. months;

a good inch thick; but that of Females
is bigger, when they are with young, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially
when the young ones are ready to
come forth. They are commonly two
good foot long; and there are <U+017F>ome, that
are <U+017F>omewhat longer. Their head, which
is flat, hath a kind of border round about
the edges of its upper part, and in that
they differ from <hi>Snakes,</hi> which have all
that round bared and taken down, and
the Head <U+017F>harper and narrower, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Body.</p>
                  <p>The Head of a Viper is in all an inch
long, and towards the top thereof it is 7
or 8 lines broad; and then le<U+017F><U+017F>ening by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, it is not above 4 or 5 lines
broad about the Eyes, and 2 lines onely
about the end of the No<U+017F>e. It is about 2
lines thick.</p>
                  <p>The Neck, taken where it begins, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bigne<U+017F>s of a mans little finger.
That of Males is ordinarily a little thicker
than that of Females: Yet there are <U+017F>ome
of the Females, which, when full, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have a Neck even thicker than that
of Males.</p>
                  <p>The Tail of Males is always longer and

the parts of generation double; and in

bigger. This of the Males is about four
fingers <U+017F>quare long; but that of Females not
much longer than three. The upper part
of the Taile of Males is, at its beginning,
about the bigne<U+017F>s of their Neck, and ends

                  <p>NO Vipers are <U+017F>een, but they have
their skin <U+017F>potted: but the ground
of the colour is different enough; for <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis whiti<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ometimes reddi<U+017F>h, in
<U+017F>ome 'tis gray, in others yellow, in others
tawny. This ground is always <U+017F>peckled
with black <U+017F>pots, or at lea<U+017F>t much darker
ones than the re<U+017F>t; they appear like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

even enough, and an<U+017F>wering one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
e<U+017F>pecially on the top and the <U+017F>ides
of the Body. Some of them are al<U+017F>o up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60888:18"/>
the Head, and among the re<U+017F>t, two
in the form of Horns, which take
their ri<U+017F>e between both Eyes, and open
them<U+017F>elves and reach towards the two <U+017F>ides
of the top of the Head, and are <U+017F>ometimes
4. or 5. lines long, each of them, and
halfe a line broad. Oppo<U+017F>ite to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the<U+017F>e two horns, there appears a
<U+017F>peck of the bigne<U+017F>s of a <U+017F>mall Lentile,
being <U+017F>haped like the Iron of a Pike: And
this is that, which is, as 'twere, the fir<U+017F>t and
principal of all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>pecks, <U+017F>eeming to
guide them all along the Back-bone.</p>
                  <p>The Skin is all cover'd with Scales, the
greate<U+017F>t, <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable
of which, are tho<U+017F>e under the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and <U+017F>ome under part of the Head.
Their bigne<U+017F>s and force is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for
them, to fortify the Viper in the place
that is feeble<U+017F>t and lea<U+017F>t capable of defence;
be<U+017F>ides that they <U+017F>upport the Animal, and
<U+017F>erve it, in<U+017F>tead of feet, for creeping, and
for carrying its Body to and fro. The<U+017F>e
great Scales are alwayes of the colour of
Steel, from one end to the other, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from tho<U+017F>e of Snakes, which are
commonly mark'd with a yellow colour.
They open, and <U+017F>tick, according as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60888:19"/>
Viper will recoyle, or <U+017F>top. The extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the<U+017F>e great Scales is, as 'twere,
<U+017F>ow'd beneath the other little Scales, which
cover the whole Body. Tho<U+017F>e under the
Head, reach in their breadth towards the
two Jawes; they are le<U+017F><U+017F>er, <U+017F>treighter and
<U+017F>ofter than tho<U+017F>e under the Belly, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
at other <U+017F>maller Scales, which go
on to cover the whole undermo<U+017F>t part of
the Head, and, beginning their ranks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ends before, continue them at
the <U+017F>ides of tho<U+017F>e ranks as far as towards
the bottom of the Jaws.</p>
                  <p>From the beginning of the Neck unto the
beginning of the Tayl, there are as many
great Scales, as there are <hi>vertebraes</hi> or
Joynts of the Back-bone; and as each
<hi>Vertebra</hi> hath on each <U+017F>ide a Ribb, each
Scale meets by its two ends the points of
both, and <U+017F>erves them for a defence and
<U+017F>tay: the <U+017F>ame abuts al<U+017F>o on each <U+017F>ide at
the end of one rank of litle <U+017F>cales, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the re<U+017F>t of the Body is covered, and
it <U+017F>eems, that 'tis placed there to receive
them. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall <U+017F>cales are admirably
well ranged, they lying upon one another,
and repre<U+017F>enting each as 'twere halfe a round
towards their extremity. Their ranks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60888:19"/>
always <U+017F>loping, whether you look on
them from the right <U+017F>ide to the left, or
from the left to the right; <U+017F>ome what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the ranks of <U+017F>mall Slate,
that are cut in a halfe round, in <U+017F>ome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<U+017F>een in olthe tops of hou<U+017F>es. The<U+017F>e
Scales are more or le<U+017F>s great, according as
the part of the Body, they cover, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or le<U+017F><U+017F>er. The Symmetry of them is
always very exqui<U+017F>ite and even; and is <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the great Scales, united to their
ranks beneath. There are al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erv'd on
the top of the<U+017F>e Scales, and all along the
Back, many fine and di<U+017F>tinct Lines, pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
<U+017F>treight along from the hind-part of the
Head unto the end of the Tayl.</p>
                  <p>The Scales, that are under the Tayl from
the beginning of it to the end, are divided,
and yet they appear united and ranged in
the middle by a very orderly and plea<U+017F>ing
compartment; and their bigne<U+017F>s goes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>hing
in proportion with the Tayl.</p>
                  <p>The Skin of the Head is al<U+017F>o covered
with <U+017F>mall <U+017F>cales, and at the end of the
No<U+017F>e turned up, and <U+017F>o on, even round
about, as far as towards the Eyes, in the
manner of a <U+017F>wines-<U+017F>nout.</p>
                  <p>There are ob<U+017F>erved only <U+017F>ix openings in

the Skin of a Viper: the bigge<U+017F>t is that of
its Throat; the other four are tho<U+017F>e of the
two No<U+017F>trils, and of the two Eyes; the
la<U+017F>t is that, which is at the lower-mo<U+017F>t end
of the Belly, where is the beginning of the
Tayl, which inclo<U+017F>eth not only the hole of
the Gut for voiding the excrements, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
tho<U+017F>e of the organs of Generation, as
well of Males as Females. This la<U+017F>t ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is <U+017F>hut by the la<U+017F>t of the great <U+017F>cales,
which is advanc'd in the form of a half
round, and opens in falling lower at the
time of copulation, as it al<U+017F>o doth at the
time of the young Vipers being ca<U+017F>t, and
of the excretion of their dung. The Throat
opens and <U+017F>huts at the will of the Animal;
the No<U+017F>trils remain alwayes open, and
the Eyes have Eye-lids to cover them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occa<U+017F>ion. There is no aperture in the
skin to give any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for Hearing; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it <U+017F>eems, <U+017F>erving her<U+017F>elf of the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

                  <p>Vipers ordinarily ca<U+017F>t their <U+017F>caly Skins
twice a year, under which they are furni<U+017F>ht
with another, quite formed, which at
fir<U+017F>t appears much fairer, and of a more
vivid colour, than that which is ca<U+017F>t off.

which are like <hi>Clavicles,</hi> <U+017F>erve both for a

There is al<U+017F>o at each advancing end of

a line and an half long, which is <U+017F>trongly
articulated with the root of the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooth,

jointed to the middle of the upper Jaw, as
well to <U+017F>upport it, as to make it advance

rai<U+017F>ed to bite.</p>
                  <p>The upper Jaw is divided in two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

from the No<U+017F>e, where its two ends are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated

                  <p>THe Opinions of the Antients have
been very differing about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the great Teeth of Vipers, and mo<U+017F>t
have held, that in this the Female exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Male, and that the plurality of the
great Teeth was the chief mark, whereby
to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h her from him. I have been
careful to inform my <U+017F>elf about it, and have
taken pains to grovel with a great deal a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in the gums of innumerable Vipers;
but all being well examined, I have not
found, as to this point, any true difference
of one Sex from the other, but <U+017F>ometimes
more, <U+017F>ometimes le<U+017F>s Teeth in one and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60888:26"/>
other. I have ca<U+017F>ually met on each <U+017F>ide
with two great Teeth fixed, placed very
near together, and on the <U+017F>ide of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as well in Males, as Females; but in
mo<U+017F>t of both Sexes I have found only one,
fixed on each <U+017F>ide, cover'd, to two thirds
of their height, with a Tunicle or Bag <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
thick, fill'd with a yellowi<U+017F>h juyce,
which is tran<U+017F>parent and pretty fluid; and
in this Ve<U+017F>icle, in the mid<U+017F>t of this juyce,
and under the great and main Teeth, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
number of Teeth ill <U+017F>et, <U+017F>ome longer
than others, and all hooked, of which I
have counted, in <U+017F>everal Vipers, from two
to five, <U+017F>ix and <U+017F>even, on one and the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>ide, under the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame Tooth, and in the
<U+017F>ame Bag.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e great Teeth are only in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part, <U+017F>tanding on the <U+017F>ide, and without
the Jaws of the Animal, where they are
like Bulwarks. They are about two lines
long, hooked, white, hollow, and diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
throughout, as far as to their <U+017F>harp
point, which is very <U+017F>ubtle and exceedingly
piercing. They have many little Cavities
towards their Root, in which the other
Teeth are planted. The<U+017F>e Teeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
remain lying along the Jaw, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60888:26"/>
their point appears not but at the moment
the Viper will bite; for then it rai<U+017F>eth
them, and advanceth them jointly with the
upper Jaw, drawn by the Bone, which at
one end is articulated in the middle of it,
and at the other, to the root of the great
Tooth.</p>
                  <p>The yellow liquor, contained in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icle,
<U+017F>erveth not only to moi<U+017F>ten the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to make them fit for the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Teeth, but al<U+017F>o to nouri<U+017F>h them,
and to make tho<U+017F>e grow, that are there as
'twere in a Nur<U+017F>ery, and are, if we may <U+017F>ay
<U+017F>o, in expectation to <U+017F>erve in<U+017F>tead of the
many Teeth, whether the<U+017F>e come to fail in
their force, or fall out of them<U+017F>elves.</p>
                  <p>All the Jaws, both upper and lower, are
fortify'd with bent Teeth, that are hollow,
pellucid and <U+017F>harp, as the bigger Teeth, but
that they are much <U+017F>maller. Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is uncertain enough, whether it be, that
Nature produces <U+017F>ometimes more, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
le<U+017F>s of them, or that that finene<U+017F>s
maketh them apt to break. There is little
difference, as to the number, in tho<U+017F>e above
from tho<U+017F>e below. Ordinarily there are
eight Teeth in each Jaw, but at times I
have found nine, ten, eleven in each. Tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60888:27"/>
that advance mo<U+017F>t, are a little bigger than
the deepe<U+017F>t; and ju<U+017F>t as tho<U+017F>e below an<U+017F>wer
in <U+017F>cituation to the Dog-teeth, that are
above them, they have at the end of each
<U+017F>ide one Tooth, that is a little bigger than
all tho<U+017F>e of the other Jaws, and another,
le<U+017F><U+017F>er, at the <U+017F>ide, at the end of the part
bent inwards.</p>
                  <p>There is a great difference in the Teeth
and Jaws of Vipers, from tho<U+017F>e of Snakes:
for, <hi>the<U+017F>e</hi> have no Dog-teeth; and although
their Jaws are all divided in their foremo<U+017F>t
part like as in Vipers, yet they exceed them
in the number of Jaws, and in the number
of Teeth; for, they have four Jaws above,
and two below; two of tho<U+017F>e above are
<U+017F>ituated all along and clo<U+017F>e to the rim of
the Lip, and <U+017F>erve for a defence to the two
other Jaws, that are <U+017F>eated in the <U+017F>ame
place, where tho<U+017F>e in Vipers are. Be<U+017F>ides,
I have counted 13 Teeth in each exterior
Jaw above, and as many in each of the
Jaws below, and 20 in each <U+017F>uperior inward
Jaw; <U+017F>o that I have counted of them to
92 Teeth in one Snake, and all the<U+017F>e Teeth
are bent, fine, hollow, white and tran<U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,

are <U+017F>eated on both <U+017F>ides, and joining to the
Skull, in the hind-part of each round of
the Eyes, and at the <U+017F>ame height with
them. There are many <U+017F>mall ones join'd
together, which may be call'd <hi>Conglomerate
Glands,</hi> which are ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hable by

from the Mu<U+017F>cles, neighbouring to them,
and of which there is one, that may be
call'd <hi>Temporal,</hi> which in part covers them
by its extremity. This heap of <hi>Glands</hi>
appears there of the bigne<U+017F>s of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Eye, and extending it <U+017F>elf in length,
continues its progre<U+017F>s in the Orbite of the
Eye, below, and in part behind the Eye.
Each <hi>Gland</hi> hath its little Lymphatique
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which parts from it as from a little
Teat, and goes di<U+017F>gorging it <U+017F>elf into a

be in vain; but that their U<U+017F>e, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,
was to receive the humidities
both of the Brain, the Eyes, and the
neighbouring parts; and that their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
was very convenient and even very

liquor, as well for moi<U+017F>tening the ligaments
of the great Teeth, and to keep them in

                  <p>THe <hi>Bladder of Gall</hi> is <U+017F>ituate an inch
below the Liver, and on the <U+017F>ide of
the bottom of the Stomack, and it leans
to the left <U+017F>ide. It is almo<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hape

                  <p>The <hi>Gall</hi> is very green; its ta<U+017F>te very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>I have found in the Bladder of Gall but
one out-let by a <U+017F>mall ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which i<U+017F><U+017F>uing

bent from its origine, and de<U+017F>cending, and
adhering, even in its beginning, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

into two branches, of which the
principal and directe<U+017F>t, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through
that Body (which the Antients have taken
for the <hi>Spleen</hi>) runs into the Inte<U+017F>tin, which
receives it; and the other le<U+017F><U+017F>er branch,
turning about, <U+017F>eems to remount to the
Liver, but dividing it<U+017F>elf into many <U+017F>mall

It is not here, that I will refute the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Antients concerning the Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

'tis free from all kind of poy<U+017F>on.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pancreas</hi> or Sweet-bread, which all
Authors have called the <hi>Spleen,</hi> is placed
near and a very little below the Gall, and
on the right <U+017F>ide of the Viper. It is of the

                  <p>THe <hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagus</hi> takes its beginning
at the bottom of the Throat; its
<U+017F>ituation is on the left <U+017F>ide, and its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age
directly on the <U+017F>ide of the Lungs and the
Liver, as far as to its union with the orifice
of the Stomach. It is made up of one onely

and which may be <U+017F>well'd even to the

fir<U+017F>t receives the animals, the Viper hath
killed with its great teeth, and <U+017F>wallowed
whole, it being proper for that purpo<U+017F>e, both
by its large capacity, and by its length,
which is of a good foot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Stomack,</hi> which is next, is as 'twere

for it cannot much exceed the bigne<U+017F>s of
an inch. It is between three and four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
long; its orifice is <U+017F>ufficiently large,
as well as its middle, but the bottom of
it grows <U+017F>treighter, and is commonly very
clo<U+017F>e and firm, not opening it <U+017F>elf, but to
eject its excrements into the Gutts. Its
internal tunicle is full of rugo<U+017F>ities when
'tis empty, and in it there are very often
found little worms of the length and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s

the bottom of it is turned towards the

                  <p>The length and capacity of the <hi>Oe<U+017F>opha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
and the largene<U+017F>s of the entry of the

the-nature of the Viper, which <U+017F>ends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
chew'd to the Stomach, but <U+017F>wallows
Animals whole for its food; and when <U+017F>ome
of them happen to be longer than the

which it receives tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>tay'd in the

                  <p>The Male hath two <hi>Penes's</hi> altogether

in bigne<U+017F>s, as the Tayle does; at

them both come forth equally, each about
the thickne<U+017F>s of a <hi>date,</hi> and of the length
of two thirds thereof, and their top is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
covered and quite be<U+017F>et with the<U+017F>e
pricks, like the skin of a Porcupin; and
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tings retire and hide them<U+017F>elves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<U+017F>erve for Generation.</head>
                  <p>THe Femal Viper hath two Te<U+017F>ticles,
as the Male; but they are longer
and bigger. They are <U+017F>eated on the <U+017F>ides
and near the bottom of the two Bodies of
the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the right is higher than
the left, as 'tis in Males. Their Sub<U+017F>tance
and colour al<U+017F>o are very like them. The
right is about one inch and an half long, and
two lines and an half large; the left is
<U+017F>omething le<U+017F>s. They have their <hi>Epidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymis,</hi>
and their Spermatique ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that
convey the <U+017F>eed into the two Bodies of the
<hi>Matrix,</hi> and which are much <U+017F>horter than
tho<U+017F>e of the Males. Yet I ob<U+017F>erve, that
the<U+017F>e Te<U+017F>ticles appear not always <U+017F>uch in all
Females, e<U+017F>pecially in tho<U+017F>e that are emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
either by <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, or by long keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for, their Te<U+017F>ticles <U+017F>horten, <U+017F>treighten,
and dry, like as in tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e Eggs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
great; having ob<U+017F>erv'd, that in the<U+017F>e
the Te<U+017F>ticles are much <U+017F>hortned and dryed
up, as al<U+017F>o that they are de<U+017F>cended lower,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60888:42"/>
although the right be alwayes found high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the left.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matrix</hi> begins in a body pretty
thick, which is compos'd of two <U+017F>trong tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
and which being <U+017F>eated above the
inte<U+017F>tin, hath in the <U+017F>ame place its orifice,
which is large, and doth ea<U+017F>ily dilate, to
receive at one and the <U+017F>ame time, by the
<U+017F>ame aperture, the two <hi>Penes</hi>'s of the
Male, in the Copulation. This Body is
about the bigne<U+017F>s of a nail of a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ized
finger, and is divided very near its
beginning into two <U+017F>mall baggs open at
the bottom, and fram'd by Nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and embrace the two members of
the Male in the coit. Their interiour coat
is full of rugo<U+017F>ities, and very hard, as is
that of the whole body, which we have
<U+017F>poken of; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffers, and al<U+017F>o feels
plea<U+017F>ure from, the pricking of the little
<U+017F>tings of the Male's members, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt thereby, although their points be
very <U+017F>harp.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matrix</hi> begins by the<U+017F>e two little
<U+017F>acks or baggs to be divided into two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which a<U+017F>cend each on its <U+017F>ide along
the kidneys, and betwixt them and the
inte<U+017F>tins, as farr as to the bottom of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60888:43"/>
Stomach, where they are <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended by
ligaments, which come from about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
being al<U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained, from <U+017F>pace to
<U+017F>pace, by divers <U+017F>mall ligaments, that come
from the Back-bone. The<U+017F>e two bodies
are compo<U+017F>ed of two tunicles, that are <U+017F>oft,
thin, and tran<U+017F>parent, being one within
th' other, Their beginning is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of tho<U+017F>e two <U+017F>mall bags, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the two members of the male, from
whence they receive the <U+017F>eed each from its
<U+017F>ide, to breed Eggs of it, and <U+017F>o young
Vipers, by the conjunction of their own
<U+017F>eed, which the te<U+017F>ticles <U+017F>end thither.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e two Bodies of the <hi>Matrix</hi> do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ea<U+017F>ily dilate them<U+017F>elves, that they may
contain many young Vipers, unto the time
of their perfection: notwith<U+017F>tanding the
opinion of <U+017F>ome, who have affirm'd, that
the <hi>Matrix</hi> of a Viper had but one onely
body; that it was <U+017F>eated in the midle, and
all along the Back-bone, and that there
were in it di<U+017F>tinct Bodies to hold the Eggs,
and the young Vipers, which bodies were
dependants of this <hi>Matrix.</hi> But, I believe,
that the ground of their mi<U+017F>take hath been,
in that tho<U+017F>e true bodies of the <hi>matrix</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very delicat and very tran<U+017F>parent, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60888:43"/>
when they are <U+017F>well'd and di<U+017F>tended
by the Eggs, or the Vipers, by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
have not pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in their opinion for
true bodies of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and that they
have taken for it the inte<U+017F>tins, which are
<U+017F>eated in the middle, and appear pretty
bigg and thick, and <U+017F>eem to make but
one and the <U+017F>ame body with the fir<U+017F>t thick
body of the <hi>matrix,</hi> under which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fir<U+017F>t inte<U+017F>tin is fa<U+017F>tned and
<U+017F>eated.</p>
                  <p>The Viper is not the onely animal, that
hath her <hi>matrix</hi> divided into two like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
equally placed each on its <U+017F>ide, and
along the Guts, which <U+017F>eparate them; for
I have ob<U+017F>erv'd the <U+017F>ame thing in many

                  <p>BY the particular de<U+017F>cription, we have
made of the parts <U+017F>erving the Viper
for generation, is is ea<U+017F>y to renounce all

the copulation of Vipers, and the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the young Vipers: <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hall
not trouble the Reader any further with
them, but onely intimate, That by the
means of the in<U+017F>ertion of both members
of the Male into the two baggs of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix;</hi>
by the ejaculation of the Seed, made
of them both together, into the two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <U+017F>aid <hi>Matrix,</hi> which are united
at the bottom of the baggs; and by the
concurrence of the Femals own <U+017F>eed which
her te<U+017F>ticles emit at the time of the coit;
the Eggs are fir<U+017F>t formed in both the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <hi>Matrix:</hi> that each is covered
by its little tunicle; that the Eggs of each
body of the <hi>Matrix</hi> are altogether wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in one common membrane, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60888:44"/>
called the <hi>Ovarium;</hi> that all is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>ed
in its proper body, the <hi>Matrix;</hi> that
the Eggs there take their increa<U+017F>e; that the
young Vipers are there formed and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that thence they come forth one after
another by the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, where the
<U+017F>eed of the Male went in; and that they are
produc'd alive, as many other animals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any need of the intervention of the
dam's death.</p>
                  <p>We can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the truth of all the<U+017F>e par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
having verified them by an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
examination of all the parts, at <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times, and upon a great number of <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and having <U+017F>een the exten<U+017F>ion and
<U+017F>welling of tho<U+017F>e two bodies of the <hi>Matrix,</hi>
even at the time when the young Vipers
were perfected and ready to come forth;
and la<U+017F>tly having <U+017F>een the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age free, by
which they were to come abroad, and the
young ones actually produced without any
danger to the Dam.</p>
                  <p>We have noted, that the right body of
the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Viper is ordinarily fuller
of Eggs and young brood, than the left;
that the number of Eggs is pretty unequal;
that at times there are twenty or twenty
five, <U+017F>ometimes but half <U+017F>o many; that the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60888:45"/>
young Vipers take their form and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Egg; that there they are <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and entangled divers wayes, and after
a very plea<U+017F>ant manner; that they have
each within their Egg a kind of after-birth
depending from their Navil, by which they
draw their food; that in coming abroad
they train it after them, and in part are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
with it; and that their Dam frees
them thereof, and clean<U+017F>eth them by lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them when they are born.</p>
                  <p>But although we have, as exactly as we
could, de<U+017F>cribed all the inward and outward
parts of a Viper, both of a Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;
yet to the end that all may be the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Month of <hi>June</hi> of the
year 1668, I procured a great
number of live Vipers, Males
and Females, to put the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
in execution, I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to my <U+017F>elf; Which was, to know in
truth all the good and all the evil, a Viper
was capable of. I was happy enough in
exciting the Curio<U+017F>ity of many intelligent
Per<U+017F>ons, and among<U+017F>t others, of <U+017F>ome
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60888:50"/>
Phy<U+017F>itians of my acquaintance, very
knowing and <U+017F>agacious, who were plea<U+017F>ed
to take the pains of coming to my hou<U+017F>e
every day, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the<U+017F>e experiments,
and to impart to me their directions.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t Meeting of all proved a <U+017F>ad
one by a <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing mis-fortune. A certain
Forrainer, drawn to <U+017F>ee our Experiments
by his own curio<U+017F>ity, felt in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
contrary to his expectation, a great
part of the grievous accidents, which may
be cau<U+017F>ed by Vipers, and furni<U+017F>ht us, <U+017F>ore
again<U+017F>t our wills, with an Experiment,
which was followed with circum<U+017F>tances
too con<U+017F>iderable to be <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and I
thought my <U+017F>elf obliged to recite them
fir<U+017F>t of all, becau<U+017F>e it was not onely the
fir<U+017F>t, but the onely, that hath furni<U+017F>ht us
with more remarkable things, than all the
re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, of 25 years of age,
had been by chance the day before at my
hou<U+017F>e, when five or <U+017F>ix douzen of Vipers
were brought thither. He would needs
<U+017F>ee them immediately, and I, being de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to <U+017F>atisfie his Curio<U+017F>ity, drew out of
the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el one of the Vipers. He was not
contented to <U+017F>ee her, but took her in his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60888:50"/>
hand, and kept her there for about a great
quarter of an hour, <U+017F>uffering her to turn and
winde her<U+017F>elf about his hand and arm, the
Viper not <U+017F>o much as offering to bite him.
Then he tyed her about her neck, and <U+017F>o
having hanged her, pulled off her skin, and
emptied her of her Guts to examine them.
I am a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that he would have been
<U+017F>oundly bitten at that time, if the Viper
had been vexed; but not having been <U+017F>o,
and being plea<U+017F>ed to breath another air
than that of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, where <U+017F>he had been
long <U+017F>hut in, <U+017F>he let her<U+017F>elf be tyed, after
which <U+017F>he could not do that mi<U+017F>chief, which
certainly <U+017F>he would have done, if <U+017F>he had not
been tyed.</p>
               <p>But this proved quite otherwi<U+017F>e the next
day; for this <U+017F>tranger being come again to
my hou<U+017F>e at the hour of the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, he
<U+017F>aw one of the Vipers upon the Table,
which had been held a long while between
Pincers, and was much angred. He would
take her with his naked hand, though he
was earne<U+017F>tly warn'd to forbear, it being
repre<U+017F>ented to him, that he had been too
bold already the day before. He had no
<U+017F>ooner taken her in his hand, but <U+017F>he turn'd
her head to bite him, and with one of her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60888:51"/>
great bent teeth, <U+017F>he laid hold on the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inward part of his right thumbe, a little
above the <U+017F>ituation of the nail. The prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appear'd no more than that of a pin;
and it <U+017F>eem'd to us not deep, and on the
<U+017F>urface we only <U+017F>aw a very <U+017F>mall hole with
a very little redne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that it was not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
but by its colour. There was not
<hi>upon,</hi> nor <hi>about</hi> this litle hole, any <U+017F>ign of that
yellow liquor contain'd in the baggs about
the great teeth, and which is wont to be
<U+017F>hed upon the wound, when a Viper biteth
deep; yet the pricking cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome pain to
him at the very fir<U+017F>t, but the finger <U+017F>well'd
not of it, no intume<U+017F>cence appearing but
<U+017F>ome hours after, as we <U+017F>hall relate more
amply in the <U+017F>equel.</p>
               <p>It was found proper to <U+017F>carify the part
wounded, and to make <U+017F>trong ligatures
above the place bitten, both to <U+017F>top the
effects of the Venom, and to di<U+017F>charge
the wounded part of the <U+017F>ame; but the
Patient oppo<U+017F>ed the<U+017F>e means, not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and he could very
hardly be per<U+017F>waded to endure any <U+017F>carifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
after which, he endured al<U+017F>o an
iron <U+017F>patule very hot and heated over and
over again, held very near to the prick't
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60888:51"/>
place; which was done, to keep the pores
open, and to fetch back and draw out <U+017F>ome
part of the poy<U+017F>on: Mean while, we made
the Patient take two drachms of Theriaque
in half a gla<U+017F>s of Wine.</p>
               <p>In le<U+017F>s then half a quarter of an hour
after the pricking, the patient felt <U+017F>ome
debility, and call'd for a chair; he wax'd
at the <U+017F>ame time very pale, and his pul<U+017F>e
was found very low, very quick, and even
interrupted. The<U+017F>e accidents were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by convul<U+017F>ive motions, and by a <U+017F>tif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of his whole body, and chiefly of his
neck, and the mu<U+017F>cles of his head: he then
al<U+017F>o complain'd of a very great pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Navil; and there appear'd a
coldne<U+017F>s in his extreme parts, and in the
whole face, which was covered with little
drops of cold <U+017F>weat: his lips al<U+017F>o were
<U+017F>well'd, e<U+017F>pecially the lower. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him<U+017F>elf urged by the pains about his
Navil, and a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to go to <U+017F>tool, he
ro<U+017F>e, and having voided <U+017F>ome excrements,
he vani<U+017F>h't away, and at the <U+017F>ame time
vomited not only all the Theriaque he had
taken, but all he had eaten at dinner,
which was yet un-dige<U+017F>ted. We made
ha<U+017F>te to <U+017F>uccour him, and found him <U+017F>o fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60888:52"/>
that he was not able to goe up again
to the chamber, whence he was come
down. And in regard his pul<U+017F>e continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
weak, low, quick, and unequal, and his
<U+017F>woundings frequent, as well as his cold
<U+017F>weats, it was thought <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to give
him a drachm of Viper-powder in <hi>Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal</hi>
and <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> water, and to
apply to him a great Plai<U+017F>ter of Theriaque
upon the Heart and Stomach, but he <U+017F>oon
rejected what he had taken. One al<U+017F>o
came to give him <U+017F>ome of the <hi>Orvietan,</hi>
mixt with new powder of Vipers, but
he vomited up that al<U+017F>o, and de<U+017F>ired to be
put upon a bed, and to have other help ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>tred
to him. During all which time,
he neither wanted his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, nor the u<U+017F>e
of rea<U+017F>on, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of his Body; and he had had great
aver<U+017F>ion to the <hi>Orvietan,</hi> having no faith
at all in it, and not con<U+017F>enting to take it,
but out of re<U+017F>pect to <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e that
were pre<U+017F>ent, who had pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed it upon
him.</p>
               <p>This vomiting not giving time to the
remedies to convey and communicate their
vertue to the noble parts, it was judged
very proper to have recour<U+017F>e to the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60888:52"/>
Salt of Vipers, becau<U+017F>e that being
very volatile and exceeding fit to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveyed to all the parts, even the mo<U+017F>t
remote, the Patient might thence feel the
effects with more <U+017F>peed and efficacy, than
from all the other gro<U+017F><U+017F>er remedies, which
having been rejected as <U+017F>oon as they were
taken, had not had time to be made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
by the <U+017F>tomach, nor to impart their
vertue where need required.</p>
               <p>We therefore cau<U+017F>ed to be di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd a
drachm of this volatile Salt of Vipers in
Theriacal and <hi>Carduus</hi> water, and gave
him about a quart of this mixture; he kept
it a little while, and then ca<U+017F>t up a part of
it, mingled with <U+017F>tore of phlegme very vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous.
We made him take another like
quantity of the <U+017F>ame mixture, which he
al<U+017F>o kept for <U+017F>ome time, and then vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up, what might have remain'd of it in
his Stomach, and among<U+017F>t it much phlegm.
We continued to give him <U+017F>till more of
the <U+017F>ame compo<U+017F>ition as fa<U+017F>t as he vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it up; and there were al<U+017F>o given him
<U+017F>everal Cly<U+017F>ters, to appea<U+017F>e the violent and
<U+017F>tubborn pains, which he felt about his
Navil.</p>
               <p>His lips remained <U+017F>till <U+017F>wolne, his pul<U+017F>e
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60888:53"/>
naught, and his <U+017F>weat cold, as well as his
faintings continued very long; but having
per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the u<U+017F>e of the Volatil Salt of
Vipers, his vomiting cea<U+017F>ed, and he kept
the eighth <hi>do<U+017F>e</hi> in his belly, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him about four hours after he received
the mi<U+017F>chief: the <U+017F>ymptoms le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd from
that time, the cold began little by little to
retire, and gave place to the natural heat,
which appeared <U+017F>ufficiently about five
hours after the pricking; his pul<U+017F>e retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and was even and <U+017F>trong, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
high.</p>
               <p>It was about ten of the clock at night,
that the mo<U+017F>t trouble<U+017F>ome accidents di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd,
the Patient was happy in his
unhappine<U+017F>s, in being <U+017F>peedily and rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>uccour'd. I left him not, before his
mortal accidents had cea<U+017F>ed; and then he
was carried to his lodgings, whether I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him, and he was put to bed;
and by the advice of tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons, that
frequently vi<U+017F>ited him during his di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
I made a mixture of one drachm of
Confection of <hi>Hyacinthe,</hi> and of as much
of the Confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and of one
ounce of Syrup of Limons, and of four
ounces of <hi>Carduus</hi>-water, which was giv'n
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60888:53"/>
him at three times, from three hours to
three hours. There were given him Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
to <U+017F>mell to, and from time to time
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>lices of them <U+017F>ugred. He took good
broths, and drank pti<U+017F>an made with <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera</hi>-roots,
and the <U+017F>havings of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
mingled with Syrup of Limons, he
al<U+017F>o drank <U+017F>ometimes a little wine, and
there was di<U+017F><U+017F>olved of the Confection of
<hi>Alkermes,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes in his broth, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in his pti<U+017F>ane.</p>
               <p>This is a thing remarkable enough, that
during all the great accidents, his finger
was not changed, and there appeared not
any <U+017F>welling upon it, but that began,
when tho<U+017F>e accidents cea<U+017F>ed. In the mean
time, the pains about the navil continued,
though they were in <U+017F>ome little degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated;
which obliged the Phy<U+017F>itians often
to pre<U+017F>cribe him Cly<U+017F>ters. His belly was
a little <U+017F>tiff, but not <U+017F>welled; his tongue
was whiti<U+017F>h, but not dry; his eyes faint and
wan; his countenance pale, and his lips
<U+017F>till <U+017F>welled.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>welling of the finger extended it
<U+017F>elf that night over the whole hand; which
was often anointed with the Oyl of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
compo<U+017F>ed by <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and mixt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60888:54"/>
with the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hungarie's</hi> water, but,
notwith<U+017F>tanding this anointing, the tumor
pa<U+017F><U+017F>'d onto the arm the next day, with pain
and redne<U+017F>s, and advanced to the Eye. It
was thought fit to apply fomentations
made with the roots of <hi>Angelica, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoria,
Carlina,</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>tolochia,</hi> and with
the tops of <hi>Scordium, Centaurium, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
St. Johns wort, Calamint,</hi> boyled in
White wine, and withal to continue the
anointing with the <U+017F>aid Oyle of Scorpions
among the<U+017F>e fomentations. Although this
was done with great care, yet there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no great effect upon it; the Patient was
<U+017F>queami<U+017F>h, and once vomited up even his
broth; but this vomiting continued not.
He alwayes u<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ame internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
remedies, and the <U+017F>ame food; but
although he found his other limbs in a
good condition, and his pul<U+017F>e very equal
and moderate, nor had any drought, heat,
or pain in the re<U+017F>t of his body, yet was that
of the Navil ob<U+017F>tinate; and the <U+017F>welling
and the redne<U+017F>s of the hand and arm <U+017F>till
increa<U+017F>ed; and from the beginning of the
third day, it had <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed on the <U+017F>houlder of
the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide, and de<U+017F>cended to the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
upon the whole brea<U+017F>t, and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

parts, and even the whole region
of the Liver, notwith<U+017F>tanding the continual
u<U+017F>e of the fomentations, and the Oyle of
Scorpions.</p>
               <p>All the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, joyned to the
hot <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, wherein we were, made us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
le<U+017F>t the gangrene <U+017F>hould <U+017F>trike to
tho<U+017F>e parts. It was believed, that, <U+017F>ince
the outward remedies which had been jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
mo<U+017F>t expedient, had proved <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s,
recour<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be had to internal ones;
which induced the Phy<U+017F>itians to give him,
in the evening of the third day, a drachm
of the root of <hi>Contra-yerva</hi> in powder, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
in cordial waters, with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Alkermes:</hi> but we <U+017F>aw no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the redne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>welling, or pain; on
the contrary, we ob<U+017F>erv'd, that the <U+017F>welling
<U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>eize on the left <U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>After we had well examin'd all things, we
found it very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to return to the u<U+017F>e
of our fir<U+017F>t inward remedy, which had
<U+017F>truck the great <U+017F>troke, and had had a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t
good operation; I mean, the <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt of Vipers.</hi> This was in the morning
of the fourth day after the biting. So we
gave him half a drachm of that Salt, di<U+017F><U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in four ounces of <hi>Carduus</hi> water, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60888:55"/>
we order'd that he <U+017F>hould be well covered,
to make him <U+017F>weat. This medicine did
work according to our expectation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire;
for the Patient not onely did <U+017F>weat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
but found a very con<U+017F>iderable
amendment in all the ill Symptoms that
had remain'd. His pain about the navil
was almo<U+017F>t not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible; the tumor of his
Lips, and that, which was in the region
of the Liver, Brea<U+017F>t, and under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
vani<U+017F>h't, and that of the <U+017F>houlder, Arm
and Hand was much abated, as well as the
redne<U+017F>s and pain.</p>
               <p>We thence judg'd, that we <U+017F>hould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure the re<U+017F>t; and to compa<U+017F>s it, we gave
the next morning to our Patient a like do<U+017F>e
of that Volatil Salt of Vipers, which made
him <U+017F>weat again very largely; the pain of
the Navil cea<U+017F>ed altogether; the <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the <U+017F>houlder was wholly gone; and
that of the whole arm and hand was yet
much more abated, as well as the redne<U+017F>s
and pain. And not to leave the cure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
though the patient found him<U+017F>elf
exceedingly amended, we gave him the
next day another <U+017F>uch do<U+017F>e again, and the
day following one more, whereby the
whole <U+017F>welling, all the redne<U+017F>s, and all the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60888:55"/>
pain of the arm, hand, and the finger it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
were di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated; Mean while there
was applyed to the finger a little plai<U+017F>ter
to cicatrize the inci<U+017F>ions, that had been
made there, and which were healed three
or four dayes after. Which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Patient to goe abroad, and to doe
his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as well as if he had never been
bitten by the Viper.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall read this Hi<U+017F>tory, and

its tyranny over the natural heat,
and all the noble parts, and which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
would have altogether triumphed over
them: the activity, penetration, and force
of the <U+017F>ame Salt, going to find out the
poy<U+017F>on, and expelling it from the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
parts of the body, where it had
fortified it<U+017F>elf, and whence it endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to regain the place it had lo<U+017F>t, and
where, in the mean time, it <U+017F>eem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pi<U+017F>e
the ordinary mo<U+017F>t powerful remedies.
All this, I <U+017F>ay, is <U+017F>ufficient to make it to
be wondred at; and men will, doubtle<U+017F>s,
averr, that the ill, which Vipers are able
to cau<U+017F>e, and which every one may ea<U+017F>ily
avoide, is nothing in compari<U+017F>on of <U+017F>uch
a remedy, as the <U+017F>ame Vipers can furni<U+017F>h,
and which may <U+017F>erve, not onely to heal
their bitings, but al<U+017F>o to overcome many
other ob<U+017F>tinate di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, again<U+017F>t which the
ordinary remedies perform nothing; not
to <U+017F>peak of many other good preparations,

it will not be thought ami<U+017F>s, if we begin
with the recitation of the Experiments,
by the Examples of its effects. And not

to be tedious to the Reader; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed

               <p>One of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was made on a <hi>Dog,</hi> which was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by an angred Viper at the upper lipp.
The dog was not much moved at it at fir<U+017F>t,
but little by little grew <U+017F>ad, and his jaw
began to <U+017F>well: a little while after he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
up the la<U+017F>t food he had taken, and
dunged. Then <U+017F>ome bread, fle<U+017F>h, and
water being offred him, he would touch
none of it, he remain'd in a pro<U+017F>trate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
without complaining, the place of
the pricking waxed livid, and this livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
extended it <U+017F>elf to the neck, and as
far as the brea<U+017F>t, as did al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>welling.
At length he dyed, but not till fourty
hours were pa<U+017F>t after the biting. His bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear'd not <U+017F>woln, and without we
ob<U+017F>erv'd nothing extraordinary but the
tumour and lividne<U+017F>s in the part prick't,
and thereabout. The Dog being opened
after his death, we found in the tronc of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60888:57"/>
the <hi>vena cava</hi> a little bloud curdled, and
we noted, that the re<U+017F>t of the bloud, in this

was of a dark colour, and of a very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tence,
as if it were blood in part di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd

a darki<U+017F>h colour, but the Me<U+017F>entery and
the Gutts were darker. We found no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration

<U+017F>welled much, and was very livid, and the
tumor and lividne<U+017F>s reached over all the

would eat nothing, and was alwayes in

thing, we cau<U+017F>ed him to be bitten again,

it <U+017F>elf over the whole belly, as well

no further; for the dog often licked his

tho<U+017F>e of all the others. The bloud very
black, and beginning to coagulate in the
heart, and in the <hi>vena cava,</hi> being al<U+017F>o of
the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of bloud curdled and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                  <p>This la<U+017F>t Experiment gave us great <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
informing us fully of the effects
of the venomous biting of a Viper, and
<U+017F>hewing us, that the poy<U+017F>on goes not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the noble parts, <U+017F>eeing we never
ob<U+017F>erv'd any alteration therein, but that
'tis chiefly the bloud it works upon, <U+017F>ince
it corrupts the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance thereof, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
it, or <U+017F>eparateth its parts, di<U+017F>turbs

its circulation; and at the <U+017F>ame time hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the communication of the Spirits
through the whole body, depriving the
noble parts of them, as well as of the pure
bloud, which was wont to bedew them,
and de<U+017F>troying them indirectly, by cau<U+017F>ing
this privation of Spirits and of the good
liquor, whence depends their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tence.</p>
                  <p>We al<U+017F>o found thereby that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s
of the venom of a Vipers biting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
depends from the place bitten, and
from the bigne<U+017F>s of the veins or arteries,
which the teeth hath lighted on. For, the
tongue of the Dog being full of veins and
arteries, 'tis no wonder, if the Venom,
meeting with them, and finding in them a
large way, very <U+017F>hort and very free to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over the bitten animal, did <U+017F>oon
produce its effects, and cau<U+017F>ed death much
more <U+017F>peedily, than that, which met on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with <U+017F>mall, <U+017F>lender and winding branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
by which its way was <U+017F>traighter, more
about, and longer; though it failed not to
do execution at la<U+017F>t; which it would have
done <U+017F>ooner, if the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age had been
freer.</p>
                  <p>We may judge by the effects of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60888:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Vipers biting in tho<U+017F>e dogs,
and e<U+017F>pecially in the la<U+017F>t, that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
and the extreme pains about the
Navil, which befell the Gentleman, above
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of, proceeded partly from the
bloud which was coagulated or di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to coagulation in its cour<U+017F>e, and which
could not freely circulate; and partly
from this, that the <U+017F>pirits, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the bloud in the circulation, finding
ob<U+017F>tacles in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, endeavoured to
make way for them<U+017F>elves, and to that
end, doing violence to the lateral parts
in their way, cau<U+017F>ed in tho<U+017F>e places the
extreme pains, which the Patient felt
there; which might al<U+017F>o be augmented
by the bloud, that probably was coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
out of the great ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and might
be di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed in the form of <U+017F>pots in the
Me<U+017F>entery, or el<U+017F>ewhere, ju<U+017F>t as in the
body of the Dog.</p>
                  <p>We may conclude al<U+017F>o, that the cold
<U+017F>weats, the convul<U+017F>ions and the faintings,
wherewith the Patient was mole<U+017F>ted, came
from nothing el<U+017F>e, but the defect of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
commerce of the <U+017F>pirits with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts, and from the goodne<U+017F>s and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the bloud de<U+017F>tinated to bedew them.</p>

Concerning the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of the remedies
employed to cure the <U+017F>aid Gentleman, we
<U+017F>hall declare our thoughts thereof in the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele
of our Experiments, after we <U+017F>hall
have given proofs <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>upport
them.</p>
                  <p>As to the Dogs, that were cured by lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wound, I think that that was a
good means to recall and draw back the
venom; and I am much of their opinion,
who believe, that if the per<U+017F>on bitten, or
<U+017F>ome friend for him, <U+017F>hould for a good
while and <U+017F>trongly <U+017F>uck the wound, it
would be cur'd, provided that the teeth of
the Viper have not lighted upon <U+017F>ome
great ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, whereby the progre<U+017F>s of the
venom may prevail over the force of <U+017F>uck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I am al<U+017F>o per<U+017F>uaded, that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ucked
and recall'd Spirits are incapable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
him who <U+017F>ucks them, partly becau<U+017F>e
they have been weakn'd by the action they
have been upon, partly becau<U+017F>e they are
then de<U+017F>titute of the in<U+017F>truments proper
to convey and <U+017F>econd their action, to wit,
the teeth of the Viper.</p>

Of the Biting of Vipers, made

               <p>THE Experiments made upon <hi>the<U+017F>e</hi>
Animals have likewi<U+017F>e been very
u<U+017F>eful to us, to know the effects
of the Biting of Vipers, which have been
very like in both.</p>
               <p>We cau<U+017F>ed a <hi>Pigeon</hi> and a <hi>Pullet</hi> to be
bitten by a vexed Viper, almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame
time, in the mo<U+017F>t fle<U+017F>hy part, namely in
that under the brea<U+017F>t. We <U+017F>oon after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
in both a very thick and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
beating of the heart, which went on
<U+017F>till increa<U+017F>ing, and in <U+017F>uch a manner, that
both Pigeon and Pullet were dead in le<U+017F>s
then half an hour. We <U+017F>oon opened them,
and found in both of them a little bloud
coagulated in the heart and the <hi>vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and all the re<U+017F>t of the bloud blacki<U+017F>h,
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to curdle, and as 'twere turn'd and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60888:62"/>
corrupt; but the Heart, and Liver, and all
the inward and outward parts of a very
good colour, and in a very good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<U+017F>ave that a little lividne<U+017F>s appear'd upon
the place bitten.</p>
               <p>We have frequently ob<U+017F>erv'd the <U+017F>ame
thing in many Pullets and Pigeons: But it
will not be ami<U+017F>s, here to relate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in two Pigeons, we cau<U+017F>ed to
be bitten equally and in the <U+017F>ame place by
an angred Viper. One of them we made
to <U+017F>wallow the weight of about half a
crown of Theriack, a moment before it was
bitten, giving nothing to the other. The
former being bitten, went to and fro in the
room, <U+017F>o as not to <U+017F>hew any <U+017F>ign of illne<U+017F>s,
but the latter was dead in le<U+017F>s than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour We afterwards cau<U+017F>ed the
former to be bitten again in the leg; and
then it grew <U+017F>ick by little and little, and
dyed half an hour after. We found the
place of the fir<U+017F>t pricking much more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
then that of the Pigeon, which dyed
in a quarter of an hour; and even more
then the place of the leg, which was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afterward. We judged, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
<U+017F>pirits unable to penetrate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
defended by the Theriaque, had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60888:62"/>
wrought upon the outward part, and
round about the place bitten, where they
had coagulated the bloud, and cau<U+017F>ed the
lividne<U+017F>s; whereas the like <U+017F>pirits, having
met with no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in the other Pigeon,
had gained and wrought upon the inner
parts, having left and as 'twere de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed
the place, at which they were entred. We
al<U+017F>o wondred not, that the Theriaque,
which had vigorou<U+017F>ly repul<U+017F>ed the Spirits
introduc'd by the fir<U+017F>t bite, could not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
the latter but for half an hour, and that at
la<U+017F>t it was forced to yield, in regard that the
number of the enemies was great, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weakn'd by the conflict, it had but now
endured, had not force enough to bear up
again<U+017F>t the new a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of the latter.</p>
               <p>We did al<U+017F>o prick <U+017F>everal times, and
pretty deep, dogs, pigeons and pullets,
with the long teeth of Vipers, <U+017F>ome pull'd
out of the throat of dead ones, others out
of <U+017F>uch as were alive. There was al<U+017F>o one
of the company, who handling a dead vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
head, had a mind to prick his finger,
and actually did <U+017F>o, with one of the great
teeth, <U+017F>o that the bloud i<U+017F><U+017F>ued. I al<U+017F>o my
<U+017F>elf thru<U+017F>t into my hand one of them,
and <U+017F>o deep, that a piece of it remain'd more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60888:63"/>
than half an hour in my fle<U+017F>h; but in all this
we found not the lea<U+017F>t appearance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
nor any ill, but <U+017F>uch, as might be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
by the pricking of a Pin, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch
thing.</p>
               <p>We al<U+017F>o deplum'd a Pigeon at the mo<U+017F>t
fle<U+017F>hy place, and holding with both our
hands the jawes of a Viper open, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her rai<U+017F>e her great teeth, we pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
both the jawes at once again<U+017F>t that fle<U+017F>hy
part, and cau<U+017F>ed the teeth deeply to enter
into it, and order'd the matter <U+017F>o, that the
yellow liquor of the Gums had time enough
to pa<U+017F>s into the wounds, which the teeth
had made. We at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>aw, that
the bloud i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out of the wounds, and
mingled it <U+017F>elf with the yellow juyce,
which remained there. We had then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a little <U+017F>tone, come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which
tho<U+017F>e of that Country call the <hi>Snake-Stone,</hi>
being pretty black, <U+017F>hining, roundi<U+017F>h,
and flat, about the bigne<U+017F>s of a French piece
of five <hi>Sols,</hi> but three times thicker;
which we pre<U+017F>ently applyed to the place
bitten, which was cover'd with bloud, and
with the yellow liquor mingled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
The <U+017F>tone immediately was fa<U+017F>tned
to the wound, and we perceived nothing,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60888:63"/>
extraordinary in the Pigeon. We might
have believed, that this <U+017F>afety of the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was due to the vertue of this Stone,
which they would a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us was infallible
again<U+017F>t the bitings of Vipers and all kinds
of Serpents, if we had not <U+017F>ome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tryed the like Stone upon a Pigeon,
bitten in the <U+017F>ame place by an angry Viper,
and if that wound had not been follow'd
by the death of that Pigeon, a quarter of
an hour after. We thought, this very
well de<U+017F>erved another experiment; and
having <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame Stone by us, which
<U+017F>eem'd to have <U+017F>aved the former pigeon,
and <U+017F>uch another, which the Lord Amba<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>adour
of <hi>Spain</hi> had tru<U+017F>ted his Phy<U+017F>itian
with, we by one and the <U+017F>ame enraged Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
cau<U+017F>ed to be bitten two Pigeons of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
bigne<U+017F>s and fle<U+017F>hine<U+017F>s, each in the
<U+017F>ame place, well freed from its feathers.
The bloud was <U+017F>een upon both wounds;
but there appear'd but little of the yellow
liquor. We <U+017F>oon applyed both the Stones,
one to each Pigeon; they pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>tuck
fa<U+017F>t to the places pricked; but we <U+017F>aw im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
in both a very high and thick
beating of the heart, which was follow'd
by the death of both Pigeons, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60888:64"/>
at one and the <U+017F>ame time, in le<U+017F>s than
a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>We had al<U+017F>o a mind to know, whether
the Venom, that had <U+017F>o much force upon
the bloud, were al<U+017F>o able to make <U+017F>ome ill
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the noble or <U+017F>olid parts of
the bitten animals, which parts appear'd
to us very fair and very well conditioned.
We gave al<U+017F>o a Pigeon, dead of a Vipers
biting, to be eaten by a Cat that was very
lean, which fed very greedily upon it; and
the <U+017F>ame did afterwards eat many more, and
Pullets al<U+017F>o; upon which <U+017F>he grew very
fat, <U+017F>o far was <U+017F>he from finding any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
thereby.</p>
               <p>Moreover we had a de<U+017F>ire to learn, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one and the <U+017F>ame Viper was able to
kill by its biting divers animals wounded,
one pre<U+017F>ently after another; and whether
the Venom was exhau<U+017F>tible, <U+017F>o that the
animals, bitten la<U+017F>t, might be free from its
mi<U+017F>chievou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s. To know the truth
hereof, we cau<U+017F>ed to be bitten five Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
one after another, by the <U+017F>ame Viper,
which we angred every time <U+017F>he was to
bite: All the<U+017F>e Pigeons <U+017F>oon dyed; and we
particularly ob<U+017F>erved, that the la<U+017F>t bitten
dyed fir<U+017F>t of all. And as to the Bloud,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60888:64"/>
and all the inward and outward parts, they
were in a manner alike with tho<U+017F>e of the
Pigeon, that was bitten fir<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The various Experiments, we have been
relating, do in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly oblige us to deliver
our thoughts concerning the Venom of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and its operation. We think this to
be a proper place to declare our<U+017F>elves here,
and afterwards to employ the re<U+017F>t of our
main experiments for the defence of what
we <U+017F>hall have advanced upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

<U+017F>ince, being ta<U+017F>ted and <U+017F>wallowed (as

al<U+017F>o, being put upon open wounds, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

very intelligent, and particularly in
this <U+017F>ubject of Vipers, wo a<U+017F><U+017F>ures to have
made a great number of Experiments;
which being contrary to ours, the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we have of the abilities and the <U+017F>ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that famous man, hath obliged us
to employ the more care and exactne<U+017F>s, and
to confirm our<U+017F>elves, by a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Experiments, which have alwayes
been found alike, in the truth, we here a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ert,
and of which we <U+017F>hall make evident and

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60888:66"/>
We <U+017F>ay further, that there is no other
venom in all the other parts of the Body;
and more, that there is none even in the
great teeth, if the Viper be not alive, and
the biting not accompanied with vexed and
<hi>enraged Spirits.</hi> The hurt, which the
teeth doth, when the Viper biteth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts
chiefly in that it opens a door to the
angred Spirits, without which irritation
the Biting of the teeth is not mortal, and
ought to be no further con<U+017F>ider'd then for
the deep and direct wound, which a tooth,
<U+017F>o <U+017F>harp, <U+017F>o long, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender, of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animal what<U+017F>oever, might make. In
which circum<U+017F>tances, the great number of
Experiments, by us made, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us knowing; in regard that we
have ob<U+017F>erved a quite manife<U+017F>t diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Biting of a Viper angred,
from that of a Viper, which was made
to bite by holding its jaws, and by pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
its great teeth into the body of
<U+017F>ome animal: becau<U+017F>e this forc'd action
<U+017F>erves rather to make the Viper retain its
<U+017F>pirits, then to let them out; for which
the freedom of the animal is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary,
the <U+017F>pirits not being able to part, but the
imagination and the Choler of the Viper
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60888:67"/>
mu<U+017F>t immediately precede and thru<U+017F>t them
out. For this way of biting, by holding
the jaws, and thru<U+017F>ting the teeth into <U+017F>ome
animal, although it emit more of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
liquor upon the part bitten, than the
biting made by an angred Viper, left to it
<U+017F>elf, is not followed by any <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and is healed like a <U+017F>imple wound,
whereas the other is attended with death,
in ca<U+017F>e we want means of preventing it.</p>
               <p>The effect therefore of the venom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether of a <U+017F>pirituous nature, and
not working but according as the <U+017F>pirits
are more or le<U+017F>s iritated and pu<U+017F>h't on,
and according as they finde more or le<U+017F>s
free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, we have rea<U+017F>on to impute it
to the exa<U+017F>perated Spirits, having found
no foot<U+017F>tep of it, neither real, nor appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in all the vi<U+017F>ible parts. But the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to maintain this our a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, we <U+017F>hall
here give you our thoughts concerning the
action of the enraged Spirits.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e Spirits then, pu<U+017F>h't on by the
choler, which the Viper had conceived,
finding the apertures, made by the Teeth,
follow their inclination, and as it is their
property, to advance and penetrate, they
at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eek out all wayes for it, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60888:67"/>
they advance more or le<U+017F>s, according to the
facility or difficulty, they meet with.
Thence it is, that the Biting is much more
dangerous, when the teeth light upon
the greater ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, than when they only
light upon Fle<U+017F>h, or the little branches of
the veins and Arteries. So that the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits of a Viper, meeting with the
bloud and Spirits contain'd in the ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
of the bitten animal, pu<U+017F>h and pre<U+017F>s
them to make way for them<U+017F>elves, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara<U+017F><U+017F>ing
the particles that compo<U+017F>e the
bloud, cau<U+017F>e there a coagulation or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
which di<U+017F>turbs the ordinary Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by this means hinders the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Spirits, to the principal
parts, from which depends their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence
and life. And by rea<U+017F>on of this privation
they mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>uccumbe, either for having
been attack't in their fort by the<U+017F>e vexed
Spirits and infected by them, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits of the Viper have made
them<U+017F>elves ma<U+017F>ters of the <hi>avenues,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, by which the blood
and the <U+017F>pirits were communicated to
them.</p>
               <p>We conclude therefore, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the Viper being irritated by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60888:68"/>
the <hi>idea</hi> of revenge which <U+017F>he had fram'd
to her <U+017F>elf, gives a certain motion to the
Spirits which cannot be expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and
pu<U+017F>hes them violently, through the nerves
and their fibres, towards the cavity of the
teeth, as into a funnel; and that from
htence they are convey'd into the blood of
the animal, by the opening, which they
have made, there to produce all tho<U+017F>e
effects, of which we end eavour to give a
rea<U+017F>on. Others, more able than we, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
carry their rea<U+017F>oning farther.</p>
               <p>For the re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome have thought, that
tho<U+017F>e enraged Spirits have in them a <U+017F>ecret
acidity, capable to coagulate the bloud,
and to hinder the Circulation, whence the
mortall accidents proceed. But <U+017F>ince that
this acidity may have been produced in the
ma<U+017F>s of the Blood by its own parts, which
come to be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved and <U+017F>evered, when
they are tainted by the venom, and <U+017F>ince
corruption <U+017F>lides into it, as into milk,
which <U+017F>owreth and corrupteth of it <U+017F>elf,
without mixing any acid thing therewith;
it is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <U+017F>earch for a coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Acid in the Spirits of the Viper,
which cannot be perceived by the ta<U+017F>te to
know the truth of its exi<U+017F>tence therein;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60888:68"/>
and that the le<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e <hi>that</hi> Acid may be
naturally formed in the Bloud of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
bitten, without looking for it in the
Viper, as if it had come from thence.</p>
               <p>How-ever this be, we mu<U+017F>t agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that this irritation in the phan<U+017F>y or in
the <U+017F>pirits of the Viper is the main cau<U+017F>e
of the activity and piercingne<U+017F>s of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
and that without it the biting would
not produce <U+017F>uch <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing effects, as
tho<U+017F>e are, of which we have related <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Examples. Nor is a viper the onely
animal, who<U+017F>e biting is mortal: Dogs,
Wolves, and Men them<U+017F>elves prove that;
and not to go from our Subject, the biting
of Serpents, of which the Viper is a <hi><U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
is more or le<U+017F>s malign, according to
the nature of their <U+017F>pirits, and e<U+017F>pecially
according as they are angred and exa<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>It <U+017F>eems, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was well in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this matter, when <U+017F>he, intending to
kill her<U+017F>elf, commanded to be brought her
two <hi>A<U+017F>pes</hi> in a fruit-basket, and pricked
them with a golden needle, which <U+017F>he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of her hair-dre<U+017F>s, and made her
<U+017F>elf be bitten immediately by one of tho<U+017F>e
A<U+017F>pes in the right arm, and by the other,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60888:69"/>
in her left brea<U+017F>t; knowing (as a famous
Author <U+017F>aith) that their natural fiercene<U+017F>s
and cruelty was not <U+017F>ufficient to execute
well what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, and that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
this pricking <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve to provoke
the <U+017F>pirits to bite to purpo<U+017F>e, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wound mortal; if at lea<U+017F>t it be
with <hi>their</hi> biting, as it is with that of our
Vipers, who al<U+017F>o have this particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that not onely they are <U+017F>oon angred,
but that in the very moment of the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they bite with a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s;
which <U+017F>peaketh much the <U+017F>ubtlety and
impetuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>pirits, whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
their <U+017F>trength and activity. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
al<U+017F>o, that in di<U+017F>tilling Vipers bodies,
we thence draw very <U+017F>ubtile and very pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
parts, and in much greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in proportion, than from any other
animal.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the ob<U+017F>tacle, which
the<U+017F>e irritated <U+017F>pirits of the Viper give to
the communication of the <U+017F>pirits of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
bitten, nor the coagulation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion,
which they cau<U+017F>e to the bloud,
are not of that force, that <U+017F>pecifique
remedies <U+017F>hould not ma<U+017F>ter them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore
the animal unto that Condition,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60888:69"/>
wherein it was before it was wounded.
Which is that, we <U+017F>hall prove in the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele

to eat, who was no more inconvenienced

by Men or other Animals, that had no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60888:70"/>
wound nor Ulcer in their mouths, nor in
their <U+017F>tomachs, was indeed harmle<U+017F>s; but
that it was quite another thing, when it
did accompany a Biting, and entred into
the openings made by the teeth and that
the <U+017F>ame being put upon an Ulcer, a wound,
or a <U+017F>imple excoriation made on the skin,
was mortal, and failed not to produce its
effect, three or four hours after it had been
put upon the wound; and that as well upon
Men, as all other <U+017F>orts of Animals, without
exception; we re<U+017F>olved al<U+017F>o to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Experiments upon this account.</p>
               <p>I can therefore <U+017F>ay, in the fir<U+017F>t place,
that I have ta<U+017F>ted of it my <U+017F>elf, at <U+017F>uch
times, when my mouth was excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
upon which I ob<U+017F>erved, that even
my <U+017F>pittle was a little ting'd with bloud,
without having perceived any acrimony,
or extraordinary heat. We al<U+017F>o made a
Tryal upon a Pigeon, which we wounded
under the wing, and in the leg in the <U+017F>ame
moment of time; and we let into each
wound <U+017F>ome of this yellow liquor, which
we ju<U+017F>t afore had drawn from the gums of
two enraged Vipers; then we re-joyned
the skin, well to inclo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>aid liquor,
and we bound both wounds over with a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60888:71"/>
band, that nothing might run out. We
can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure, that the Pigeon felt not any
inconveniency from it, and that we even
found upon the wound, made on the leg,
a coagulated drop of the juyce, round, and
of the <U+017F>ame colour, as we had put it there,
and the bloud of the place dryed, and that,
<U+017F>oon after, both wounds were dryed up, and
heal'd of them<U+017F>elves.</p>
               <p>We al<U+017F>o made the like Experiment upon
a Cat, which we purpo<U+017F>ely wounded in
the leg, but he received no harm at all by
it. We have al<U+017F>o often experimented it
upon Pullets, and other Pigeons, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with the like <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, and without
any offence to the Animals.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ame tryal hath been thrice made
at three <U+017F>everal times, and even twice in
one day, upon a dog, whom we had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on purpo<U+017F>e towards the bottom of the
Ear, where he could not lick his wound;
and no mi<U+017F>chief at all followed upon it.</p>
               <p>We cannot but adde here an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the mortal effect of the enraged
Spirits, without any intervention of the
yellow liquor<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> We made a Viper <U+017F>everal
times to bite upon a <U+017F>lice of bread, by pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
every time its jaws again<U+017F>t the bread,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60888:71"/>
and we did this <U+017F>o often, that not only that
juyce was altogether exhau<U+017F>ted, but that
the bloud began to come out of the gums.
At the <U+017F>ame time we vexed the Viper,
and made it bite a Pigeon in the mo<U+017F>t fle<U+017F>hy
part; and we ob<U+017F>erv'd, that indeed the
effects of the venom of the biting were
not <U+017F>o quick, the Pigeon not dying but an
hour and an half after it had been bitten;
but then we found al<U+017F>o, that the teeth of
the Viper were in a manner cover'd with the
crums of the bread, from the force of its
having bitten at it, and that that had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them from making a deep entrance,
and that having half <U+017F>top'd up the pores of
the tooth, a good part of the angred Spirits
could not come forth; <U+017F>o that the death
of the Pigeon could not follow <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t,

at a time; but they never found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eves
ill after it, no more than the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Pullets that had <U+017F>wallowed <U+017F>ome
of it, and which we had al<U+017F>o wounded,
and afterwards rubbed with the Gall of a
Viper: for this Gall <U+017F>erved them for a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om,
the wounds being the <U+017F>ooner cured
thereby; <U+017F>o that we can ju<U+017F>tly declare the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60888:72"/>
gall to be free from all venom, as well as the
yellow liquor, and even inculcate here what
we have already <U+017F>aid, that the galls of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
have particular vertues in them.</p>
               <p>We can <U+017F>ay the <U+017F>ame of the <hi>Matrix</hi> and
Eggs of a Viper, and of all the Inte<U+017F>tins,
of which we often have made good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
to be <U+017F>wallowed by Doggs and Cats,
<U+017F>ome of which have eaten thereof with
greedine<U+017F>s, when they could light upon't;
and none ever hath felt any trouble after
it. On the contrary, we have tryed, that
having cau<U+017F>ed to be bitten, at the thicke<U+017F>t
place of the Ear, by a <U+017F>ufficiently vexed
Viper, a young Cat, very lean, that had
but ju<U+017F>t before eaten the Eggs, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
and all the guts of a Viper; the biting
had almo<U+017F>t no effect, and there appeared
nothing but a very little <U+017F>welling, and a
very incon<U+017F>iderable lividne<U+017F>s in the place
bitten.</p>
               <p>We have further made many Dogs and
Pigeons <U+017F>wallow the Heads of Vipers,
newly cut off, and yet living, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut with Sizers the point of their great
teeth, lea<U+017F>t in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing down they <U+017F>hould
bite the throat, or the inward parts of the
animals, that were to devour them; but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60888:73"/>
we have not ob<U+017F>erv'd any thing after it,
that was extraordinary, in all tho<U+017F>e crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>We had al<U+017F>o a de<U+017F>ire to find, Whether
a Viper, being eaten by an Animal, which
it had bitten before, would be cur'd of that
biting. We therefore cau<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
broyled the head of a Viper, which had
on it a part of its neck, newly <U+017F>ever'd from
the body; and we made a Dog to be
thrice bitten at the Ear by a well enraged
Viper, in <U+017F>uch a manner that the bloud
came out at the three places pricked. We
<U+017F>oon ca<U+017F>t before him the head and neck,
broyled, and yet hot. The dog, that was
hungry, and felt not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon the effects
of the bitings, immediately <U+017F>eized on the
head, brui<U+017F>ed it between his teeth, and
<U+017F>wallowed it down: after which we <U+017F>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a pretty while to <U+017F>ee, whether the three
bitings would prevail over the devoured
head and neck; but the Dog was free, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<U+017F>ome blewne<U+017F>s and a little tumor, he
had at the places bitten, but which little
by little vani<U+017F>h't in three or four dayes.</p>
               <p>We made al<U+017F>o a dog to be bitten three
times in the <U+017F>ame place, and without broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the head of the <U+017F>ame Viper that had
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60888:73"/>
bit him, we ca<U+017F>t it to him, hoping that
he would eat it, becau<U+017F>e he had not eaten
any thing for many hours before; but the
dog would not touch it. Upon that we
brui<U+017F>ed and <U+017F>tamp'd that head in a mortar,
and <U+017F>o cramm'd it down the dogs throat;
rubbing al<U+017F>o the bitten places with the
bloud of the <U+017F>ame Viper: which done,
we expected the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; which was, that
this head, raw and brui<U+017F>ed, and if you will,
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the blood of the Viper, being
applyed to the part bitten, had produced
the <U+017F>ame effects with the former, which
had been <U+017F>o <U+017F>lightly broyl'd; in regard that
this dog was free, excepting tho<U+017F>e inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
the former <U+017F>uffer'd, and was, after
that as <U+017F>ound, as if he had never been bitten.</p>
               <p>If the<U+017F>e two Experiments had been
made, before that Gentleman, above
di<U+017F>cours'd of, was bitten by the Viper, we
<U+017F>hould have been in much le<U+017F>s anxiety for
his pre<U+017F>ervation. But it was enough, that
we were able to <U+017F>ecure him from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
effects of the biting, by wayes
grounded upon rea<U+017F>on, and by remedies,
that were more proper for <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, as
could not well re<U+017F>olve to eat the bare fle<U+017F>h
of Vipers.</p>

               <p>WHereas we gave but little credit
to what divers Authors have a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured
to be true, namely, that the Head of
a Viper brui<U+017F>ed and applyed to the biting
of it would heal the <U+017F>ame; we made a
Pigeon to be bitten in the mo<U+017F>t fle<U+017F>hy
part of its body, well freed of its feathers,
and we cut, brui<U+017F>ed, and applyed to the
place bitten, the head of the <U+017F>ame Viper,
that had wounded the Pigeon, and took
care to have it held upon it with a hand.
We al<U+017F>o cut the head of a living Viper, and
had it <U+017F>lightly broyl'd, then bruis'd and
laid hot to the wound of another Pigeon,
which had been newly bitten in the <U+017F>ame
place, to find, whether by the heat of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60888:74"/>
broyling, the parts of the head being more
open'd, and the <U+017F>pirits more <U+017F>et at liberty,
they would work better; but the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s
was not more beneficial for one Pigeon,
than the other; for they both dyed half a
quarter of an hour after they had been bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and their bodies being open'd, we
found in them, what we did in others, kill'd
by Vipers, namely a blacki<U+017F>h blood, in part
coagulated, and half corrupted, in the heart
and the great ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; but we took notice,
that there was le<U+017F>s black &amp; blew about the
place bitten; which was perhaps all the
effect, that the<U+017F>e brui<U+017F>ed heads had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
which had not been able to carry
their virtue any farther.</p>
               <p>It is not <U+017F>o, (to <U+017F>ay that on the by)
with the pricking of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> which being
brui<U+017F>ed on the part <U+017F>tung, <U+017F>erves for an
Antidote, and cureth: for which this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
may be alledged, that the venom of
a Scorpion, not working <U+017F>o briskly, and
not piercing with <U+017F>o much quickne<U+017F>s unto
the inward parts; the Spirits, that i<U+017F><U+017F>ue
from the brui<U+017F>ed Scorpion, have lei<U+017F>ure to
make way for them<U+017F>elves, and to go and
find out the venom, to joyn with it, and
to make it come forth; whereas the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60888:75"/>
of the Viper goes immediately to
taint the ma<U+017F>s of the blood, and the
parts which it bedeweth; as was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in our Gentleman, who had no pains
nor <U+017F>welling in his arm, but after all the
other accidents; contrary to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scorpions Venom, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth further, acteth upon the
part prick'd by benumming, cold, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
or by inflammation, and very great
pains; as tho<U+017F>e Authors, that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thereof, and the per<U+017F>ons, that have
been prick'd by them, doe a<U+017F><U+017F>ure.</p>
               <p>We have found very true, what Signor
<hi>Redi</hi> hath <U+017F>aid of the effects of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence
of <hi>Tobacco</hi> upon Vipers; That, running
their skin through with a thred dipp'd in
that e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and leaving the thred in the
skin, the Viper dies in le<U+017F>s than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, and becomes as hard as
bra<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>oon after <U+017F>upple and plyant.
We have al<U+017F>o tryed, that a little piece of
Tobacco in the roll, held in the throat of a
Viper, and the <U+017F>moak of Tobacco blown
into its throat produce the like effect,
but a little more <U+017F>lowly; and that both
do cau<U+017F>e convul<U+017F>ions, and extraordinary
contractions in a viper, which are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60888:75"/>
with death; and that, when all the
other parts of the body are deprived of
motion, the heart yet beats about half an
hour after; and that Tobacco, or its e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence,
kills Snakes as well as Vipers. I know
not, whether this will do with other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<U+017F>ince, having run a thred dipt in the
e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of Tobacco, into the skin of the
under-belly of a Dog, he immediately how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
very much, and continued <U+017F>o to do for
half a quarter of an hour, running round,
then lying down, and then ri<U+017F>ing again, and
in the mean time purging above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and voyding excrements more liquid
then ordinarily. He would eat nothing,
and onely drunk now and then a little, after
which he vomited; but this was all the
trouble he had, which in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and <U+017F>oon after, without any other
accident.</p>
               <p>We have vexed a viper, and made it to
bite another viper, which on purpo<U+017F>e we
held within the reach of its teeth. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<U+017F>he open'd her throat, and put her
<U+017F>elf into a po<U+017F>ture of biting, yet <U+017F>he refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and <U+017F>unk not her teeth deep into the
body of the other; which moved us to
thru<U+017F>t them our <U+017F>elves by pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her jaws;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60888:76"/>
but the bitten viper received no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
from it. Yet we have ob<U+017F>erved,
that a viper which was made to <U+017F>wallow
<U+017F>ome of the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of Tobacco, and which
we yet held by the neck with pincers, did
bite her<U+017F>elf; but as the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence alone fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to kill her, <U+017F>o there was no rea<U+017F>on
to impute her death to this kind of biting,
which was probably an effect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ive
motions cau<U+017F>ed by the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of
Tobacco.</p>
               <p>We al<U+017F>o pierced twice, in the day-light,
with the point of a pen-knife, the head
of a live viper in the mid<U+017F>t of the Brain,
from the top to the botom; one thru<U+017F>t
long-wayes, the other cro<U+017F>s-wayes, and
in <U+017F>uch a manner, that the blood run out
both above and below; but notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the viper, being let loo<U+017F>e, crept
about as before, and as if <U+017F>he had not
been wounded; but <U+017F>he <U+017F>till lo<U+017F>t bloud by
the wounds, and at la<U+017F>t dyed at the end of
an hour, but her heart did <U+017F>till beat and
continue to do <U+017F>o two hours after. Which
Experiment <U+017F>ufficiently argues the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
vivacity of the Spirits of the
viper.</p>
               <p>We have al<U+017F>o put into a gla<U+017F>s-ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60888:76"/>
living viper, together with three live <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi>
and there left them together four
dayes; but found them in the <U+017F>ame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in which they were, when we put
them in, though there be Authors that
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure, that the<U+017F>e Animals kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being <U+017F>hut up together in one and
the <U+017F>ame ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. Mean time a viper will
kill Scorpions, as well as Lizzards, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animals to devour them and feed upon
them, but that <U+017F>he doth only, when <U+017F>he is
at liberty, and not when impri<U+017F>on'd; for
then <U+017F>he cea<U+017F>eth to take food.</p>
               <p>We have likewi<U+017F>e found the contrary
to what Authors have affirm'd of the
<hi>Wa<U+017F>pe's</hi> attaching a Viper, and that the
former would fix its <U+017F>ting into the head of
the latter, and quitted her not, till <U+017F>he were
dead.</p>
               <p>Divers Authors have a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that all
the remedies, which are reputed Alexite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
or Pre<U+017F>ervatives again<U+017F>t poi<U+017F>on, did
kill Vipers, by their vertue contrary and
oppo<U+017F>ite to their venom. To be certain
hereof, we forced a Viper to <U+017F>wallow half
a drachm of <hi>Theriaque,</hi> di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in <hi>Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Benedictus</hi>-water; and having laid her
a<U+017F>ide, we perceived not any change in her,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60888:77"/>
except that the <U+017F>urface of her skin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
for a while a little moi<U+017F>t; but <U+017F>he
grew more vivid upon it, and more ready to
bite than before.</p>
               <p>We had al<U+017F>o a minde to know the effect
of <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> upon a Viper. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made one <U+017F>wallow about a drachme of
it; which thereupon was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>tun'd,
and then fell into <U+017F>trange agitations; but
<U+017F>eeing that that cea<U+017F>ed little by little, we
gave her another do<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
which not onely caus'd in her
the like agitation, but afterwards made
her almo<U+017F>t un-moved, and <U+017F>o inebriated
her that <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be half dead. She
remain'd about three hours in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but at length <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>tir again,
and was like the former, more brisk, and
more di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to bite than before. We
put al<U+017F>o a living Viper into a bottle almo<U+017F>t
full of Spirit of wine, and we <U+017F>aw, that <U+017F>he
turned to and fro therein, now <U+017F>wimming
on the top, then in the middle, and by and
by at the bottom of the bottle, and that
<U+017F>he re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted a good hour, before <U+017F>he was
choaked therein.</p>
               <p>We cau<U+017F>ed likewi<U+017F>e a Viper to <U+017F>wallow
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>ugar, part of which was in powder,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60888:77"/>
and the other part di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in water. She
kept the whole for a while with her, but
afterwards vomited it up; and having laid
her a<U+017F>ide, to <U+017F>ee, what would become of
her, we found her dead four and twenty
hours after.</p>
               <p>We have often <U+017F>pit into the throats of
many Vipers, even when we were fa<U+017F>ting,
but they <U+017F>oon after ca<U+017F>t up our <U+017F>pitle, and
had not any hurt thereby; though there
be Authours affirming that Vipers become
tabid or con<U+017F>umptive thereby; which yet
may very well happen, not from thence,
but rather from the ab<U+017F>tinence and <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s,
after a long impri<U+017F>onment.</p>
               <p>Many Authors have mentioned, that
Vipers have a great Antipathy to <hi>A<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
and that, if a live Viper were put
within a round, made, one half, of the leaves
of A<U+017F>h, and the other half, of kindled
coales, the Viper would rather expo<U+017F>e
her<U+017F>elf to be burnt, then to come near the
A<U+017F>h-leaves. But having made a whole
round of <U+017F>uch leaves, which had about
three foot in diameter, we put a Viper in
the mid<U+017F>t, which pre<U+017F>ently hid her<U+017F>elf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
tho<U+017F>e leaves.</p>
               <p>While<U+017F>t I had live Vipers in my hou<U+017F>e,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60888:78"/>
<U+017F>everal Women with child came to me,
<U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ignedly to <U+017F>ee them, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any <U+017F>uch thought, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>urpris'd at, and abhorring the <U+017F>ight of
them; but none of them having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenienced
by it; <U+017F>o far were they from
mi<U+017F>carrying thereupon, as certain Authors
would beare us in hand they would do.
Not that <U+017F>uch a thing may not chance to
happen to <U+017F>ome woman or other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fearful, and of a temper <U+017F>o delicate,
that a much le<U+017F>s occa<U+017F>ion might produce
<U+017F>uch an effect; but that ought not to pa<U+017F>s
for a general rule.</p>
               <p>We have often pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome Vipers,
both Males and Females, at the place,
where be the <hi>Para<U+017F>tates,</hi> or the Bladders
containing the <U+017F>eed, namely under the tail,
and near the openings, which <U+017F>erve for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
and have <U+017F>o much and <U+017F>o long
pre<U+017F>s'd them, that a white liquor came
forth; but we never perceived there any
piercing or ill-<U+017F>ented <U+017F>mell, no more than
we did in opening tho<U+017F>e <hi>Para<U+017F>tates</hi> with a

               <head>CHAPT. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">GENERAL REFLEXIONS
Vpon all we have experimented.</head>
               <p>THE great care and attention u<U+017F>ed
by us in the Experiments, we have
hitherto de<U+017F>cribed, and in tho<U+017F>e,
we have thought fit to <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s, hath
made us to profit of all the occa<U+017F>ions, that
pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves; and we have taken
plea<U+017F>ure to ob<U+017F>erve all the effects, that
have appeared to us, and carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, and inquired into their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
afterwards, that we might make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
thereon.</p>
               <p>The Biting of the Viper, which hapned
to the Gentleman Stranger, began to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h
us with much matter; and at that
time we knew the Venom by its effects,
which <U+017F>eem'd to proceed from a very <U+017F>light
cau<U+017F>e, it being nothing but a little prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and onely the cut of a tooth, which
was not any thing deep, and the ill of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60888:79"/>
which did not <U+017F>eem to us increa<U+017F>ed by any
of the yellow liquor of the Gums, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of which was not yet fully known
to us. In the mean time the mortal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
came on in great number, whil<U+017F>t
continued vomitings hinder'd the effect
of the remedies, which could not be
kept in the Stomach, to communicate
from thence <U+017F>ome of their vertue to the
parts affected. It was well enough known,
that there was <U+017F>omething very <U+017F>ubtile, very
quick, and very powerful in this Venom;
and it was al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umed, that that re<U+017F>ided
in the Spirits; but the nature of it, or by
what means, or how, or on what parts it
acted, was not known <U+017F>o well.</p>
               <p>Yet we mu<U+017F>t avow, that on an occa<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, <U+017F>o dangerous, and <U+017F>o extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
we could not take our mea<U+017F>ures bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than by having recour<U+017F>e to the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Salt of Vipers. The cau<U+017F>e being <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and <U+017F>pirituous, there was required a
remedy of the like nature, that might be
able to make ha<U+017F>te to finde it out, to joyn
with it, and to draw it to the extremities
of the body, and to make it come forth
by the wayes, it had opened for it. But
then, the continual vomiting demanded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60888:79"/>
the aid of <U+017F>uch a remedy, that could
work in a moment, or execute at lea<U+017F>t by
<U+017F>everal takings, what it was not able to do
at the fir<U+017F>t. The happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the u<U+017F>e of this Volatile <U+017F>alt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
acquainted us with the <U+017F>ufficiency
thereof, and <U+017F>howed us the ma<U+017F>tery it had
over the malignity of tho<U+017F>e Spirits. It al<U+017F>o
begot in us a de<U+017F>ire to know aright, in what
manner it produced <U+017F>uch good effects, and
to be enabled <U+017F>o to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of it, as that
others might have no rea<U+017F>on to reject our
<U+017F>entiments.</p>
               <p>We e<U+017F>teem therefore, <hi>that</hi> this Salt,
by its <U+017F>ubtile, volatile and piercing quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is very proper to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Bloud, and to <U+017F>ever the parts,
which therein were congeal'd or fix'd, (if
we may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak) and caus'd the di<U+017F>order
and confu<U+017F>ion of its motion; <hi>that</hi> it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
this in the Blood of the <U+017F>aid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
which it re<U+017F>tor'd to its former
condition, and <U+017F>o gave again to the parts
the free communication of the Spirits,
which they had lo<U+017F>t. We believe al<U+017F>o,
that this Volatile Salt, by the facility it
had to hook and fa<U+017F>ten it <U+017F>elf unto tho<U+017F>e
vexed Spirits, as being of the like nature,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60888:80"/>
did ea<U+017F>ily joyn with them, and drove them
to the extremities of the body, drawing
them forth through the pores of the skin,
and i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out with them by the way, it
had open'd for them.</p>
               <p>The Ligatures made about the place
bitten, the Scarifications, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the well heated iron-<U+017F>patuls to
the wound, were to <U+017F>erve to <U+017F>tay the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s
of tho<U+017F>e irritated Spirits, and
to give them an out-let at the<U+017F>e openings,
rather than that they <U+017F>hould go farther:
And the exhibition of the Theriaque, the
Viper-powder, and the like, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to drive them back, as it might have
done, if the<U+017F>e remedies had <U+017F>tay'd in the
Stomach. As al<U+017F>o the <hi>Epithemes</hi> of
Theriaque upon the Heart and Stomach
might have <U+017F>erv'd much, if the action of
the enrag'd <U+017F>pirits had been more <U+017F>low,
and if at the time of their application
tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits had not been too farre ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>But the U<U+017F>e of this Volatile Salt was to
carry the Bell, as it did, from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedies; and tho<U+017F>e, that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
afterwards and in the intervals of
its exhibition, were nothing, if we may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60888:80"/>
<U+017F>o <U+017F>peak, but Souldiers a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<U+017F>uch as the Confection of <hi>Alkermes</hi>
and of <hi>Hyacinthe,</hi> which were very proper
to fortify the noble parts; as al<U+017F>o were the
Syrup of Limons, and the Decoction of
Scorzonera, and the <U+017F>havings of Ivory.</p>
               <p>The Slices of Citron, which might
<U+017F>eem to <U+017F>ome by their acidity capable to
augment the coagulation of the blood,
were not given till after the Volatile Salt
had u<U+017F>ed its force to di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate it; and they
<U+017F>erved to recover the Stomach, debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by continual vomiting, and by their
acidne<U+017F>s to re<U+017F>tore the lo<U+017F>t appetite, and
to help the concoction of the aliments, and
their di<U+017F>tribution into the parts, that had
need of them. Be<U+017F>ides that Citrons have
a <U+017F>pecifique vertue again<U+017F>t the poy<U+017F>on of
Vipers, if we will believe tho<U+017F>e Authors,
that have written of it; and is a great
friend to the Heart and the other noble
parts.</p>
               <p>The Anointing with the Oyle of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and with the water of
the <hi>Queen of Hungary,</hi> made upon the
<U+017F>well'd parts, and the application of Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
fomentations, <U+017F>hould in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
have <U+017F>erv'd much; but the <U+017F>equele
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60888:81"/>
<U+017F>hew'd, that there was nothing but that
Volatile Salt, which could make tho<U+017F>e an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Spirits <U+017F>urrender, and <U+017F>o was to take
the honour of all.</p>
               <p>The Experiments, which we afterwards
made upon a great number of differing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
have given us a much greater
knowledg of the effects of Vipers-poy<U+017F>on,
of the parts on which it works, and of
tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>eem to be exempt from it,
though at la<U+017F>t they do <U+017F>uccumbe: We
have <U+017F>et down the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable of
them, making <U+017F>ome reflexions on the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <U+017F>everal Doggs, done by Vipers;
but there remain'd <U+017F>till for us to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
Why and How the parts of Vipers, being
eaten, can <U+017F>top and overcome the Venom
of their biting.</p>
               <p>We <U+017F>ay therefore, that all the parts of
a Viper abound chiefly in Volatile Salt,
which in di<U+017F>tillation is found partly alone;
partly in the form of a Spirit, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is nothing but a Salt di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in <U+017F>ome
portion of Phlegme; and partly in the
form of an Oyle, which al<U+017F>o is but a Salt
mix't among the unctuous part of a Viper.
We <U+017F>ay al<U+017F>o, that in the dige<U+017F>tion, made
in the Stomach, of the parts of a Vipers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60888:81"/>
body, that have been <U+017F>wallowed down,
this <U+017F>ame Volatile Salt, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is <U+017F>eparated, and afterwards di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the parts that need them; e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if of the<U+017F>e parts there have been
<U+017F>wallow'd enow, to furni<U+017F>h that quantity,
which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, of this Salt; and <U+017F>o we
need not doubt, but that this Salt will
produce an effect like that of the Volatile
Salt, which was given to our Gentleman
bitten; Unle<U+017F>s it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid, that this
<U+017F>ame Volatile Salt of tho<U+017F>e parts of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
body, which have been <U+017F>wallowed,
being of the <U+017F>ame nature with the irritated
Spirits, attracts them to it <U+017F>elf, and by
this union changes their maligne quality,
and <U+017F>o tames them, that they have no
power over the bitten Animal; which, in
my opinion, is hard enough to conceive,
and perhaps e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed upon un<U+017F>olid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>We hope, that among the many Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
tho<U+017F>e of the Five Pigeons, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
one after another, by one and the <U+017F>ame
Viper exa<U+017F>perated, and of which the la<U+017F>t
bitten dyed fir<U+017F>t of all, when the Viper was
mo<U+017F>t vexed, and mo<U+017F>t exhau<U+017F>ted of its yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
liquor; and that of the Pigeon bitten by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60888:82"/>
Viper, which we had cau<U+017F>ed to bite <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times into bread before, and that even
till bloud came forth, to the end that the
Juyce might be well emptied of it, and
which notwith<U+017F>tanding was followed by
the death of the Pigeon; The<U+017F>e Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I <U+017F>ay, will prove on one hand,
that the yellow liquor contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the poy<U+017F>on; and on the other,
that the<U+017F>e incen<U+017F>ed Spirits, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the
openings which the great Teeth had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, are the <U+017F>ole and true
cau<U+017F>e thereof.</p>
               <p>The wound, made by a Viper not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed,
who<U+017F>e jaws were held in, and who<U+017F>e
teeth were at the <U+017F>ame time thru<U+017F>t into the
body of a Pigeon, which al<U+017F>o was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with <U+017F>tore of the yellow juyce, and
yet not attended with any ill accident;
as al<U+017F>o the pricking, made by the great
teeth, pulled out of a live Viper, or by
<U+017F>uch, as <U+017F>tuck yet in the head of a dead
Viper, and did no hurt at all, do <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm this truth, viz. that the cau<U+017F>e of
the Venom is to be imputed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
enraged, and not to any other thing
or parts in the Vipers body.</p>
               <p>I have not undertaken to rea<U+017F>on upon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60888:82"/>
all the Experiments, we have made, as I
have done upon the Bitings, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
that is beyond the Sphere of a man
of my profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and becau<U+017F>e I de<U+017F>igned
onely to confine my <U+017F>elf particularly to
the wounds and to the Remedies able to
heal them.</p>
               <p>For the re<U+017F>t, if in the Treaty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Theriaque, which I have lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>ht,
I have advanced any thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onant
to what I have declared here,
touching the action of the Venom, I
am to be excu<U+017F>ed therein, fora<U+017F>much as
I had not then had the occa<U+017F>ion, well to
know the nature and the effects of the
Bitings of Vipers, and referred my <U+017F>elf to
the mo<U+017F>t approved Authors about it.
But yet all we have there <U+017F>aid, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
in nothing from the preparation of
Vipers for Theriaque, which we have
there laid down, and which was in that
Book our main de<U+017F>ign, as well as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<U+017F>everal other preparations, that
<U+017F>eemed not rea<U+017F>onable to us: That which
now remains to be done by us, is, to <U+017F>peak
of the Remedies to be drawn from Vipers,
which may <U+017F>erve to heal their bitings,
and to cure many other evils.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the different choyce that
may be made of the parts of
a Viper.</head>
               <p>THere is nothing in Nature, to
which can be given more ju<U+017F>tly
the title both of <hi>Aliment</hi> and
<hi>Medicine,</hi> than to a Viper, <U+017F>ince it affords
equally very good Nouri<U+017F>hment and very
good Remedies. It al<U+017F>o hath in its Body
not one part, which is not very u<U+017F>efull,
and of which Arti<U+017F>ts may not draw <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60888:83"/>
that is good; their chief difference
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in this, that the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the
one is more or le<U+017F>s clo<U+017F>e, then that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Yet, as in all Bodies of Animals,
there are parts preferable to others, <U+017F>o
we may make a di<U+017F>tinction of tho<U+017F>e in a
Viper, e<U+017F>pecially if we mean to eat them,
or to reduce them to powder, to take it
at the mouth, alone, or mingled with other
medicaments.</p>
               <p>In this ca<U+017F>e, it will be well, to u<U+017F>e on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Heart, the Liver, and the Trunk,
I mean, the Body emptied of its guts,
without head and tayle. Not that, if you
would make u<U+017F>e of the head and taile,
any ill would attend it, or that you need
to fear any ill quality in them, no more
than in all the other parts of the body;
but the Heart, Liver and Trunk are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en,
as tho<U+017F>e that are mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem'd, and
which are taken before the re<U+017F>t, out of
the body of <U+017F>uch Animals, which men
u<U+017F>e to feed upon. Tho<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, that
would nouri<U+017F>h them<U+017F>elves with Viper-fle<U+017F>h
boyled and <U+017F>ea<U+017F>oned, may do well, in
eating of it, to <U+017F>eparate the bones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to leave them uneaten: but if
they brui<U+017F>e them between their teeth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60888:84"/>
and <U+017F>wallow them down together with the
fle<U+017F>h, they would afford them a like, and
even a <U+017F>tronger nouri<U+017F>hment than the
fle<U+017F>h: for, we have found by Di<U+017F>tillation,
that the Bones yield the <U+017F>ame parts, that
the Fle<U+017F>h does and even in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
For the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, the Bones of
the trunk are not to be ca<U+017F>t away, when
you will prepare the powder of Vipers, and
that the rather, becau<U+017F>e they are in that
way very ea<U+017F>y to <U+017F>wallow. One may al<U+017F>o
very u<U+017F>efully dre<U+017F>s the fle<U+017F>h of Vipers with
their own fat, as one would do with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or with the fat of other animals. The
Skin it <U+017F>elf, if men would, might be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and eaten with benefit; but that it
would not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>avory, as the principal
parts we have been <U+017F>peaking of.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Chymical</hi> preparations, all
the parts of Vipers may be therein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and I would not except from them
the Stomach it <U+017F>elf, nor the Inte<U+017F>tins, if they
were well clear'd of Worms, and all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
               <p>I al<U+017F>o know no difference, as to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
of one Sex from the other, although
mo<U+017F>t Authors have pre<U+017F>cribed the u<U+017F>e of
Females: On the contrary, if there be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60888:84"/>
any <U+017F>uch difference, I would preferre the
Males to the Females, when the<U+017F>e are full
of Eggs, and big, fora<U+017F>much as then they
are too much wa<U+017F>ted for the feeding and
increa<U+017F>ing of their Eggs.</p>
               <p>As to the Sea<U+017F>ons, in which they are to
be taken and u<U+017F>ed, I almo<U+017F>t equally con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumne;</hi> for the times
wherein men need them, ought to carry
it in the behalf of tho<U+017F>e who have a mind
to feed on them. But care mu<U+017F>t be had
to chu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch Vipers, as are bigg, fat, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and active; and not to keep them
very long after they have been taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they grow leaner and le<U+017F><U+017F>er every

of food, which after that time they u<U+017F>e

between tho<U+017F>e Vipers of <hi>France,</hi> that are
bred in one Province, and tho<U+017F>e of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Poitou</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

The place therefore is not to be con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Authors have di<U+017F>approved for Vipers,

               <p>THere is <U+017F>carce an Author, that hath
written of Vipers, but affirms, that
in <U+017F>everal parts of the World, many
per<U+017F>ons, and even whole Nations, have fed,
and <U+017F>till feed upon the fle<U+017F>h of Vipers;
in <U+017F>omuch that in great and co<U+017F>tly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
they made exqui<U+017F>ite and very
con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>hes of it. There are al<U+017F>o,
that have alledged for an example <U+017F>ome
Nations, which by the u<U+017F>e of Viper-fle<U+017F>h,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60888:85"/>
have extraordinarily lengthn'd their life,
even to 140. years. It is needle<U+017F>s, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ert
here the te<U+017F>timonies of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
on this <U+017F>ubject; the Curious may
finde them in Books. We content our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to affirm, that many per<U+017F>ons do <U+017F>till
u<U+017F>e it at this time in divers Countries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be from Cu<U+017F>tom, or to <U+017F>atisfie their
appetite, or by the Advice of knowing
Phy<U+017F>itians, and that upon occa<U+017F>ions they
finde wonderful effects thereof. I al<U+017F>o
doubt not, but that the u<U+017F>e of it would
be more frequent among us, if the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Vipers were well known, and if one
could di<U+017F>lodge out of the minde of people
the horrour and natural antipathy, they
have again<U+017F>t this animal. For the ta<U+017F>te of
Viper-fle<U+017F>h is very like that of Eeles;
whence it is, that in <U+017F>ome Countries Vipers
are called <hi>Eeles of the Mountain;</hi> and one
finds <U+017F>omething in them even more <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
than in Eeles. I know per<U+017F>ons,
who well knowing the mo<U+017F>t inward parts
of Vipers, have out of merriment, and in
company, made good meals of them, and
found it very <U+017F>avory meat. But tho<U+017F>e
that have too much aver<U+017F>ion from this
kind of food, may find very convenient
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60888:86"/>
wayes to benefit them<U+017F>elves by the vertue
of them, <U+017F>o as not to be diverted from it by
any abhorrency of the animal: for they
may feed Capons and Pullets with the
fle<U+017F>h of Vipers cut in <U+017F>mall pieces, which
tho<U+017F>e Creatures eat very greedily; and
continuing for <U+017F>ome time to feed them
therewith, it will certainly communicate
the vertue of the Vipers to the body of
tho<U+017F>e Animals; which may be eaten, as
we eate other Capons or Pullets, the ta<U+017F>te
of which will be very <U+017F>avoury, becau<U+017F>e
that of Viper fle<U+017F>h is <U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>Neither ought we to doubt, that the
qualities of Vipers pa<U+017F>s into the bodies of
tho<U+017F>e animals, <U+017F>ince there are innumerable
others, the fle<U+017F>h of which hath not onely
the vertue, but even the ta<U+017F>te of the
things, they are fed with. The fle<U+017F>h of
the Birds, that live on Juniper-berries,
and of tho<U+017F>e, that live onely upon Olives,
hath not onely their qualities, but al<U+017F>o
their ta<U+017F>te and bitterne<U+017F>s, and that <U+017F>o high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that one can <U+017F>care eat them. In the
Countries, where Silk-worms are bred,
it is ob<U+017F>erved, that in their <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, which
is chiefly in the months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi>
the Eggs of Hens, that eat tho<U+017F>e Worms,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60888:86"/>
have a ta<U+017F>te and <U+017F>mell of them, as well as
their fle<U+017F>h; in<U+017F>omuch that nice per<U+017F>ons
feed their Poultry a part, and hinder them
from eating any Silk-worms. It may be
taken notice of, to this purpo<U+017F>e, that 'tis
a cu<U+017F>tome to give to Nur<U+017F>es the medicines,
which young Children cannot be made
to take, to the end that their vertue may
pa<U+017F>s from the body of the Nur<U+017F>e to that of
the Child; and it hath been often ob<U+017F>erv'd,
that the Urine of the Babe hath had the
<U+017F>ent of the Druggs the Nur<U+017F>e had
taken.</p>
               <p>But yet <U+017F>ome might phan<U+017F>y, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
cannot take the good from the good
parts of the things eaten by them, but
they mu<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of the ill ones, that are there;
and it might even be objected, that Liz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
Scorpions, Cantharides, and the
other Creatures, on which Vipers do feed,
<U+017F>hould impre<U+017F>s in their bodies the ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
they have, as, among the re<U+017F>t, the
Cantharid, its Cau<U+017F>tique quality. But
notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, the Experience
we have of the harmle<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s of Vipers-bodies,
and al<U+017F>o of their good qualities,
furni<U+017F>hes us with a contrary argument, <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60888:87"/>
to de<U+017F>troy that phan<U+017F>y; and it
teaches us, that the <U+017F>tomach of Animals
converteth into good all the ill qualities,
to be met with in the bodies, it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to dige<U+017F>t; and that it uniteth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriateth
the good ones to the very <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
of the Animal that hath eaten
them: Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that it
is as 'twere transformed, or at lea<U+017F>t very
much changed by tho<U+017F>e good qualities;
and is upon that account capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them to other animals, into
who<U+017F>e <U+017F>tomach it enters to be there dige<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We <U+017F>ay be<U+017F>ides, that there are
divers Examples of Bodies, that would be
altogether poy<U+017F>onous in the <U+017F>tomach of
men, which yet <U+017F>erve for food to, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
other animals, which afterwards yield
good nouri<U+017F>hment to men. Such are <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore</hi>
and <hi>Hemlock,</hi> which nouri<U+017F>h and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Quailes and Goates, which afterwards
are u<U+017F>efully employed for the nouri<U+017F>hment
of men; and this is it, what <hi>Lucrece</hi> hath
very well ob<U+017F>erved in the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es;

               <p>But tho<U+017F>e, that have no aver<U+017F>ion from
Vipers-fle<U+017F>h, may take of them the Heart,
the Liver, and the Trunck, and having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed

them to their own ta<U+017F>te in the dre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing.

herbs, as Garden- and Wild-Thyme, and
the like; or a little Nutmeg, Cinamon,
Cloves, to rai<U+017F>e the ta<U+017F>te. They mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o
avoid the fault, committed by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
whipping and vexing the Vipers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they killed them; lea<U+017F>t this irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome ill impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in their
body, which by it <U+017F>elf hath no venom at
all in it. Let them al<U+017F>o not ca<U+017F>t away the
broth, wherein the Vipers have been boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becau<U+017F>e it retaines the greate<U+017F>t vertue
of them. Neither do I <U+017F>ee, why one <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>tint the quantity, or limit the time of the
u<U+017F>e of it; that depending from the degree
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60888:88"/>
of the illne<U+017F>s, and from the con<U+017F>titution of
the per<U+017F>ons, that will make u<U+017F>e thereof.
And although we know Vipers to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Alterative Medicine, and that their
chief u<U+017F>e is onely for their Medicinal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
yet if taken as an Aliment, there
is no danger at all to eat of their fle<U+017F>h, or
to drink of their broth, <U+017F>omewhat more
or <U+017F>omewhat le<U+017F>s. It is al<U+017F>o to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<U+017F>alted; and tho<U+017F>e that have any of
the Fixed Salt of Vipers, <U+017F>hall do well to
employ it. You may al<U+017F>o adde to it <U+017F>ome
of its Volatile Salt, if you will have the
Fle<U+017F>h of Vipers work more powerfully.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Vertues</hi> of Viper-fle<U+017F>h, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the con<U+017F>ent of innumerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
who<U+017F>e opinion is <U+017F>upported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
and truth, confirmed by many Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments;
we can <U+017F>ay, that they are very
great, and that there is no Animal in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that affords <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>o many: And
we wonder not at all, that the Antients
have <U+017F>o frequently employ'd Vipers in their
<hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> and adorned their <hi>Medals</hi>
with them; thereby to de<U+017F>ign very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
things for the publick, and
for private men; forasmuch as this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
is very capable to furni<U+017F>h them. For
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60888:88"/>
the u<U+017F>e of it pre<U+017F>erves the natural heat in a
very good temper, it repaireth the <U+017F>ame,
and re<U+017F>toreth it when 'tis altered; it yields
a very good food; helps dige<U+017F>tion by its
heat, which is not exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive; it retards
old age and prolongeth life, by a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which Vipers have, to maintain in
good plight the whole habit of the Body.
Whence it is, that many have believed,
that both Staggs and Eagles, induced to
it by a natural in<U+017F>tinct, eat all the Vipers,
they can meet with, and that 'tis upon
that <U+017F>core, that their life is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long.</p>
               <p>There is al<U+017F>o ad<U+017F>cribed to Vipers, and
not without rea<U+017F>on, a Renewing vertue,
capable to make young again; which they
tacitly <U+017F>hew, by ca<U+017F>ting their skin twice
a year, and renewing them<U+017F>elves by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of a new skin. This, joyned to the
<U+017F>ubtile parts, of which the Viper is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed,
and to its lively and daring a<U+017F>pect,
te<U+017F>tifies it to be pertinent enough, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have attributed to it the vertue of
clearing and <U+017F>trengthning the Eyes.</p>
               <p>Vipers have al<U+017F>o a very particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Clean<U+017F>ing the whole Body, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Bloud, and of expelling
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60888:89"/>
through the pores of its skin all the <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities:
Whence it may be inferred, that
they are very proper to cure the <hi>Itch, Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
Ery<U+017F>ipelas</hi> or Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els,
Small Pox,</hi> and the <hi>Lepro<U+017F>y</hi> it <U+017F>elf, the
u<U+017F>e of them being long enough continued;
though I cannot well believe what <hi>Galen</hi>
<U+017F>aith, That the Wine, wherein one onely
Viper is choaked, is able to cure <U+017F>o great
an Evil, and which doth not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily yield
to remedies.</p>
               <p>Vipers al<U+017F>o may, by removing all the
impurities and ob<U+017F>tructions of the Body and
skin, cau<U+017F>e beauty therein; and upon this
account it is, that many Ladies in <hi>Italy</hi> u<U+017F>e
them for their ordinary food.</p>
               <p>By the good nouri<U+017F>hment, they yield
by the purity they give to the blood and
to all the parts, and by the liberty they
give to the Spirits to do their functions
therein, they are a great relief to per<U+017F>ons
in a Con<U+017F>umption, and to tho<U+017F>e that are
emaciated by long di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and wa<U+017F>ted by
tedious Feavers. There are even Authors,
who a<U+017F><U+017F>ure that the u<U+017F>e of them is capable
to cure the Venereal di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; for which we
doubt not but they may <U+017F>erve much, if they
do not altogether cure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60888:89"/>
Their mundifying vertue, joyned to the
Alexiterial, makes them al<U+017F>o very proper to
expell all <U+017F>orts of poy<U+017F>ons, and even the
Plague it <U+017F>elf and all contagious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es.
They are al<U+017F>o very contrary to all putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which commonly is the matter and
<U+017F>ource of mo<U+017F>t maladies; whence it comes,
that tho<U+017F>e who u<U+017F>e them, are not <U+017F>ubject to
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, unle<U+017F>s they live irregularly, which
is able to de<U+017F>troy all the good, which the
u<U+017F>e of Vipers might afford.</p>
               <p>We might here <U+017F>pecify many other <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es,
that might be cured by the u<U+017F>e of
Viper-fle<U+017F>h; but we think not fit to do <U+017F>o,
<U+017F>ince the general vertues, which we have

it. Yet we <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>cribe, in the Chapter

               <p>It is very certain, that the <hi>Head</hi> of a

all <U+017F>orts of contagious and epidemical di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>Divers Authors a<U+017F><U+017F>ure, that the <hi>Head</hi>
of a Viper, hung about the neck, hath a
very particular quality to cure the Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
and all the di<U+017F>tempers of the Throat;
and that the Brain of a Viper, wrapt up
in a little skin, and likewi<U+017F>e hung about
the neck, is very good to make the Teeth
of children come forth; which effect
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60888:91"/>
others believe to be due to the great teeth
of Vipers. If we had experimented it, we
could then <U+017F>peak with more certainty. The
remedies are ea<U+017F>ily practicable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
harmle<U+017F>s; wherefore tho<U+017F>e who need
them may make tryal of them.</p>
               <p>Some al<U+017F>o have affirmed, that the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of a Viper, <U+017F>wallowed, keeps one from
being bitten either by this Animal, or
by any other <U+017F>erpent, and that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Vipers hath the <U+017F>ame efficacy. But
we mu<U+017F>t not rely upon their report; we
onely believe, that the Liver <U+017F>wallowed
is capable to heal the biting of a Viper;
like the heart, fle<U+017F>h, and other parts, of
which we have <U+017F>poken; and that it may
much facilitate the delivery of Women
with child, as doth the Liver of Eeles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> of a Viper is not altogether
de<U+017F>titute of vertue; for be<U+017F>ides that it is
al<U+017F>o, as they <U+017F>ay, very good for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of women, making a garter of it
about the right leg, it hath a very <U+017F>ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
vertue for all the di<U+017F>tempers of humane
skin: And although all the other parts,
eaten, may work the <U+017F>ame thing; yet, that
we might have benefit from all, we have
experimented, that the Viper-skin does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60888:91"/>
heal the inveterate mangie of Dogs,
making them eat it boyled or raw. It might
al<U+017F>o be <U+017F>aid, that the <U+017F>pecks in the Viper-skin
<U+017F>eem to <U+017F>ignify the marks of the itch
or mangy, or, if you will, of the lepro<U+017F>y,
which the <U+017F>cales of the skin repre<U+017F>ent yet
better, and <U+017F>o tacitly expre<U+017F>s its vertue.</p>
               <p>Some have believed, that the <hi>Gall</hi> of a
Viper applyed, can heal its biting; but we
give no credit to it, no more than to the
application of its brui<U+017F>ed head. But this
we judge, that it is proper for the wound
of the biting, onely as it is for all other
wounds, and for ulcers them<U+017F>elves, having
a great ab<U+017F>ter<U+017F>ive, mundifying and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
vertue. It is al<U+017F>o very good for the
weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es of Eyes, above all, for <U+017F>uffu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and films, being taken inwardly, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
outwardly; <U+017F>o far it is from doing
them hurt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fat</hi> of Vipers hath very great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
for, be<U+017F>ides that it is very good in the
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the Viper-fle<U+017F>h (as hath been
<U+017F>aid) it is able al<U+017F>o, taking a drachm of it,
to give great relief in Epidemical di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,
and to expell the venom thereof. It is al<U+017F>o
very u<U+017F>eful to facilitate the travel of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and to di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the <U+017F>wellings of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60888:92"/>
the throat, anointing it outwardly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
It al<U+017F>o much relieves Gouty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
and <U+017F>erves to re<U+017F>olve nodo<U+017F>ities. It
un<U+017F>wels all hard and inveterate tumors, and
even tho<U+017F>e that proceed from Venereal di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es;
and for this rea<U+017F>on 'tis, that <hi>Jean de
Vigo</hi> hath u<U+017F>ed it in the Plai<U+017F>ter which bears
his name. It is likewi<U+017F>e very good for Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
pu<U+017F>tuls,' and all di<U+017F>tempers of the skin;
and la<U+017F>tly, it is very powerful again<U+017F>t all the
illne<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Sinews, and of great vertue
for the parts attackt by the Pal<U+017F>y. We
might al<U+017F>o adde many other vertues, ad<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by Authors to other parts of the Viper;
but we forbear, becau<U+017F>e we have not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented

per<U+017F>ons, who, having need to make
u<U+017F>e of Viper-fle<U+017F>h, are di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to

ready <U+017F>uch remedies, that be as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the inclination of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
as fitted to remove the malady.
The knowledge, which Phy<U+017F>itians have
bad of the great Vertues of the Viper, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the difficulty, met with in the point
of plea<U+017F>ing Patients, hath obliged them
to <U+017F>earch for divers Preparations, in which
the Antients did not well <U+017F>ucceed; and if
we would bind our<U+017F>elves to their way of
preparing the <hi>Powder</hi> and the <hi>Trochi<U+017F>ques,</hi>
we <U+017F>hould loo<U+017F>e the principal vertue of the
Viper, and retain onely the mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s.
For, in the opinion, which they entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60888:93"/>
that there remain'd alwayes <U+017F>ome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
in the fle<U+017F>h of the Viper, if it were
not freed therefrom by <U+017F>ome preparation
or other; their practice was, to put
the fle<U+017F>h of Vipers in <U+017F>ome earthen pot,
and having luted it, to <U+017F>et it in a Bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oven,
after the Bread was drawn out, and
to leave it there, till this fle<U+017F>h was reduced
to powder. In which preparation the be<U+017F>t
of this fle<U+017F>h, which is the Volatile Salt, was
certainly di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated. They al<U+017F>o made <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
medicines with this powder, mixt
among other medicaments divers wayes;
of which we need not to enlarge. We <U+017F>hall
content our<U+017F>elves, here to <U+017F>et down a
preparation of the <hi>Powder</hi> of Vipers, which
<U+017F>hall be grounded on Rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>Take then towards the end of <hi>Aprill,</hi> or
in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> <U+017F>uch a quantity of
Vipers as you plea<U+017F>e, Males and Females,
chu<U+017F>ing big ones, and <U+017F>uch as are fat and
vigorous, and u<U+017F>ing none of tho<U+017F>e Females,
which are already big with eggs; and then
prepare tho<U+017F>e, you <U+017F>hall have thus cho<U+017F>en,
as follows: Without whipping and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60888:93"/>
them, cut off, with a pair of <U+017F>izers,
their heads and tailes, flea them, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
them of all their entrals, of which you
are to <U+017F>eparate the heart and the Liver;
and lay a<U+017F>ide their fat for its peculiar u<U+017F>es.
Wa<U+017F>h the trunks of the bodies, the hearts
and livers in clear water, and after that in
white wine; then dry them with a very
clean linnen cloth, and having put the
hearts and livers again into their trunks,
tye all the trunks with <U+017F>mall pack-thred,
each at one end, and hang them up in the
air in the <U+017F>hade, and leave them there, till
they be well dryed; which will be in three
or four dayes. After that, cut the<U+017F>e
trunks into <U+017F>mall pieces, and <U+017F>tamp them
in a great Bra<U+017F>s-mortar with an iron-pe<U+017F>tle,
and <U+017F>earce all through a very fine hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive,
and <U+017F>o keep it for u<U+017F>e. This is the
right Powder of Vipers, which contains
all the vertues; to which may be added
a drop of Cinamon-oyle, to give it a good
<U+017F>cent.</p>
               <p>There are <U+017F>ome, who, to make this
powder would have the trunks of Vipers
cut in pieces, and put together with their
hearts and livers in a Gla<U+017F>s-cucurbit, and
this covered with its head and luted, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60888:94"/>
<U+017F>o placed with a recipient, in a very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Balneum;</hi> thereby, continuing that
warmth for three dayes together, to draw
the phlegm of Vipers, accompanied with
a <U+017F>mall portion of the Volatile Salt, and to
keep this liquor apart; and then to take
out of the Cucurbite what <U+017F>hall remain
there, and of it to make the powder of
Vipers.</p>
               <p>But, be<U+017F>ides <hi>that</hi> this method is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
enough; <hi>that</hi> the fire of a <hi>Balneum</hi> is
not <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>trong to <U+017F>end forth enough
of the Volatile Salt, at a time when 'tis
not yet loo<U+017F>en'd from its <U+017F>ubject; <hi>that</hi> 'tis
notwith<U+017F>tanding too much <U+017F>o, not to emit
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mal portion, which would
afterwards be wanting in the Powder, and
which al<U+017F>o may exhale out of the water;
be<U+017F>ides al<U+017F>o <hi>that</hi> the Vipers are in danger
to be too much dry'd in the Cucurbite,
and even to be there ro<U+017F>ted in part: We
e<U+017F>teem, there is cau<U+017F>e to prefer <hi>our</hi> Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to <hi>this,</hi> in regard it is much ea<U+017F>ier,
and, without any de<U+017F>truction or alteration
of the good parts of Vipers, carries away
all their <U+017F>uperfluous and u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>You might notwith<U+017F>tanding follow this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60888:94"/>
way in part, if you <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire to have
good Viper-water; but then you mu<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e
the fire of the <hi>Balneum,</hi> and fini<U+017F>h
the di<U+017F>tillation in much le<U+017F>s time, and yet
take heed not to ha<U+017F>ten the fire too much
at the latter end, lea<U+017F>t the water <U+017F>mell of
the <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or burning. You mu<U+017F>t
al<U+017F>o, after you have taken out the parts
of the Viper, that re<U+017F>t in the Cucurbite,
put them into a gla<U+017F>s-retort well luted,
and <U+017F>et this into a reverberating furnace,
dapt and exactly lute to it a great Recipient,
and give it a fire increa<U+017F>ed by degrees, and
hotter about the end, to obtain the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirit, Salt, and Oyle, that could not
ri<U+017F>e by the fire of the <hi>Balneum;</hi> which are
to be <U+017F>eparated and rectifyed, as we <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ay hereafter. Then take a portion of this
Volatile Salt well rectified, and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve
it in di<U+017F>tilled water, and keep it carefully
in a well <U+017F>topp'd bottle, as an excellent
remedy; of which you may increa<U+017F>e or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>h
the do<U+017F>e, according to per<U+017F>ons and
occa<U+017F>ions; and according as you <U+017F>hall have
di<U+017F><U+017F>olved more or le<U+017F>s of the Volatile Salt
in it.</p>
               <p>Upon this occa<U+017F>ion, I thought fit to
adverti<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e, who di<U+017F>till Capons, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,

<U+017F>lices of Veal, or other parts of
Animals, in a Gla<U+017F>s-limbec (as the cu<U+017F>tom
is,) and who employ for that purpo<U+017F>e the
fire of a <hi>Balneum,</hi> or that of Sand or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hes;
that by a moderate fire they cannot
make ri<U+017F>e almo<U+017F>t any thing but u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s
flegm; and that, not being able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e
the fire without making the di<U+017F>tilled

<U+017F>ucceed better, if in this they did, what
I was ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>aying of the water and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt of Vipers; and if they joyn'd
their water with the volatile Salt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tilled
Animals, in which re<U+017F>ides the chief
vertue. Tho<U+017F>e, that have no mind to take
<U+017F>o much pains, <U+017F>hall do better not to give
di<U+017F>tilled waters to their Patients, as the
cu<U+017F>tom is, <U+017F>ince they have no vertue at all,
if none be communicated to them by the
volatil Salt of the Animal,</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Trochi<U+017F>ques,</hi> the Antients
have as ill invented, and as ill ordered
them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as the <hi>Powder.</hi> For, not to <U+017F>tay to
blame here (as I have done el<U+017F>ewhere)
the whipping, which they u<U+017F>ed, and which
was not onely u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, but al<U+017F>o very noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay in a few words, that the
decoction, they made of the body of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60888:95"/>
Viper in Water, with Salt and Ani<U+017F>e, till
the fle<U+017F>h would <U+017F>ever from the bones,
which they afterwards ca<U+017F>t away as well as
the broth, was not a <hi>Preparation</hi> of the fle<U+017F>h
of the Viper, but rather a <hi>de<U+017F>truction,</hi> <U+017F>ince
it was made to leave its principal vertue in
the broth; and that they weaken'd it yet
more, by incorporating it with very dry
bread, of which the proportion of a fifth
to four times as much weight of fle<U+017F>h,
though but little in appearance, came yet
to a moiety, <U+017F>ince that four ounces of
this fle<U+017F>h, and one ounce of bread (which
was <U+017F>o dry that it could not be le<U+017F><U+017F>ened)
make onely two ounces of <hi>Trochi<U+017F>ques,</hi>
when they are well dry'd. This we have
more at large examined in our Treati<U+017F>e of
the <hi>Theriaque;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e their fault is
very ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tood, I <U+017F>hall in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on
it no farther; nor on their rea<U+017F>ons for
making u<U+017F>e of Boyling to correct a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
in the fle<U+017F>h, (of which there is none)
and to be able to <U+017F>ever it from the bones,
which they believe naught, or at lea<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<U+017F>efull,
which yet are very good; fora<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all their rea<U+017F>ons are <U+017F>ufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in the <U+017F>ame Book, and becau<U+017F>e they

And although it be not alwayes nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary
to make <hi>Trochi<U+017F>ques</hi> of Vipers, <U+017F>ince

Trochi<U+017F>ques are to be reduced into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when they are to be u<U+017F>ed. Neither
of them have an ill ta<U+017F>te, and they contain
all the vertues, we have a<U+017F>cribed to the
Fle<U+017F>h of Vipers, as having lo<U+017F>t nothing in
drying, made without the heat of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
but a <U+017F>uperfluous moi<U+017F>ture, which
could <U+017F>erve for nothing but corrupt them,
if it had remained. They may be given
in cordial waters, broths, wine, or <U+017F>ome fit
decoction, or you may make <hi>Bolus</hi>'s of
them with Syrrups, Con<U+017F>erves, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Confections, or turn them into tablets
with <U+017F>ugar.</p>
               <p>Their main effect is, to purify, open, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
and to drive to the extremities of
bodies all venom, corruptions, impurities,
<U+017F>uperfluities, and they may be very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60888:97"/>
u<U+017F>ed in many occa<U+017F>ions for divers
maladies, without the fear of any ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s.
For both have this quality, that they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<U+017F>ome good, but never any harm.
Their do<U+017F>e is from a Scruple to a drachm
or two; and they may be given to all ages,
and <U+017F>exes, and at all times.</p>

               <p>AMong many different Preparations
of the Salt of Vipers, made by the
Ancients, of which we finde the
de<U+017F>criptions in their Books, there is none
more famous, nor that hath been longer
in u<U+017F>e, than one that is very ample and
much enriched by many Alexiterial reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
whence tis al<U+017F>o, that they gave to
this Salt the name of <hi>Theriacal.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
con<U+017F>idered this pompous Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60888:97"/>
we do not wonder, that a much e<U+017F>teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author hath not given it his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<U+017F>ince we cannot finde any thing in it,
that is according to rule or rea<U+017F>on, no more
than there is in the re<U+017F>t. We finde, that
the <U+017F>entiments of that Author proceed
from an under<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>o judicious, and <U+017F>o
knowing, that we cannot but <U+017F>ub<U+017F>cribe to
them, almo<U+017F>t in all: For, in the Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they u<U+017F>ed, there remain'd nothing
but the <hi>fix't</hi> Salt, which contains but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little vertue; Vipers, as all <U+017F>orts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
having but little of Fixt Salt,
whereas they have much of the Volatile,
which <U+017F>oon ri<U+017F>eth in the Calcination, and
carries away with it the principal and the
mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ential vertue of the Animal. They
were al<U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>taken, when they
thought, that <hi>four</hi> Vipers, which they
burn'd with <hi>fourty</hi> pounds of Sea-<U+017F>alt, or
<hi>Sal Gemmae,</hi> or <hi>Sal Ammoniac,</hi> (as <U+017F>ome
would have it) and with a great quantity
of Simples, <U+017F>hould communicate great
vertues to the<U+017F>e Salts and the<U+017F>e Coales.
For in the Calcination, which they u<U+017F>ed
to make in an earthen pot luted, with
its cover on, and yet in one place
pierced, the Volatil Salt of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60888:98"/>
four Vipers would certainly fly quickly
away; and if it had <U+017F>tay'd (which yet we
do not grant) and there had been half an
ounce of it (which is a quantity beyond
what the four greate<U+017F>t Vipers could yield,)
what, I pray, would that be to 40. pounds
of Sea-<U+017F>alt, and to many pounds of Coales,
more than a <U+017F>mall rivolet mingled with the
Ocean? But as to the fixt Salt, four Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are not able to afford half a Scruple
of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis al<U+017F>o certain, that both the Sea-<U+017F>alt
and <hi>Sal gemme,</hi> do not peri<U+017F>h in the Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but <U+017F>till remain there. But if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Salt Ammoniac be employed, the
Urinous and Volatile part, which is in that
Salt, will not fail to make its e<U+017F>cape, as
well as the Volatile Salt of Vipers, and
there will onely remain the fixt Saline part
of the Salt Ammoniac, mix't with <U+017F>ome
terre<U+017F>trial parts; which is that, we finde in
the Di<U+017F>tillation, after we have driven out
all the Volatile Salt, of which afterwards,
changing the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el and the fire, we draw
an acid <U+017F>pirit, very much approaching to
that, we draw out of Sea-Salt, by wayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
like the<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Arti<U+017F>ts know al<U+017F>o, that Herbs, Wood,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60888:98"/>
Horns, Bones, and other <U+017F>uch like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if they <U+017F>hould be calcined in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
pot, luted and covered, though a hole
were left in the cover, would alwayes be
afterwards found in the form of very black
coales, although they had endured a great
fire; and that the Salt cannot be <U+017F>eparated
from them, unle<U+017F>s they be calcin'd again
in an open ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; or they being reduced
to a<U+017F>hes, the Salt be then <U+017F>ever'd from them
by a Lixivium, and by Filtration.</p>
               <p>On which occa<U+017F>ion we relate an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of an imperfect Calcination, which is
naturally made in the Earth about the
Summer-Sol<U+017F>tice, of the end of the root of
many Plants, and among others, of <hi>Mugwort</hi>
and <hi>Plantatin;</hi> on which end, the <U+017F>ubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fire, or, if you will, the Fire of the Sun,
working, and yet being <U+017F>urrounded by the
Earth, (which is to the root what the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
pot, luted, is to the Vipers, and to
the Mixts, that were <U+017F>hut up with them)
burns it and reduces it to coales, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
turn it to a<U+017F>hes. I have often found
this to be true, and lighted upon a little
coal at the end of the root of tho<U+017F>e Plants,
at the time above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>So that, although the Fixt Salt of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60888:99"/>
be Simples in the Coales, yet it would
have been more proper, and more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
to have quite calcined tho<U+017F>e coales
to reduce them to a<U+017F>hes, and <U+017F>o to draw
from them and to purify the Salt for
u<U+017F>e, than to make people <U+017F>wallow the
gro<U+017F>s, earthy, and u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s part of the<U+017F>e coales.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e Antients added to this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Salt calcin'd, the powder of many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexiterial
Druggs, which not being deve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their vertue by any calcination,
may communicate, and even alone furni<U+017F>h
the greate<U+017F>t part of the good qualities, by
them a<U+017F>cribed to this Salt. And 'tis upon
the account of the<U+017F>e principally, that the
name of <hi>Theriacal</hi> may belong to it, which
impertinently would be attributed to the
Vipers, <U+017F>ince they have lo<U+017F>t their prime ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Calcination.</p>
               <p>This Preparation of <hi>Theriacal</hi> Salt doth
<U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>hew us, that the Antients did
not take pains to know the inward parts,
of which mix't bodies are compounded,
and that they did not well know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the poy<U+017F>on of Vipers, of which
they imagin'd they <U+017F>hould be infected by
the fumes proceeding from their Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
although none could come from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60888:99"/>
them, when there was none, as we have
made appear. And although the <U+017F>mell,
as well of the Vipers, as of the Simples,
were trouble<U+017F>ome, whil<U+017F>t they burned,
yet they were not therefore at all veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
               <p>The little knowledge, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
had, and many Moderns <U+017F>till have,
of the nature of the two Salts in Vipers,
hath led them into a great fault, viz. to
calcine the bones of Vipers, to draw from
thence, as they thought, the true Salt of
Vipers, which they were not at all like to
finde, after they had di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated it by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.
The fir<U+017F>t fault hath drawn after
it a <U+017F>econd; for the <U+017F>mall quantity of <hi>fix't</hi>
Salt, they found in them, not much <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
them, carried tho<U+017F>e, that had no
great <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of honour or con<U+017F>cience, to a
very great abu<U+017F>e, which was, to mix
among tho<U+017F>e calcin'd bones a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Sea-<U+017F>alt, to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve this Salt, and
and to boyle all together in water, to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and coagulate it, and to <U+017F>ell at a
great rate this Counterfeit <U+017F>alt for true Salt
of Vipers.</p>
               <p>But, to accommodate our<U+017F>elves to
tho<U+017F>e, who, intending better, will make
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60888:100"/>
no ill u<U+017F>e of it; and to furni<U+017F>h them with a
plea<U+017F>ing Salt for tho<U+017F>e, that may de<U+017F>ire it
for ordinary u<U+017F>e; we <U+017F>hall here deliver the
way of preparing a Salt of Viper, that <U+017F>hall
have much vertue; the method of which
<U+017F>hall be very ea<U+017F>y, and the u<U+017F>e very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>Take three dozen of great Vipers, well
cho<U+017F>en; cut off their heads and tails, flea
them, and empty the bodies of all their
entrals, and wa<U+017F>h them well, together with
the Heart and Liver: Boyl all together in
ten pints of common water, <U+017F>o long till all
be perfectly boyled. Then <U+017F>train it, and
<U+017F>quee<U+017F>e well all the parts; and in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve four pounds of Sea-<U+017F>alt;
and carefully filter it; afterwards, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
or, if you will, chry<U+017F>tallize this Salt,
which will be found white and abounding
with the vertue of the Vipers, and of no ill
ta<U+017F>te at all; which you may u<U+017F>e in all things
as common Salt.</p>
               <p>And to <U+017F>hew, that the<U+017F>e boyled and
<U+017F>quee<U+017F>ed parts have left much of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Decoction, and yet that they
have not left all, and that <U+017F>till there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<U+017F>ome of it, principally in the Bones;
lay them abroad, and dry them, and then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60888:100"/>
di<U+017F>till them, and you will draw from them,
e<U+017F>pecially from the Bones, a Volatile Salt
and oyl, but in much le<U+017F>s quantity, then if
they had not been boyld.</p>
               <p>If you would have a Viper-Salt of more
vertue, and that might even be call'd <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacal,</hi>
you mu<U+017F>t proceed after the <U+017F>ame
manner, as hath been lately <U+017F>et down;
but in <U+017F>tead of Seal-Salt, take a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Salt, drawn from <hi>Alexiterial</hi> and
<hi>Theriacal</hi> Plants, as the roots of <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Imperatoria, Angelica, Leaves</hi> of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
the little <hi>Centaurium, Carduus Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus,</hi>
and the like. 'Tis true, that this
Salt is a little more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing to the ta<U+017F>te
than the former, but it may produce more
con<U+017F>iderable effects, and be u<U+017F>ed in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occa<U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e <U+017F>orts of Salt have indeed good
vertue, and are convenient for la<U+017F>ting, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the two fir<U+017F>t: But the Volatile Salt
hath <U+017F>omething more particular, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderably
better: the properties of it are
innumerable, and it is an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the
excellent qualities, contained in Vipers.
We <U+017F>hall now <U+017F>peak of its Preparation, as
al<U+017F>o of the Phlegm, of what is called vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirit and Oyle, which accompany
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60888:101"/>
it; and of the <hi>Fixt</hi> Salt, which remains
after di<U+017F>tillation, mixed among the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trial
parts; and that done, we <U+017F>hall treat
of their vertues and u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s.</p>

which goes beyond many others,
to <U+017F>ay no more. We hope, that our
way of proceeding will be well received by
all, and that, if there be any that <U+017F>hall
finde fault with it, they will be <U+017F>uch only,
who are unwilling to communicate what
they have, and often wrap it up under the
name of <hi>Secrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take onely the Bodies, Hearts and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Vipers, or, (to have the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of all) add to them the Heads, Tails,
and skins, and generally all the parts of a
Viper; of which you will have a care to
take away all the Excrements and Worms,
as al<U+017F>o the Eggs, that may be in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
of the Females. Small and great,
Males and Females are of the <U+017F>ame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
as al<U+017F>o the Salt is, that <U+017F>hall have
been drawn from all the parts of the Body.
Dry in the <U+017F>hade all the<U+017F>e parts <U+017F>eparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then cut them into bits, and fill with
them your Gla<U+017F>s-limbec up to the neck,
which is to be well luted. Put it in the
mid<U+017F>t of a Reverberating furnace, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to its bigne<U+017F>s, cover it with its
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60888:102"/>

the Limbec a Gla<U+017F>s-recipient, which mu<U+017F>t
be very large; and lute well all the joynts.
Then begin to give a <U+017F>mall fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for about two hours, <U+017F>o that the
Limbec be heated gradually, and the
Phlegme begin to di<U+017F>til into the Recipient.
Afterwards increa<U+017F>e the fire gently unto a
<U+017F>econd degree; and give a little opening
at the Regi<U+017F>ter, and continue the <U+017F>ame fire
likewi<U+017F>e two hours; then increa<U+017F>e it, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Regi<U+017F>ter yet more, and <U+017F>o continue
two other hours; at the end of which you
are to give it the fire of the la<U+017F>t degree,
quite opening the Regi<U+017F>ter, and you mu<U+017F>t
continue to drive the fire, till no more

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60888:102"/>
take away, and, if you will, keep
for u<U+017F>e, as 'tis. This Volatile Salt, Spirit,
and Oyle, are <U+017F>o penetrating, that you are
not able to hold your no<U+017F>e over it.</p>
               <p>Powre out, what you find in the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient,
into a Glo<U+017F>s-Body, which mu<U+017F>t be
large, tall, broad below, and who<U+017F>e figure
goes up <U+017F>traightning towards the orifice;
to which you mu<U+017F>t adapt a Gla<U+017F>s-head, that
is to have <U+017F>omewhat a high body, and
large, and a very <U+017F>traight mouth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to that of the Gla<U+017F>s-body. Lute
the joynts exactly with paper and <U+017F>tarch;
put the Body in a Sand-bath, and <U+017F>ink it
down as low as the matter reacheth; fit a
<U+017F>mall Recipient to the beak of the Head,
and lute that al<U+017F>o: kindle under it a very
gentle fire, and order it <U+017F>o, that the Sand
and the Gla<U+017F>s-body may be heated gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
after which you may increa<U+017F>e it a little,
but onely <U+017F>o as to make it <U+017F>trong enough
to drive up the Volatile Salt; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
di<U+017F>-engag'd from the parts of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
bodies, ri<U+017F>eth ea<U+017F>ily. It will be <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed,
and <U+017F>tick every where to the in<U+017F>ide
of the Head, like a Chry<U+017F>tallized Snow.
There will ari<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ame time a little
of the Spirit, which is properly nothing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60888:103"/>
but a portion of the Volatile Salt, having
carried up with it a little of the Phlegme,
that will run into the little Recipient, and of
which even a part will congeal into Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tals.
You mu<U+017F>t alwayes be careful in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the Fire; for how little <U+017F>oever
you increa<U+017F>e it, the Phlegme will ri<U+017F>e with
<U+017F>ome of the Oyle, and they will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve
and hide the Salt; and then you mu<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commence
the Rectification; but govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fire well, when you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the
Head well lined with Salt, which will be
very white and very Chry<U+017F>talline, you mu<U+017F>t
then un-lute it, and take it off, and lute
on an other head, in<U+017F>tead of the former.
You are to take out the Salt, as <U+017F>oon and
as well as you can; and to enclo<U+017F>e it in a
<U+017F>trong bottle, with <U+017F>uch a mouth, that
the Salt may pa<U+017F>s through it, and which
may be exactly clo<U+017F>ed, without which the
Salt will ea<U+017F>ily fly away. Mean time, you
are to continue a like fire under the Gla<U+017F>s-body,
and when no more of that Volatile
ri<U+017F>eth, you are to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and to take out
of the head the Salt there gathered, and
keep it as the former. Your Sand being
cold, take off the Gla<U+017F>s-body, and decant
from it the remainder through a great
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60888:103"/>
Gla<U+017F>s-funnel, covered with paper for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
held over <U+017F>ome ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell. All the
Phlegm will pa<U+017F>s thorough the Paper;
but you'l finde <U+017F>ome Oyle there, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pa<U+017F>s, which you may make run through
the Funnel into a bottle, having pierced
the paper with <U+017F>ome convenient in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire a high and much
more perfect Rectification of this Volatile
Salt, may make it in manner following.
Take two pounds of Ivory calcin'd to
whitene<U+017F>s, and reduced to a fine powder;
which is to be mixt with four ounces of
this Salt. Then put all into a new Gla<U+017F>s-Body,
of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hape with the former.
To this let there be adapted and luted a
blind Head, or <U+017F>uch an one, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of who<U+017F>e beak is well <U+017F>topp'd (for <hi>that</hi>
is u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s for this purpo<U+017F>e, there being no
phlegme; and if there were, the calcin'd
Ivory being a dry Body, and in part <U+017F>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
would lick and retain it, as it would
al<U+017F>o the Oily part, that might happen to
be among the Volatile Salt:) let there be
given to this Gla<U+017F>s-body a moderate Fire,
with the <U+017F>ame cautions as before; the Salt
will quickly ri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>tick to the Head;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60888:104"/>
where, the Sublimation being ended, you
will finde it in the form of Chry<U+017F>tals, white
like <U+017F>now; which you are to put up and
keep in a bottle exactly clo<U+017F>ed, to u<U+017F>e it
upon occa<U+017F>ion. This Salt thus rectified
<U+017F>mells not of Fire, and hath nothing but
its own natural <U+017F>trong and penetrating
<U+017F>cent.</p>
               <p>There may perhaps be found Arti<U+017F>ts,
who will take it ill, that we have been <U+017F>o
large and <U+017F>o particular in exactly <U+017F>etting
down all the things, that are to be ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in preparing and rectifying this Salt.
But it is not for them, that we have done
it, but for tho<U+017F>e, who not knowing it will
be glad to learn it. We have given them
<U+017F>incerely the true means u<U+017F>ed by our<U+017F>elves;
which they may al<U+017F>o practi<U+017F>e in preparing
and rectifying the Salts of the parts of all
Animals. Tho<U+017F>e that have any tincture
of Chymi<U+017F>try, will here find enough to
teach them<U+017F>elves; as we have done, and
do daily. Mean time they mu<U+017F>t not be
offended, that there remain with us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <U+017F>ubject <U+017F>uch things, which could
not be <U+017F>aid, nor well comprehended but
by tho<U+017F>e that have labour'd a great while
in this Art. Intelligent per<U+017F>ons, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60888:104"/>
<U+017F>hall examine our proceeding, or have a
mind to experience the <U+017F>ame, will find
our ingenuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, by finding the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of
all we have made them expect, together
with the facility, we give, of the Operation.
They will al<U+017F>o find, that our way of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Retort as far as the neck, is more
proper than that of leaving a third part
empty, as <U+017F>ome would have it, in the Di<U+017F>til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Bones, Horns, and other dry
parts of Animals; although tho<U+017F>e, that
under<U+017F>tand it, practice it not but in matters
that will melt, and may break the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
or let <U+017F>omething run out by the
beak, when 'tis fill'd too high. But in
dry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, as are our Vipers, and the
Horns, and Bones of Animals, Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes,
Stones, and the like, it is enough to
leave this neck empty, to give vent to
the parts rai<U+017F>ed from the matter, and that
are to go into the Recipient. They will
al<U+017F>o acknowledge, that our way to leave
the Oyl among the other <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, when
we will <U+017F>ever them by <U+017F>ubliming and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
them, is not without rea<U+017F>on, in regard
that the Oyl hath commonly with it much
Volatile Salt, which leaves it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ri<U+017F>eth in the Rectification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60888:105"/>
We e<U+017F>teem al<U+017F>o, that this Preparation
will be preferr'd before many others, that
are opero<U+017F>e and have little method in
them; and, among others, before the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which <U+017F>ome pretend to make by
the addition of Spirit of Salt to the
Phlegme, and to that which is call'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and to the Volatil Salt: which in<U+017F>tead
of rectifying this Salt, and of making it
purer and better, changes its nature; and
in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>ubliming it to the Head and the
top of the Body (as they have pretended
it did, after the Phlegm was ri<U+017F>en,) the
Spirit of Salt ri<U+017F>eth it <U+017F>elf in its fir<U+017F>t form,
in its <U+017F>mell, colour and ta<U+017F>te, leaving at
the bottom the Salt, which is there found
like fixed, having the ta<U+017F>t and the other
qualities of the Spirit of Salt, but being
le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd of two thirds of its weight. That
kind of men have fill'd Books with many
Preparations they under<U+017F>tand not, nor have
experimented: For, forgetting, among
other things, in the proce<U+017F>s of this, <U+017F>uch
methods as are ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and
without which they do nothing, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es, and putting
the Cart before the Hor<U+017F>es, they fix the
Salt when they pretend to <U+017F>ublime it, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60888:105"/>
<U+017F>o very unadvi<U+017F>edly pro<U+017F>titute them<U+017F>elves
to <U+017F>hame and confu<U+017F>ion. For, in<U+017F>tead of
rectifying fir<U+017F>t the Volatile Salt (as more
intelligent men might have taught them,
of whom they had borrowed this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and of <U+017F>ubliming it, and of <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it by this means from other parts;
they labouring to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e the Proce<U+017F>s,
have retrenched the main and mo<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
part of it, and employed at the
very fir<U+017F>t that method, which they <U+017F>hould
have ob<U+017F>erv'd to fix it, believing that
that would <U+017F>ublime it; not con<U+017F>idering,
that having by that means inverted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s would prove an<U+017F>werable
to it. I <U+017F>et a <U+017F>ide their unwarrantable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of adding a pound of luke-warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances found in the
Recipient, after the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tillation, <U+017F>ince
it is an Augmentation, not onely u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s,
but trouble<U+017F>ome, of that Phlegme, which
mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>eparated.</p>
               <p>Now, although one part of this Salt,
remaining in the Body of the Limbec, may
yet afterwards becom Volatil, by mixing
it with <U+017F>ome Lixiviat Salt, and making it
to <U+017F>ublime; yet <hi>that</hi> is not done but with
a new and very great lo<U+017F>s of its weight;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60888:106"/>
nor is the ta<U+017F>te of it better than of that,
which <U+017F>hall have been well rectified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the method, we have before de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed;
<U+017F>ince the Lixiviat Salts, by revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it in part, give it as di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing a <U+017F>mel
as the former. We may further add here,
that the u<U+017F>e of tall and <U+017F>trait-neck't Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is much more proper for this Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
than the u<U+017F>e of Matra<U+017F><U+017F>es with
long necks, my<U+017F>elf having experimented,
that the Phlegme fals back again more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily,
and that the Volatil Salt ri<U+017F>eth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in the Bodies of our fa<U+017F>hion; of which
the <hi>Figure</hi> may be <U+017F>een on the <hi>Title page,</hi>
where al<U+017F>o is that of the Retort and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient,
for the fir<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>tillation.</p>
               <p>Now although the <U+017F>ame men, that
have given us cau<U+017F>e to reprehend them,
have affirmed contrary to truth, that
there is no <hi>fix't</hi> Salt in the parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
To prove that there is, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by that of the Viper; Take what
<U+017F>hall remain in the Retort, commonly
called the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which you
will find of the form and colour of Coales;
calcine it in a Furnace, or, to <U+017F>ave expences,
in a Potters Oven, till all become white
and of the form of Chalk, pulverize it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60888:106"/>
well, and make it boyl in a competent
quantity of water, that may receive and
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Salt; filter it, and make it
euaporate and con<U+017F>ume. You'l find at
the bottom a coagulated Salt; though in
a <U+017F>mall quantity, and <U+017F>uch an one, as that
of five pounds of Viper-bones well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd,
we have obtain'd no more than
three ounces of fix't Salt. This Salt
hath a very <U+017F>harp and poynant ta<U+017F>te; it is
Lixiviat, and approaching enough in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
regards to the fixt Salt of Tartar.
You'l find on the Filter the Terre<U+017F>trial
part, <U+017F>tripp'd of all its vertue; which then
may ju<U+017F>tly be call'd <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
And thus you'l have the Phlegme, that
which is call'd Spirit, the Volatil Salt,
the Oyl, the Fixt Salt, and the Earth;
into which all the parts of the Viper have
been reduced in their <U+017F>eparation.</p>

               <p>If the Fixed Salt of Vipers were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

were then nothing to be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t this

powre, little by little, and drop-wi<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>ome Spirit of Salt well rectified upon
the Volatil Salt. At fir<U+017F>t there will be a
conflict betwixt them, which will cau<U+017F>e
an ebullition, but that of a <U+017F>hort duration.
Continue to powre upon it of the <U+017F>ame
Spirit of Salt, gently and lei<U+017F>urely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as you find the ebullition cea<U+017F>e, and
by intervals <U+017F>tir al<U+017F>o the Cucurbite; and
repeat this <U+017F>o often, that at la<U+017F>t there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no motion any more, and the
Spirit of Salt have as 'twere mortified and
fixed the Volatil Salt. Then place the
Cucurbite in <U+017F>ome receptacle furni<U+017F>h't with
Sand; fit to it a head, lute it (though at
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60888:109"/>
the beginning that be not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary) and
by a <U+017F>low fire draw away all the moi<U+017F>ture
of the Spirit of Salt, and of the Volatil
Salt, which will ri<U+017F>e almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>ipid. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the fire <U+017F>till, and when you <U+017F>hall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a ta<U+017F>te of the Spirit of Salt in what
<U+017F>hall be di<U+017F>till'd, change the Recipient,
increa<U+017F>e a little the fire, and drive it (yet
without too much violence,) until there
di<U+017F>til no more, and that the Salt remain
at the bottom of the Cucurbite altogether
dry and of a gray colour. You'l find in
the Recipient a Spirit of Salt of the <U+017F>ame
ta<U+017F>te, of the <U+017F>ame colour, and of the
<U+017F>ame force it had when it was powr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Volatil Salt; but you <U+017F>hall not
find any part of the Volatil Salt ri<U+017F>en to
the head, nor to the top of the Cucurbit,
as <U+017F>ome have given out it doth, without
having experimented it, as we have done.
The gray Salt, found at the bottom, is
but in a <U+017F>mal quantity, being le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
of two thirds: It's ta<U+017F>te is very <U+017F>harp,
biting, and much differing from what it had
before it was fix'd, and as 'twere mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spirit of Salt. After this you
may di<U+017F><U+017F>olve this Salt in water, filter it, and
make it evaporate, and letting it cool,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60888:110"/>
you'l find at the bottom a <U+017F>mal quantity
of Salt coagulated in the form of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tals.
Powr out by inclination the water
<U+017F>wimming on the top, to have the Salt by
it<U+017F>elf, which you may dry in the Air, or
the Sun, or over a little fire. You may
al<U+017F>o make good u<U+017F>e of the Salt that <U+017F>hall
have remained in the water that <U+017F>wam a
top, by making it evaporate in part,
Chry<U+017F>tallizing and drying it, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
You might, if you plea<U+017F>ed, very well
omit luting the Funnel upon the Cucurbit,
when you will powre the Spirit of Salt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Volatil Salt; fora<U+017F>much as we have
found by experiment, that in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of Salt upon the Volatil
Salt, there ri<U+017F>eth nothing but phlegme,
that hath neither vertue nor <U+017F>mel; although
the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>ons, that have err'd in many
things in the rectification of the Volatil
Salt, have fear'd they <U+017F>hould loo<U+017F>e there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Volatil Spirit, which was only in
their imagination: And the luting, which
we have advi<U+017F>ed, was only to prevent
peoples belief, that a part of the Volatil
Salt might have e<U+017F>caped that way.</p>
               <p>But although this Volatil Salt appear
fix't, and remain as <U+017F>uch at the bottom of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60888:110"/>
the Cucurbit, after di<U+017F>tillation, yet
there is a part, which retakes its former
nature, and becoms Volatil again, if it
be mix'd with Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or with
<U+017F>ome other Lixiviate Salt, putting them
together in a <U+017F>ubliming ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. For the<U+017F>e
<hi>Lixiviate</hi> Salts, being of a nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>acid</hi> Salts and Spirits, do morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
them and retain them to them<U+017F>elves,
and let go the Volatil Salts, which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
<U+017F>pirits had, as 'twere, mortified and
fix'd, and all that was Volatil in this <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly

and hath almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame ta<U+017F>te and the
<U+017F>ame other qualities of the Volatil Salts
well rectified. Yet you will al<U+017F>o find there
a great diminution of its weight, <U+017F>o that
it will be more advantagious to keep it in
the condition, it was in before this la<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ublimation; the greate<U+017F>t advantage of
which is, to come to know, that the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that hath been made by the Spirit
of Salt, although it have as 'twere chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the nature of the Volatil Salt, and
hid its diaphoretique quality under that of
the diuretique, yet hath not quite de<U+017F>troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, <U+017F>ince there is <U+017F>ome part, that can

               <p>THE Volatile Salt of Vipers is to
be con<U+017F>ider'd, as a Sun, as well
among the parts, that ri<U+017F>e by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tillation,
as among tho<U+017F>e that re<U+017F>t in the
Retort; there being none among tho<U+017F>e
that are come over, but have borrowed
from it almo<U+017F>t all the vertue it can have;
nor any of tho<U+017F>e that have <U+017F>tay'd, but have
need of it, or are u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s without it. The
<hi>Flegm</hi> that ri<U+017F>eth fir<U+017F>t, carries alwayes <U+017F>ome
part with it, without which it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no effect. That which is called
<hi>Spirit,</hi> is nothing el<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>peak aright, but
a Volatile Salt, which in the di<U+017F>tillation
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60888:112"/>
hath been followed by a little Flegme
di<U+017F><U+017F>olving it, and giving it the form of a
Spirit: which may be <U+017F>hewed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
wherein that <U+017F>aline volatil part
is <U+017F>eparated, rai<U+017F>ed, and coagulated into a
white and chry<U+017F>talline forme, and leaveth
at the botom of the cucurbite the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
that had changed its nature, and is
nothing el<U+017F>e but flegm. We <U+017F>ay, on this
occa<U+017F>ion, the <U+017F>ame thing of what many
Authors improperly call the Volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of an humane skull, of Harts-horn, and
of other parts of Animals, they being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
el<U+017F>e but Volatil Salts mixt with
flegme, which they afterwards quit, when
they are rectified. The <hi>Oyle</hi> al<U+017F>o would
have but very little vertue, if it borrowed
no Volatil <U+017F>alt, and if it retained not in it
a good part thereof, as may be ob<U+017F>erved
in the Rectification: for, if the Oyle were
mea<U+017F>ur'd, or weighed, before 'tis put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the re<U+017F>t into the cucurbite for recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and if it were weighed again after
that all the Volatil Salt is ri<U+017F>en, it would
be found much dimini<U+017F>hed in quantity,
and in <U+017F>trength al<U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t of the
Volatil Salt, which had joyned it <U+017F>elf to
it, hath been carried away by the rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60888:112"/>
So tho<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>eparate the Oyle
from the other parts to rectify them, and
who u<U+017F>e it not but for wounds or ulcers,
and to take away <U+017F>uperfluities, do doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
not know it aright; for it is al<U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with other vertues more con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
of which we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peake in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
The Fixt Salt, which re<U+017F>ts in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
mix't among the terre<U+017F>trial part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is to be put in the rank of Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
Salts, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth few other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
but tho<U+017F>e of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> yet
retains <U+017F>omething of the nature of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<U+017F>alt. And tho<U+017F>e, that have con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this Salt as a <hi>Cau<U+017F>tick,</hi> have had good
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s with it, without knowing its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<U+017F>eing they imputed it to the maligne
parts, which they believed to be in Vipers,
whereas they <U+017F>hould have a<U+017F>cribed it to
the nature of Lixiviate <U+017F>alts. But this
Salt being taken at the mouth, will be
much more effectual, if you mingle <U+017F>ome
Volatil Salt with it; this Cau<U+017F>tique fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
not hindring but that it may be taken
<U+017F>afely and beneficially in appropriated li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
as many other lixiviate Salts are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Terre<U+017F>trial</hi> part hath nothing in it,
that de<U+017F>erves to be con<U+017F>idered, and it may
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60888:113"/>
ju<U+017F>tly be called <hi>Terra mortua,</hi> Dead earth,
after it is freed from its fixed Salt. So that
all the parts, that ri<U+017F>e by di<U+017F>tillation, as
well as tho<U+017F>e that cannot ri<U+017F>e, are of <U+017F>mall
force, or altogether u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, without the
Volatil Salt. It is therefore upon good
rea<U+017F>on, that we attribute to it the principal
vertues, which a Viper can furni<U+017F>h.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>imilitude of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which the
Volatile Salt of Viper hath with the <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
parts of our Body, conjoyn'd to its
<U+017F>ubtile and piercing quality, maketh, that
accommodating it<U+017F>elf to their condition,
and finding all liberty in its actions, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
all the effects, it is capable of, and
penetrateth without any oppo<U+017F>ition into
the most <U+017F>ecret and the mo<U+017F>t remote parts
of the Body. It hath this peculiar, that
thought it act as a Soverain, and finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to its dominion, yet it
exerci<U+017F>eth it not as a Conquerour, nor as

the places and parts, where it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth; and

to all the places, where it pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth.</p>
               <p>Now <U+017F>ince the fle<U+017F>h, the heart, the liver,
and the other parts of the Viper, taken as
an Aliment, or as a Medicine, may <U+017F>erve for
the cure of many maladies, and produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
con<U+017F>iderable effects; 'tis not at all tobe
doubted, but that this Salt, which is the
mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtile and the mo<U+017F>t potent of them
all, is <U+017F>omething more <U+017F>ublime and more
efficacious. And we are a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that if it
were well known to us, it would pa<U+017F>s for an
almo<U+017F>t Univer<U+017F>al medicine; men would be
careful of preparing it, and we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee
it often pre<U+017F>cribed by Phy<U+017F>itians, and find
it <U+017F>ucceed in innumerable ob<U+017F>tinate di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
that are but <U+017F>eldom and difficultly
cured.</p>
               <p>To Judge well of the Effects, which
this Volatile Salt can produce in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we mu<U+017F>t know its manner of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is, to open, to comminute, to
attenuate, to pierce, and to drive to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
parts of the Body, and through the
pores of the skin, all the impurities, and
all the <U+017F>trange bodies, that can get out by
tho<U+017F>e wayes. Further, it is an enemy to
all corruption, very friendly and very agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60888:114"/>
to our nature, which it a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies,
enabling it to expell, not onely by
the pores of the skin, but al<U+017F>o by <U+017F>iege and
urine, and by all the Emunctories of the
Body, the <U+017F>uperfluous humors, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>t
it: Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that it
produces admirable effects upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
occa<U+017F>ions, curing a great number of
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>es, or at lea<U+017F>t giving great relief
therein, even in tho<U+017F>e, that are mo<U+017F>t refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and mo<U+017F>t difficult to cure; <U+017F>uch as are
Apoplexies, Lethargies, Convul<U+017F>ions, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ies,
and many other maladies, believed to
have their <U+017F>ource in the Brain. It is al<U+017F>o a
great relief to the Di<U+017F>tempers of the Brea<U+017F>t,
as Swoundings, Palpitations of the Heart,
Difficulties of Breathing, and Pleuri<U+017F>ies.
Be<U+017F>ides it particularly un<U+017F>tops the Ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Liver, Spleen, Me<U+017F>entery, and
other parts of the lower Belly. It di<U+017F><U+017F>ipates
all inward impo<U+017F>tumes, in their ri<U+017F>e, and
di<U+017F>lodgeth <U+017F>ecret and unknown pains,
which have their origin in the Spirits. It
helps dige<U+017F>tion, the purification of the
ma<U+017F>s of the blood, and its di<U+017F>tribution to
all the parts of the Body, and re<U+017F>olves and
prevents coagulations: And <U+017F>o being an
Enemy to all corruption, it is very proper
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60888:114"/>
for all <U+017F>orts of Fevers, cau<U+017F>ed thereby;
as for mo<U+017F>t intermittent Feavers, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>Quartans.</hi> It al<U+017F>o worketh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
in the di<U+017F>tempers of the <hi>Matrix;</hi>
and is a remedy to all the vices of the skin,
and to the Lepro<U+017F>y it <U+017F>elf: but above all,
'tis <U+017F>pecifique again<U+017F>t all Bitings and <U+017F>ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of venomous creatures, again<U+017F>t all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms
and poy<U+017F>ons, if they be not corro<U+017F>ive;
for in that ca<U+017F>e, recour<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently be
had to Vomitives and to Unctuous things,
after which it produceth good effects. It
hath a particular vertue again<U+017F>t the Plague,
again<U+017F>t all Contagious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
ones, <U+017F>uch as are the Mea<U+017F>els, Small
Pox, and the like. In a word, the Inductions,
we can draw from the great number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
we have <U+017F>een of it, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
times, oblige us to affirm, that its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
goes beyond what can be expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed.
And tho<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>hall make reflexion on
what we have <U+017F>aid of it, will be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and u<U+017F>e it beneficially to many other
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>es, which to enumerate would be
too prolix and too tedious.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, we cannot forbear to
relate here a very remarkable Experiment,
made upon a Gentleman, who <U+017F>uffered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60888:115"/>
about a month <U+017F>ince, a violent and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
paine, doubled and redoubled, at the
right part of his front pretty near the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the end of a finger might cover the
place of the pain; there appeared no redne<U+017F>s
nor <U+017F>welling, and there was perceived no
hardne<U+017F>s. Yet the pain, though it was, as

to the other neighboring parts, <U+017F>o that
the Gentleman could not chew, nor <U+017F>o much
as open his mouth to take down a little
broth, but with extreme pain, though
hunger urged him. The Phy<U+017F>itians, that
<U+017F>aw him, had u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal means to relieve
him, and, among the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Venae</hi>-<U+017F>ections
in the arm and foot; they had purged him
often; they had employed frictions of his
neck and <U+017F>houlders; they had applyed to
him Ve<U+017F>icatories, and Snailes, behind his
eares: they had cau<U+017F>ed his temporal arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be open'd, and drawn from him ten
or twelve ounces of arterial blood, and
then cauteri<U+017F>ed the Aperture; they had
al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>cribed him powerful Sudorifiques,
which were continued many dayes morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening, and had made him <U+017F>weat
very copiou<U+017F>ly; and the Patient him<U+017F>elf,
of his own accord, being extremely pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60888:115"/>
by the violence of the pains, cau<U+017F>ed
one of his upper teeth, which was very
<U+017F>ound, to be pulled out, hoping thereby
to give <U+017F>ome vent to them: But after he
had u<U+017F>ed all the<U+017F>e means in vain, one do<U+017F>e
of the Volatil Salt of Vipers, given in
wine, remov'd pre<U+017F>ently all the pain,
which cau<U+017F>ed as great a wonder in the A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants,
as <U+017F>atisfaction in the Patient. This
<U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing effect, which demon<U+017F>trateth
better, than all rea<U+017F>ons, the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this Volatil Salt, may al<U+017F>o conclude
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of its Vertues.</p>
               <p>There remains now, that we <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the vertues of the <hi>Oyle,</hi> which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth
by Di<U+017F>tillation with the Volatil Salt,
of which it al<U+017F>o retains a part. Its <U+017F>trong
<U+017F>ent is the cau<U+017F>e, that it is not often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
whence it comes, that <U+017F>ometimes
it is more advantageous to the Preparer,
to profit by the rectification of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt, which it hath, than to keep it
in its condition for Patients that <U+017F>hall u<U+017F>e
it notwith<U+017F>tanding its <U+017F>trong <U+017F>mel and ill
ta<U+017F>te. This <U+017F>mel is <U+017F>o intimately <U+017F>tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, that there is no rectification,
able to remove it. But we make herewith
known to all tho<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>hall be able to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60888:116"/>
comply with the u<U+017F>e of it, that it is one of
the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t efficacious outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
in all Phy<U+017F>ick, provided it be
made u<U+017F>e of, when 'tis yet indued with
its Volatil Salt: For it opens, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
re<U+017F>olves, is ab<U+017F>ter<U+017F>ive, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
clean<U+017F>ing; and we know, who
have experimented it, that the continued
anointing with it, accompanied with the
internal u<U+017F>e of the Volatil Salt, produceth
admirable effects in the parts labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Pal<U+017F>y, and deprived of motion,
and even in tho<U+017F>e, that are dryed for want
of the communication of Spirits and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment.
A little Spunge imbibed with
this Oyl, carried in a little box pierced,
and often <U+017F>melled to, is very good in the
time of the Plague, to keep off the ill
Air, and to fortify the Brain, and the
noble parts. It is al<U+017F>o good to make it to
be <U+017F>melled, to put of it in the no<U+017F>trils, and
to annoint the Temples with it, in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptical
Symptoms, and for tho<U+017F>e, that
are troubled with giddine<U+017F>s, and have
their Brain charged with vapors or flegme;
for it gives them vent, and di<U+017F>pels them
powerfully. It hath al<U+017F>o a con<U+017F>iderable
effect again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>uffocations of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60888:116"/>
and again<U+017F>t all <U+017F>orts of worms; in
which ca<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ome drops of it may even be
given at the mouth, in wine, or broth;
and the hollow of the <U+017F>tomach anointed
therewith. It vi<U+017F>ibly di<U+017F><U+017F>ipitateth all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
contu<U+017F>ions, and <U+017F>erveth much for
inward ones, and e<U+017F>pecially for tho<U+017F>e of
the Head. It re<U+017F>olves tumours and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es,
giving i<U+017F><U+017F>ue by the pores to <U+017F>uch
matter, as can tran<U+017F>pire, digo<U+017F>ting the
gre<U+017F><U+017F>er, and bringing them to a laudable
<U+017F>uppuration. It is al<U+017F>o ab<U+017F>ter<U+017F>ive and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth
all <U+017F>orts of Ulcers, and healeth all
the di<U+017F>tempers of the skin, even the mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>tubborn, provided the internal cau<U+017F>e
thereof be removed. In all which evils its
effects are yet more quick and powerful,
if it be enforced by the internal u<U+017F>e of the
Volatil Salt, which, in a word, is that,
which gives it its main vertue.</p>
               <p>We <U+017F>hall add, on this occa<U+017F>ion, that the
Ancients valued very much their Oyl of
Vipers, which they prepared <U+017F>everal ways,
<U+017F>ome by infu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ome by the decoction
of Vipers in Oyl of Oliues. If they had
rightly proportioned the quantity of Vipers
with that of the Oyl; if they had added
thereto what moi<U+017F>ture was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60888:117"/>
if in this they had employed <U+017F>ome good
method, this Oyl might produce good
effects, and we <U+017F>hould approve of it,
and refer our Readers to it. But finding
nothing regular in all the Preparations, by
them de<U+017F>cribed, we thought good here
to <U+017F>et down one, according to all the
rules of Art.</p>
               <p>Take about the end of <hi>May,</hi> or the
beginning of <hi>June,</hi> a dozen great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
newly taken, cut each of them into
<U+017F>even or eight pieces, and put them into a
well glazed and <U+017F>trong earthen pot: powr
upon them three pounds of Oyl of Olives,
and one pint of white wine; cover the
pot well, and make it boyl over a gentle
fire to the con<U+017F>umption of the moi<U+017F>ture.
Then <U+017F>train all, <U+017F>queeze out the Vipers
well, and keep the Oyle for u<U+017F>e. In the
mean time, fear not (as the Antients did)
the Vapors, that may i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the pot
during the decoction; for the Vipers, as
we have <U+017F>aid, have no poy<U+017F>on in all their
body. This Oyle, thus prepared, hath
not, 'tis true, all the <U+017F>trength and vertues
of the di<U+017F>tilled Oyle, of which we were
<U+017F>peaking a little before; but it may very
well <U+017F>erve for an oyntment in all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempers
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60888:117"/>
of the skin, in contractions of
nerves, in rheumati<U+017F>mes, &amp; in many other
evils.</p>

in <U+017F>ome degree to <U+017F>atisfy tho<U+017F>e that may
de<U+017F>ire it we <U+017F>hall make here an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a good part of what we have <U+017F>een
practi<U+017F>'d by Phy<U+017F>itians, that perfectly know
the qualities and proprieties of this Salt,
and u<U+017F>e it daily to the great benefit of their
Patients.</p>
               <p>You mu<U+017F>t <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> know, that its piercing
Ta<U+017F>te hinders it from being given alone,
and that it mu<U+017F>t be mix't, <hi>now</hi> with <U+017F>ome
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60888:118"/>
Aliment, as in broth, the yolk of an egg,
a ro<U+017F>ted apple, a little jelley, &amp;c. <hi><U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
with Medicines, and that innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wayes, which partly depend from the
humour and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Patient, but
chiefly from the wit, knowledge, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Phy<U+017F>itian. For this Salt
calls for a Phy<U+017F>itian, that hath <U+017F>ufficient
ability to know and mea<U+017F>ure its force and
activity; that is intelligent and ver<U+017F>ed in
all Maladies, to be able beneficially to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it in tho<U+017F>e that require it, that knows
to chu<U+017F>e a favorable time and occa<U+017F>ion;
and to mix it pertinently and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
with <U+017F>uch things, as may not change
its nature nor divert its operation, nor <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the indication, he <U+017F>hall have taken.
So that 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to be equally a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
of the genuine and methodical preparation
of the Salt; of the knowledge of its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and vertues; of the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper,
of the condition, temper, and
<U+017F>trength of the Patient; of the fitne<U+017F>s of
its exhibition among aliments or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
medicaments, and of the occa<U+017F>ions
and the time, in which it may be u<U+017F>efully
employed. And when a due regard hath
been had to all the<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances, men
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60888:118"/>
will not fail to finde very good effects of it.
But that tho<U+017F>e, who are not accu<U+017F>tom'd
to make u<U+017F>e of it, may not unawares finde
in it effects contrary to the nature of this
Salt, we have thought our<U+017F>elves obliged
to adverti<U+017F>e them, that they mu<U+017F>t above
all things avoid mixing them among <hi>Acids,</hi>
and e<U+017F>pecially among Spirit of Salt, Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,
Brim<U+017F>tone, and the like, which would
fix it and de<U+017F>troy its operation. To find
therefore facility in its exhibition, it may
be taken in di<U+017F>tilled waters, or pti<U+017F>ane, or
<U+017F>uch decoctions as are appropriated to the
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; as al<U+017F>o in Juleps, Emul<U+017F>ions, or
Potions diver<U+017F>ly compo<U+017F>ed. It may al<U+017F>o
be mix't in Con<U+017F>erves, Extracts, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the like; as al<U+017F>o in Lozenges and
Opiats, diver<U+017F>ly made according to the
nature of the di<U+017F>temper, and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Phy<U+017F>itian; It is al<U+017F>o mingled
with Purgatives, Sudorifiques, Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Diuretiques; and no le<U+017F>s, with
its own fix't Salt, and <U+017F>uch other Salts, as
are not contrary to it. It is al<U+017F>o given in
Wine, and among certain Mineral waters.
It may be admini<U+017F>tred to both <U+017F>exes, and
to all ages, at all times and hours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
meals according to the nature of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60888:119"/>
the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and the intention of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
It may be taken, if one will, <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times in a day, and even at night; and
the u<U+017F>e of it may be continued for a good
while.</p>
               <p>As to its do<U+017F>e, that is different, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the occa<U+017F>ion, age, temper and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Patient, and the nature of
the di<U+017F>temper, and the reiteration made of
it: For, the do<U+017F>e is to be much le<U+017F>s for
tho<U+017F>e, who take it often in one day, and
continue the u<U+017F>e of it, than for tho<U+017F>e, that
take it but once in a ca<U+017F>e of need. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>ufficient to give 6. 8.
10. or 12. grains of it; but on certain
occa<U+017F>ions we may give 20. or 25. grains,
and <U+017F>ome-times, half a drachme, and even
a whole drachme. But di<U+017F>cretion and skill
is to be u<U+017F>ed; without which, this Salt, as
excellent as 'tis, may produce effects quite
contrary to what the Phy<U+017F>itian and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
