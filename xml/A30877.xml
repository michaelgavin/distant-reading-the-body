            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A <hi>Fi<U+017F><U+017F>ure</hi> is di<U+017F>cerned by the thickne<U+017F>s, pain and uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Part, and requireth the judgment of a skilful Chirurgion. A <hi>Comminution</hi> is ea<U+017F>ie to be perceived, the Bone being very unequal, and here and there yielding to the Fingers.</p>

                        <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks</hi>] A <hi>Tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e</hi> Fracture is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie to cure than an <hi>Oblique</hi>; or when accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with apparent Inequalities; <hi>that,</hi> where but one Bone is broken, than where two are, or where the Bones are much <U+017F>hattered; <hi>that,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s made in the mid<U+017F>t of the Bone, than what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be near the Head; and a <U+017F>ingle one, than a compound. If the Patient remain undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <U+017F>eventh day, the Member is in danger of mortifying, e<U+017F>pecially if that the Part be too <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:10"/>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] A broken Bone requires the<U+017F>e four Operations; <hi>Extention, Conjoining, Ligature, Well-placing</hi>; and withal, the application of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward Remedies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Extention</hi> can hardly be performed without pain; which yet will be much le<U+017F>s, if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be <U+017F>o extended, that the Mu<U+017F>cles do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; that is to <U+017F>ay, The Part mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o laid, that when <hi>in health,</hi> they could hold out longe<U+017F>t without tiring. Sometimes the exten<U+017F>ion mu<U+017F>t be greater, <U+017F>ometimes le<U+017F><U+017F>er; which will be performed aright, if regard be had to the time of the Fracture, to the Age of the Patient, and to the greatne<U+017F>s of the Bone. A recent Fracture, a tender Patient, a <U+017F>mall Bone, require a gentler Extention: on the contrary, an old Fracture, a <U+017F>trong Patient, and a big Bone, a greater. The manner of extending I de<U+017F>cribe not, becau<U+017F>e it is better learnt by the frequent view of Practice, than by Reading.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Extention,</hi> you are to join the Bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in the doing of which, the Mu<U+017F>cles mu<U+017F>t not be wre<U+017F>ted, but retain their natural po<U+017F>ition and figure.</p>
                     <p>Then the Part mu<U+017F>t be bound with a double Rowler; the <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> is to be rowled thrice about the Fracture, and then upwards. The <hi>(<U+017F>econd</hi> (which mu<U+017F>t be twice as long) is to be once wound about the Fracture, proceeding down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then upwards again, a little higher than the fir<U+017F>t Rowler; to which you will give more firmne<U+017F>s, if you bind <U+017F>ome convenient Splints (of Wood, or rather of Pa<U+017F>t-board) round about the Member.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature ought not to be too <U+017F>trait, le<U+017F>t it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52336:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cau<U+017F>e pain, and rob the Part of its nouri<U+017F>hment; nor too loo<U+017F>e, le<U+017F>t the Bones <U+017F>lip out of their place. And unle<U+017F>s great pain, or other <U+017F>ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms require, it mu<U+017F>t not be opened before the <hi>third</hi> day; and at the <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, it mu<U+017F>t be bound <U+017F>omewhat clo<U+017F>er; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards changed but once every four, five or <U+017F>ix dayes.</p>
                     <p>La<U+017F>tly, The Part ought to be <hi>well placed,</hi> that is, <U+017F>oftly, evenly, and a little rai<U+017F>ed. If you lay it too low, the Bone will bend outwards; if too high, it will bend inwards: Wherefore you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve a mean.</p>
                     <p>Now, whether the<U+017F>e four Operations have been duly performed, may be known by the en<U+017F>uing Signs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Extention</hi> is well done, if the part be <U+017F>trait, and as long as its fellow; if it appear to outward view every where even, and a little hollow about the Fracture.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>joining together</hi> is duly made, if the Bone be any thing firm, and all about the Fracture be found equal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ligature</hi> is as it ought to be, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as <U+017F>oon as he is dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, find the pain aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if the pain do <U+017F>omewhat encrea<U+017F>e the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd night, and there be perceived the third day, without the place of binding, a little <U+017F>welling yielding to your hands.</p>
                     <p>The Bone is <hi>well placed,</hi> if in the <U+017F>econd dre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing you find all even.</p>
                     <p>Before you rowl the Ligature about the Member, bathe the part with Spirit of Wine or Red Wine; or, with Oyl, Wine and Vinegar mix'd together; Or, take the White of an Egg,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52336:11"/>
with <U+017F>ome Bolus, Frankincen<U+017F>e, Dragons-Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or anoint it with Oyl of Ro<U+017F>es, Mirtles, Violets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or lay Plai<U+017F>ters on it. In Winter, the <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> will do well: At all times that which follows;</p>
                     <p>Take Ma<U+017F>tick, Frankincen<U+017F>e, of each two drams, Aloes, Gum Tragacanth, Dragons-Blood, Bole-Armonick, of each a one dram; <hi>Lapis Haematitis,</hi> Burnt Talch, of each one dram; Whites of Eggs, and Oyl of Ro<U+017F>es, as much as is <U+017F>ufficient.

                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; for <U+017F>ometimes the Bone is altogether forced out of its place, and that is properly called <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> or <hi>Di<U+017F>location:</hi> Sometimes it is got out but a little or half, which is called Sub-laxation, or <hi>Elongation.</hi> 2.

                     <p>The <hi>Cau<U+017F>es</hi> are of two <U+017F>orts; 1. <hi>External,</hi> Such as are Falling, Beating, Running, Wre<U+017F>tling, and vehement extention, as it often happens to Women in Labour, through the unskilfulne<U+017F>s of Midwives; yea, by a violent <U+017F>troke or fall, even the Bones of the Infant in the Womb, may be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located. 2. <hi>Internal,</hi> By the afflux of Humors, which falling into the Joints, relax and re<U+017F>olve the Ligaments, and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>eth the Bones to <U+017F>lip out of their places.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus roughly handled the boney and hard parts of the Body, it now follows, that I treat the <U+017F>oft and fle<U+017F>hie more gently, and de<U+017F>cribe their <hi>Synthe<U+017F>is</hi> or re-unition again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin with the broken <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which <U+017F>ometimes gives way to the Inte<U+017F>tines, at other times to the Cawl, and not <U+017F>eldom to both, to get out of their natural place into the Groins or <hi>Scrotum,</hi> there cau<U+017F>ing a Rupture called <hi>Entorocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Inte<U+017F>tinalis,</hi> if the Guts come out; an <hi>Epiplocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Omentalis,</hi> if the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Cawl be out.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is made up of two <U+017F>trong, but <U+017F>oft Membranes, which do <U+017F>o contain what<U+017F>oever is included in the Belly or lowe<U+017F>t Cavity, that when <U+017F>ound, nothing can fall out. In Women, the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> is its utmo<U+017F>t Limit. In Men, its outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t Membrane reaches farther; and con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the fir<U+017F>t proper Coat of the Te<U+017F>ticles. In the Groins, it comprehends the Seminal Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els as in a Sheath, called <hi>Proce<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> or <hi>Productio Peritonaei.</hi> This being <U+017F>tretch'd, or enlarged, or coming to bur<U+017F>t, is the proximate cau<U+017F>e to the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Ruptures. The Groins therefore are the u<U+017F>ual places of Ruptures: But do not imagine, that the <hi>Peritonoeum</hi> cannot be di<U+017F>tended or bur<U+017F>t in other places, and there to cau<U+017F>e a Rupture. It happens <U+017F>ometimes above the Navel, yet <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: <hi>Beneath,</hi> and <hi>on the <U+017F>ide</hi> of the Navel, far

                        <p>The manner of cure had nothing peculiar in it <U+017F>elf, but that you contrive <U+017F>uch Bands, that may reduce the parts fallen out into their right place, without prejudicing the <U+017F>ound ones.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Blood</hi> is the darling of Nature, by who<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance <U+017F>he performeth all her Operations, and which can hardly be drawn from her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dammage; yet does Art require, that tho<U+017F>e who meddle with it, being neither venturous nor timorous, but di<U+017F>creet and couragious, and making out of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity a virtue, do <U+017F>ometimes proceed to the opening a Vein; yet for no other than the<U+017F>e <hi>four</hi> following cau<U+017F>es.</p>

                     <p>The<U+017F>e limits are too narrow for <U+017F>ome, who will needs take into tho<U+017F>e a <hi>fifth</hi> cau<U+017F>e, which they make the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Blood, held by them to be as great an inducement for bleeding as any of the <hi>four</hi> by us recited; to the end, <hi><U+017F>ay they,</hi> that Nature being rid of part of what is corrupt, may be the better able to correct what remains.</p>
                     <p>But I much wi<U+017F>h, 1. That they could make this di<U+017F>charge without the lo<U+017F>s of that <U+017F>trength which is <U+017F>o highly nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. 2.

That they would declare, why they will have cur'd the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by Purging, and the le<U+017F><U+017F>er by Bleeding, <U+017F>ince that they give to the one as well as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and that duly) the name of <hi>Cacho-Chimia.</hi>

Let them <U+017F>hew, that things differing only <hi><U+017F>ecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Majus &amp; Minus,</hi> do differ in <hi><U+017F>pecie,</hi> and <U+017F>o require <U+017F>pecifically different Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Others proceed yet further, and <U+017F>hed innocent Blood in all <U+017F>orts of Fevers, without any con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <U+017F>pots of the Plague, or of Poi<U+017F>on it <U+017F>elf; thus freeing them<U+017F>elves from a great deal of labor and trouble, otherwi<U+017F>e caus'd to the <hi>Phy<U+017F>itian</hi> from the variety of Fevers. But becau<U+017F>e the nature of all Poy<U+017F>on and Malignant Humors is continually to a<U+017F><U+017F>ault the Heart, and <U+017F>uddenly to pro<U+017F>trate the <U+017F>trength of the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>ons; and <U+017F>ince Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth likewi<U+017F>e <hi>both,</hi> not only dimini<U+017F>hing <U+017F>trength, but al<U+017F>o drawing the malignity toward the Heart, and driving in again, for the oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Nature, what <U+017F>he had thrown out for her relief: I do intreat and warn all the Practi<U+017F>ers of our Art, That as they love the quiet of their Mind, and the good of their Patients, they would beware of bleeding in Pe<U+017F>tilential and other Malignant Fevers; as al<U+017F>o in all ca<U+017F>es that may befal People by Poy<U+017F>on, either inward or outward.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French, Italians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugue<U+017F>es</hi> (great Blood-letters) will, I expect, tell me; That Nature, when by bleeding <U+017F>he hath vent, and is <U+017F>omewhat di<U+017F>charg'd, <U+017F>hall be better able to throw out the remaining Evil. And this <U+017F>eems to be true, for the blood indeed receives Air, that the Spirits may the better flie away, and is robb'd of that <U+017F>trength which it <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily wants; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature exchangeth the Life of the Patient for death, and extorts tears from the By-<U+017F>tanders.</p>
                     <p>Without alledging other Rea<U+017F>ons, they ground them<U+017F>elves upon Experience. And it were to be wi<U+017F>hed they had that ground indeed; for we find
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52336:30"/>
<U+017F>uch Patients of theirs, who in the morning were in no danger, even after but the taking away of five or <U+017F>ix ounces of Blood, to be cold and <U+017F>tiff at night. Whence it may ea<U+017F>ily be collected, what it is they call <hi>Experience, viz.</hi> If the Patient by chance e<U+017F>cape death, then <hi>Bleeding</hi> mu<U+017F>t have the honor of it; but if he die, as for the mo<U+017F>t part, then the malignity of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was the cau<U+017F>e of it. Wherefore I alledge Experience again<U+017F>t Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and prai<U+017F>e God Almighty, that he hath vouch<U+017F>afed to furni<U+017F>h all tho<U+017F>e, who without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or <U+017F>lavi<U+017F>h dependance upon others, will duly con<U+017F>ider Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es with <U+017F>urer means.</p>
                     <p>The more moderate <U+017F>ort of them would have <hi>Bleeding</hi> only admini<U+017F>tred in the beginning of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and before the Malignity appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. This I <U+017F>hall willingly allow them; 1. In very hot Countreys. 2. In a Plethorick Body. 3. If the humors flying to the head, cau<U+017F>e any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <U+017F>ymptoms there; in which ca<U+017F>e, bleeding in the Hand or Foot may be, I think, very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. Otherwi<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that u<U+017F>e it in all bodies, and without di<U+017F>tinction in the<U+017F>e cold and moi<U+017F>t parts, will find the ill effects of it, and be puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withal to give a rea<U+017F>on for their Practice, allowable by Art; the rather becau<U+017F>e, by their own confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, they dare not u<U+017F>e this their Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Bleeding at certain times, but find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves be<U+017F>t in the u<U+017F>e of Sudorificks and cooling Drinks. But enough of this.</p>
                     <p>Now how <hi>many Ounces</hi> of Blood ought to be taken at once; the degree of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and the Patients more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trength, will indicate.

                     <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of Bleeding is <U+017F>o well known, that I think it needle<U+017F>s here to de<U+017F>cribe it; only I could wi<U+017F>h, that <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e that let blood, would take care <U+017F>omewhat better to gue<U+017F>s of the number of Ounces of Blood they take from their Patients, that <U+017F>o we might not find 12, 16, 18, yea, 22 ounces drawn away in<U+017F>tead of 6 or 8, that

and extol it far above the former: I think my <U+017F>elf obliged to declare here what I judge of this matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Potential Cautery</hi> hath this Advantage, that it doth not terrifie timorous Patients, nor is painful to the tender; e<U+017F>pecially joyning with it the pre<U+017F>ent and known good Remedies: For <hi>unquenched Lime,</hi> mixed with <hi>Holland Sope,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deep enough into the fle<U+017F>h, yet much gentli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Corro<U+017F>ive of <hi>Ambr.

                     <p n="1">1. That according to the tenderne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>trength of the Skin or Bodies, <U+017F>ometimes it eats in deeper than needs; for we have found by experience, that in <U+017F>ome it hath eaten through the Skin and Mu<U+017F>cles, to the very cavity of the Belly; in others irrecoverably wounded the proce<U+017F><U+017F>es of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> together with the <U+017F>eminal ve<U+017F><U+017F>els therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Commonly it <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elf in length and breadth <U+017F>omewhat further than you would have it, e<U+017F>pecially if it be to be applied under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, in the Groin, or in the Joynts; for it no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grows warm, but it melts, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>preads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, notwith<U+017F>tanding the Plai<U+017F>ter with which the Surgeon de<U+017F>igned to bound it.</p>

that many people are affrighted at it, and that it is painful: But the fear may be prevented by <U+017F>ilence, and the pain is little con<U+017F>iderable; mean time you have the<U+017F>e Advantages:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Manual Operation is ancient, and full of danger; yet <U+017F>ometimes pre<U+017F>erves the life of the Patient. Nature and Succe<U+017F>s have emboldened us now and then to make u<U+017F>e of it; but Experience hath taught us, that the greate<U+017F>t difficulty con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts herein: 1. That the parts debilitated, and de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their natural heat, do ea<U+017F>ily, after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mortifie. 2. That together with the Water, i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out likewi<U+017F>e the Spirits. 3. That the pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing water can hardly be <U+017F>o kept in, but it will run out in de<U+017F>pight of the Chirurgeon; and if, the better to clo<U+017F>e the Wound, you do forcibly pre<U+017F>s in the Pipe, a Gangrene <U+017F>oon and ea<U+017F>ily en<U+017F>ueth.</p>
                     <p>Who therefore expects a good i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e it only upon a Body that is not emaciated or wa<U+017F>ted; in a Drop<U+017F>ie that is recent (or at lea<U+017F>t, when the Tumor in a <U+017F>hort time hath ri<U+017F>en to a great bulk) and which, upon the u<U+017F>e of proper Remedies, would not pre<U+017F>ently be removed; in <U+017F>uch Patients that are not mole<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Fever, or with difficulty of breathing, and where the noble parts are yet <U+017F>ound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted; and in per<U+017F>ons of a middle age, <U+017F>ince in Children and in old people it <U+017F>ucceeds not <U+017F>o pro<U+017F>perou<U+017F>ly.</p>

                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as you perceive Water to come forth, take a Golden, Silver, or Leaden <U+017F>mall Pipe, that is, 1. Smooth. 2. Furni<U+017F>ht at the Head with a Button or Wing. 3. Perforated on the <U+017F>ides with three or four holes. 4. No longer than the thickne<U+017F>s of the di<U+017F><U+017F>ected part, that is, an inch broad. 5. Somewhat crooked at the end. 6. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fitting the <U+017F>ize of the Orifice. Put this into the Apertion, lay over it a <U+017F>ticking-Plai<U+017F>ter (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take a Spunge, or a four double linnen Rag) bind up the Patient, and let him re<U+017F>t two or three hours; then open the Bandage again, and take away one, two, three, <U+017F>eldom or never more pints of Water, and <U+017F>o repeating it once or twice a day, till the water be <hi>almo<U+017F>t</hi> all di<U+017F>charged. You mu<U+017F>t not take away all at fir<U+017F>t, for the chilne<U+017F>s of

the parts, following <U+017F>o great an Evacuation, very often cau<U+017F>eth death. The Pipe is not to be taken out, but mu<U+017F>t remain all the time of the cure in the Wound, which you mu<U+017F>t at length heal up according to Art.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of an Hydropical Belly, this is the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t as hitherto practi<U+017F>ed way, that is left us by the Ancients; but the indu<U+017F>try of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>terity hath invented for us a much convenienter In<U+017F>trument, whereby we not only do avoid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the above-mentioned difficulties, but al<U+017F>o with le<U+017F>s trouble pre<U+017F>erve the lives otherwi<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Patients, freeing them from <U+017F>tretching, pain and trouble, according to our plea<U+017F>ure, or the degree of their <U+017F>trength.</p>
                     <p>This never enough commended <hi>In<U+017F>trument</hi> was fir<U+017F>t of all brought out of <hi>Italy</hi>; by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chirurgeon of this City, Mr. <hi>Jacob Block,</hi> and by him put into practice, to the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of many Patients.</p>
                     <p>Commonly he chu<U+017F>eth the place lately pointed out by us, <hi>viz.</hi> about three inches below the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and perforates the Skin, Mu<U+017F>cles and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> unto the very Water, taking away no more at once than a quart.</p>
                     <p>That done, he draws out his In<U+017F>trument again, puts nothing upon the made hole but dry Lint and a <U+017F>ticking-Plai<U+017F>ter, whereby he <U+017F>ufficiently hinders the running out, again<U+017F>t your Will, of even a drop of Water; for, upon the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the In<U+017F>trument, the opened Skin, Mu<U+017F>cles and <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> are ea<U+017F>ily by their natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>o far drawn a<U+017F>under, that the holes cannot any more exactly clo<U+017F>e upon one another.</p>
                     <p>This being once performed, we regulate our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52336:35"/>
according to the <U+017F>trength of the Patient, <U+017F>taying two, three or more days, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this Operation; then either the fir<U+017F>t Orifice is to be opened, or again a new one to be made, e<U+017F>pecially if the Chirurgeon finds, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be more conveniently drawn away in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place.</p>
                     <p>In an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> (when the water is fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>) the <U+017F>aid Chirurgeon doth by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trument <U+017F>o dexterou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>charge the Water out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> that the next day you <U+017F>hall not, or hardly be able to find where the Hole was.</p>
                     <p>The Perforation <U+017F>eems to me a little inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, wherefore I have cau<U+017F>ed this In<U+017F>trument <U+017F>o far to be altered, as that I make the end not to be wrought round, but <U+017F>harp on both <U+017F>ides, Launcet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, by which means it may be <U+017F>ooner thru<U+017F>t through the Mu<U+017F>cles. But then, <hi>his</hi> may be made of Silver, <hi>mine</hi> mu<U+017F>t be of Steel.</p>
                     <p>To the end that you may the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what we <U+017F>ay, we <U+017F>hall repre<U+017F>ent to your view the In<U+017F>trument, and the Operation it <U+017F>elf, in the en<U+017F>uing <hi>Figures.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Opening of the Brea<U+017F>t.</head>
                     <p>THere is <U+017F>ometimes collected in the Cavity of the Brea<U+017F>t a <hi>water</hi> or <hi>purulent matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Water</hi> gathers either by <U+017F>ome <hi>Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> bur<U+017F>t, or from an unconcocted watrine<U+017F>s of the Blood. The <hi>purulent Matter</hi> follows upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Throat, or Lungs, or a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be Matter that is collected, it is called <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema</hi>; if Water, <hi>Hydrops pectoris vel pulmonis,</hi> the Drop<U+017F>ie of the Brea<U+017F>t or Lungs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> are, a dry Cough, a painful heavine<U+017F>s, a difficulty of breathing, even to Suffocation, great Thir<U+017F>t, little Appetite, a pale Look and <U+017F>ometimes a <U+017F>welling of the Legs, now and then accompanied with a Feaver; and when the Patient turns him<U+017F>elf, you may perceive a rumbling noi<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>The collected <hi>Sanies</hi> may be known by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Signs</hi>; When the Inflamation of the Lungs or <hi>Pleura,</hi> will not, upon Bleeding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient means, be <U+017F>ufficiently removed, then may you apprehend a collection of <U+017F>uch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come within a fortnight. Between the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fortieth day the Tumor commonly breaks. The Patient <U+017F>hall find a great heavine<U+017F>s in his Che<U+017F>t without con<U+017F>iderable pain; and in ca<U+017F>e it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pain, then you are to Expect a new Flux, which you mu<U+017F>t divert by Bleeding. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:37"/>
Patient hath a difficulty in breathing; in motion, he hears a rumbling, at lea<U+017F>t he is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that the matter changeth place, and the <U+017F>ide affected is to the touch, hotter than the other. He ca<U+017F>ts up, with violent coughing, a purulent matter, having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fever; he finds an anxiety at his heart, and hath little <U+017F>tomach to his meat.</p>
                     <p>If we cannot expel the<U+017F>e Humors by Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, nor by Diureticks, nor Diaphoreticks, nor by purging Medicines, then are we forc'd to come to Manual Operation.</p>
                     <p>This cannot be done without danger, and is not to be attempted in ca<U+017F>e the Patient be weak, and the inward parts already corrupted. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this Operation hath le<U+017F>s danger than the next foregoing, and people oftner recover upon it; yea, Learned Writers a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us, that by this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and the u<U+017F>e of Injection, they have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of Ulcers of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>Place</hi> of Opening, Authors are not agreed in it; the rea<U+017F>on whereof is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> runs higher in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons than in others; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that the collected Humors in <U+017F>ome Patients, lie higher than in others. Secondly, the Che<U+017F>t is rai<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>ome, flat in others; which here much alters the ca<U+017F>e. Be<U+017F>ides, the Lungs do often grow <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that the <U+017F>anious matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ea<U+017F>ily be carried into the Cavity of the Brea<U+017F>t: In which ca<U+017F>e it would be ill done, to cho<U+017F>e the place of Opening lowe<U+017F>t, in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi> And in regard that in this, as in other <U+017F>wellings, the mo<U+017F>t eminent place is, e<U+017F>teemed the mo<U+017F>t convenient for opening, it cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e but that one Chirurgeon hath made
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
choice of this place, and another u<U+017F>eth that place as the be<U+017F>t. Upon which account, <hi>Hyppocrates Guido, Amatus Lu<U+017F>itanus,</hi> &amp;c. do make the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the third and fourth Rib, counting from beneath upwards: <hi>Fienus, Riverius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, between the fourth and fifth; <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Vidus Vidius, Fabritius ab Aquapendente, Sennertus,</hi> &amp;c. between the fifth and <U+017F>ixth; which place, in my opinion, is the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t; for, if higher, the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> if lower, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> may be wounded, of which there have been many <U+017F>ad Examples. But in this difference of di<U+017F><U+017F>enting Writers, what hath been <U+017F>aid, will direct you to pa<U+017F>s into the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t Haven.</p>
                     <p>All things therefore well con<U+017F>idered, chu<U+017F>e the place where to make your Apertion; not the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (for, <hi>before,</hi> the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Brea<U+017F>t-bone will hinder your operation here; nor in the back-part, for the Ribs are <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e to one another, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting <U+017F>ome Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, you cannot make any Apertion there) but on the <U+017F>ide, four or five inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the <hi>Sternum</hi>: Neither ought the Inci<U+017F>ion to be <U+017F>o near to the upper Ribs, as to the lower, becau<U+017F>e the interco<U+017F>tal Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vein, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Nerve, lie in the lower part of each Rib, where Nature hath a<U+017F><U+017F>igned them a place, branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them<U+017F>elves into the middle of the interco<U+017F>tal Mu<U+017F>cles; which di<U+017F><U+017F>emination neverthele<U+017F>s hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that the Inci<U+017F>ion may be made in the middle between the two Ribs.</p>
                     <p>After you have marked the place with Ink, charge the Patient to breath forth as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can, without taking it in, and in the mean time make an oblique, but <U+017F>mall Orifice, and put into it a Silver or Leaden Pipe, and take forth four
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
or five ounces of Matter to run out in a day. In ca<U+017F>e the Matter does not come forth well, place your Patient on the wounded <U+017F>ide, and make him to cough; if by rea<U+017F>on of its toughne<U+017F>s it will not yet come forth, then inject into the cavity <U+017F>ome ab<U+017F>ter<U+017F>ive, ex<U+017F>iccating and healing Medicines; As,</p>
                     <p>Take Goats whey, eighteen ounces; Honey of Ro<U+017F>es, four ounces; the Juice of Celandine and Smallage, of each <U+017F>ix drams: Mingle it.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Comfrey the greater, an ounce; of Sanicle, half an ounce; the Leaves of Betony, Agrimony, Periwincle, Burnet, of each half a handful; the Cordial Flowers, two pugils; the Seed of St. John'swort, Holy-Thi<U+017F>tle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Nettle, of each half a dram: Boil them in Water and Honey to a pint and half; <U+017F>train it, and keep it for your u<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Of this Injection, the Patient may al<U+017F>o drink a little twice or thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>It is yet further to be ob<U+017F>erved, that the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Matter is often contained in a Membrane of its own, and by its ri<U+017F>ing, manife<U+017F>ts it <U+017F>elf from without; and then the <hi>Latines</hi> call it <hi>Vomica Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis</hi>: In which ca<U+017F>e, you mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tay till the Membrane breaks of its <U+017F>elf; for by delay, the Matter flowing up and down is more difficulty to be got out of the Brea<U+017F>t; but open it pre<U+017F>ently, taking no other place, but the mo<U+017F>t rai<U+017F>ed part of the <U+017F>welling.</p>
                     <p>Now, <U+017F>ince an <hi>Empyema</hi> for the mo<U+017F>t part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon a <hi>Pleuri<U+017F>ie,</hi> and 'tis dayly found, that ignorant Chirurgeons take all kind of pain in the Sides, Belly and Brea<U+017F>t, although cau<U+017F>ed from Winds only, for a Pleuri<U+017F>ie; thereupon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

                        <hi>The Pleuri<U+017F>ie then is an inflammation of the</hi> Pleura, <hi>and commonly of the Lungs them<U+017F>elves, cau<U+017F>ed from afflux of Blood, accompanied with Pain Cough, <U+017F>pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of Breath, continual Feaver, <U+017F>trong and quick Pul<U+017F>e.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Signs,</hi> as may be <U+017F>een in the De<U+017F>cription, are <U+017F>o evident, that tho<U+017F>e who know not how to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it from a <hi>Cholick,</hi> are not worthy of any excu<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks.</hi>] The <U+017F>ooner the matter is concocted, and the whiter and ea<U+017F>ier 'tis ejected, the quicker and <U+017F>afer is the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue. If the Cough, and difficulty of breathing le<U+017F><U+017F>en not by a copious Expectoration, 'tis an ill <U+017F>ign. If the Patient come not to <U+017F>pit the third or fourth day, then will he <U+017F>carce <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>eventh. If upon Bleeding, and other fit means, the pain cea<U+017F>e not, the Patient mu<U+017F>t ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, or the Pleuri<U+017F>ie will turn to a Con<U+017F>ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an <hi>Empyema.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] In this ca<U+017F>e, <hi>Bleeding</hi> is one of the mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t means of Cure; and if u<U+017F>ed in time, the Patient, in the very Operation, and before the Vein be clo<U+017F>ed, will find relief, and <U+017F>ometimes be altogether freed of the pain. Nor do I know any Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, in which there may, to the Patient's benefit, be <U+017F>o much Blood taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at once, as in this.</p>
                     <p>There are different Opinions concerning what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:39"/>
<U+017F>ide the Patient is to bleed on: But tho<U+017F>e have had little Experience of this <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, who have not found, that Patients (at lea<U+017F>t in the<U+017F>e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) are relieved much more and <U+017F>ooner, when they are bled in the Arm of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide where the Pain is, than when it is done in the oppo<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ide.</p>
                     <p>The Pain not cea<U+017F>ing in four and twenty hours, we are nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated to bleed twice or thrice, mo<U+017F>t commonly in the <U+017F>ame Arm; but here you mu<U+017F>t well ob<U+017F>erve the Patient's <U+017F>trength.</p>
                     <p>After letting Blood, <U+017F>ometimes Purging, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Expectorating Remedies, are very nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary. One only Medicine I cannot conceal from you, becau<U+017F>e of its Excellency. The Indu<U+017F>trious Phy<U+017F>itian Dr. <hi>Hadden</hi> in his <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Pleuri<U+017F>ie,</hi> hath much commended it, and I have, after once Bleeding, always in the beginning u<U+017F>ed it with great <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>A <hi>Cataract</hi> (by the Greeks called <hi>Hypochyma</hi> by the Latines, <hi>Suffu<U+017F>io</hi>; in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue, <hi>De Staer) is a concretion of <U+017F>uperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humors, by little and little generating a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Membrane betwixt the</hi> Cornea <hi>and the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>talline Humor, covering either totally, or in part, the Pupil of the Eye, and <U+017F>o depriving the Patient, of his <U+017F>ight, or hindring it.</hi>

                     <p>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis white, gray, yellow, green, <U+017F>ometimes of a leaden colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as the green, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or black Choler is mingled among<U+017F>t it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seat</hi> of it is between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the <hi>Cry<U+017F>talline</hi> humor, being <U+017F>ometimes nearer to <hi>this,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes to <hi>that.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Cau<U+017F>e</hi> is a Phlegmatick Humor, either collected there by the weakne<U+017F>s of the Eyes, or by the Brain tran<U+017F>mitted thither by rea<U+017F>on of its abundance.</p>

the Center of the Pupil, yet covers not the whole Pupil; but leaveth round about the <U+017F>ight <U+017F>ome place free, and then all the Patient <U+017F>ees, <U+017F>eems per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated. If the Pupil <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elf, when you rub the Eye with your Fingers, then is it yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; if it remains unmoved, there is no doubt of its being perfect.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks.</hi>] The imperfect Cataract may ea<U+017F>ily be cured in the beginning, by convenient External and Internal Medicines, in <U+017F>ound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in Patients of a middle Age. The le<U+017F>s the Pupil is dilated, the le<U+017F>s hope of Cure. The nearer the Suffu<U+017F>ion is to the Cry<U+017F>talline Humor, the more dangerous. If the Eye be turned to the Sun, and the Patient then <U+017F>ees no glimmering of Light, there is no benefit to be expected from the Manual Operation. If the Humors of the Eye be commixt by the Needle, though the Membrane be removed, then blindne<U+017F>s will certainly remain.

                        <hi>IS<U+017F>ues are little Ulcers made by Art in a <U+017F>ound part of the Body by a red-hot Iron, Launcet, Sci<U+017F><U+017F>ars, or corro<U+017F>ive Medicine, to evacuate <U+017F>uperfluous humors, and <U+017F>o either to cure or prevent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es.</hi>

                     <p>Tho<U+017F>e which de<U+017F>ire it rather by <hi>Inci<U+017F>ion,</hi> the Skin being taken up either by the Forceps, or by the Hand, divide it with a pair of Sci<U+017F><U+017F>ars or Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. If Burning be preferred before the other ways, burn the Skin, but not the <U+017F>ubjacent Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; for indeed the Skin it <U+017F>elf is not to be wholly penetrated, oftentimes the touching only the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of it is enough.</p>
                     <p>When the Scar falls off, take little hard Do<U+017F><U+017F>els made of Lint, <U+017F>pred upon them <U+017F>ome Deter<U+017F>ive Medicine, and pre<U+017F>s them into the Ulcer, until they have made a <U+017F>ufficient Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward keep in this Cavity a Ball of Wax, Wood, or Silver, or a Pea, which is to be often taken out, and another put in, and <U+017F>o is to be continued till the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be cured, or Weakne<U+017F>s hinder.</p>

                        <p>When the Mother turns her <U+017F>elf from one <U+017F>ide to the other, and perceives the Child to fall on the

                        <p>But fir<U+017F>t, it is diligently to be enquired into, which of the Cau<U+017F>es it is that hinders the Birth: If the Child be greater and the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age <U+017F>traighter than u<U+017F>ually, they ought to be dilated; this <U+017F>ome Midwives do with convenient In<U+017F>truments, and <U+017F>o draw forth the Child alive; but where they are wanting, the Midwife mu<U+017F>t clutch her hand very clo<U+017F>e, and thru<U+017F>t through the Internal Orifice into the Womb it <U+017F>elf; then putting her Fingers one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another through the Orifice into the inner part of the Womb, to di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>ituation of the Child; and if <U+017F>he finds the Arms or Feet to come inconveniently, let her gently rai<U+017F>e it up, bringing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:50"/>
the Head downwards, which if <U+017F>he finds to be next the Orifice, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, let her put in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand through the <hi>Pudenda</hi> into the Womb, and <U+017F>o with both her hands laying hold of it, draw it forth.</p>
                        <p>But if this Operation cannot be performed, then with a hook firmly fixt (le<U+017F>t it injure the in<U+017F>ide of the Womb) in the Mouth, Eye or Ear of the Child, and <U+017F>o gently draw it forth; and if the <hi>Faetus</hi> will not follow, then with another Hook, blunt on the out-<U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>harp within, let him cut in pieces the Belly, Brea<U+017F>t, or Head of the Child; and if the Arms or Legs cannot be brought forth, let him cut them off; <U+017F>o at length, being deprived of its Limbs, the remainder may be drawn forth.</p>
                        <p>But if by this way the Woman can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, with a <U+017F>harp and <U+017F>trong Knife, the Limbs one after another are to be cut out, and <U+017F>o the Child be drawn forth by piece-meal: It is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that this be perform'd by none but a good Anatomi<U+017F>t.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Secundine</hi> will pre<U+017F>ently follow the Birth, for it's of no u<U+017F>e, that being excluded; for the Mouth of the Womb, <U+017F>uddenly after delivery, is <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ly <U+017F>hut, that not without great pain it can admit the Hand of the Midwife; therefore the Midwife, as <U+017F>oon as may be, is to draw it forth, and with her fingers, if it <U+017F>ticks very clo<U+017F>e to the Womb, gently to <U+017F>eparate it, but not pluck it a way forcibly, which is mortal; and although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Writers and Midwives of inferior Rank, little regard the retention of the After-Birth for <U+017F>ome time after delivery; yet I think I have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on to pronounce it, one of the greate<U+017F>t Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of Womens Labour.</p>

                        <p>If either the Patient or Chirurgeon be aver<U+017F>e to the u<U+017F>e of a Cautery, then as <U+017F>oon as the Member is taken off, let the Skin together with the Fle<U+017F>h, in four di<U+017F>tinct places oppo<U+017F>ite one to the other, be taken up with a Needle and waxed Thread, and the Ligature being loo<U+017F>ened above, or drawn down, that, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, they may meet: So by this way is the <hi>Hemorage</hi> <U+017F>taid, the Bone pre<U+017F>erved from all danger, and the Wound <U+017F>ooner cured. But this way is painful and trouble<U+017F>om, therefore ought it the <U+017F>eldomer to be u<U+017F>ed.</p>

The <hi>cau<U+017F>e</hi> of this Tumor, <hi>not to be impure Blood,</hi> <U+017F>eeing the be<U+017F>t, may produce it; <hi>not <U+017F>imply abounding in quantity,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it al<U+017F>o happens in wa<U+017F>ted Bodies, though 'tis not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon generated, nor arrives to <U+017F>uch a greatne<U+017F>s in the<U+017F>e, as in tho<U+017F>e Bodies; but <hi>the true cau<U+017F>e is the Ero<U+017F>ion, Rupture or Dilatation of the Membranes which clo<U+017F>e the Mouths of the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that the nutritious Blood may not flow too <U+017F>uddenly into the Part</hi>; from whence, more Blood flows into the Part than what is required for its nouri<U+017F>hment; and Nature changeth that Blood which otherwi<U+017F>e would purifie into a fle<U+017F>hy Sub<U+017F>tance. 2. <hi>This fle<U+017F>h <U+017F>ometimes grows to the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the common Tunicles of the</hi> Scrotum, <hi>and not to the Te<U+017F>ticles,</hi> in which ca<U+017F>e it may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] In the beginning, when the Membranes of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els being eroded, broke or dilated, do give leave for too much leave to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue forth, <hi>Bleeding, and the u<U+017F>e of Repelling and Re<U+017F>tringent Medicines profit much</hi>; but when it hath begun to augment, then we may u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e following means: Let there be made a little Orifice into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> rather in its Superior then Inferior Part, through which, by the help of Plegets let Suppurating Medicines be applied, <U+017F>o that if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to wa<U+017F>te the Fle<U+017F>h, every dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing diligently wiping away the Matter, but not at all, that the remaining Fle<U+017F>h may be the better con<U+017F>umed.</p>

                        <hi>If the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>ucceed not,</hi> draw forth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticle, and by Inci<U+017F>ion take off as much Fle<U+017F>h as may be done without injury to it; then re<U+017F>tore it again into its place, and the remainder of the Fle<U+017F>h endeavor to con<U+017F>ume by Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if there be no hope of curing this Rupture by the recited means,</hi> draw forth the Hernious Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as far as you may, then pa<U+017F>s once or twice a Silken Thred above the Tumor by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>; then pa<U+017F>s both ends of the Silk through the Orifice it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o that which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52336:53"/>
was on the right <U+017F>ide, may be on the left, and that of the left, on the right; and having ordered that the proce<U+017F>s of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> may be tied with a knot, then cut off the Te<U+017F>ticle, letting both the ends of the Silk hang out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and <U+017F>o cure it as another Wound.</p>
                     <p>I cannot here but friendly advi<U+017F>e, 1. <hi>The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ought to con<U+017F>ider well of the Cau<U+017F>e, before he comes to the Operation it <U+017F>elf</hi>; for <U+017F>ometimes the <hi>Para<U+017F>tates</hi> are <U+017F>o <U+017F>well'd, e<U+017F>pecially the Te<U+017F>ticles being Scirrhous, that they may ea<U+017F>ily deceive a very curious Examiner. 2. The Ligature ought to be made as near to the Tumor as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for by how much the higher part of the Proce<U+017F>s of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be perforated, it is ob<U+017F>erved to be <U+017F>o much the thicker, which thing will retard the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration and the falling of the Thread; in the mean time <hi>Convul<U+017F>ions</hi> coming on, denounce death. 3. The Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els detain'd in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> oftentimes by Natures variety, exceed the Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles them<U+017F>elves in greatne<U+017F>s, which cau<U+017F>es no other inconvenience but only Fear, which I have ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true, in more than one.</p>

Lillies, Ro<U+017F>es, or fre<U+017F>h Almonds, and thru<U+017F>t them up the Fundament, with his right hand gently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> <U+017F>o that the Stone may <U+017F>lip down under the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> into the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> which when brought thither by the fore<U+017F>aid Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, let him make Inci<U+017F>ion with a <U+017F>harp Knife in the left <U+017F>ide between the Te<U+017F>ticles and the <hi>Anus,</hi> near to the Suture of the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> cutting to the very Stone it <U+017F>elf; and if it comes not out of the Wound it <U+017F>elf, nor by the thru<U+017F>ting forth of the Fingers which are in the <hi>Inte<U+017F>tinum rectum,</hi> let him draw it forth with a pair of Forceps, or which is better, with the <hi>Lapidillum</hi> or Spoon. The Stone being taken out, and all the Ligatures loo<U+017F>ed, let the Wound be bound up according to Art, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, <U+017F>topping Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> of Meal and Bole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the greate<U+017F>t care to con<U+017F>olidate it as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, le<U+017F>t the Patient labour with a dropping of his Urine through the wounded part: And this is the manner of drawing forth the Stone, which Chirurgeons u<U+017F>e to call <hi>Apparatus Minor,</hi> which chiefly is u<U+017F>ed in Children, although there are tho<U+017F>e which proceed thus in People of full growth: But in our Country always this Inci<U+017F>ion is made by them who<U+017F>e Fingers are fitted for this Operation,</p>
                     <p>But in People of full Age it is <U+017F>ometimes very difficult to reach the Stone by the Fingers put up into the Fundament, and after the <U+017F>ame manner to bring it down into the <hi>Perinoeum,</hi> if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, as many think it; therefore there is another way found out, which they call <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus Major</hi>; the Patient is put on a Table, and bound, and held as above, the Chirurgeon through the <hi>Uretra</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth a Director into the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52336:57"/>
Bladder to the Stone, then Inci<U+017F>ion being made as obove, in the hollow of the Director, puts in the Conductor, taking the Director out of the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> he pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth into the Wound the Forceps, the <hi>Lapidillum,</hi> or other In<U+017F>trument convenient for drawing out the Stone, by which he may both lay hold of it, and draw it forth, not making u<U+017F>e of his Fingers in the <hi>Anus,</hi> except great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to it. Where the Stone is bigger than the Orifice, and cannot come forth, the Wound is to be enlarged, or the Stone to be broken into pieces by the Forceps, and <U+017F>o drawn forth in parts: This done, the Binding and Con<U+017F>olidating the Wound, ought to be the <U+017F>ame as in Children, giving it a <U+017F>titch if it be too great, putting in a Silver-Pipe for two or three days, that may give pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Concreted Blood, Slime and Sandy Urine.</p>

                     <p>The Cure is performed two ways: 1. <hi>By hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering any further Flux to the Part.</hi> 2. <hi>In removing that which is already gathered in the Part.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sphacelus, Necro<U+017F>is, Syderatio, is a perfect Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only of the <U+017F>oft, but of the hard parts al<U+017F>o.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Differences.</hi>] In a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> the parts are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead; but in a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> they begin but to die, and the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e is not perfectly aboli<U+017F>hed; <hi>there</hi> the Skin is fir<U+017F>t pallid, <U+017F>uddenly livid, then black; <hi>here</hi> in a manner red; greater <U+017F>tink in <hi>that,</hi> than in <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cau<U+017F>es</hi> of both are <U+017F>ix. 1. The External Cold of the Air, or Repelling Medicines. 2. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Heat,</hi> from burning, or u<U+017F>e of Corro<U+017F>ive Medicines. 3. <hi>A Defect of Nutriment,</hi> as in an <hi>Atrophia,</hi> either by the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion or ob<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, by rea<U+017F>on of which <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s the Blood cannot pa<U+017F>s to the Part. 4. <hi>The <U+017F>topping of the Pores,</hi> or <hi>Per<U+017F>piration hindred</hi>; from whence comes a Suffocation of the Natural Heat. 5. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Humor,</hi> either begotten in the Body, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractee from venomous Bea<U+017F>ts, or Medicines. 6. The <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which by a peculiar property, cau<U+017F>eth the Parts <U+017F>ometimes to mortifie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] A <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is ea<U+017F>ily to be known, the Part looks black; Spungy Fle<U+017F>h; Sen<U+017F>e, Heat, and Pul<U+017F>ation aboli<U+017F>h'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:52336:77"/>But the <hi>Signs</hi> of a <hi>Gangrene</hi> vary according to the variety of the Cau<U+017F>es: If contracted from <hi>Cold,</hi> a great pricking Pain is felt in the affected Part: Fir<U+017F>t, 'tis red, then pale, at length black: The Natural heat by degrees is extingui<U+017F>hed, and there happens a <U+017F>haking, not unlike that in a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Ague.</p>
                     <p>If cau<U+017F>ed from an <hi>External Heat,</hi> or <U+017F>topping of the Pores, the Redne<U+017F>s is changed into White, then into Black; Pul<U+017F>ation and Pain cea<U+017F>e; the Sen<U+017F>es le<U+017F><U+017F>ened; and at la<U+017F>t there appear <U+017F>ome <hi>Pu<U+017F>tules,</hi> from whence i<U+017F><U+017F>ue a gleety Humor.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>from defect of Aliment,</hi> there is neither <hi>Pain, Inflammation</hi> or <hi>Tumor</hi>; the Body waxeth cold, and for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>eizeth upon the Joynts.</p>
                     <p>If from a <hi>venomous Creature</hi> or <hi>Humor,</hi> great <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Fever</hi> always accompany it; frequent Faintings, and oftentimes <hi>Deliriums</hi>: Here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth a <hi>Pu<U+017F>tule,</hi> under which appears a black Spot, which <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elf over the whole part.</p>
                     <p>If from the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> it for the mo<U+017F>t part begins at the Toes, it <U+017F>hews it <U+017F>elf outwardly with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h <U+017F>pots and lines, which degenerates into a dry Cru<U+017F>t; upon which follows a Numne<U+017F>s of the Part, and at length a Mortification it <U+017F>elf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Stink: Sometimes without pain, other times very great, e<U+017F>pecially in them that are given to Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion or Sadne<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks.</hi>] Except a Gangrene be <U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>topt, it degenerates into a <hi>Sphacelus</hi>; ea<U+017F>ilier cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in young, than old People: The Humors continually flowing to the part affected, bring danger with them, and that very great, if they are Malignant: In the Cavities of the Body, to wit, in the Mouth, Privy Parts, and Fundament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:52336:78"/>
a Gangrene is always difficult of Cure, as al<U+017F>o that which happens among the Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; in Hydropicks always mortal: That which happens from the Scurvy, may be <U+017F>pun out from many Months, but <U+017F>eldom cured.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is not cured but by the Knife and Fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] Diet mu<U+017F>t be good, the Air, Meat and Drink generally cooling and drying: But <U+017F>eeing the Cau<U+017F>es are various, we leave it to the Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to pre<U+017F>cribe what is convenient; who al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t well di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h concerning <hi>Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purging,</hi> when to be u<U+017F>ed with advantage or di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.

Second is <hi>Synanche,</hi> when the Tumor <U+017F>hews it <U+017F>elf within the Jaws; the Symptoms are likewi<U+017F>e here great, but much le<U+017F>s than in <hi>Cynanthe.</hi> Third is, <hi>Para<U+017F>ynanche,</hi> when the Tumor appears more Externally than Internally; and in this the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes are lea<U+017F>t of all.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A mortal Wound is that, which in the <U+017F>pace of few hours or days, of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity cau<U+017F>es Death, and cannot by any Art be cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For tho<U+017F>e that in them<U+017F>elves are curable, yet by rea<U+017F>on of ill Symptoms, or through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect either of the Patient or Chirurgeon, do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion Death, ought not to be accounted mortal Wounds: Incurable Wounds them<U+017F>elves are not to be call'd Mortal, if they are not the cau<U+017F>e of Death

                     <p n="1">1. Among the Wounds that are Mortal, are to be accounted the Wounds of the Brain, but not all of them; for Experience hath taught us, that part of the Brain hath been taken forth, and the Life pre<U+017F>erved, though the Under<U+017F>tanding lo<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>Therefore tho<U+017F>e Wounds of the Brain that be ab<U+017F>olutely mortal, are, 1. <hi>When be<U+017F>ides the Brains, a Nerve is al<U+017F>o wounded.</hi> 2. <hi>When Blood, or <U+017F>ome other Humor ob<U+017F>tructs the beginning of the Nerves:</hi> 3. <hi>When after a few days the concrete and putrified Blood produceth a Fever,</hi> Delirium, <hi>and Death it <U+017F>elf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By concreted Blood, I under<U+017F>tand not that which lies between the <hi>Dura-Mater</hi> and the Skull; for that is to be taken forth by the Trepan, and the Patient this way may be pre<U+017F>erved; but that which is included between the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or between the <hi>Pia</hi> and the Brain: Although <U+017F>ometimes, that which is detained between both Membranes, by the dividing of the <hi>Dura,</hi> may be taken forth, and <U+017F>o the Patient pre<U+017F>erved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Wounds of the Spinal Marrow are al<U+017F>o mortal, which happens in the Neck, or nearer to the Head; but tho<U+017F>e which happen lower, as about the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> are of le<U+017F><U+017F>er danger.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Wounds of the Lungs are mortal, if great and deep, where the great Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, or the Branches of the <hi>A<U+017F>pera Arteria</hi> are hurt: Where the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are divided, there follows a great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion of Blood; where the Branches of the <hi>A<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria,</hi> the Breath comes forth more through the Wound than the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wounds of the heart are always mortal;

                     <p n="5">5. The Wound of the Wind-pipe may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if the Membranes only behind, to which the Cartilaginous Rings are join'd, be hurt; but if the Rings them<U+017F>elves are wounded, there's no cure to be expected; yet <U+017F>ometimes tho<U+017F>e wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lingering Death; <U+017F>o that I have <U+017F>een on <U+017F>o wounded, live Eighteen weeks before he died.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wounds of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> tho<U+017F>e that are inflicted in the fle<U+017F>hy Part of it, are curable; but tho<U+017F>e that are in the Nervous Part, though the<U+017F>e always occa<U+017F>ion not <U+017F>udden Death, yet 'tis impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible ever to cure them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Wounds of the <hi>Stomach</hi> are <U+017F>ometimes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; tho<U+017F>e chiefly being mortal, that happen in the upper Orifice, or in Nerves that are di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the Stomach.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Wounds of the <hi>Small Guts</hi> are <U+017F>eldom cured, but the <hi>Wounds</hi> of the <hi>Great Guts</hi> much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, e<U+017F>pecially if they are not great.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Wounds of the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> are mortal, where the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els them<U+017F>elves are wounded; where not, they may be cured.</p>
                     <p n="10">10.

                     <p n="11">11. Wounds of the <hi>Bladder</hi> are <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, but that for the mo<U+017F>t part there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Fi<U+017F>tula; but tho<U+017F>e that are made at the neck of the bladder, are daily cured.</p>

Wounds of the great <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> are often mortal; but every Surgeon under<U+017F>tands not rightly to bind up <U+017F>uch Wounds; therefore the cau<U+017F>e of death is not always to be ca<U+017F>t upon the guilty.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Wounds of the <hi>great Nerves</hi> are for the mo<U+017F>t part incurable, and <U+017F>ometimes mortal.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Wounds from <hi>poi<U+017F>oned In<U+017F>truments</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> generally are mortal.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of Nerves, Veins, Tendons and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, are more difficultly, and longer of Cure, than tho<U+017F>e of the fle<U+017F>hy parts.</p>
                     <p>A Wound from a pricking In<U+017F>trument, is of le<U+017F>s danger, than from a brui<U+017F>ing.</p>
                     <p>A Nerve, Vein or Artery, if wholly divided, are le<U+017F>s dangerous, than if they were but in part.</p>
                     <p>A great Inflamation coming upon a great Wound, is of no great danger, except it continue too long; but a great Inflamation falling upon a little Wound, is an ill <U+017F>ign.</p>
                     <p>The Inflamation for the mo<U+017F>t part vani<U+017F>heth by the fifth day; therefore if the Wound then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear white, livid or black, 'tis not void of danger.</p>
                     <p>A Fever, Vomiting and Convul<U+017F>ion, are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but a Fever and Vomiting of le<U+017F>s danger than a Convul<U+017F>ion.</p>

By con<U+017F>idering <hi>the wounded place,</hi> and by Anatomy, which teacheth in what Members the Nerves are in<U+017F>erted; but the Tendons <U+017F>eeing they terminate near the Joynts, the Hands and Feet having many; if a Wound <U+017F>hould be inflicted in the<U+017F>e parts, who would not fear them to be <U+017F>o hurt, e<U+017F>pecially if it be with a tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e

Convul<U+017F>ion is an ill <U+017F>ign; Nerves and Tendons wounded, do ea<U+017F>ily putrifie.</p>

Outward cold things do here hugely injure, not only the Air, but Medicines them<U+017F>elves: For Experience hath taught us, that cold, moi<U+017F>t and a<U+017F>tringent Medicines do nought but hurt; therefore 'tis be<U+017F>t to u<U+017F>e Medicines mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and drying, but void of any <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s. The <hi>Wound</hi> al<U+017F>o is to be kept <hi>open,</hi> till the Cure be ab<U+017F>olutely performed, that the Matter may flow freely forth; which if kept in, may increa<U+017F>e the pain, and cau<U+017F>e the putrefaction of the Nerve; which, if it <U+017F>hould happen, the corrupt Part is to be cut off, or removed by an actual Cautery.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be ob<U+017F>erved, whether the Nerve or Tendon lies bare or not; if bare, warm Medicines are convenient; but if <hi>covered,</hi> hotter Medicines are required; in the mean time, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Bleeding are not to be neglected.</p>

and Cyno<U+017F>ure to tho<U+017F>e that Navigate through the va<U+017F>t Ocean of this Art. It is every ones part to labour in it, that it may be perfected, and every day more and more illu<U+017F>trated; which may at length be brought to pa<U+017F>s, if with the greater Pains, <hi>Indu<U+017F>try</hi> and <hi>Curio<U+017F>ity,</hi> we enquire into the unknown <hi>Regions</hi> and <hi>Tracts</hi> of the <hi>Microco<U+017F>m,</hi> and not given to <U+017F>loth, plough our Ground with other Mens Oxen, only tru<U+017F>ting on the Authority of the Ancients, which the Learned wi<U+017F>ely call <hi>A<U+017F>inorum Pontem.</hi> As for me, I have ventured to introduce <U+017F>ome new <hi>Opinions;</hi> becau<U+017F>e that I deemed them in the nature of things, to exceed thee and me, and all in Antiquity.

it is nothing but what can be demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection.

                        <p>In the beginning, the <hi>Medicines</hi> that are to be applied, ought to be very <hi>a<U+017F>tringent</hi> and <hi>repelling,</hi>

the Part is gently to be rouled, having applied to it, either a Plate of Lead, or a Diachalcitheos Plai<U+017F>ter, or of Frogs with Mercury, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                        <p>Take Pomegranate-rinds, Bi<U+017F>tort-roots, of each one dram; Scales of Iron, Quick-<U+017F>ilver, Burnt-Lead, of each two drams; Bole-armenick, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Haematitis,</hi> of each a dram and half; Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Wax, as much as is <U+017F>ufficient to make it into a Plai<U+017F>ter according to Art.</p>

                        <p>But if the Tumor yields not to the<U+017F>e Remedies, but daily increa<U+017F>eth, <hi>Suppuratives</hi> are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if the<U+017F>e within few days effect nothing, and the Tumor continuing in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate, an <hi>actual Cautery</hi> may be u<U+017F>ed; which, let not the contrary Opinions either of Chirurgeons or <U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by hinder; for by its u<U+017F>e, the increa<U+017F>e of the Tumor will be <U+017F>tayed for a long time; yea, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e will be wholly eradicated.</p>
                        <p>But if the Fle<U+017F>h begins to repullulate again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, the Surgeon ought not to defer to endeavour either by a <hi>Thred</hi> or <hi>Knife</hi> its extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; the <hi>Thred</hi> being <U+017F>mall and <U+017F>trong, mu<U+017F>t be twice wound about the neck of the Tumor, and tied with a double knot, which mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>traight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <U+017F>ame day, and <U+017F>o every day until the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be deprived of its colour, <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and life, which is within <U+017F>even or eight days; then 'tis to be taken off with a crooked Knife, which is very ea<U+017F>ie to perform, <U+017F>eeing neither any great pain or flux of Blood is to be feared: If the <hi>Thred</hi> be

wet in Mercurial or Ar<U+017F>enick-water, it ha<U+017F>tens the mortification of this Tumor: But in this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Phlegmatick Body is required; for in other Bodies pain and inflamation do <U+017F>o much afflict the Patient, that 'tis <U+017F>eldom that the <hi>Thred</hi> in a <U+017F>hort time <U+017F>hould take them off; yet the Chirurgeon may to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the Symptoms, and to cool, anoint with a Feather the part which the <hi>Thred</hi> toucheth, with white camphorated Ointment, of Ro<U+017F>es, or the like, continually putting the Patients in mind how that others bear it more quietly.</p>
                        <p>But if you de<U+017F>ign to u<U+017F>e a <hi>Knife</hi> only, the whole Tumor mu<U+017F>t be endeavoured to be taken away, except you will con<U+017F>ume the remaining by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which is very rarely effected; be<U+017F>ides the Chirurgeon mu<U+017F>t have a Care that he divides not the greater Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, le<U+017F>t there follows a Flux of Blood not to be <U+017F>topped.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Vi<U+017F>cerous Fle<U+017F>h</hi> belongs rather to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians care, than the Chirurgeons.</p>

                     <p>IT hath been long di<U+017F>puted, whether the Fat, Hair and Nails ought to be accounted Parts of the Body, or Excrements. I neither think them Excrements, nor Parts properly <U+017F>o call'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Generation of the Blood, and its Circulation.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto treated of the Similar Parts, properly and improperly <U+017F>o call'd; from whom are the Di<U+017F><U+017F>imilars compounded. The Blood <U+017F>erves to their Con<U+017F>ervation, as doth the Spirits to the Actions from thence proceeding; but how the Blood is generated in our Body, and how many Spirits are there found, is not as yet <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently under<U+017F>tood by us. In this thing Writers differ among them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o that the very Truth <U+017F>eems to lie hid in the profounde<U+017F>t darkne<U+017F>s; yet the love and de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>earching out the Truth exactly, gives me freedom to declare my Opinion, yet <U+017F>till giving place to a better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sanguification</hi> I conceive to be performed after this manner: The harder Meat received in by the Mouth, chawed by the Teeth, and by the <hi>Spittle</hi> moi<U+017F>tened, is in <U+017F>ome manner prepared to be made Chyle.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Spittle,</hi> from whence it hath its beginning, no man as I know of, hath rightly demon<U+017F>trated: Tho<U+017F>e that derived it from the Veins and Arteries, it is upon this rea<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e they communicate <U+017F>everal Branches to the Maxillerary Glandules, through which the late invented <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> pa<U+017F>s; and moreover, a Salivation rai<U+017F>ed by Art, <U+017F>eems to confirm this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>But how the Arteries and Nerves can <U+017F>eparate
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52336:140"/>
<U+017F>o great a quantity of <hi>Spittle,</hi> as we have often known to have been thrown forth in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, <U+017F>eems not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to me, I do rather derive it from the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Limphaducts,</hi> which I <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e to adhere to the Salivals, upon the following Rea<U+017F>ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As often as voluntary <U+017F>wallowing is de<U+017F>ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ob<U+017F>erve the Spittle to a<U+017F>cend as it were from the Stomach into the Mouth it <U+017F>elf, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Meat be moi<U+017F>tened by Drink.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tongue, Mouth and the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach have inwardly a common Tunicle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Meat in the Mouth, as in like manner in the Ventricle, ought to be mixt with Spittle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It would be very trouble<U+017F>ome continually to drink in eating; for it is very ea<U+017F>ie for <U+017F>ome time to keep the devoured Liquor in the Stomach, and then <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to communicate <U+017F>ome part of it to the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Limphaducts are di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed through the whole Body, and they go both unto the Stomach and Tongue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I judge no Humor to be thrown out of our Body, except by peculiar pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; and <U+017F>o for <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rea<U+017F>ons, I think the Tears al<U+017F>o to be <U+017F>hed though particular Channels, which a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hand (whether mine or others) may <U+017F>ometimes find out: Yea, the mo<U+017F>t Noble <hi>Lewis Bills,</hi> the great Anatomi<U+017F>t, atte<U+017F>ts to have already di<U+017F>cover'd them and promi<U+017F>eth to demon<U+017F>trate them in the Body, and in Figures to the Favourers of Truth.</p>
                     <p>If you enquire of me of what nature <hi>Spittle</hi> is, I an<U+017F>wer, that it is <hi>Salt</hi>; yet 'tis not always nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary that this <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s be perceived by the Tongue, which tho<U+017F>e that Under<U+017F>tand the Nature
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52336:141"/>
of Artificial Salts, <U+017F>ufficiently know: It is certain that there is <U+017F>ome natural Salt in all Meats and Drinks; 'tis al<U+017F>o certain, that Salt not only helps the commixing and concoction of the Meat, but al<U+017F>o contributes much to the fermentation of the Humors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> which we have now made mention of, have but one <U+017F>trong <hi>Tunicle,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Ureters, but that they are le<U+017F><U+017F>er.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Meat thus chewed by the Teeth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Mouth, through the <hi>Gullet,</hi> by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of proper Mu<U+017F>cles, is carried into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which that it may the better keep it, it pre<U+017F>ently pur<U+017F>eth it <U+017F>elf together, <U+017F>o that the <hi>upper Orifice</hi> is clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut, but the <hi>lower</hi> not <U+017F>o <U+017F>traight, that though very lightly pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, may there find pa<U+017F><U+017F>age.</p>
                     <p>The Meat received by the Stomach, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tened by Spittle, Drink, and its own humidity, forthwith by the heat of the Stomach, begins to be concocted; the <hi>Order</hi> is not ob<U+017F>erved here, which was in the eating of the Meat; yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

I have ob<U+017F>erved the Meat to be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>ame order, as it was devoured by the Animal that was di<U+017F><U+017F>ected; but afterwards the Stomack continually dige<U+017F>ting, fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ends away that Meat which is of ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t Dige<U+017F>tion, to the Guts, and it doth not detain it, whil<U+017F>t the other is al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, which Loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es and Vomiting evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough declare, if you look into the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

'Tis al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erved in the fir<U+017F>t xx or xxx days after conception, it is naturally white, neither becomes red before the maternal Blood (concerning which, <U+017F>ome of the Moderns have far otherwi<U+017F>e a<U+017F>cribed) comes to the nouri<U+017F>hment of the already formed parts, which is the <U+017F>ame in all <hi>Spermatick parts,</hi> even in the Heart it <U+017F>elf: But will you conclude from hence, that this red colour only happens to the Liver, and is not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it, than it is to the Mu<U+017F>cles, which yet therefore do not make Blood? To this I an<U+017F>wer, that the affluent Blood is <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary here, and <U+017F>o appropriated to the Liver, that without it it cannot be called a perfect Liver; but both the colour, <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance and number of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are <U+017F>o difierent in a Mu<U+017F>cle, and in the Liver, that in no wi<U+017F>e the parts de<U+017F>erve to be <U+017F>aid to be like one another; and what

ab<U+017F>urdity is it to <U+017F>ay; that <hi>a Mu<U+017F>cle <U+017F>anguifies,</hi> when even the Heart it <U+017F>elf by the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomi<U+017F>ts and Philo<U+017F>ophers, is acknowledged a Mu<U+017F>cle.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The Choler is <U+017F>eparated from the Blood in the Liver</hi>; for every one knows, that there can no <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be made, without there be fir<U+017F>t a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                     <p>From all the<U+017F>e Arguments I cannot gather any thing, but that the returning Blood is carried by the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> to the Liver, that it may there be purified, and in <U+017F>ome manner concocted, in which its operation, that the Blood may be rendred more perfect, 'tis carried to the Heart, e<U+017F>pecially when by rea<U+017F>on of its continual and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Pul<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Blood cannot remain long in the Heart: and for this rea<U+017F>on I judge, the whole Blood mu<U+017F>t needs be moved about with a circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Blood made in the Liver, as is declared but now in the eighth Chapter, enters the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and from thence into the Heart.</p>

                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>And thus the Royal Liver, at the <U+017F>ame time, when Kings are taken away, may yet u<U+017F>e a limited power, and may remain with honour in its own Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But what <U+017F>hall we do with the Melancholick Spleen, which makes many laugh? It hath many accu<U+017F>ers, and not fewer excu<U+017F>ers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was never accounted by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Learned <hi>Greek,</hi> a receptacle of the Excrements; or is it any where to be found in him, that he call'd the Spleen another Liver.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great number of Veins and Arteries, and <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>equence the abundance of Vital Spirits, do not permit the Excrements to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hath not any convenient Cavity wherein the Melancholy, Faeculent Juice can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And if you imagine that there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here of a Cavity, its Parenchyma is too thick, and not porous enough, therefore unfit for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <U+017F>o thick a Humor; which al<U+017F>o is never naturally found in it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is too great a Bowel to perform <U+017F>o vile an Office.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In dead men, where Melancholine<U+017F>s hath been the cau<U+017F>e of their death, upon the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Internal parts, there none of them le<U+017F>s recede from its natural <U+017F>tate than the Spleen, the Heart only excepted, whom the Vital Spirits do <U+017F>o greatly defend, that it is le<U+017F>s affected than other parts, which <U+017F>eldom happen to the Inte<U+017F>tines, Kidneys, Gall and Bladder.</p>
                     <p>What is therefore its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi>? It elaborates the Acid Humor, which is very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, but not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>
Excrementitious, and mingles it as a Ferment with the Blood, by which it becomes more perfect, and fitter for Circulation.</p>
                     <p>In my judgment the Salt of the Blood affords matter to this Humor, which it greatly requires that it may not be corrupted; but this Salt which proceeds from the Meat and drink, is never <U+017F>o pure, but that it hath need to be brought to a more perfect <U+017F>tate in our Body. But this is my Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Supreme<U+017F>t of the Kings is the Heart; to this are two others <U+017F>ubject, the Liver and Spleen (I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to make u<U+017F>e of this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in favour of the Ancients) the Heart makes the Blood, the <hi>Liver</hi> repeats the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <U+017F>eparates the Choler; the <hi>Spleen</hi> from its own Salt, by an innate vigor, produceth an Acid Humor, which as a Ferment by the Venal Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Branch, it mixeth with the Blood, to render it the perfecter, and the more fit for Circulation; if any Excrementitious part <U+017F>hould be there <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it is all by the Caeliack Artery, and the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodal Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els <U+017F>ent to the Guts.</p>
                     <p>If it appears to any one to be a contradictory, that by Salt a Humor <U+017F>hould be made Acid, we advi<U+017F>e that per<U+017F>on to ta<U+017F>te <U+017F>ome Spirit of Salt.</p>
                     <p>About <U+017F>ixteen years <U+017F>ince, the great Anatomi<U+017F>t <hi>Franci<U+017F>cus Sylvius</hi> put forth <U+017F>ome particular things concerning the u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Spleen</hi>; he was of opinion, that the Blood was not made in the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles</hi> of the Heart, neither that it was carried from the Heart by the Arteries to all the parts of the Body, for nouri<U+017F>hment-<U+017F>ake alone, but that it likewi<U+017F>e underwent <U+017F>ome other Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the re<U+017F>t of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>cera</hi>'s, particularly <hi>that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52336:145"/>
Spleen further concocts the Arterial Blood, and brings it to a higher degree, yea that it more then perfects it,</hi> <U+017F>o that the Blood in a manner in this place a<U+017F><U+017F>umes the nature of Ferment, by who<U+017F>e means in a <U+017F>hort time, a great quantity of Ma<U+017F>s may become acid; in the <U+017F>ame manner he affirms, that the Blood more and more concocted in the Spleen there receives <U+017F>trength, by which it re<U+017F>tores the returned and weakned Blood, and preparing together with it the Chile, that it may the <U+017F>ooner be turned into Blood: The Rea<U+017F>ons which he produceth for it, are the<U+017F>e:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spleen receives a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood from the Heart, than is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, for its nouri<U+017F>hment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it can be returned back again to the Heart, by no other way than by the Branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta</hi>; for what hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been delivered of the <U+017F>hort Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, are to be accounted but ridiculous Fictions, as may mo<U+017F>t evidently be made appear in di<U+017F><U+017F>ected Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing this Blood is continually mix'd with the returned Blood and Chile in its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Heart, it ought not to be an Excrement; for <U+017F>o the Noble Parts, and the whole Body would not be purged, but the more injured.</p>

                     <p>Tho<U+017F>e which proceed from the Arm, both lie above and under the Veins, until they come to the Subclavial Vein, which they enter about the <U+017F>ame place; where the great Lacteal Vein doth, being furni<U+017F>hed with a particular Valve ju<U+017F>t at their entrance, and <U+017F>o altogether they carry the Water to the Heart.</p>

                        <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of them in my opinion, is to take the <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Water from the Arteries, and carry it to the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the Chile, and Lacteal Vein, by which the Chile being made more Liquid, may the more conveniently be conveyed through the narrower pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, thence to return the <U+017F>ame to the Arterial Blood, making it fitting to <U+017F>erve to the nutrition of the moi<U+017F>t parts, and to the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moi<U+017F>tening of the hot.</p>

to which part of the Drink is mingled, this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is carried through the Glandules of the Chile, and the great Lacteal Vein into the Heart, where it is changed into Blood, which is by means of the Arteries to be conveyed through the whole Body; every part of this Blood nouri<U+017F>heth tho<U+017F>e parts which are of the like temperament with it <U+017F>elf; the Hot part of it nouri<U+017F>heth the Hot; the Dry, the Dry; the Moi<U+017F>t, the Moi<U+017F>t, &amp;c. that which is here not well concocted, mu<U+017F>t be brought back again to be perfected.

                                       <hi>I</hi> Will truly declare to you my Opinion concerning the Que<U+017F>tion I informed you I had moved in the company of <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>icians, which was, Why the Bones
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
which lie under the temporal Mu<U+017F>cles, are not cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inve<U+017F>ted by the <hi>Pericranium</hi> as are the other Bones.</p>
                                    <p>On the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Janaury 1654,</hi> being commanded by the Honourable Senate of this City, to open the Head of <hi>PETER JACOBS,</hi> Brick layer, then was my Opinion, which I had been hitherto big withal, <U+017F>ufficiently confirmed; for as <U+017F>oon as I had ob<U+017F>erved a great depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the upper part of the Skull, I al<U+017F>o found a great quantity of coagulated Blood, which had part of it pa<U+017F>t through the Ears, and part of it remained yet in the Cavity of the Ear; then being very de<U+017F>irous to know the way by which this Blood had de<U+017F>cended into the Cavity of the Ear; which, when I had diligently enquired into, I al<U+017F>o di<U+017F>covered the rea<U+017F>on and cau<U+017F>e wherefore the <hi>Pericranium</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this place the temporal Mu<U+017F>cles, and not the Bone under them.</p>
                                    <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The Opinion and the An<U+017F>wer (which the Honourable and Experienced Dr. <hi>TULPH</hi> Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>ter of <hi>Am<U+017F>terdam,</hi> had given to the propounded Que<U+017F>tion, to wit from whence this Blood <U+017F>hould come, which very often in Wounds of the Head flows out of the Ears?) I found to be true and rea<U+017F>onable; for I perceived, as the Noble Con<U+017F>ul had affirmed to me, that the Blood from the upper part of the Head, did de<U+017F>cend between the Skull and <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and <U+017F>o did enter the <U+017F>pace that is between the <hi>Os Parietale</hi> and <hi>Petro<U+017F>um,</hi> and from thence to be as it was <U+017F>train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a Sieve into the Cavity of the Ear; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <U+017F>earching further, I found the <hi>Os Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um</hi> to be removed a great di<U+017F>tance from the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale;</hi> <U+017F>o that in the place where the Bones did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from each other, was a motion ob<U+017F>erved, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the <hi>Os Petro<U+017F>um,</hi> and ending in the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale,</hi>
                                       <pb n="273" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
there where the Toothy unition in the <hi>Os Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> in the inward part, which is covered with a Callus (as it ought to be in every Articulation) to hinder brui<U+017F>ing, is ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
                                    <p>And this being <U+017F>o, it may be concluded, that the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> if it had inve<U+017F>ted the Bone under the temporal Mu<U+017F>cles, without all doubt it would have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it <U+017F>elf between the <hi>Os Petro<U+017F>um,</hi> whence from its moving and rubbing in eating, <U+017F>peaking, or any other Motion, would haue always felt intollerable pain.

                     <p>This Opinion is indeed judicious, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; for in dead Mens Skuls the upper Bone of the Temple is movable as is the lower; and in the Suture of the <hi>Zygomatick</hi> Bone, is a Cartilage found, which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in every Joynt; for I confe<U+017F>s the motion is little, but greater would not be required than what <U+017F>ufficeth to afford pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the thick Humors, either from External or from Internal Cau<U+017F>es, collected <U+017F>ometimes in the Cavity of the Ear, by the which the Brain and Ears may be freed from many and various incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences: I hope time and diligence will give us greater light in this thing.</p>

A Bubo is le<U+017F>s dangerous than a Carbuncle, and a Carbuncle than the Spots, which very <U+017F>eldom portend le<U+017F>s than pre<U+017F>ent death where<U+017F>oever they are di<U+017F>play'd.</p>

under the Arm-pits, is more dangerous than that in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>Carbuncles on the Hands and Feet, may by <U+017F>ome be thought le<U+017F>s pernicious, becau<U+017F>e they are more remote from the Heart; but <U+017F>ince they happen among<U+017F>t many Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, they are more to be feared than tho<U+017F>e which appear in other parts of the Body which are better covered with fle<U+017F>h.</p>
                     <p>A Carbuncle ari<U+017F>ing after a Bubo, is a <U+017F>ign of Death. If a Bubo or Carbuncle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Fever, there is le<U+017F>s danger than if they follow it at a di<U+017F>tance, and ari<U+017F>e <U+017F>lowly.</p>
                     <p>A blew Circle encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Bubo the <U+017F>econd day after its appearance, is a <U+017F>ign of Death.</p>
                     <p>If a Bubo <U+017F>uddenly di<U+017F>appears, the <U+017F>tate of the Patient is dangerous, unle<U+017F>s Nature di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth the Malignant Humour to <U+017F>ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have often ob<U+017F>erved, that upon the retreat of <hi>that Morbifick Matter</hi> which hath cau<U+017F>ed a Bubo in the Groin, there hath appeared a Gangrene in the Foot, and on the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide which was before affected, and many have by that means e<U+017F>caped.</p>
                     <p>If a Cupping-gla<U+017F>s applied to the Patient, rai<U+017F>eth no Bli<U+017F>ter, we may rea<U+017F>onably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his condition to be de<U+017F>perate.</p>
                     <p>It is an infallible <U+017F>ign of Death, if after Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terization, or the application of a Cupping-gla<U+017F>s, the Carbuncle abates not in 12 or 24 hours, as likewi<U+017F>e if there is no moi<U+017F>ture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it; but if a Bladder appears, or any <U+017F>eparation of the matter be made

(which is <U+017F>o much the better, by how much it is the greater) with a <U+017F>ufficient purulency, <hi>the Patient is then pa<U+017F>t danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Carbuncle which <U+017F>eems to have a little tail, or pu<U+017F>h at the end of it, is very dangerous, as are likewi<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e which look white; which, unle<U+017F>s the Fever doth very much abate, are certain forerunners of Death.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient that hath a Bubo in his Neck, or behind his Ears, be troubled with a pain in his Throat, and a difficulty in <U+017F>wallowing, and no con<U+017F>iderable Inflammation appear, we have always found it a certain Rule, that in this ca<U+017F>e he outlives not 12 or 15 hours.</p>
                     <p>Sleep more <U+017F>ound than ordinary, <hi>Diliriums,</hi> waking often in the night, inflammation of the Eyes, pain at the Heart, a trembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ion of the Joynts, are all very dangerous Symptoms, but do not always portend Death.</p>
                     <p>A great Fever without a pain at the Heart, is not <U+017F>o dangerous as a le<U+017F><U+017F>er, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with that Symptom.</p>
                     <p>The greatne<U+017F>s of the danger may <U+017F>ometimes be judged from the great dryne<U+017F>s of the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>If by the admini<U+017F>tration of <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> Sweat is not provoked, the Patient u<U+017F>ually mi<U+017F>carrieth.</p>
                     <p>A Flux of Blood was heretofore held dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in all Plagues; but in our Age, all that can either bleed at the No<U+017F>e, or have their Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trua's, come off <U+017F>afe: We have no pre<U+017F>ident of any that have pi<U+017F><U+017F>ed Blood; but a <hi>Di<U+017F><U+017F>entery</hi> is the <U+017F>ign of an approaching Death.</p>
                     <p>It is very certain, although it but <U+017F>eldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that incurable Carbuncles do break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eyes, No<U+017F>e &amp; Stomach, &amp; even amid<U+017F>t the Entrails them<U+017F>elves.</p>

I endeavour to ea<U+017F>e the pain of the Head by the<U+017F>e following, <hi>viz.</hi> by applying Ground-Ivy brui<U+017F>ed to the nape of the Neck, and to the <U+017F>oles of the Feet, and palms of the Hands; this, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch like Compo<U+017F>ition.</p>
                     <p>Take Leaves of Rue, a handful and half; <U+017F>owre Leaven, two ounces; Pigeons dung, an ounce; common Salt, half an ounce; Elder-Vinegar, as much as <U+017F>ufficeth to make it into a Poultice, to be applied to the <U+017F>oles of the Feet, and palms of the Hands.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Bolearmenick, <U+017F>eal'd Earth, common white Chalk, of each half an ounce; Vinegar of Marigolds, as much as <U+017F>ufficeth: Apply it as before.</p>
                     <p>To the Forehead I have often applied the Powder of Cloves, moi<U+017F>tened with the Spirit of Wine; for I take Vinegar to be hurtful, as are al<U+017F>o all Emul<U+017F>ions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vomiting and the Hiccough</hi> is another <U+017F>ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Plague. It hath been ob<U+017F>erved by <U+017F>everal who have been <U+017F>o curious as to open Bodies which have died of the Plague, that <hi>Carbuncles</hi> have often appear'd in the Stomach, and among<U+017F>t the Entrails, who<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timony is not to be rejected, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o agreeable both to Rea<U+017F>on and Experience.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e (If they are not the Cau<U+017F>e of the Vomiting and Hiccough, may be ea<U+017F>ily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a <U+017F>poonful of this following Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taken cold every quarter of an hour.</p>
                     <p>Take Mint-water, our Prophylactick-water, of each an ounce and half; Cinamon-water, half an ounce; Confection of Hyacinth, a dram; Salt

                     <p>By the u<U+017F>e hereof, the Vomiting is u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>tay'd, e<U+017F>pecially if the Stomach be <U+017F>ometimes anointed with this following Oyl.</p>

                     <p>Another Symptom of the Plague is a <hi>great Flux</hi> which is u<U+017F>ually a <U+017F>ign that Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth; but when the <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on hath not voided meer blood, nor any thing of a bloody <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, I have <U+017F>ometimes found the<U+017F>e fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pre<U+017F>criptions to be <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful.</p>
                     <p>Let him ab<U+017F>tain from all things that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acid or <U+017F>alt; which except in this ca<U+017F>e, are of great u<U+017F>e in the Plague; and likewi<U+017F>e from drinking much: But if his thir<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o exceeding great, that he cannot bear it, let him take one, two or three <U+017F>poonfuls of this following Mixture.</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>Fraca<U+017F>torius</hi> his <hi>Dia<U+017F>cordium,</hi> two drams Amber, half a <U+017F>cruple; red Coral prepared, Dragons blood, of each a <U+017F>cruple; prepared Pearls, half a <U+017F>cruple; Fennel-water, an ounce; Plantane and Ro<U+017F>e-water, of each an ounce and half; Syrup of Comfery of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> an ounce<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Mix them.</p>

                     <p>Take Roots of Comfrey the greater, an ounce; Bi<U+017F>tort and Tormentil Roots, of each three drams; Oak-leaves, half a handful; Flowers of Balau<U+017F>tians, Red Ro<U+017F>es, of each a pugil; Ani<U+017F>eeds, three drams: boil them in Cows Milk that hath been burnt to; into 8 ounces of Liquor, di<U+017F><U+017F>olve of Venice Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, two drams: one Yolk of an Egg, white Troches of <hi>Rha<U+017F>is,</hi> a dram; Honey of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, half an ounce; of Ro<U+017F>es, an ounce: Make a Cly<U+017F>ter,</p>
                     <p>The Bathing of the Belly with the Lees of white or rather of red Wine, and the applying to it afterward a warm cloth three or four times doubled, have by <U+017F>ome been found to be of <U+017F>ingular benefit, or el<U+017F>e the Ointment and Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter following may be made u<U+017F>e of.</p>

                     <p>And thus much may <U+017F>uffice to have been <U+017F>poken concerning the inward Symptoms of the Plague; the outward are three, the <hi>Spots,</hi> call'd <hi>Petechiae,</hi> the <hi>Bubo,</hi> and the <hi>Carbuncle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spots</hi> can hardly any other way be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter removed than by inward Remedies, but they do u<U+017F>ually portend <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bubo,</hi> I am wont to deal with after this manner following. At the fir<U+017F>t appearance of it, and although the <U+017F>welling hath arrived to no con<U+017F>iderable height, I draw a Bli<U+017F>ter, without making u<U+017F>e of Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, which by rea<U+017F>on that they cau<U+017F>e a great deal of pain, &amp; create a Fever, &amp; draw unto them both the good &amp; bad Humors, &amp; cau<U+017F>e a greater alteration than was before in the Blood, I do utterly lay a<U+017F>ide: After 7 or 8 hours cutting the Bli<U+017F>ter. I apply unto that part a Magnetick Plai<U+017F>ter of Ar<U+017F>enick; the virtue whereof is <U+017F>o great, that I know not any more excellent; which will appear to whom<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <U+017F>hall make u<U+017F>e of it; the account of it out of <hi>Hartman</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> is as followeth.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Magnetick Ar<U+017F>enical Plai<U+017F>ter.</head>
                        <p>Take Crude Antimony, yellow Brim<U+017F>tone, white Ar<U+017F>enick, of each two ounces.</p>
                        <p>When you have beat them very <U+017F>mall, let them be put into a Viol covered in Sand, to which you mu<U+017F>t apply fire till they are all mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; appear to be of a dark red colour; when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
it is cool, it may be taken out of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and this is that which they call the <hi>Ar<U+017F>enical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and hath not in it any thing of Poy<U+017F>on, as it may be ea<U+017F>ily experimented upon Dogs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Gum Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> of the Ar<U+017F>enical Magnet, of each three drams; Turpentine of the Larch-tree, Wax, of each half an ounce; Oyl of Amber, two drams; Dulcified Earth of Vitriol, a dram.</p>
                        <p>Let the Gums be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Wine-Vinegar, and <U+017F>trained through a Linnen Cloth, let them after that be boiled up to their former con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, then melt the Wax and the Turpentine together by them<U+017F>elves, &amp; when you have taken them off from the fire, <U+017F>tir them well till you have brought them to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an Ointment; then add to them the Gums beforementioned, &amp; the Ar<U+017F>enical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, together with the Earth of Vitriol, and Oyl of Amber, &amp; you will have that plai<U+017F>ter which is mo<U+017F>t effectual for drawing forth all <U+017F>orts of Poy<U+017F>on.</p>
                        <p>I have found the virtue of this Plai<U+017F>ter to be <U+017F>uch, that if it be applied to tho<U+017F>e parts where the Skin is <U+017F>omewhat hard, it leaves not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ign of a Scar, and yet doth <U+017F>o plentifully draw forth the malignant Humor, that a <hi>Bubo</hi> of the bigne<U+017F>s of a Walnut, will in the <U+017F>pace of 5 or 6 days be utterly taken away; but becau<U+017F>e it doth not always <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly produce this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is often very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to rai<U+017F>e a Bli<U+017F>ter for evacuation of the Humors. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervable, that in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trong Bodies it cau<U+017F>eth no E<U+017F>car at all, unle<U+017F>s when the Bli<U+017F>ter hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
not only the outward, but al<U+017F>o the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Skin. But in Children, and more tender Bodies, it will of it <U+017F>elf cau<U+017F>e an E<U+017F>car, although there be no Bli<U+017F>ter drawn before the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                        <p>This E<U+017F>car or Cru<U+017F>t is the true <U+017F>eat of the Venom, which is extracted, &amp; is of that thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s (e<U+017F>pecially con<U+017F>idering that the Skin is but <U+017F>uperficially corroded) that it is well worth our while to con<U+017F>ider it. For I do believe that to be the rea<U+017F>on why it is much <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated than other Cru<U+017F>ts or Scars that are cau<U+017F>ed by Art; for in the <U+017F>pace of 24 or 36 hours, if no Scarification hath preceded, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily taken off without any, or at lea<U+017F>t with a very <U+017F>mall pain, if you make u<U+017F>e of any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<U+017F>tilential Plai<U+017F>ter, and add unto it <U+017F>ome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nguentum Ba<U+017F>ilicum,</hi> or el<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the E<U+017F>car may be very much promoted by this Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Take Virgins-Honey, Ducks-gree<U+017F>e, of each an ounce; Soot, <U+017F>ix drams; Turpentine, an ounce; Yolks of two Eggs, Treacle, three drams; Oyl of Scorpions, as much as <U+017F>ufficeth to make it into an Ointment.</p>
                        <p>But if the Tumor is not <U+017F>ufficiently abated when the fir<U+017F>t Cru<U+017F>t is taken off by the Ar<U+017F>eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Magnetick Plai<U+017F>ter, it is requi<U+017F>ite that you create a <U+017F>econd or third, and then proceed as before.</p>
                        <p>The Ulcer may be con<U+017F>olidated by a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter of <hi>Minium,</hi> of White Lead, <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch Remedy which drieth up the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and bringeth the Ulcer to a Cicatrice: But we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve this by the way, that this

Con<U+017F>olidation is not to be wrought too <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, le<U+017F>t part of the poy<U+017F>onous Humor which <U+017F>till remains in the Body, <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which may be fatal to the Patient.</p>

them) <U+017F>hews it <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>everal <U+017F>hapes; but the Symptoms of it are many times very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: It is ea<U+017F>ie to conclude of it when ever it di<U+017F>covers it <U+017F>elf by a little Pu<U+017F>h of a dark Purple Colour, with an Inflammation round about it; but often appears with a White Pu<U+017F>h without any con<U+017F>iderable prominency, which <U+017F>eems to contain a <U+017F>ort of purulent Matter that portends no mi<U+017F>chief; but if you <U+017F>queeze it, you will find it dry and very hard, and it eats very deep into the Skin underneath it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes there appears one <U+017F>ingle Bladder filled with Limpid Matter, which if it be not opened in the <U+017F>pace of 24 hours, it grows black, and upon its di<U+017F><U+017F>ection <U+017F>ends forth two or three drops of black Blood.</p>

If the<U+017F>e grow hard under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and are accompanied with a Fever and Inflammation, there is no que<U+017F>tion but that they are Malignant; and I know not why they may not be reckoned in the number of Carbuncles, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince they are wont to di<U+017F>patch a man in as <U+017F>hort a time as the purple ones; and they are to be dealt with after the <U+017F>ame manner, if we expect that our endeavours <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ucceed.</p>
                        <p>To the Cure of it, it is requi<U+017F>ite that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration <U+017F>hould with all diligence be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby the danger prevented of the Infection di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elf. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e I have found nothing more effectual than an actual Cautery; which hath al<U+017F>o been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by <U+017F>everal Chirurgeons; but there are <U+017F>ome who apprehending it to be too cruel

                     <p>IT is the Doctrine of the Devil to teach that the u<U+017F>e of all Means is to be neglected; who once <U+017F>pake to our Saviour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to per<U+017F>wade him to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the top of the Temple, becau<U+017F>e they need no other <U+017F>ecurity, whom God <U+017F>upporteth by his mighty Hand: but he that hath given us Life and Health, requires that we <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome helps for the con<U+017F>ervation of both; and therefore if you take my advice, I would wi<U+017F>h you to ob<U+017F>erve the Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>When we go out into the Air, either by day or night, we ought to take <U+017F>pecial care that it be clear and free from Vapours.</p>
                     <p>To which intent it hath been in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es very u<U+017F>eful, and found exceding advantageous

                     <p>It is al<U+017F>o very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the Hou<U+017F>es be daily wa<U+017F>hed, which if it be done with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in<U+017F>tead of Water, it is much better.</p>

                     <p>It is u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s and ridiculous to anoint the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trils with <hi>Treacle</hi> and <hi>Mithredate.</hi>

                     <p>An inordinate Diet is very hurtful at all <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, but e<U+017F>pecially in a Pe<U+017F>tilential one.

                     <p>Walnuts are very much commended, and not without good rea<U+017F>on; for there may be very much u<U+017F>e made of them: The green ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, do much good to tho<U+017F>e that abound with Choler; but <U+017F>uch as are come to their full ripene<U+017F>s, whether you take them fre<U+017F>h gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or when they are more dried, all that make u<U+017F>e of them, will tell you that they are very pernicious.</p>
                     <p>The <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Beer, and Wine of a middle <U+017F>trength, are very u<U+017F>eful at <U+017F>uch times, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately taken; but we cannot allow that any, except <U+017F>uch as are very ancient, <U+017F>hould dayly make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>weet Wines, nor of Spirit of Wine and Brandy.</p>
                     <p>Go not forth into the Air with an empty Stomach, but always take <U+017F>ome Pre<U+017F>ervative again<U+017F>t Infection.</p>

                     <p>Vinegar, and all <U+017F>harp things have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by long experience; but they will not well agree with <U+017F>uch as are troubled with a Cough, weakne<U+017F>s of Stomach, or the Cholick, if they are taken either alone, or in too great a quantity.</p>
                     <p>I never had any great e<U+017F>teem for outward means, but tho<U+017F>e that can fancy it, may wear about their Neck this Amulet.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HOw great Ebullition <U+017F>ometimes happens in the Blood, in what ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and with what <U+017F>wift motion it is ca<U+017F>t about every where through the Body, and if an Artery be opened how quickly, and with what force it breaks out, it hath been hitherto treated of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; by which it appears, how nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Blood-letting</hi> is, to dimini<U+017F>h its Quantity, or to <U+017F>top its Career, and how dangerous the Admini<U+017F>tration of it is, if it be performed by a rude and unskilful hand.</p>
                  <p>For it often happening, either by want of skill, or common practice of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> (which makes the Mind fearful, and con<U+017F>equently the Hand trembling and uncertain) that an <hi>Artery</hi> is opened, or a <hi>Nerve</hi> or <hi>Tendon</hi> cut or prick'd, whence follows Swellings, Pains, Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gangrenes or Convul<U+017F>ions, which put the member in danger of being cut off, or render'd u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, I thought it might not be beyond the <U+017F>cope of my Treati<U+017F>e, if, by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52336:223"/>
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew by what means and In<U+017F>trument any Vein might be <U+017F>afely and <U+017F>ecurely opened, (if it <U+017F>well upon a Ligature (though it have an Artery, Nerve or Tendon immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>Fora<U+017F>much therefore as never any harm happens in <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> unle<U+017F>s a Vein be prick'd through or <U+017F>lipping a<U+017F>ide, the <hi>Lancet</hi> be put too deep into the part, the Fabrick of this <hi>Lancet</hi> is <U+017F>uch, and ought to be <U+017F>o put into the Vein, as both may be ea<U+017F>ily prevented.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Lancet</hi> is <U+017F>o contrived, that it is not cutting on each <U+017F>ide, unle<U+017F>s it be near the point, but is purpo<U+017F>ely blunt, and made round on the lower <U+017F>ide, which is to be applied next to the skin, that it may more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>lide over it, as it appears by the following Table, in which.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>a</hi> the <hi>Lancet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>b</hi> the place where the upper edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends in a plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>c</hi> where the under edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends, the re<U+017F>t of the under part being poli<U+017F>h'd round, and thick, (but not made thicker than the upper plain part) that it may not grate or tear the skin (upon which it mu<U+017F>t be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by its compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>Which figure of the <hi>Lancet</hi> differs nothing from a common ordinary <hi>Lancet,</hi> but that the under edge of it is blunted almo<U+017F>t to the point.</p>
                  <p>The way of u<U+017F>ing it is only this, that the Member being tied, and the Vein <U+017F>welling, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:224"/>
                     <hi>Lancet</hi> mu<U+017F>t be applied as near to it as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but <U+017F>o that the <hi>Lancet</hi> may be depre<U+017F>s'd as much as may be; then the Point of it being directed upwards, it mu<U+017F>t be gently, and by an oblique tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Inci<U+017F>ion be put into the Vein: which if <U+017F>o directed, neither can the Vein avoid the point of the <hi>Lancet,</hi> or the parts underneath be any way offended. Which way of <hi>Blooding,</hi> as it is mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>o it will never prove unhappy to any one, though but meanly skilful.</p>
                  <p>And though I do not write this to <hi>Phy<U+017F>icians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> who are expert and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerci<U+017F>ed in bleeding; yet having <U+017F>een many peoples health and life endangered, either by ill Blood-letting, or becau<U+017F>e a good <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> could not timely be called in by <hi>Phy<U+017F>icians,</hi> who mo<U+017F>t commonly forbear the Practice of it, therefore I have devi<U+017F>ed this figure of a <hi>Lancet,</hi> that they may more <U+017F>ecurely and confidently u<U+017F>e it.</p>

<U+017F>upplied with what they needed for their healths; and al<U+017F>o that the Medicines that were wanting or decayed, might be forthwith renewed: an evident <U+017F>ign, and great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tration of the Piety, Prudence, and Care of this <hi>Prince</hi> towards his Souldiers. This <hi>Che<U+017F>t,</hi> as often as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity required march'd with the Camp, and in the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t dangerous occa<U+017F>ions the Souldiers were for the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>uccoured, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted from it. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were carried to the next Cities, where they were taken care of by Phy<U+017F>icians and Chirurgeons, appointed and paid by the <hi>States</hi>: and if by chance any Souldier lo<U+017F>t a Limb, or was lame, he was relieved, and had an Annual Pen<U+017F>ion from the <hi>States.</hi> This Pious and Chri<U+017F>tian Con<U+017F>titution made the Souldiers de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e all dangers, and incouraged them to be both valiant and daring.</p>

                     <p>'Tis very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, both the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould go abroad and travel before they undertake to practi<U+017F>e, thereby to acquire experience, and to learn al<U+017F>o to conver<U+017F>e with the more di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and gentlene<U+017F>s with all <U+017F>orts of humors. And when they come to practi<U+017F>e, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons ought to advi<U+017F>e with Phy<U+017F>itians, who are but lame Doctors, if they be not skilled in Chirurgery; <U+017F>ince this is the third part of Phy<U+017F>ick, from which it can and ought not to

                     <p>'TIs known <U+017F>eldom to fail, that in an army there reigneth <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e or other, according to the nature and con<U+017F>titution of the Country, Air, and Diet. The rea<U+017F>ons are;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> that among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a number of Men, rai<U+017F>ed from <U+017F>o many different places, there are to be found Men of very different tempers and con<U+017F>titutions, <U+017F>ound and un<U+017F>ound; and among<U+017F>t the latter, <U+017F>ome that are <U+017F>cabby, others <U+017F>corbutical, others labouring under venereal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, many inclined to dangerous and infectious Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itian mu<U+017F>t have a watchful eye upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent their <U+017F>preading.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Souldiers in an Army want conveniences wherewith to take due care of their health; but are often con<U+017F>train'd to expo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves and <U+017F>leep in the open Air
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52336:239"/>

Whence is cau<U+017F>ed an inward putrefaction in the blood and humours, which <U+017F>ometimes proceeds <U+017F>o far, as to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume a venemous nature, and to break out into <U+017F>pots, tumors, bubo's, carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Souldiers commonly keep an irregular diet. Sometimes they have plenty and do <U+017F>upperabound; at other times they have nothing; and then being very hungry, when they come again to a place of plenty, they over-feed and <U+017F>urfeit; whence are bred crudities in the Stomach, and corruption, which cau<U+017F>eth malignant Fevers in abundance. Be<U+017F>ides, they often feed upon Meat that is unwhol<U+017F>om, as <U+017F>tinking Veni<U+017F>on, rotten Chee<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>ty Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot but occa<U+017F>ion many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. And when they come to places, where Fruit abounds, as Apples, Pears, Plums, Melons, Cherries, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they over-eat them<U+017F>elves, and thereby cau<U+017F>e Gripings in the Guts, <hi>Diarrhaea's, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La<U+017F>tly,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes the Air is corrupted, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after a great Battel, and <U+017F>laughter of Men that remain unburied; whereby the Air being tainted infects the living that take it in. Which is often made wor<U+017F>e by the exhalations of low and moori<U+017F>h ground, and by thick Fogs.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e are the general Cau<U+017F>es of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Di<U+017F>tempers reigning in Armies; again<U+017F>t which thou art to arm thy <U+017F>elf accordingly. Fir<U+017F>t then be careful in thy Diet; eat not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
greedily and indi<U+017F>creetly every thing that comes to hand; and though it be good, yet eat and drink not too plentifully of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>train thy appetite, con<U+017F>idering how de<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive every exce<U+017F>s may be to thy health.</p>
                     <p>If thou can<U+017F>t and ha<U+017F>t no aver<U+017F>ion from it, drink every Morning of thy own <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rine,</hi> which prevents corruption in the Stomach, opens ob<U+017F>tructions in the Liver, Spleen, Me<U+017F>araic Veins; which if not removed, there will follow Fevers, the Yellow Jaundice, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and difficulty of breathing. If thou art aver<U+017F>e from doing <U+017F>o, eat <U+017F>ome Bread and Butter with Rue on it; or, if it be not hot weather, take in the morning the quantity of a Ha<U+017F>el-nut of Mithridate or Treacle; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>e in Brandy, or rather in Spirit of <hi>Juniper-berries,</hi> <U+017F>ome <hi>Zedoary, Angelica,</hi> and a little <hi>Citron-peels,</hi> and drink a <U+017F>poonful of it in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is corrupted, and there be at hand a Goat, rub thy <U+017F>elf at him, and let not the <U+017F>trong <U+017F>mell keep thee from it. Al<U+017F>o put Quick<U+017F>ilver in an empty Ha<U+017F>el-nut, clo<U+017F>ed up with <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Wax, and hang it about thy neck; or the <hi>Zenechton</hi> prepared of <hi>Ar<U+017F>enic,</hi> (after the manner by and by to be de<U+017F>cribed) <U+017F>owed up in thin Leather; for if it <U+017F>hould touch the bare skin, it would cau<U+017F>e Bli<U+017F>ters and do harm. This <hi>Zenechton</hi> is a Plai<U+017F>ter, out of which are cut pieces of the bigne<U+017F>s of a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which are carried about the Neck, and hang down near the Heart; keeping good a whole year. And when the infection is pa<U+017F>t, this <hi>Zenechton</hi> being reduced to Powder, will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
yet <U+017F>erve to kill Rats and Mice with. It is to be thus prepar'd,</p>
                     <p>Take of Yellow and White Ar<U+017F>enic, of each an ounce, or ¾ of an ounce; of <hi>gummi Tragacanth</hi> ½ an ounce; put this <hi>gummi</hi> in Ro<U+017F>e-water or in common water over night, and it will yield a <U+017F>limy Water. Then beat thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>enic in a Mortar, and put <U+017F>o much of this gummed Water to it, as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to reduce it to a Pa<U+017F>te having the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of Dough; work it well and round it, and then cut off a <U+017F>lice of the bigne<U+017F>s of a Dollar, <U+017F>omewhat thicker; let this <U+017F>lice dry in the Air, and <U+017F>ow it in a piece of thin Leather (well-dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Dogs-skin is the be<U+017F>t for this purpo<U+017F>e;) carry this about thy Neck <U+017F>o as to let it hang down upon, and to touch the place of thy Heart. Some mix with it a proportion of the Powder of dried Toads, which I have done my <U+017F>elf, it being e<U+017F>teem'd more powerful. Some carry about their Necks dried Spiders; <hi>Theophra<U+017F>tus</hi> commends <hi>Celondine,</hi> Leaves and Root, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Remember al<U+017F>o to burn frequently <hi>Juniper-wood</hi> before thy Tent; though all ordinary fires clean<U+017F>e the Air: Upon which account <hi>Hippocrates</hi> advi<U+017F>ed great fires to be made in <hi>Greece</hi> at the time of a great Plague, which was thought to have been remov'd by that means. Some burn only a few Chips of Juniper-roots, or <U+017F>ome of the Berries of that <U+017F>hrub, which is as effectual.</p>
                     <p>If the<U+017F>e means cannot be had, burn <U+017F>ome Gunpowder, ordering it like a Train; this purifieth the Air likewi<U+017F>e. And the volleys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
of <U+017F>hot made mornings and evenings in a Camp, conduce very much to the di<U+017F>pelling of Mi<U+017F>t, and qualifying raw weather.</p>
                     <p>Frankincen<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, Ma<U+017F>tick, and <U+017F>uch other Perfumes as dry and clear the Air, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry u<U+017F>efully burnt; and even a Scholars Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume made of wa<U+017F>te <hi>Paper</hi> is not to be de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>If thou can<U+017F>t get <hi>Rue,</hi> <U+017F>mell often to it: And remember me for this general hint, to take good notice of all Herbs that are green Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer, and which are not eaten by Hor<U+017F>es or Cattel; for they are endow'd with excellent virtues for the good of <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore made to grow at all <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons of the year.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is pe<U+017F>tilential, or breeding any Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, then wa<U+017F>h thy face with Vinegar every morning. If thou can<U+017F>t get <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Elder-flowers, Lavender, Ro<U+017F>es, Marigold-flowers, 'tis the better. Or, if you have the conveniency, prepare the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Acetum</hi>: Take Rue, Elder-flowers, Burnet-roots, white Dittany, Carlina, of each equal quantity; a few Orange or Citron-peels, (of which the latter are the better of the two,) and a little Camphire, and <U+017F>ome Walnut-kernels (the fre<U+017F>her the better,) leaving the bitter skins upon them; put all the<U+017F>e into common Vinegar, and with this infu<U+017F>ion moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ten every morning thy Temples, Mouth and No<U+017F>trils, and the beating Arteries of both thy Wri<U+017F>ts; taking down a good <U+017F>poonful of it, and thou ha<U+017F>t a good pre<U+017F>ervative.</p>
                     <p>If it be cold weather, take Angelica-roots, Zedoaria, white Dittany, <U+017F>ome dried Citron-peels,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
and a little Camphir, infu<U+017F>e them all in Brandy, e<U+017F>pecially in <U+017F>uch as is made out of Wormwood or Juniper-berries. Of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drink in the morning a <U+017F>poonful. But if thou be of a hot con<U+017F>titution, then content thy <U+017F>elf with the former <hi>Acetum,</hi> in which you may mix a little Treacle.</p>
                     <p>Some advi<U+017F>e to take fa<U+017F>ting <U+017F>ome of the Juice of Marigold, fre<U+017F>hly expre<U+017F>s'd out of the Flower and Leaves, as a good pre<U+017F>ervative again<U+017F>t the Infection. This I have not tried; but I have often in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es u<U+017F>ed the <hi>Acetum</hi> of Marigold-flowers, e<U+017F>pecially for a Cordial and Sudorifick, and, I think, with very good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>Or make an Electuary of Rue and Juniper-berries, of each equal quantity, adding thereto a double quantity of Walnuts, with their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skin on them, <U+017F>ome Figs, a little Treacle, and a little Saffron; beat them together in a Mortar, and pour on them, whil<U+017F>t thou art beating, as much Rue-vinegar as will reduce it to a thick Puls or Electuary: Of this take the bigne<U+017F>s of a Ha<U+017F>el-Nut or two, fa<U+017F>ting.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of the greater <hi>Burrdock,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Celondine,</hi> both well cleared, and the Bark of A<U+017F>h; infu<U+017F>e them twenty four hours in half White-wine, and half Rue-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; then di<U+017F>til it, and in the di<U+017F>tilled water mix a little Brim<U+017F>tone-oyl, to render it a little <U+017F>owri<U+017F>h. Of this take two <U+017F>poonfuls in the morning for a pre<U+017F>ervative. But if any be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready infected with the Plague, let him take of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ix or eight <U+017F>poonfuls at a time, and <U+017F>weat upon it, it being a very <U+017F>udorifick

At lea<U+017F>t, drink a little Wine with Camphir and Vinegar, kindling the Camphir and letting it burn in the Wine, <U+017F>o as to let it <U+017F>ink into it; for if it burn on the top, it will there remain <U+017F>wimming: And if the Wine be skinned over with it, kindle it again till it be quite burnt out. Take of Camphir for one draught, the quantity of a pea<U+017F>e; but if thou be <U+017F>ubject to the Head-ach, then Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir will not agree with thee.</p>

Then let him pre<U+017F>ently take <U+017F>ome Sudorifick Medicine, to make him <U+017F>weat; for if the poy<U+017F>on be not <U+017F>peedily driven from the heart, the Patient is lo<U+017F>t. You are al<U+017F>o to take great care, that this Di<U+017F>temper prevail not, and to endeavour to di<U+017F>cover it before the Patient be quite di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled:

                     <p>It is chiefly to be u<U+017F>ed in the hot Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Head; which I have done many a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times. Take of it the weight of about two ducats in common Vinegar, or in Elder-water, or rather in the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Juyce of fre<U+017F>h Sorrel, and <U+017F>weat upon it. 'Tis very good e<U+017F>pecially in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Sickne<U+017F>s and other venomous and infectious Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. To young People you may give a le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity, and proportionably you are to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the Do<U+017F>e for Women with Child or in Child bed, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children.</p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides take notice of the Powder of Doctor <hi>He<U+017F><U+017F>ius,</hi> which hath been u<U+017F>ed with great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and is thus prepared.</p>
                     <p>Take a drachm of Sugar-candy, a quarter of an ounce of pulveri<U+017F>ed Ginger, and a drachm of Camphir; reduce all to a fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; give of it to the infected Patient the weight of a drachm in Vinegar mingled with the Water of Marigold flowers, Scabious or Sorrel, and <U+017F>weat upon it. If you have none of the<U+017F>e Waters, then look that the Vinegar be not too <U+017F>harp, and to that end dilute it with <U+017F>ome Wine and Water. Mean time, though in this ca<U+017F>e I highly value Camphir, yet in <U+017F>tead of Ginger I would u<U+017F>e Zedoary, Saxifrage, Carlina or Imperatoria, or the true <hi>Peta<U+017F>ites</hi> or Butter-burr.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Brim<U+017F>tone</hi> is none of the meane<U+017F>t Remedies in the<U+017F>e infectious ca<U+017F>es; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52336:256"/>
the Body from Putrefaction. Wherefore take of the noble Flowers of Sulphur a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce, being <U+017F>ublimed from Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; add to it one <U+017F>cruple of Camphir, an ounce of the Spirit or Oyl of Cyprian or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Turpentine. Put all this into a Gla<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, lute it well and put it upon hot Sand or A<U+017F>hes, whereby the Oyl of Turpentine will come to open the Brim<U+017F>tone, and produce a red colour like a Ruby, or at lea<U+017F>t as yellow as a high-colour'd Hyacinth. Of this give <U+017F>ome to the Patient three or four times, mingled with a little Treacle, or in Sorrel, Cardobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus, or Scabious-water. This Bal<U+017F>om is excellent al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>ore Brea<U+017F>ts that are growing purulent, taken in warm broth, or in a good Wound-drink. But this mu<U+017F>t be in ca<U+017F>es of no great heat or inflammation, in which it would be dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Among<U+017F>t all the Remedies, which <U+017F>erve again<U+017F>t Infectious Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, that of <hi>Henricus Stapedius,</hi> to be found in my Book <hi>de Pe<U+017F>tilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> is an excellent one, and perhaps the be<U+017F>t for curing as well as pre<U+017F>erving; of which half a <U+017F>poonful being taken fa<U+017F>ting, is able to keep a Man well for twelve hours or more: But if any be already infected, he mu<U+017F>t take of it at any time immediately, to the quantity of a <U+017F>poonful and an half, or two <U+017F>poonfuls, for <U+017F>weating. Which is to be repeated every eighteen or twenty four hours, to make the Patient <U+017F>weat, till he recover, or till the Pe<U+017F>tilential Boyls and Carbuncles break out behind the Ears, under the Arms, or el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. This Water, though it be <U+017F>omewhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52336:257"/>
dear, yet its vertue countervails its price. The older it grows the more vertue it hath.</p>
                     <p>Many have a<U+017F>cribed great efficacy to the Blood of Animals: Thus old <hi>Democritus,</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s <hi>Galen,</hi>) prepared an Electuary of <U+017F>uch Blood, called <hi>Diathaematôn.</hi> Some e<U+017F>teem much the Blood of <hi>Storks,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they eat Toads and Snakes; others value the Blood of Hens, becau<U+017F>e they eat Spiders and other venomous In<U+017F>ects.

If thou art a good Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, have ready a good <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-kernels and Marigold-flowers, taking the greater quantity of Rue; and as you u<U+017F>e it, fill it up again with <hi>Acetum</hi> of Elder-berries.</p>
                     <p>The Rich do u<U+017F>e for their Phy<U+017F>ick in the time of the Plague, the red Hungarian, as al<U+017F>o the Imperial red and gray Powder, Bezoar, Harts-horn, <hi>Antidotum Matthioli, Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Bole Armeniack, Scorzonera</hi> and <hi>Contrayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Species de Gemmis, Diamargariton de Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintho,</hi> and other high Medicines, of which I have largely di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed in my above-cited Book <hi>De Po<U+017F>tilentia.</hi> But I, though I have u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch Remedies among the Rich, yet I content my <U+017F>elf commonly with the plainer

and mo<U+017F>t common Medicines, of which I have more knowledge and experience.</p>
                     <p>The Pickle of <hi>Ebulus</hi> or Walwort, (<hi>alias</hi> Dane-wort, or Dwarf-elder,) which is of kin to Elder; as al<U+017F>o the Pickle of Juniper-berries, are al<U+017F>o of great u<U+017F>e in this ca<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>The Phy<U+017F>icians of <hi>Ausburg</hi> made great u<U+017F>e, in the year 1572. of the red Imperial Powder; the compo<U+017F>ition of which is in the <hi>Augu<U+017F>tan Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>atory</hi> at large, as al<U+017F>o in my Book <hi>de Pe<U+017F>te.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e are the <U+017F>everal means to provoke <U+017F>weat, which I e<U+017F>teem to be of great efficacy for that purpo<U+017F>e upon a <U+017F>udden. And though Souldiers have not the conveniency of a Bed for <U+017F>weating, when they are in a march, and often cannot put off their Cloaths for many nights together; yet let them u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch <U+017F>udo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick means: for, though they cannot <U+017F>weat outright, yet they may fall into a dampi<U+017F>h moi<U+017F>ture, which if it <U+017F>trike not in again, may prove as good as a <U+017F>weat. Yet in this ca<U+017F>e he mu<U+017F>t turn his Shirt: <hi>Quod non facit <U+017F>udor, prae<U+017F>tat id tenuis udor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is to be noted, that 'tis not enough, once only to give a <U+017F>udorifick Medicine to an infected Body; con<U+017F>idering that the venom, like a raging Sea, is to<U+017F><U+017F>ed to and fro every way. And though it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to thee, as if by thy approved Antidote thou had<U+017F>t over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, the <U+017F>ymptoms of it excepted, yet thou art not to tru<U+017F>t in this ca<U+017F>e; for I my <U+017F>elf have been <U+017F>ometimes deceived, and hard put to it to make good what by confidence I had omitted. Wherefore you mu<U+017F>t not tru<U+017F>t
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
to the <hi>once</hi> taking a <U+017F>udorifick Potion or Powder, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch malign and lurking Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, that keep no <U+017F>titch, do indeed fly the fir<U+017F>t time from thy Medicament, and hide them<U+017F>elves under it, but they are wont <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re-appear. Wherefore you mu<U+017F>t repeat the Antidotes, that were fir<U+017F>t admini<U+017F>tred to you, for the time of 16, 18, 20, or 24 hours, according to circum<U+017F>tances, and <U+017F>o long and often, till you judge your <U+017F>ick Brothers or Friends Heart <U+017F>ecured from the infectious Venom.</p>
                     <p>When the <U+017F>weating is over, thou mu<U+017F>t then refre<U+017F>h thy Patient, fir<U+017F>t by drying him well, and next by giving him a little Vinegar to ta<U+017F>te in a <U+017F>poon. The Rich may afford <U+017F>ome <U+017F>lices of Citron, of which <hi>Theopompus Chius</hi> writeth, that the Tyrant <hi>Clearchus Heracleota,</hi> who lived in <hi>Pontus,</hi> having poi<U+017F>oned many People, the vertue of Citron was at length found out, of which a <U+017F>lice being eaten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an effectual Antidote again<U+017F>t it. The <U+017F>ame vertue may be found in a <U+017F>lice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apple; and the <hi>Syrupus de Pomis</hi> is one of the Cordials of our <U+017F>hops.</p>
                     <p>But the thir<U+017F>t, that u<U+017F>es to follow upon <U+017F>weating, will not be quenched with <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter; wherefore take three parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one part of Vinegar, and, if the Patient be not too hot, one part of Wine, mixing <U+017F>ome Sugar therewith, and of this let him drink a good draught, and it will cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h him.</p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides, take <U+017F>ome of the guts of Hens, and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>lices of Radi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>prinkle them with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
Vinegar and Salt, and bind them to the <U+017F>oles of his feet; this will draw away the heat. But let not the Radi<U+017F>h lye too long upon them, becau<U+017F>e it will give a <U+017F>tink that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e the head-ach, wherewith the People that have the Plague are commonly troubled enough without provoking it. Moreover you will do well to tye about his wri<U+017F>ts <U+017F>ome Rue beaten with Vinegar. Anoint his Loyns and Back-bone with the Unguent of Ro<U+017F>es, or with fre<U+017F>h Butter; but if there appear any Spots, forbear to anoint him, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in.</p>
                     <p>You will do well to have <hi>Epithemata</hi> of good things about you, as of Ro<U+017F>e water and Elder-vinegar, to lay over the Heart; with which mix <U+017F>ome Camphir. But if you find any thing of Specks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> broke out, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e no wet thing.</p>
                     <p>Anoint his Heart with Oyl of Scorpions, take the Oyl of Sea-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms and of tho<U+017F>e Earth-worms that appear after rain, of each <U+017F>ix ounces, of St <hi>Johns</hi>-wort Oyl two ounces, of fre<U+017F>h Elder-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms and Rue, each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an half, of the <hi>Acetum,</hi> of Marigold-flowers and Ro<U+017F>es, each about three ounces, of live Spiders forty five: Boil all the<U+017F>e toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the Vinegar be <U+017F>o qualified, that when 'tis thrown into the fire, it cau<U+017F>e no cracking there. Then <U+017F>train it, and in this <U+017F>trained Oyl put a matter of five and twenty Spiders more, of the bigge<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort, and add to it of Camphir di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in the Spirit of Ro<U+017F>es half a drachm; let it <U+017F>tand in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> or upon hot embers for twelve hours, and then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
put to it of Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce, and let them work together. With this Oyl anoint the eight Pul<U+017F>es, <hi>viz.</hi> both Temples, behind both Ears, both Hands, and both Knees, as al<U+017F>o the Heart. And this is an excellent <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to Scorpion-oyl, much u<U+017F>ed by the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides, you mu<U+017F>t refre<U+017F>h and <U+017F>trengthen the Patient with convenient Meat and Drink; I mean with good Fle<U+017F>h or Barley-broath, with a little Vinegar in it to make it <U+017F>avoury to him who will have appetite to little el<U+017F>e, till he have <U+017F>haken off this venomous Di<U+017F>temper; which when he hath done, his <U+017F>tomach will be <U+017F>o keen, that you will find work enough to keep him from <U+017F>urfeiting.</p>
                     <p>Be al<U+017F>o careful to keep thy Patients Body open; if he be ob<U+017F>tructed, u<U+017F>e a Cli<U+017F>ter, or take Butter or Hogs-grea<U+017F>e, mixing a little Salt with it, or, if it be to be gotten, a little Mice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickles, and put it into his bowels. Phy<U+017F>ick at the mouth for this purpo<U+017F>e is not always <U+017F>afe: When the Patient is di<U+017F>charged of the venom, a little liquor of <U+017F>tew'd Prunes with <U+017F>ome Senna-leaves in it will do well for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body. Some fre<U+017F>h Butter eaten in the morning, or melted in warm Broath, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, is wont al<U+017F>o to keep the body <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble.</p>
                     <p>The Drink of the<U+017F>e Patients may be, Water with <U+017F>ome Bread <U+017F>oaked in it; or take of <U+017F>uch Water, wherein Bread hath been <U+017F>oaked, one quart, and a little Vinegar, with two or three <U+017F>poonfuls of Kitchin-<U+017F>ugar, mingling it well together. If you have no Sugar, u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch Water
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
with Vinegar alone: This affords good Drink in malignant Fevers. Among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was drunk by the Souldiers, under the name of <hi>Po<U+017F>ca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may al<U+017F>o take a handful of well cleaned Plantain-roots, and boil them up in three quarts of Water, and then decant the Water, which though it be <U+017F>omewhat bitter, yet 'tis very good in Fevers, and a good Drink in hot Di<U+017F>tempers.</p>
                     <p>If you have Oyl of Vitriol, let a few drops of it fall into clear Water, mingling it well; and you will have a factitious <hi>Sawer-brun</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidula.</hi> But u<U+017F>e no Metalline Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el for this purpo<U+017F>e. With this kind of Water many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been <U+017F>erved in all <U+017F>orts of Fevers; the Oyl of Vitriol, in <U+017F>uch Di<U+017F>tempers, if rightly u<U+017F>ed, being very beneficial.</p>
                     <p>But if a Man <U+017F>hould have with it any Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, in that ca<U+017F>e he mu<U+017F>t forbear acid things, and u<U+017F>e Liquorice, and content him<U+017F>elf with Pti<U+017F>ane. Nor is it at all good to u<U+017F>e acids in Pe<U+017F>tilential Pleuri<U+017F>ies.</p>
                     <p>And <U+017F>ince on this occa<U+017F>ion we mention this ca<U+017F>e, and we having above given warning, not ea<U+017F>ily to blood in Pe<U+017F>tilential Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; yet may Venae-<U+017F>ection be <U+017F>ometimes, upon good con<U+017F>ideration, u<U+017F>ed in that <hi>Pleuri<U+017F>ie,</hi> provided it be done in the very beginning, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be <U+017F>trong and full of Blood. Yet this is not to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the blood, but only to give it vent; but before bleeding the Patient is to <U+017F>weat by taking <U+017F>ome of the above <U+017F>pecified Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient have violent Head-ach, lay on his head Vine-leaves or fre<U+017F>h Cabbage-leaves;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:260"/>
and, if you have no Alabla<U+017F>ter-<U+017F>alve, take two parts of Vinegar, and one part of Oyl of Olives (the Sea-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms Oyl, and Elder-Vinegar were better;) dip long rags of linnen therein, and having well <U+017F>queez'd them again, lay them lukewarm over the face and temples. Even Vinegar alone is good. Of <U+017F>uch Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may make many, of <hi>Acetum</hi> of Ro<U+017F>es, Elder-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms, and the like, with a little Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir. The expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Milk of Peaches is al<U+017F>o very effectual in this ca<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>If at the going off of this Di<U+017F>temper, a hot defluxion <U+017F>hould fall into the Eyes, take Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir and infu<U+017F>e it in water, and often moi<U+017F>ten the Eyes therewith; and if it <U+017F>hould be cold and windy weather, you will do well to keep your <U+017F>elf out of the open Air, and not to let this water dry up in your Eyes in the cold wind.</p>
                     <p>In ca<U+017F>e of having lo<U+017F>t thy hearing, take of thy own Urine, and with it wa<U+017F>h thy Ears within, but withal dry them very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e that moi<U+017F>ture is very noxious to the Ears: And it often happens, that after the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sickne<U+017F>s People grow deaf or hard of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Others put the water of <hi>Carduus-benedictus</hi> di<U+017F>tilled with Wine into the Ears, or the Oyl of bitter Almonds.</p>
                     <p>If thy Throat <U+017F>well, or the Palate of thy Mouth be fallen down, gargarize thy Throat with warm Milk, wherein Figgs have been boil'd, or <U+017F>weetned with Sugar.

middle rind of <hi>Oxyacantha</hi> or <hi>Haw-thorn,</hi> if boiled, with a little Allom di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in the Decoction. If you have the Juice of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, mix a little Honey of Ro<U+017F>es with it, and often take a little thereof. The Roots of Sloes boiled in red Wine, and the Mouth often wa<U+017F>hed therewith, is al<U+017F>o very good.</p>
                     <p>If thou ha<U+017F>t the Squinancy, boil Scabious in Meath, and drink thereof warm, when <U+017F>train'd. Beat Turnips and fry them in Butter or Oyl, and clap them in a cloth round about thy Neck.</p>
                     <p>If thou ca<U+017F>t up blood, take Mou<U+017F>e-ear, Ground-Ivy, Cumfrey; boil them in half Wine and half Water, or in Meat, and Drink often of it. But if the Plague reign not, open fir<U+017F>t a Vein.</p>
                     <p>For a violent Cough, boil white Turnips, well clean<U+017F>ed in common water; throw away this fir<U+017F>t water, pour on other water, and in it let the Turnips boil till they grow <U+017F>oft. Strain this water, <U+017F>weeten it with Sugar, or infu<U+017F>e in it Liquorice cut <U+017F>mall; and drink of it mornings and evenings warm. Or make a Decoction of <hi>St. Johns bread,</hi> and drink it, ab<U+017F>taining from all four and <U+017F>alt things.</p>
                     <p>The bleeding at the No<U+017F>e is al<U+017F>o incident to per<U+017F>ons infected; which is no good <U+017F>ign, though in <U+017F>ound per<U+017F>ons it often frees from the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach and cools the Liver. If this bleeding be too violent, clap Ice-cold water about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Neck, or let him put his <hi>Pudenda</hi> in cold Vinegar.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. Of the Inflammation of the Tongue, its ri<U+017F>e, and concomitants, together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</head>
                     <p>WHen the Tongue is inflamed, the whole <hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagus</hi> or Wea<U+017F>and is inflamed al<U+017F>o, and this from beneath upward, becau<U+017F>e the inward fire <U+017F>ends up its <U+017F>moak all along, as it were, that chimney, which like <U+017F>oot <U+017F>ticks to it, drying and blackning the <U+017F>ame.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Inflammation, much more dangerous, which taking its ri<U+017F>e about the Heart, and therefore is call'd the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Heart, which proceeds from the great inflammation of the orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <U+017F>ituate near the heart, in which is in<U+017F>erted the <U+017F>ixth pair of Nerves, which maketh the <U+017F>aid orifice very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any pain. This part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>eized by <U+017F>o great an inflammation, which is venomous withal, it mu<U+017F>t in a manner harden, and <U+017F>hrink; and this heat is of that extent that, the inner Membrane of the Stomach &amp; that of the Tongue being one and the <U+017F>ame, what befalls the Stomach, the Tongue mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it. Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that if the Gall overflows and pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth into the Stomach, the Tongue pre<U+017F>ently finds the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne<U+017F>s of it: or if the Stomach be full of <U+017F>lime or foul, or the like, the Tongue is <U+017F>oon affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:261"/>There is another kind of Inflammation, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Prunella alba.</hi> This is of the <U+017F>ame kind with the re<U+017F>t, but not of the <U+017F>ame degree; for 'tis not of <U+017F>o dry a nature, as the others are, but commonly is moi<U+017F>t, yet overlays all the Gums, the Throat, and the Wea<U+017F>and with <U+017F>uch a tough white <U+017F>lime, like a kind of Leather, and <U+017F>o covers the Almonds with the <U+017F>ame, that <U+017F>ometimes it can hardly be removed even with In<U+017F>truments. The Tongue is as if it were cru<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with dough, the Gums like an Oven that by the heat of fire is burnt white, the Almonds cover'd as 'twere with white leather, and the Palate of the Mouth likewi<U+017F>e. And in this ca<U+017F>e if the Patient will <U+017F>peak, he lalls and <U+017F>tutters, his Tongue being burthen'd with a load of <U+017F>lime; or, if he make his Tongue wagg, the <U+017F>lime <U+017F>pins out like a thred, and <U+017F>o invades the Teeth as if they were laid over with var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h. And when this varni<U+017F>h on the Teeth grows black (as I have often ob<U+017F>erv'd it to do) and drieth on them, 'tis a mortal <U+017F>ign; of which <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith, <hi>Quibus in febribus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vores circumdentes na<U+017F>cuntur, his fortes fiunt febres,</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 53.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e are the three <U+017F>orts of Inflammation; for which let us now <U+017F>eek out the Remedies, beginning from the la<U+017F>t, the <hi>White.</hi> This is not to be ma<U+017F>ter'd by gargari<U+017F>ins alone, but the hand mu<U+017F>t be employed al<U+017F>o. Take therefore Cotton-wooll, or Flax, and wind it about a <U+017F>tick or rod, and dip this in Vinegar, and rake his Throat and Gums therewith, yet taking care not to make it raw; let him gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari<U+017F>e between, and wa<U+017F>h well his Mouth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52336:262"/>
with Water and Vinegar, or Mul-berry-juyce. <hi>Privet</hi> that grows in the hedges, or the middle rind of <hi>Haw-thorn,</hi> boiled in Water and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vinegar, then <U+017F>trained, with a little Sal-armoniack put into it, is in this ca<U+017F>e an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gargari<U+017F>m; but if there be bli<U+017F>ters upon the Tongue, or el<U+017F>ewhere, then take in<U+017F>tead of Sal-armoniack a little unburnt Allom, and mix it therewith. If you can have the Juyce of Turnips, or the Juyce of fre<U+017F>h Hou<U+017F>e-leek, di<U+017F><U+017F>olve therein al<U+017F>o a little Sal-armoniack, and u<U+017F>e it to wet the <U+017F>tick, wherewith thou clean<U+017F>e<U+017F>t the Throat of the Patient; dipping it often therein, and carrying it about the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula</hi> or Palate of the Mouth; and you will <U+017F>ee lumps come away as big as Pea<U+017F>e. The skin is under this <hi>Prunella alba</hi> fair and red, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whil<U+017F>t thou art clean<U+017F>ing the Patients Mouth, let him often gargari<U+017F>e with the Waters above-<U+017F>pecified, and he will clear his Mouth of the loo<U+017F>en'd lumps. If thou can<U+017F>t get Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce mixt with Honey of Ro<U+017F>es, the Mouth will heal the better; for upon this <U+017F>ort of Inflammation there u<U+017F>ually follows a Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Mouth; and in ca<U+017F>e thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<U+017F>t any <U+017F>uch thing, take Wood-<U+017F>orrel, and the above <U+017F>aid rind of Haw-thorn, make a Decoction of it, and put in it a little Allom, and often gargari<U+017F>e with it. Clean thy Teeth from the <U+017F>lime with Water well <U+017F>harpned with Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>The common Inflammation of the Mouth may be cured with frequent wa<U+017F>hing of the Mouth, taking a gargari<U+017F>m made of Hou<U+017F>e-leek, Lettice, Night-<U+017F>hade, or Self-heal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52336:262"/>
mixing a little Honey of Ro<U+017F>es and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce with it. Of this gargari<U+017F>m the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>wallow a little, thereby to moi<U+017F>ten the Throat.</p>
                     <p>Some take Hou<U+017F>e-leek, and beat it, and put to a pound of it half an ounce of Sal-armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, mixing it well together. And <U+017F>o they put it for <U+017F>ome days in an earthen pot gla<U+017F>ed under ground; then they di<U+017F>till of it a Water in <hi>Balneo</hi> or in Sand: Which is excellent both to drink and to gargari<U+017F>e, though the Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack make it a little unplea<U+017F>ant.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing better to allay this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation than Niter; which is <U+017F>o well known among<U+017F>t Souldiers, that they are wont to give one another Gunpowder to drink, which Powder performs this effect not upon the account of the Coals or Brim<U+017F>tone, but the Saltpeter.</p>
                     <p>For this cau<U+017F>e Experienced Phy<U+017F>itians and Chirurgeons endeavour to purifie Niter for this u<U+017F>e, that it may have the greater effect; and this they do in manner following:</p>
                     <p>They take of the pure<U+017F>t Niter they can get, as much as they think fit; they beat it to a fine powder, and melt it in a large Crucible, &amp; whil<U+017F>t it boils up and foameth, they pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a little powdered Sulphur, and <U+017F>o let it boil together, till the blew Sulphur-flame cea<U+017F>eth; then they ca<U+017F>t in more fre<U+017F>h Sulphur: Which they repeat often, and then pour out the Niter into an earthen ve<U+017F><U+017F>el gla<U+017F>ed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lozenges of it, of which they put one pulveri<U+017F>ed into a quart of limpid water, and <U+017F>o give the Patient to drink of it as much as he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
needs to quench his thir<U+017F>t. Or they give of this purified Niter to their Patients, labouring under this Inflammation, the quantity of a ducat or half a ducat weight in Broath, or in Pti<U+017F>an, till they find the Tongue cleared of its <U+017F>lime.</p>
                     <p>The u<U+017F>e of Salt-petre thus prepared remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth al<U+017F>o the Inflammation of the Heart, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be melted upon Lead, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with as before. For Lead is a con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable cooler, of which cooling quality the Niter, whil<U+017F>t it is melting upon it, taketh in not a little. Let then your Lead melt, and when 'tis melted, di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Niter upon it, and then, to purifie it, ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome Brim<U+017F>tone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as was <U+017F>aid above, till it be clean<U+017F>ed from all impurity; and then give of it to thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient two or three times a day, according as need <U+017F>hall require.</p>
                     <p>Otherwi<U+017F>e, take live Crafi<U+017F>hes and fre<U+017F>h Hou<U+017F>leek, beat them together in a Mortar, <U+017F>queeze out the Juyce, with it mix a little Sal-Armoniack, or a pretty deal of thy prepared Niter; make a Potion of it, and give of it even cold to thy Patient, repeating this <U+017F>everal times, every eight or ten hours once, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>Or, take fre<U+017F>h Lard, (if it be <U+017F>alted, draw it through hot Water to un<U+017F>alt it,) and cut a <U+017F>lice of it two fingers large, and of the thickne<U+017F>s of a knives back; put this into the Mouth of thy Patient, it is an excellent Remedy again<U+017F>t this Inflammation; of which I <U+017F>hall give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on hereafter. I have <U+017F>een wonders done with it. But if thy Patient do rave, then fa<U+017F>ten this <U+017F>lice of Lard with a Thred and Needle to his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
Shirt or Doublet, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>wallow it. Or take fre<U+017F>h Butter, and put it in cold Water, and of it give thy Patient at a time the quantity of a Ha<U+017F>el-nut to hold it upon his Tongue, and let it melt there; which will keep the Tongue always moi<U+017F>t. And if thou work among this Butter <U+017F>ome of thy prepared Niter, it hath a wonderful effect, though the ta<U+017F>te be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant.</p>
                     <p>I promi<U+017F>ed above to explain the Rea<U+017F>on of the Cure of the<U+017F>e Inflammations. When you take a Gargari<U+017F>m of the Waters of <hi>Night-<U+017F>hade, Wood-<U+017F>orrel, Knot-gra<U+017F>s, Endive, Hou<U+017F>leek,</hi> and the like, mingled with Vinegar, you do well, but this is not enough; the rea<U+017F>on is: If you wet a piece of Leather, you make it indeed limber, but when it comes to be dry, it grows hard and <U+017F>hrinks, except you grea<U+017F>e it over with <U+017F>ome fatty matter, and then it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <U+017F>mooth. So it is with the Tongue; though it be made clean with Gargari<U+017F>ms, yet will it become again rough and untoward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome fatne<U+017F>s be u<U+017F>ed: For which cau<U+017F>e I have directed to u<U+017F>e Lard, or Butter mixt with Niter.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Almonds</hi> be <U+017F>welled, thou mu<U+017F>t ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain from all <U+017F>owre things, and prepare a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari<U+017F>m of Figgs, St. <hi>Johns</hi> Bread, Mallows-flowers, Liquorice, Elder-canes, mixing with it <U+017F>ome Ro<U+017F>e-honey, or Juyce of Walnuts, or the <hi>Rob Diamorom,</hi> gargling often with it, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this <U+017F>ymptom is a dangerous thing; for when the Throat <U+017F>wells of it, few Patients do e<U+017F>cape death, e<U+017F>pecially if it be a Pe<U+017F>tilential Squinancy. And in ca<U+017F>e there appear any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

outwardly, take fine Flower, Milk and Saffron, making a Pul<U+017F>e of it; and, to keep it from growing hard, mix with it <hi>Althea-<U+017F>alve,</hi> or <hi>Hounds-tongue-<U+017F>alve,</hi> the Oyl of <hi>blew Violets, Mullein, white Lillies, Camomile,</hi> or the like, adding a little Oyl of Scorpions to it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Make al<U+017F>o a Scraper of <hi>Alder-wood,</hi> if it may be had; if not, other wood will <U+017F>erve, though <hi>Alder</hi> be be<U+017F>t. Throw it into cold Water, and let it lye there, u<U+017F>ing it as often as there is need; yet take heed of making thy Tongue <U+017F>ore or raw.</p>

of the white Hore-hound and Chicory-roots is al<U+017F>o u<U+017F>ed to good purpo<U+017F>e in this ca<U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e things expel al<U+017F>o Worms, if any do lodge within thee; for which may al<U+017F>o be u<U+017F>ed the Souldiers Pills of <hi>Aloe,</hi> called <hi>Maroco<U+017F>tinae.</hi> In this ca<U+017F>e Vinegar of Squills is al<U+017F>o an excellent remedy, taking of it in the morning early a <U+017F>poonful, two or three, and exerci<U+017F>ing after it. It will open the Brea<U+017F>t, and make you expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate phlegm and <U+017F>lime in abundance.</p>
                     <p>If you be troubled with Wind and Gripings of the Guts, be careful to have your Body <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. Boil <hi>Calamus,</hi> cut <U+017F>mall, in Broath, drink of it hot, putting a little <hi>Angelica,</hi> or <hi>Ma<U+017F>terwort.</hi> Do this mornings and evenings, and beware of drinking cold, and ab<U+017F>tain from all Milk, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <U+017F>elf very warm, e<U+017F>pecially about the Feet, which you will do well to bathe with a Decoction made of A<U+017F>arabacca, Camomile, wild Trefoil, wild Marjerom, wild Thyme, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little Salt into it. For your drink, boil Cummin, Annis or Fennel in Water, and now and then a gla<U+017F>s of Wine may do well.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e Gripings may al<U+017F>o be cured with drinking very bitter Wormwood-wine, as hot as you can endure it. This is al<U+017F>o opening. If you boil Elecampane and Orange-peels with the Wormwood, it will have the greater effect. And if you add to it <hi>Allium Sylve<U+017F>tre</hi> (Crow-Garlick) you have an excellent Medicine for this purpo<U+017F>e. This I have u<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf, and found pre<U+017F>ent relief from it, when in a very hard Winter upon a Journey I was taken with the<U+017F>e Gripings. 'Tis indeed a very unplea<U+017F>ant potion, exceeding bitter, e<U+017F>pecially being to be drunk

hot; but the good effects will make amends for that. If the pains <U+017F>hould not cea<U+017F>e after all this, mix with it the quantity of a Ha<U+017F>el-nut of Treacle or Mithridate, and <U+017F>o drink it off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>If you can get Malva<U+017F>y, mix a little Oyl of Olives with it, and drink of it warm. Oyl of <U+017F>weet Almonds would be better, one half of that and the other of Malva<U+017F>y; though the<U+017F>e things perhaps will not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily be had in a Camp. Fre<U+017F>h Butter may <U+017F>erve in<U+017F>tead of Oyl.</p>
                     <p>El<U+017F>e make a Decoction of Juniper-berries, or Laurel-berries, and Elecampane in <U+017F>trong Wine, and drink a good draught of it morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and evenings. Or reduce the Herb <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus benedictus</hi> to powder, and drink its weight of a ducat in warm Malva<U+017F>y or other <U+017F>trong Wine; it will remove the Gripings, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you mix with it a little Zedoary pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>For your Meat, take Larks, if they chance to be in <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, draw them, and fill their bellies with Garlick, and <U+017F>o ro<U+017F>t and eat them.</p>

                     <p>For an outward Application, take the Oyl of Rue and Wormwood, dip Cotton into it, and put it warm to thy Navil. Or beat Onions, and fry them in Dill or Camomile-Oyl, wrap it up in a linnen Cloth, and apply it to thy Belly, where the pain is mo<U+017F>t violent, refre<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it often.</p>

                     <p>If you perceive any Hydropical Di<U+017F>temper in you, make a Decoction of Wormwood and Juniper-berries in Wine, drink every morning a warm draught of it fa<U+017F>ting. You may al<U+017F>o to very good purpo<U+017F>e boil with it Swallow-wort, Burnet, or Succory-roots, adding al<U+017F>o to it <U+017F>ome Annis or Fennel<U+017F>eed. But it will be requi<U+017F>ite fir<U+017F>t of all to purge with Mechoacan and Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb; and now and then to repeat this purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ab<U+017F>tain from Milk, Beer, Fruit, and all raw and ob<U+017F>tructing food. If you knew how to u<U+017F>e Elder, you would have an excellent Purge to free your Body from the Hydropical water, becau<U+017F>e the Juyce of the Roots of Elder pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Hydropical Per<U+017F>ons exceedingly: But 'tis not <U+017F>o <U+017F>afe to u<U+017F>e it, unle<U+017F>s you do it with great caution, becau<U+017F>e a very little of it taken inwardly purgeth both by <U+017F>tool and vomit, like Antimony. Half a nut<U+017F>hel full may <U+017F>uffice. The like effect you'l find in Elder-buds boiled, and then dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with Oyl and Vinegar like a Salad, eating a very little of it. But I advi<U+017F>e you not to u<U+017F>e too much of it; el<U+017F>e it will ca<U+017F>t you into great faintne<U+017F>s.

The Fat <U+017F>ticks to the parts annoyed, to defend them from being further hurt by the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent humors, which running down over it, can find no <U+017F>tay there, and con<U+017F>equently cau<U+017F>e no more hurt to tho<U+017F>e parts.</p>
                     <p>Yet mu<U+017F>t you not put in any grea<U+017F>ie Fat, or any Oyl of Olives, becau<U+017F>e they hinder heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all Oyl, except that of Lin<U+017F>eed, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Hemp and Almonds, is very <U+017F>harp; and you will find, that if any drop of Oyl of Olives <U+017F>hould chance to fall into your Eye, no Juyce of Oranges or Limons is <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the acrimony of that Oyl. But of this Oyl more will be <U+017F>aid in the next Chapter, to which I therefore refer you. If you would have your Cly<U+017F>ter yet milder and more <U+017F>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you may beat a yolk or two of new-laid Eggs, and mix them with it; though I have contented my <U+017F>elf with the Ingredients before mention'd, and found great benefit thereby. El<U+017F>e you may in this ca<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e for a Cly<U+017F>ter the <hi>Cremor hordei,</hi> mixt with yolks of Eggs bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it; which is al<U+017F>o very good to wa<U+017F>h out the bowels.</p>
                     <p>Here is no conveniency of making much u<U+017F>e of Apothecary-<U+017F>hops; el<U+017F>e many things might be pre<U+017F>cribed to lay upon the belly and the navil, as al<U+017F>o divers fermentations, and <U+017F>toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Unguents. You may therefore content
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:270"/>
your <U+017F>elf with tho<U+017F>e plain and ea<U+017F>ily parable means, already deliver'd, and be thankful to God for them.</p>
                     <p>But then you are al<U+017F>o to think upon means to obviate Symptoms of this Di<U+017F>temper, and particularly <hi>Drought,</hi> which is wont very much to torment people in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. 'Tis true, Acid things do quench thir<U+017F>t, but they cannot be u<U+017F>ed boldly, and therefore you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e them with great di<U+017F>cretion and warine<U+017F>s. And as for <U+017F>weet things, they u<U+017F>ually increa<U+017F>e thir<U+017F>t, and do ea<U+017F>ily corrupt, and turn into gall. Wherefore give to the Patient pre<U+017F>erved Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; or if fre<U+017F>h ones be in <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, mix a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them with Honey or Sugar, and give him of it to eat upon white-Bread and Butter. Or plump dried Black-cherries, or dried Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>cene-prunes<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in half Wine and half Water, and let him hold &amp; <U+017F>queeze them in his mouth. Or, if you can, mingle <U+017F>ome Almond-milk with Chalybeat-water, and let him drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and this is both meat and drink. Or let him drink water, wherein Coriander and roots of Tormentil have been boiled. Or boil in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dried <U+017F>lices of Quinces, roots of <hi>Bi<U+017F>torta</hi> or Snake-weed, and burnt Harts-horn, put into it a to<U+017F>ted cru<U+017F>t of Rye-bread rubb'd with Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg, but let it not lye in it above a quarter of an hour, le<U+017F>t the water <U+017F>hould thicken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vi<U+017F>cous. Marmelat al<U+017F>o of Quinces, Black-cherries, and Sloes is proper in this ca<U+017F>e, giving the Patient a <U+017F>lice of it to hold upon his tongue, and <U+017F>o to <U+017F>wallow it down.</p>
                     <p>Further, you mu<U+017F>t learn how to remedy a <hi>Tena<U+017F>mus,</hi> which is more irk<U+017F>ome to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
and, occa<U+017F>ions more trouble to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itian, than the Bloody-flux it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince it night and day painfully provokes the poor Patient to go to <U+017F>tool, and yet to no purpo<U+017F>e. For this I have u<U+017F>ed many remedies, but found almo<U+017F>t nothing more beneficial, than Fomentations of this nature following: Take <hi>Potentilla</hi> (wild Tan<U+017F>ie Silver-weed) Knot-gra<U+017F>s, Mullein, and Oak-leaves, of each as much as you plea<U+017F>e, put them into two linnen bags, and let them boil in Smiths-water, wherein much Iron hath been quenched: Squeeze out the<U+017F>e bags be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two boards, and let them be held alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to the <hi>anus,</hi> as hot as can be endured. Black Pitch, <U+017F>uch as is found on Larch and Fir-trees, put upon a heated fire-<U+017F>hovel, and the fundament held over it, is al<U+017F>o a good remedy; &amp; <U+017F>o is Turpentine, u<U+017F>ed after the <U+017F>ame manner.</p>
                     <p>Again, take a black well-burnt Brick out of the hearth, heat it thoroughly, and wet it with <U+017F>harp Vinegar, and wrap it about with a linnen cloth, and let the Patient <U+017F>it on it as hot as he can endure it. This was the Experiment and Remedy of old <hi>Aetius</hi>; but he reduced the Brick to powder, and by boiling it in Vinegar, reduced it to a pul<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a linnen rag, and applied it to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You may chu<U+017F>e which you plea<U+017F>e of the two.</p>
                     <p>Milk-Cly<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>uch as above pre<U+017F>cribed, would al<U+017F>o be good, but that 'tis not <U+017F>afe with Cly<U+017F>ter-pipes to vex the <hi>anus,</hi> which is already <U+017F>ore enough. Yet you may give a Suppo<U+017F>itory of Deers-<U+017F>uet mixt with <U+017F>ome Oyl of Mullein. And the grey <hi>Diapompholox,</hi> or the white Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire-unguent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
or the like, mixt with it, would not be improper in this ca<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Falling down of the fundament, then let it often take in the fumes of the above-mention'd Herbs, adding to them the beaten <U+017F>talks of Sloe-<U+017F>hrubs, and tho<U+017F>e of red Ro<U+017F>es, as al<U+017F>o Mou<U+017F>e-ear, and Mug-wort. The outer bark of Elder, and of Shepherds-pur<U+017F>e, doth al<U+017F>o well with it. But above all things keep the Patient warm, and let by no means any of the above<U+017F>aid <U+017F>teams grow cold on the <U+017F>ore part.</p>
                     <p>Make al<U+017F>o a Decoction of Garlick, and pour it hot into your clo<U+017F>e-<U+017F>tool, let the Patient <U+017F>it upon it, to receive the hot <U+017F>teams. Be<U+017F>ides, put <U+017F>ome burnt Harts-horn in a linnen cloth, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>trew it upon the fundament, by little and little to drew it up. Or heat an Oaken-board very well, and cover it over with Stags-<U+017F>uet, and let the Patient <U+017F>it upon it whil<U+017F>t 'tis hot. Put <hi>Colophonium</hi> or the Ro<U+017F>in of Pinetree upon a heated Iron, and let the Patient by holding his fundament over it take in the <U+017F>teams thereof, Anoint al<U+017F>o the part with Butter, in which Onions have been boiled; and <U+017F>trew upon it <hi>Album-graecum</hi> very finely pulveri<U+017F>ed. You may al<U+017F>o make a Salve of Ceru<U+017F>e, Bol-Armeniack, Dragons-blood, Stags-<U+017F>uet, Blood-<U+017F>tone, Oyl of Myrrh, or Butter in which fir<U+017F>t hath been boiled broad Plantain, Mullein, or wild Tan<U+017F>ie Silver-weed; and with this anoint the fundament.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Mari<U+017F>ca's,</hi> which do torment Men e<U+017F>pecially, they may be cured with Oyl of Eggs, Salve of red Hounds-tongue, as al<U+017F>o with

the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nguentum Populeum,</hi> or with Butter <U+017F>tirr'd up and down in a Leaden Mortar, till it turn grey or blacki<U+017F>h, Let the Patient drink al<U+017F>o of <hi>Scrophularia</hi> or Fig-wort, infu<U+017F>ed in his drink, this being a <U+017F>pecifick for that evil. Al<U+017F>o the Oyl of Mullein, Elder-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms, Water-lilly, and White-lillies, is an excellent remedy for it, a rag dipped therein being laid upon the part affected. To u<U+017F>e <U+017F>carifying on the lower part of the back-bone, is al<U+017F>o very good, though it be very painful.</p>
                     <p>If the Hoemorrhoid-vein bleed in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, and do not overbleed, it is an exceeding good thing, and pre<U+017F>erves from many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as the Inflammation of the Lungs, Stitches of the <U+017F>ides, the Lepro<U+017F>ie, Melancholly, Quartans, and the like. If the <U+017F>ame vein <U+017F>hould bleed in one that is mad, or di<U+017F>turbed in his mind, or in one that is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Inflammation of the Kindneys, the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>tempers would thereby be allayed. But if it <U+017F>hould bleed too often &amp; too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it weakens much, cau<U+017F>eth a pale colour and the Drop<U+017F>ie. My Collegues and I have often open'd it by Leeches, and thereby found great benefit. But in ca<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould exceed in bleeding, you mu<U+017F>t deal with it as you do with the Bloody Flux, and give to the Patient <hi>Terra Sigillata, Bol-Armeniack,</hi> burnt Harts-horn, and the like ad<U+017F>tringent things. If you can get <U+017F>ome teeth of the <hi>Hippo-potamus,</hi> ra<U+017F>p it into powder, and drink <U+017F>ome of it in red or white wine; it <U+017F>tops all bleeding, of the no<U+017F>e, mouth, guts, fundament, hoemorrhoids, the matrix, e<U+017F>pecially the bleeding of Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivery.</p>

                     <p>Concerning then the Pe<U+017F>tilential Bubo's and Sores, that ri<U+017F>e behind the Ears, under the Arms, and about the Groin, the Cure of them con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts chiefly in this, that they be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd with <U+017F>peed; for which end are to be employed meer emollient and <U+017F>uppurating things. Yet are you to know to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h between Boyls, there being <U+017F>ome of them that are not venomous, e<U+017F>pecially in young people; and they may be hereby di<U+017F>cerned, that at the touch they cau<U+017F>e no pain, whereas the Pe<U+017F>tilential ones are very painful; which are al<U+017F>o di<U+017F>cover'd by the accompanying veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fever, and other pernicious Symptoms.

But <U+017F>uch means have rather irritated the evil, cau<U+017F>ed great pains, and put the Patient to greater danger.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I judge nothing <U+017F>afer and better, than, as I was intimating, to u<U+017F>e <hi>Emollients.</hi> Take then of the common Diachylon, and lay it upon the invenom'd Boyls; and be<U+017F>ides make a pul<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e herbs, <hi>viz.</hi> of Camomile, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Melilot, Dill, Line-<U+017F>eed, Fenu-greek, Althaea, the roots of White Lillies, as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>alve of Althaea, Oyl of Camomile and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, mixing a little Saffron with it, and <U+017F>ome Oyl of Scorpions.

as often happens, then make u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<U+017F>trum Apo<U+017F>tolorum.</hi> But if you can prepare the <hi>Diapalma,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e called <hi>Diacalcithros,</hi> make u<U+017F>e of that.

Among the common Plai<U+017F>ters for <U+017F>uch evils is the brawn <hi>Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> one of the be<U+017F>t. El<U+017F>e you may prepare this Ointment which follows: Take the middle rind of Elder, and St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, boil them in Oyl, putting a little Wine to it, and <U+017F>o let it boil up till the Wine be boiled away; then take it off from the fire, and let it cool; this done, <U+017F>tir a little Turpentine among<U+017F>t it, and a Yolk or two of Eggs, according as you make a greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity; mixing with it a little Allum and Vitriol, (the white is the be<U+017F>t,) <U+017F>tir all well together, and apply it to the Ulcer, and make a bandage, and cover it as u<U+017F>ually. For a good Drawing-plai<U+017F>ter,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52336:276"/>
take Ro<U+017F>in, Bees-wax and Oyl-Olive; the quantity of the Ro<U+017F>in mu<U+017F>t be but the half of the Wax: Let them melt together, and <U+017F>tir among<U+017F>t it <U+017F>ome Tartar exqui<U+017F>itely powder'd. U<U+017F>e not much of fatty things to <U+017F>uch Ulcers. I have had under my care <U+017F>uch Ulcers, that were to be healed with only dry things, as with <U+017F>trewing in of <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and the red Earth of Vitriol, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>For this rea<U+017F>on the antient Phy<U+017F>icians and Chirurgeons invented a dry Stone, which they kept <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, that they called it <hi>Lapis Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophorum</hi>; which is ea<U+017F>ily made, as followeth: Take Allum, Hungarian Vitriol, of each one pound, beat them to powder, and mix them well together; then put all into a gla<U+017F>ed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, and pour upon it two quarts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, boil them together, and <U+017F>tir them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> taking off the <U+017F>cum: When 'tis boiled in, put to it an ounce of <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> an ounce and a half of Ceru<U+017F>e, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce of Camphir, all finely powder'd, <U+017F>tirring it well about; la<U+017F>tly, put it to a quart of <U+017F>harp Vinegar, and boil all together to a <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence; which reduce to powder, and of it <U+017F>trew a little into the Ulcer, or let <U+017F>ome of it di<U+017F><U+017F>olve in a convenient Liquor, and wa<U+017F>h the Ulcer therewith, or dip <U+017F>ome Linnen raggs in it, and lay it over the place.</p>
                     <p>'Tis al<U+017F>o prepared this way: Take green and white Vitriol, of each a drachm; of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> Ceru<U+017F>e, Bol-Armeniack, of each two ounces and a half; of Sal-Armoniack an ounce. Beat them all to powder, put them in an earthen pot, mingle and <U+017F>tir them together

in Vinegar, to be a thick pul<U+017F>e; then put your pot upon a hot Charcoal-fire, to let it grow red hot, <U+017F>o as that the matter be reduced to a <U+017F>tony con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence; of which di<U+017F><U+017F>olve about half an ounce in half a pint of Water, dip Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen raggs into it, and put it twice a day upon the Ulcer. 'Tis al<U+017F>o very good for purulent Brea<U+017F>ts.</p>
                     <p>I was <U+017F>peaking above of <hi>Lavements</hi>: The<U+017F>e you may prepare of all <U+017F>orts of Wound-herbs, by boiling Con<U+017F>ound, Bugle; Fluellin, Ground-Ivy, Yarrow, Snake-weed, Avens, Ar<U+017F>mart; you may al<U+017F>o, again<U+017F>t putrefaction and the <U+017F>ettling of purulent matter, mix <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little Myrrh, or <hi>Aloes Epatica,</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincen<U+017F>e, Ma<U+017F>tick, quick Brim<U+017F>tone, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, Niter, Allum, Vitriol, or the like. Nor is it needful to bind your <U+017F>elf to this or that preci<U+017F>ely, but you may take <U+017F>uch of them as you can get.</p>
                     <p>I have a peculiar Ulcer-<U+017F>alve, which I call <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nguentum Decameron,</hi> being made of ten <U+017F>orts of Juices. Of the<U+017F>e the principal is the Juice of <hi>Per<U+017F>icaria,</hi> (Ar<U+017F>mart;) to which are added the Juices of Ground<U+017F>el, Tobacco, Yarrow, <U+017F>harp-pointed Dock, Cranes-bill, broad and pointed Plantain, Centory, St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, and Celondine. The<U+017F>e Juices mu<U+017F>t be well <U+017F>trained, and then kept for <U+017F>ome days in gla<U+017F><U+017F>es or gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to <U+017F>ettle, and then very gently pour off the clear from the <U+017F>ediment. Which done, boil them with fre<U+017F>h Butter, and <U+017F>ome good Licori<U+017F>h newly <U+017F>craped, as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Tormentil and Cumfrey, adding a little red Hounds-tongue Salve and Oyl of Myrrh, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
Deer-<U+017F>uet: Let all be boiled together, till the cracking cea<U+017F>e, and the Juice be boiled in. Then <U+017F>train it through a Linnen Cloth; and add to it <U+017F>ome Venice-Turpentine, Gum <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> and a little Bees-wax, both the latter melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each a part. Of the Wax there needs no more than to bring the Salve to a due con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Then is this Unguent prepared, to which may be added a little refined Verdigrea<U+017F>e, which will make it perfect. It is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in foul Wounds, for both clean<U+017F>ing and healing; as experience will <U+017F>hew.</p>
                     <p>A Chirurgeon, in meeting with Ulcers, is to ob<U+017F>erve well the purulent matter that i<U+017F><U+017F>ues, <U+017F>ince he may from thence learn the condition of the evil, whether it proceed from foul Blood, Gall, corrupt Phlegm, or Adu<U+017F>t Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. If the evil grow wor<U+017F>e, and the Humors of the Body force their way copiou<U+017F>ly thorow, then beware, and withal exhort the Patient to purge, or to <U+017F>weat with taking <U+017F>ome Sa<U+017F><U+017F>afra<U+017F>s, or the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sanies</hi> or matter that is thick, white, and well dige<U+017F>ted, is the be<U+017F>t; but when there runs but a <U+017F>harp water out of the Ulcer, this is not good, and is withal painful. Which to obviate, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e Litharge, Ceru<U+017F>e, and the like; putting al<U+017F>o beaten Lead upon the place, and clean<U+017F>ing the fi<U+017F>tulat holes with Lead-oyl, qualifying its <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s with Oyl of Eggs. This Lead-oyl is made two ways, the the one out of Ceru<U+017F>e, which is green; the other out of Litharge, which is yellow or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>h Both are prepared with Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Boil <hi>Celondine</hi> in wine, and with this wine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
you may al<U+017F>o clean<U+017F>e the Ulcer with good effect. Mix afterwards a drachm of Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grea<U+017F>e with about four ounces of the Juyce of Ground-Ivy; u<U+017F>e it with wiecks or raggs dipt therein for the foul Ulcer-holes.</p>
                     <p>Burn Oy<U+017F>ter-<U+017F>hells to powder, and u<U+017F>e it for old Ulcers that need clean<U+017F>ing, which this powder will well perform by rea<U+017F>on of the Salt that is in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hells. You may <U+017F>ometimes have occa<U+017F>ion al<U+017F>o of the <hi>Mercurius praecipitatus,</hi> or the <hi>Mercurius dulcis Co<U+017F>meticus.</hi> If you can prepare this you have a good Remedy.</p>
                     <p>As for hard Knobs and Boyls, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly owing their ri<U+017F>e to the Venereal Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e are not <U+017F>o proper for this place. However you may make a plai<U+017F>ter again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch Knobs of the phlegm of Althaea or Mar<U+017F>h-mallows, Gummi Ammoniac, Galbanum, Turpentine, Myrrh, Mi<U+017F><U+017F>el-toe of the oak, mixing a little Bee-wax therewith and <U+017F>ome Oyl of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms. If you will have it <U+017F>tronger, mix with it Gumm Elemi, Tacamahaca or Carana. But this can only be compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the rich men; the poor mu<U+017F>t be content with the Melilot-plai<U+017F>ter, mixt with Saffron and the Oyl of Mullain or Dill. You may al<U+017F>o prepare for <U+017F>uch Patients a Salve of Fox-oyl, Dill-oyl, Turpentine, Man-grea<U+017F>e, and the like, mixing therewith <U+017F>ome Oyl of Earth-worms and the Oyl of Mullain-flowers, Camomil and white Lillies.</p>

For, although in every Camp, yea in every Regiment, and even in every Company there ought to be one or more Chirurgeons; yet becau<U+017F>e in a battle, or the <U+017F>torming of a <U+017F>trong-hold, there may be wounded a very great number of men, who, by rea<U+017F>on of the multitude, cannot all be dre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed by the Chirurgeons, every common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that is <U+017F>ound and unhurt, is obliged to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t his fellow, con<U+017F>idering it may <U+017F>oon be his own ca<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place then, refre<U+017F>h thy fellow that is wounded, with wine, cold water, vinegar, or the like; then place him in a right po<U+017F>ture. For, if the wounds be in the head or about the brea<U+017F>t, you ought to lay him high with his head and <U+017F>houlders, that <U+017F>o the blood may <U+017F>ink down from the places wounded. If his legg be hurt, put it <U+017F>o that it may not hang downwards, and thereby the afflux from the body be prevented, which otherwi<U+017F>e might cau<U+017F>e a tumour. If the wounds be in the middle of the body, then place him

                     <p>If any one do bleed <U+017F>o copiou<U+017F>ly, that it is not ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>topp'd, and the Patient is in danger<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> then receive of his blood in an Iron pan, and letting it run about therein, hold it over the fire till it be dry and between your fingers fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to powder; of which <U+017F>trew <U+017F>ome into the bleeding wound, and it will <U+017F>top it. But of this ca<U+017F>e more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The wound being clean<U+017F>ed, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>tayed, take fine linnen-raggs, burn them as you are wont to do for tinder, and quench it in Oyl of Olives; and put <U+017F>ome of it into the wound, If you have no plai<U+017F>ter at hand<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> take a <U+017F>lice of un<U+017F>alted lard and lay it on. If that be al<U+017F>o wanting, dip a pledget of linnen-raggs in warm wine, and being wrung out very dry, lay it upon the wound, and a dry bandage over it, that <U+017F>o the moi<U+017F>t pledget may long keep warm. Though in <U+017F>uch wounds, as are apt to bleed much, warm bandages are often to be avoided, and <U+017F>ometimes (but with <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care and di<U+017F>cretion) cold bandages to be u<U+017F>ed, if the hurt be not in the brain, brea<U+017F>t or bowels. Whence old <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath this Aphori<U+017F>m: <hi>Frigido verò in iis locis utendum, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
<U+017F>anguis aut fluit aut fluxurus e<U+017F>t.</hi> Yet this mu<U+017F>t be done with great caution, le<U+017F>t in the place affected there <U+017F>hould follow a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</p>
                     <p>After this, take Oyl of Olives and Wine, beat them well together, and warm the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; dip it in Linnen pledgets, wring them dry, and lay them on warm with a dry ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage over it. This mu<U+017F>t de done once every hour, or every two hours, nor let this care and labour <U+017F>eem irk<U+017F>om to you, for it will have a good effect.</p>
                     <p>This Dre<U+017F>s is almo<U+017F>t the only thing, which the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Maltha</hi> make u<U+017F>e of at Sea to heal their wounds; for the Oyl allays the pain and the <U+017F>welling, as the Wine clean<U+017F>eth, and the<U+017F>e two together cau<U+017F>e healing. Whence the <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Go<U+017F>pel is <U+017F>aid to have poured only Oyl and Wine into the wounds of him, that was fallen among Thieves. You may therefore make out of the<U+017F>e two a Wound-<U+017F>alve that may be equivalent to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t every common Wound-bal<U+017F>om, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take one part of Oyl-olive, and two parts of Wine, boil them together till the Wine be boiled in, and the Oyl, when any is thrown into the fire, cracks no more; and you have a Wound-oyl according to wi<U+017F>h: Put of it with fine Linnen <U+017F>havings into the wound, and it will, for a plain Remedy, do marvels.</p>
                     <p>You may al<U+017F>o melt Lard un<U+017F>alted, mix it with Honey and Rye-flower, and <U+017F>o make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Salve, which, though plain and <U+017F>imple, may when put upon the Wound, have as good an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
effect, as many Plai<U+017F>ters that are in great e<U+017F>teem.</p>
                     <p>Otherwi<U+017F>e, for a very good Wound-<U+017F>alve, take of the be<U+017F>t <hi>Aloes</hi> cleanly pulveri<U+017F>ed the weight of a ducat, mingle and <U+017F>tir it with half an ounce of fine Honey; melt afterwards by it <U+017F>elf half an ounce of Deer-<U+017F>uet, and <U+017F>tir it among the other Ingredients: Thus you have a good Salve again<U+017F>t the putrefaction of wounds, and for the a<U+017F><U+017F>waging of their pains, as al<U+017F>o for healing them, if you duly apply it to the wound: If you'l add to it a little Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus-Turpentine with the Yolk of an Egg, you may.</p>
                     <p>The black Wheel-grea<U+017F>e in a time of need is al<U+017F>o a good Wound-<U+017F>alve, and is only de<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed becau<U+017F>e of its plainne<U+017F>s. When you u<U+017F>e it, lay only over it the leaves of Snake-weed, or of pointed Plantain.</p>
                     <p>But by all means keep the wound clean, and let not many look into it, for fear they <U+017F>hould by their breath annoy it; <U+017F>ome being fa<U+017F>ting, others having eaten one thing, others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But e<U+017F>pecially admit not many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when you open the wound for clean<U+017F>ing and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it. But above all things take care to exclude the Air as much as is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible from the open'd wound, e<U+017F>pecially if any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Nerve be hurt. Take notice, that Carpenters and Joyners, when they have hurt them<U+017F>elves, do almo<U+017F>t by this only means of well clo<U+017F>ing their wounds, and keeping out the Air, heal them<U+017F>elves. They take a very thin chip, and lay upon it <U+017F>ome of the Glue, wherewith they joyn together the Boards of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
their work, and this they apply to the wound, fir<U+017F>t well clean<U+017F>ed, and let it lye on, till it fall off of it <U+017F>elf, and the wound is healed. But this will not do in ca<U+017F>e any Bones be hurt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Honey and the Du<U+017F>t-flower of the Mills, fre<U+017F>h Butter and Bol-armeniack, and knead it well together, without any fire, until it be as thick as a Plai<U+017F>ter, and this laid on is very good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Cumphrey well clean<U+017F>ed, cut it <U+017F>mall, add to it one or two of the Vulnerary Herbs, <U+017F>uch as you may meet with in the field, as <hi>Pyrola</hi> or Winter-green, Yarrow, Plantain, Fluellin, Orpin, Con<U+017F>ound, Sanicle, Bugle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Boil this in Lin<U+017F>eed-oyl and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine, until the Wine is boiled away; and this being <U+017F>trained, put to it <U+017F>ome raw Honey and one or two well beaten yolks of Eggs, (according to the quantity you make) and a little Turpentine, and <U+017F>o thru<U+017F>t it, with <U+017F>ome Hemp or Flax dip in it, into the wound.</p>
                     <p>Lime-water is one of the <U+017F>imple<U+017F>t or plaine<U+017F>t Remedies, but healeth admirably well. Take only <U+017F>ome un<U+017F>laked Lime, pour on it clear Water, and let it <U+017F>tand upon it till the Lime be fallen to the bottom: Wa<U+017F>h the wound with it, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are old running Sores, and you'l find a wonderful effect.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e plain means may be u<U+017F>ed, in ca<U+017F>e you want a Chyrurgeon, taking the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of your Fellow-<U+017F>ouldier in the application; though tho<U+017F>e very Remedies may challenge a place among the mo<U+017F>t chargeable ones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed and applied by Ma<U+017F>ters. And provided the Chyrurgeon do not under-value the<U+017F>e my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
plain and cheap Remedies, but receive them thankfully, I am ready here to teach him <U+017F>ome ways, hitherto concealed by me, which I <U+017F>cruple to keep any longer from publick knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Know then fir<U+017F>t, that to a Phy<U+017F>ician belongs al<U+017F>o the knowledge of Chirurgery, as a third part of the Art of Medicine, the other two being the <hi>Pharmaceutica,</hi> pre<U+017F>cribing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for inward Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the <hi>Diatetica,</hi> ordering the Patients Diet and other nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I have my <U+017F>elf, whil<U+017F>t I practi<U+017F>ed Phy<U+017F>ick, dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in Camps many wounds with my own hands and cured them, carrying always my Chirurgical <hi>apparatus</hi> about me, without any di<U+017F>paragement to my Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion; imitating herein the Examples above-alledged, of <hi>Podaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> two of the chief Phy<U+017F>icians of the Antients in the Army before <hi>Troy,</hi> who were not at all a<U+017F>hamed to practi<U+017F>e Chirurgery, and to attend the cure of wounded Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Fir<U+017F>t of all then, con<U+017F>ider well, whether the wound be mortal or no. Next, what limb or part it is that hath received the wound: The wounds in the Head are commonly the mo<U+017F>t dangerous, by rea<U+017F>on of the Symptoms inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, as the Apoplexy, Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s or other Convul<U+017F>ions, the Pal<U+017F>ey and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Limbs by rea<U+017F>on of the hurt Nerves, as al<U+017F>o Phren<U+017F>y, lo<U+017F>s of Hearing and Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are wont to be con<U+017F>equent, according as the re<U+017F>pective Nerves have been <U+017F>truck or wounded. If the Brea<U+017F>t be any where wounded, great care al<U+017F>o is to be had, and the means mu<U+017F>t be directed to prevent purulency,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
(which that place, by rea<U+017F>on of the heat there, is <U+017F>ubject to,) and to heal the <hi>Pleura</hi> or the inner Membrane of the Ribbs; the like is to be done concerning the Diaphragme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ought al<U+017F>o to ob<U+017F>erve, what kind of wound it is you have to do with, whether any Bone, any Nerve or Artery be hurt; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a meer fle<U+017F>h-wound, and the like. If it be a gaping wound, you mu<U+017F>t, if it hath taken cold from the Air, bathe it with warm Wine, and keep it very clo<U+017F>e; and make u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>trong a<U+017F>tringent Plai<U+017F>ter, prepared of Ro<U+017F>in, Gumm Elemi, Turpentine, Pitch, with <U+017F>ome Ma<U+017F>tick, Frankincen<U+017F>e, <hi>Sarcocolla,</hi> as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Blood-<U+017F>tone, Mummy, and <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis</hi> mixt therewith, and keep all on carefully with a good bandage, which is a great matter in all wounds. For, <U+017F>ome months <U+017F>ince, I had a Patient under my cure, who<U+017F>e Skull in the place of one of its futures was <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, <U+017F>o as that I found a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>pace between the two parts <U+017F>eparated. I order'd a Chirurgeon of my particular acquaintance to draw tho<U+017F>e parts forcibly together with good bandages; which being well done, I cau<U+017F>ed his Hair to be <U+017F>horn away, and an a<U+017F>tringent Plai<U+017F>ter to be applied, which was almo<U+017F>t like a Rupture-plai<U+017F>ter: whereby in three or four weeks, to the admiration of many, my Patient was perfectly healed. This plai<U+017F>ter was the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> mixt wit Gumm <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> and with a little <hi>Ceratum de Betonica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be provided with good Blood-<U+017F>taunching remedies. The common ones are, <hi>Bol-armeniac, Sheep-trickles, Blood-<U+017F>tone, Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
Terra Sigillata, Mill-du<U+017F>t, Hares-hair, Peacocks-dung, &amp;c.</hi> Avoid by all means Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticks, e<U+017F>pecially Sublimat<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Ar<U+017F>enic, Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; with which you anger a wound, and ca<U+017F>t the Patient into very dangerous <U+017F>ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: For, though they may by their corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s at fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F>tringe the wound, yet they do afterwards <U+017F>o fret and eat it, that you would think, hell-fire were in it. Beware al<U+017F>o of a hot Iron, which many have a refuge to as to a Ma<U+017F>ter-piece and the la<U+017F>t remedy.</p>
                     <p>Among the chief A<U+017F>tringents, is <hi>Frog-<U+017F>pawn</hi>; which therefore you are, when 'tis in <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, to make good provi<U+017F>ion of, for the whole year. Take therefore in the Spring a lump of raggs, and dip it into Smiths-water, in which fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome crude Allum hath been di<U+017F><U+017F>olved. Let this lump be dried again, and then draw it thorough the Spawn of Frogs, <U+017F>o as that the Spawn may every where hang on it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e it to the Air to dry; and afterwards draw the <U+017F>ame again thorough Frog-<U+017F>pawn: Which repeat as often as you can, during the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of Frog-<U+017F>pawn; for the oftner you dip the raggs into it, the more vertue they will receive. This Spawn <U+017F>tauncheth bleeding, with a good bandage. I have often u<U+017F>ed with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s the di<U+017F>tilled water of Frog-<U+017F>pawn in the bleeding of the No<U+017F>e, fir<U+017F>t mixt with crude Allum, and then drawn up into the No<U+017F>trils. Take a green Frog, burn him in a pipkin, not to a<U+017F>hes, but <U+017F>o as to be reducible to powder: This powder put into a <U+017F>mall Taffaty-bagg, and hang it about the neck of a woman that floods exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively; and <U+017F>he will find great help from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>Having often made mention of Allum, which is one of the chief remedies for <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of blood, I will make publick the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery of Allum,</hi> which I have hitherto kept <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Take then of the be<U+017F>t and cleare<U+017F>t Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum as much as you plea<U+017F>e; pulveri<U+017F>e it, and put the powder into an Oxe-or Swines-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, tying it very clo<U+017F>e; Then throw it into a kettle of hot water, and the Allum will be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved; this Solution bring over the helm out of a low retort, until the Allum get a <hi>caput mortuum</hi>; then cea<U+017F>e to urge the fire any more, le<U+017F>t you force corro<U+017F>ive <U+017F>pirits from it, which are noxious to our pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e. This <hi>caput mortuum</hi> put again into a bladder, and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it as before; and do this <U+017F>o long, until the whole body of your Allum be brought over the helm. But you mu<U+017F>t filter the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>olution for fear of any du<U+017F>t or other heterogeneous matter mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>This is the Magi<U+017F>tery of Allum, able to draw the veins together without corro<U+017F>ion. Apply this to wounds, or any other bleeding part. You may mix with it Tragacanth, Gummi Arabick, <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> and well-beaten Whites of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Take good notice, whether the wounded Patient have heated him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>torming a place, or by any other military execution, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be yet di<U+017F>temper'd by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for as long as this la<U+017F>ts, the blood is in a rage, and can hardly be <U+017F>topped. In this ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>top the wound with Peacocks dung; and take Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Whites of Eggs well beaten together, a little Allum, and refined Salt-peter<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> put to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>
it as much Frog-<U+017F>pawn, Shepherds-pur<U+017F>e, broad Plantain, or other convenient water, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary; <U+017F>o that there may be three parts of water and one part of vinegar; dip pledgets into it, and clap them cold to the wound, and the bleeding will cea<U+017F>e,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> al<U+017F>o is an excellent <U+017F>tauncher of blood, to be u<U+017F>ed both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. For inwardly it cureth the Bloody Flux and other Fluxes; and outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to wounds and <U+017F>trewed into them, it clo<U+017F>eth the veins. But it mu<U+017F>t not be prepared with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or di<U+017F>tilled Vineger, or any corro<U+017F>ive thing, but only by the heat of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberating furnace; and afterwards di<U+017F>til often from it <U+017F>ome proper water, as of <hi>Ro<U+017F>es, Speed-well, Self-heal</hi> or broad <hi>Plantain,</hi> after which preparation it is divers times to pa<U+017F>s again through a reverberating furnace, until it grow as light as a down-feather: And then 'tis fit for our purpo<U+017F>e; for as long as it is <U+017F>trong and heavy, the body of it is not throughly opened.</p>
                     <p>Among other things, you may make u<U+017F>e of the Red earth of Vitriol; which is to be thus prepared: Take Vitriol, as much as you plea<U+017F>e, put it in a new ungla<U+017F>ed pipkin, into a Potters oven, to deprive it of its moi<U+017F>ture, and to reduce it to a <hi>Colcothar</hi>: Then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri<U+017F>e this calcined Vitriol, and in a large gla<U+017F>ed earthen di<U+017F>h pour hot water on it, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o for four or five hours; then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the water, and pour other hot water upon it, as before, repeating this three, four, or five times, until all the <U+017F>alt be got out of the <U+017F>aid <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar</hi>;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
which whether it be done, may ea<U+017F>ily be found by the ta<U+017F>te. Then dry this red dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Earth, and it will prove a very good blood-<U+017F>taunching medicine; which may al<U+017F>o in other ca<U+017F>es be variou<U+017F>ly u<U+017F>ed; as you'l find it hereafter of great u<U+017F>e in my plai<U+017F>ter for wounds made by thru<U+017F>ting.</p>
                     <p>The water you had poured on this <hi>Colcothar,</hi> you ought not to throw away as u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, but to put it by; and, for other occa<U+017F>ions, you may boil it away, and it will leave a Salt behind, as white as <U+017F>now, with which you may do wonders in foul Sores. I have u<U+017F>ed it with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es; in which it clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth and maketh a firm ground for new and good fle<U+017F>h to grow upon. For, though there be many things, that clean<U+017F>e Sores, yet they leave the fle<U+017F>h loo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>pungy; but this is both a<U+017F>tringent, and withal maketh <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ound and firm bottom, that you may tru<U+017F>t to it: Whence al<U+017F>o it is to be u<U+017F>ed in fi<U+017F>tulous Sores.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the <U+017F>topping of Blood; take the blood of a Lamb or Sheep, let it <U+017F>tand in a clean earthen ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, until the <hi><U+017F>erum</hi> be <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from it; pour this off, and dry the blood well in a new gla<U+017F>ed pipkin, upon hot embers: Then pulveri<U+017F>e it, and mix with it a fourth part of clean pulveri<U+017F>ed <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> and <U+017F>trew this into the wound. If the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of the blood be <U+017F>o impetuous, that it wa<U+017F>hes away the fir<U+017F>t application, then wipe the wound again, and <U+017F>trew into it of the <U+017F>ame powder the <U+017F>econd time. Putting among<U+017F>t it Allum, <hi>Crocus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> or the red Earth of Vitriol, you will do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
well: Bind the wound with the <hi>Empla<U+017F>trum Santalinum,</hi> (which is called <hi>Incognitum</hi> by our Chirurgeons,) or with the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> due to <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The blood being <U+017F>topt, and the wound clean<U+017F>ed, you mu<U+017F>t then apply good vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Oyls or Wound-bal<U+017F>oms. Oyls are all, as I mention'd above, fatty; whence it is, that they do not ea<U+017F>ily con<U+017F>olidate wounds, unle<U+017F>s you put to them <U+017F>ome refined <hi>Ma<U+017F>tic, Sarco-colla, Sanguis Draconis, Sandarach,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>But to open unto you the good affection of my heart, I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>cribe here my Wound-bal<U+017F>om, wherewith I have, by Gods a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, done much good, <hi>viz.</hi>

I cannot tell you the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e weight of each ingredient, becau<U+017F>e as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I have prepared it, I have done it by the Eye, and as it <U+017F>eemed good unto me; only note, that there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o much of the Gumm Elemy as to give it a due con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence; which you may try, by ca<U+017F>ting a drop or two of it into cold water; this Bal<U+017F>om being to be thinner than an Unguent, and yet thicker than Oyl.</p>
                     <p>This Bal<U+017F>om heals very <U+017F>peedily, e<U+017F>pecially

                     <p>My <hi>Opodeldoch,</hi> that I make u<U+017F>e of, is almo<U+017F>t like this, but that I mix with it the red Earth of the Oyl of Vitriol, above <U+017F>poken of in the matter of Blood-<U+017F>taunching; and add al<U+017F>o to it Turpentine and Gumm <hi>Elemi,</hi> with <U+017F>ome <hi>Tutia, Aloes epatica,</hi> well prepared <hi>Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris,</hi> and <hi>Crocus Martis</hi>: And thus the Plai<U+017F>ter becomes red and hard, like <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Sealing-wax.

evenings to wipe it clean; and then working it through again, lay it on as before: And <U+017F>o he may heal him<U+017F>elf; which when done, let him clean the Plai<U+017F>ter, and role it up in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for another occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>I have <U+017F>een con<U+017F>iderable opperations of Gumm Elemi u<U+017F>ed alone, laid on leather, and put upon the thru<U+017F>t; but this wound is then to be kept from falling together.</p>
                     <p>To prevent incidental heat and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounds, make u<U+017F>e of the Oyl of Ro<U+017F>es, Bol Armeniac, Whites of Eggs and Camphir. But to avoid trouble, you may find ready, in the Apothecary-<U+017F>hops, the <hi>

                     <p>You may with great benefit, and you ought al<U+017F>o, e<U+017F>pecially in the wounds of the Head, provided there be no danger of bleeding, lay over the bandage <U+017F>ome fine raggs moi<U+017F>ten'd in wine, and well dried again.

                     <p>And in ca<U+017F>e the wound be <U+017F>welled, you may al<U+017F>o to good purpo<U+017F>e make u<U+017F>e of Fomentations made of the herb and flowers of <hi>Mullein, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Egrimony, Cow<U+017F>lips, Camomil, Melilot, Ground-Ivy, red Ro<U+017F>es, Bugle,</hi> and the like: But beware of all hot things, whatever they be. Boil the afore<U+017F>aid herbs or the like in half wine and water; but if the wound be not inflamed, take two parts of wine and one of water. With <U+017F>uch fomentations I have done much good; among others upon a Fencing-Ma<U+017F>ter

                     <p>A <hi>Bone</hi> being broken, <U+017F>et it carefully, and bind it up <U+017F>trongly, having laid upon it <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> or <hi>Empla<U+017F>trum de pelle Arietina.</hi> You may al<U+017F>o comfort <U+017F>uch wounds with the like fomentations, as before de<U+017F>cribed.</p>
                     <p>On the bank of the <hi>Rhine</hi> is found a Stone in the gravel, call'd <hi>Lapis <U+017F>abulo<U+017F>us,</hi> which is ea<U+017F>ily reducible to powder: Of this, if you can get it, give to the Patient, who<U+017F>e bone is broken, a drachm to be taken in broath, mornings; of which he will find a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>In the ca<U+017F>e of a Limb wrenched, clap to it <hi>Bran</hi> boiled in wine, <U+017F>ometimes, according to occa<U+017F>ion, mixing with it a little Salt, and <hi>Mar<U+017F>hmallows</hi> or red <hi>Hounds-tongue-<U+017F>alve.</hi> If it have happened long ago, then make a pul<U+017F>e of Wheaten-flower, Milk, and the Oyl of <hi>Camomil</hi> or <hi>Mullein</hi>; mixing a little Saffron with it, and clap it on hot. If there be any collection or coagulation of blood, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of Hounds-tongue will do well, together with a linnen compre<U+017F>s moi<U+017F>tened in warm wine.</p>
                     <p>You mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be provided with good Wound-drinks; but they mu<U+017F>t be prepared diver<U+017F>ly, according to the <U+017F>everal places wounded. Thus in the wounds of the Head, <hi>Betony</hi> challenges the pre-eminence and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52336:285"/>
greate<U+017F>t quantity of all the Vulnerary Herbs; In the wounds of the Sides, <hi>Carduus Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> claims that right; in the wounds of the Brea<U+017F>t, <hi>Veronica</hi> (or Speedwell) ought to have it; in tho<U+017F>e about the Kidneys, the Herb Strawberry mu<U+017F>t be preferred; in tho<U+017F>e near the Liver, Agrimony will have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, and <U+017F>o forth. Mean time, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Herbs to be u<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, are the<U+017F>e; <hi>Sanicle, Winter-green, Ladies-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Speedwell, Orpine, Mugwort, Ground-Ivy, Straw-berry-leaves, Agrimony, St. Johns-wort, Cinquefoil, Bugle, Tormentil, Snakeweed, Avens, Woodrooff,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You may make an excellent Wound-drink of the<U+017F>e four Ingredients, <hi>viz. Winter-green, Orpine, Mugwort</hi> and <hi>Snakeweed,</hi> boiled in half Wine and Water; but in ca<U+017F>e there be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Wine is to be forborn, or very little of it to be employed.</p>
                     <p>If any Bone be broken into <U+017F>plinters, do not pull them out with any violence, but loo<U+017F>en them with a good Ointment of Eggs, keeping the wound open the longer. Nature her <U+017F>elf will not <U+017F>uffer any <U+017F>plinter to remain behind.</p>
                     <p>Now you mu<U+017F>t be ready with <U+017F>ome good thing for Blood coagulated, in ca<U+017F>e any per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould have been flung down, <U+017F>queezed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or fallen from a high place. The right powder for this purpo<U+017F>e is thus made: Take of <hi>Terra Sagillata,</hi> or <hi>Bol-Armeniack, Sanguis Draconis</hi> and <hi>Mumia, ana</hi> half an ounce, of <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb ana</hi> half a drachm, reduce it to a powder; of which give the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52336:286"/>
the weight of about a ducat in Wine, or Chervil-water. Or take a good quantity of <hi>Chervil,</hi> boil it in Meath or Fle<U+017F>h-broath, and let the Patient drink a good draught of it warm, three times a day. Or let him drink a Thimble-full of <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> in Beer, adding a little Butter to it. Or take of <hi>Mumia</hi> half an ounce, or <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> two drachms, of <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Cancrorum</hi> (of which the blew ones, which <U+017F>ometimes fall from Crafi<U+017F>hes whil<U+017F>t alive, are the be<U+017F>t,) three drachms, adding to it a little Licori<U+017F>h and Cinnamon, and <U+017F>ome Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil Roots: Of this pulveri<U+017F>ed give every day to the Patient, mornings and evenings, the weight of about half a ducat, and by this means you will expel purulent matter and blood, and bony <U+017F>plinters, and <U+017F>ometimes even bullets lurking in the fle<U+017F>h; not omitting other good Wound-drinks, and vulnerary Bal<U+017F>oms, Plai<U+017F>ters, Ointments and Fomentations. Again, take of the red <hi>Hounds-tongue</hi> Ointment, of the bigne<U+017F>s of a great Walnut, di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it in warm Broath; it expels all coagulated blood, e<U+017F>pecially if you mix <U+017F>ome <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>If you have any Thorns, Thi<U+017F>tles, Bullets, Small-<U+017F>hot, or the like, to draw out, where perhaps you cannot reach them with In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then burn live Crafi<U+017F>hes in a new Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, until they be reducible to powder, but burn them not to A<U+017F>hes. This powder mix with Hares-<U+017F>uet, and lay it on, and you will find a good effect. Al<U+017F>o take the Roots of the big <hi>Reed</hi> that grows in Mari<U+017F>hes, dry them to be pulveri<U+017F>ed, and mix Virgin-honey with it,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52336:286"/>
and lay it upon the part; and of the <U+017F>ame powder give the Patient to drink, twice a day, the weight of half a ducat in Wine, or in Broath, or in a vulnerary potion, if you have at hand. The fir<U+017F>t of this I learned of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctor <hi>Schleer</hi> of <hi>Con<U+017F>tance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Excrement of a <hi>Gander,</hi> being applied, is al<U+017F>o powerful in drawing out Iron. Again, Quince-wine mingled with Vinegar, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <U+017F>ome Saffron and Gun-powder among<U+017F>t it, if you give it to one that hath been <U+017F>hot, it will do him good. Otherwi<U+017F>e, they make a plai<U+017F>ter of the Roots of <hi>Cumfrey, Aron, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody, Juniper,</hi> and dried <hi>Radi<U+017F>hes,</hi> all reduced to powder, and mix it with Hares-<U+017F>uet and grey <hi>Diachylum,</hi> making a thick Ointment of it, and <U+017F>preading it over a piece of Hare-skin, and <U+017F>o laying it on. This is greatly prai<U+017F>ed, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when <U+017F>econded with good Wound-drinks, of which <hi>Ma<U+017F>ter-wort</hi> is one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients: But if you have not this at hand, take a <hi>Beet</hi> and boil it in Wine, and lay it warm on the wound. Likewi<U+017F>e young Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not yet fledge, burnt to powder, and this powder made by <hi>Acetum</hi> of Ro<U+017F>es into a pul<U+017F>e, and laid on, does the <U+017F>ame.</p>
                     <p>You ought al<U+017F>o to be provided for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novia</hi>: And if you proceed aright with my Wound-bal<U+017F>om above de<U+017F>cribed, and keep the wound warm, you may therewith do much good. Mix with it, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the red Earth of Vitriol, above di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of. This <hi>Synova</hi> is a dangerous thing, and often cau<U+017F>eth almo<U+017F>t intollerable pain, if it be not well handled; the Herb of Straw-berries and its
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52336:287"/>
Juyce have great vertue in this ca<U+017F>e. Some make u<U+017F>e of the White of Eggs, Bol-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and the like. The Magi<U+017F>tery of Allum al<U+017F>o belongs hither; for, Allum mixed with Vinegar, and clapp'd on very warm, allays it al<U+017F>o. Elder-blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms likewi<U+017F>e, u<U+017F>ed every way, are effectual in the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e. Employ al<U+017F>o diligently <U+017F>uch Defen<U+017F>ive-plai<U+017F>ters, as are not fatty, becau<U+017F>e fat lays no hold on water.</p>
                     <p>To proceed to Burnings, I know almo<U+017F>t no better Salve for burning than this; Take a <hi>Tench,</hi> or any common-Pond-fi<U+017F>h; fry one or more of them with good Butter, pour the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s upon cold Water in a broad earthen Pan, and you have an excellent Ointment again<U+017F>t Burnings. When, <U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince, a Powder-Mill was blown up, and the Attendants upon the work <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erably burnt, that they looked as if they had been ro<U+017F>ted, they were healed with this Ointment, only a little finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Sage</hi> being mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>Cream and Lin<U+017F>eed-oyl mingled together, and raggs moi<U+017F>ten'd therein, put upon the burnt part, healeth, though the burning were made with <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi>; for, to my knowledge, a certain Chymi<U+017F>t that had thus burnt all his Arm, was thereby re<U+017F>tored. Or, take Oyl of Elder, or <U+017F>tale Oyl that hath been long in a burning Lamp; beat half as much, as you take of that, of the Whites of Eggs among<U+017F>t it, and anoint the burnt part therewith. If you can get no Oyl of Elder, take any other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, as of <hi>Nymphaea,</hi> (Water-lillies) <hi>Poppy-<U+017F>eeds, Violets</hi> or <hi>Ro<U+017F>es,</hi> or the Oyl of <hi>Poplar-buds,</hi> or of <hi>Mar<U+017F>h-Marigold</hi> Flowers.</p>

Again, Yolks of Eggs and Lin<U+017F>eed-oyl, equal quantities, mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <U+017F>pread over the burning, is al<U+017F>o very good.

of Inflammations, and therefore very good to allay <hi>St. Antonies fire</hi>; if you pull its mild green rinds from the <U+017F>tem, and lay them on, without moi<U+017F>tening them. El<U+017F>e they u<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>aid Fire, Flower mixed with the powder of Licorice, to be clapt on with a ragg done over with red <hi>Saunders.</hi> My way is, to take the <U+017F>havings of <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h and juycy Licorice, and to fry them in new Butter; then to <U+017F>train the Butter from it, and to fry the like fre<U+017F>h Licorice therein, and to <U+017F>train the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from that again; repeating this five or <U+017F>ix times.

                     <p>If you be troubled with the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cold in winter, take the root of <hi>Pyrethrum</hi> (Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi>) and boil it in Vinegar, and hold this Vinegar warm in your mouth, and it will draw out the phlegm that cau<U+017F>es the pain. Or, take the root of Elder, boil it in half Wine and half Water, and hold it warm upon the Teeth. But what you take of this Decoction mu<U+017F>t be often <U+017F>pit out, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fre<U+017F>h taken into you mouth; of which I have found wonderful Effects.</p>
                     <p>The root of <hi>Heath</hi> boiled together with the <U+017F>ame herb in wine, and laid on is e<U+017F>teem'd to be powerful in drawing out thorns and <U+017F>plinters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52336:289"/>You may make a good Ointment again<U+017F>t the <hi>Itch</hi> and <hi>Scabs,</hi> of <hi>Savin,</hi> <U+017F>tale Fat, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone and Juniper-berries Oyl.</p>
                     <p>If your Limbs after long <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s be weak, boil <hi>Valerian</hi>-roots in Camomil-oyl, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint <U+017F>uch Limbs therewith.
