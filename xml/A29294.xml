         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>

            <p>NOthing was wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Happine<U+017F>s of this
Fortunate Slave, but to fall into
the hands of <U+017F>o Generous a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
as your Lord<U+017F>hip. And I
who had undertaken to furni<U+017F>h
him, was willing to find him one
<U+017F>o qualified, that he might have
rea<U+017F>on to be well plea<U+017F>ed with my
Choice. To whom then could I
<pb facs="tcp:103330:3"/>
with more Rea<U+017F>on Addre<U+017F>s my
<U+017F>elf for making this Pre<U+017F>ent, than
to a Lord, who by Excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
as well as Eminent Birth,
every day gains Slaves and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to him<U+017F>elf. To <U+017F>atisfie any
of the truth of what I <U+017F>ay, they
need not make a particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
or hearken after the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Atte<U+017F>tations of this Kingdom.
The Fame of your Glory extends
beyond <hi>England;</hi> there is not in
<hi>Europe</hi> a Court, where it hath
not arrived, to gain you the Heart
and Admiration of the be<U+017F>t. But,
my Lord, to know your Merit
more perfectly, we need only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
the particular e<U+017F>teem always
had for you by the greate<U+017F>t and
mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cerning Monarch in the
World; the choice he hath made
of your Per<U+017F>on for the greate<U+017F>t
Employments of War, and the
mo<U+017F>t important Negotiations of
Peace; the weight and <U+017F>tre<U+017F>s he
<pb facs="tcp:103330:3"/>
lays on your Advice, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
wherewith he relies on
the clearne<U+017F>s of your Judgment,
and greatne<U+017F>s of your Capacity
in his Council. How fair a Field,
my Lord, are your Prai<U+017F>es to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
on, were my Faculties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to my Subject, or my
Offerings of value an<U+017F>werable to
the Dignity of the Per<U+017F>on they
are made to, but the Enterprize
is too va<U+017F>t and too difficult for
<U+017F>uch an Author as I; and your
Glory <U+017F>tands <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al
e<U+017F>teem the whole World
hath for you, that it hath no
need of new Elogies or Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.
It becomes me better to
<U+017F>tudy your Plea<U+017F>ure: The Happy
Slave hath an impatient de<U+017F>ire to
entertain your lei<U+017F>ure hours with
the Relation of his Adventures.
And if he prove <U+017F>o happy, as not
to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>teem it
the highe<U+017F>t piece of good Fortune
<pb facs="tcp:103330:4"/>
he hath met with in his Life; at
lea<U+017F>t, I believe he cannot de<U+017F>ire
any thing with greater pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
unle<U+017F>s it be, that he who hath

            <p>THE Book I Publi<U+017F>h <U+017F>carce de<U+017F>erves
an Adverti<U+017F>ement. But that I
give you, is not to be<U+017F>peak the Criticks
in my favour. I cannot believe any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on

But 'tis becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons having <U+017F>mall
kindne<U+017F>s for an Author, have been plea<U+017F>ed
heretofore to comment on my Tables, to
make <U+017F>tories of my <U+017F>tories, and to <U+017F>tretch
my fancy to conjectures which never came
into my Head: It were ea<U+017F>ie for me to
ju<U+017F>tifie my <U+017F>elf in this particular, if it
were de<U+017F>ired; but I conceive my manner
of proceeding hath <U+017F>ufficiently done it, to
Dedicate it to one of the Principal Lords
of the Kingdom, a Book, <U+017F>uch as they
make my former, by their <U+017F>trange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
to be, and to put my Name to
it, was it not the way to gain my <U+017F>elf
Enemies, and utterly ruine me? I have
<pb facs="tcp:103330:5"/>
committed faults in my time, but never of
this nature. Therefore I declare to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

or any other Nation, and that they

I think, if they make me <U+017F>peak any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e

mine. There are <U+017F>o many in Love, that
though Love takes infinite ways, they can

Writers confined to entertain you only with

               <p>The Spring was come, and the
Weather <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for Travel, when
on a fair day the Young Gentleman
and his Servant privately left <hi>Rome,</hi>
and Imbarqued at <hi>Civita Vecchia</hi> in a
<hi>Felucca</hi> hired for the purpo<U+017F>e. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
was to vi<U+017F>it the be<U+017F>t Courts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> beginning with that of <hi>Spain.</hi>
But there are Per<U+017F>ons over whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is <U+017F>o rigorou<U+017F>ly imperious, that
<U+017F>he <U+017F>eems jealous of any thing they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103330:7"/>
undertake, without con<U+017F>ulting her
fir<U+017F>t. 'Twas <U+017F>he who provided Count
<hi>Alexander</hi> a Voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi> when
he had de<U+017F>igned to confine his Travels
to <hi>Europe:</hi> Of the Towns he was to
<U+017F>ee, <hi>Tunis</hi> was marked out by Fortune
for one; and though much out of his
Road, yet where Fortune intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
there always happens <U+017F>omething
extraordinary; her exce<U+017F><U+017F>es and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
being that which chiefly
makes us take notice of her.</p>
               <p>The fourth day after he had left
<hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> this Young Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to perceive, that though all the
Elements are terrible at Sea, yet Men
who are Enemies are more terrible
than the Elements. Till then the
Weather had been fair to extremity,
not a puff of contrary Wind: He
proceeded in his Voyage with what
<U+017F>peed he could wi<U+017F>h, and ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
at the happine<U+017F>s of the Weather.</p>
               <p>The Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Italy</hi> is dangerous,
e<U+017F>pecially in Summer, being then <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to In-roads by People of the South,
who<U+017F>e livelihood is Robbery; and
when the Weather is fair, their Trade
is <U+017F>o great, that who<U+017F>oever is not upon

his Guard, is happy if he e<U+017F>cape them;
I mean the Cor<U+017F>airs of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Count
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who never thought he had
left <hi>Rome,</hi> to be led in Triumph to <hi>Tunis,</hi>
<U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf at break of day <U+017F>aluted
by a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of that Nation: The
poor Seamen pre<U+017F>ently took <hi>Alarm,</hi>
the <U+017F>ight of one Turban was <U+017F>ufficient
to affright them: And the <hi>Turks</hi> had
<U+017F>carce di<U+017F>charged three or four Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
at the Chri<U+017F>tians, but they leapt
into the Sea to <U+017F>ave them<U+017F>eves by
<U+017F>wimming; the <hi>Italian</hi> Count and his
Servant <U+017F>taid in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, not in hopes
of being able to defend them<U+017F>elves
again<U+017F>t that number of Enemies,
which the <U+017F>trength of <hi>Rollando,</hi> and
the Inchanted Armour of <hi>Amadis</hi>
could <U+017F>carcely have done, (whereas
now a Man is but a Man, and among
other Secrets that of Inchanting Arms
is lo<U+017F>t.) But having no skill in <U+017F>wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
he could not expect to e<U+017F>ape
as the Mariners: Yet he was not <U+017F>o
out of love with his Life, but that he
held it better to be a Slave than be
drowned. But that tho<U+017F>e Barbarous
Cor<U+017F>airs might <U+017F>ee what a Per<U+017F>on they
dealt with, and that he might <U+017F>ell his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103330:8"/>
Liberty as dear as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; having
commanded his Servant to throw his
Baggage over-board, he gave him
order what further to do. I will omit
the De<U+017F>cription of the Action, though
reputed the mo<U+017F>t glorious ever done
on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of Two again<U+017F>t Thirty, whereof
they laid <U+017F>ix dead on the Deck, and
many more wounded. 'Twas an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of a Herd of Wolves again<U+017F>t
Two young Lions, who defended
them<U+017F>elves with unparallel'd Valour
and Courage. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi>
(not to lo<U+017F>e the Money they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from their Ran<U+017F>om) <U+017F>pared them
at fir<U+017F>t, u<U+017F>ing Cudgels only again<U+017F>t

many, having filled them with rage,
they had recour<U+017F>e to their Symitars:
And with <U+017F>o much advantage, that
having killed the <hi>Valet,</hi> the Young
Count (after <U+017F>everal Wounds received,
his <U+017F>trength, not his Courage, having
failed him in <U+017F>o tedious a Fight, was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103330:8"/>
forced to yield, being no longer able
to lift up his Arm to make u<U+017F>e of his
Sword. The Cowardly Villains had
<U+017F>carce the Courage to board him, and
dur<U+017F>t not approach him till they <U+017F>aw
him fallen flat on his back. They
took him, and carried him on board
their <hi>Brigandine,</hi> where they gave him
all the help in their power for <U+017F>aving
his Life, having no other mark of
their Victory, but the taking one Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Per<U+017F>on, who had co<U+017F>t them too
dear to be proud of their Prize: They
beheld him with Admiration, and
could not comprehend how an Age
<U+017F>o tender could be capable of <U+017F>o much
Courage; and that in a Body appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o delicate, there was <U+017F>trength
enough lodged to perform the actions
they had <U+017F>een. And being Naturally
Super<U+017F>titious, they did really believe
there was <U+017F>omething <U+017F>upernatural in
the Young Mans Per<U+017F>on, or at lea<U+017F>t,
that he was the Flower of Chri<U+017F>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
this conceit helped them to
bear with more patience the <U+017F>hame of
their Victory. And finding their Men
thin, and having taken before <U+017F>ome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103330:9"/>
con<U+017F>iderable Prizes, they re<U+017F>olved to
return directly for <hi>Tunis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Weather was favourable, and
in few days <U+017F>ail they arrived at <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi>
where going a<U+017F>hore they put the
poor Count on Hor<U+017F>e-back, bound and
pinion'd like a Robber, and brought
him to the Town; <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
having got the <U+017F>tart of the re<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>pread <U+017F>uch a Report of his Valour
and Courage, that they drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not the ordinary People only,
(who are curious of <U+017F>mall matters)
but the Principal Per<U+017F>ons of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> him<U+017F>elf, who accompanyed

Youth pale and disfigured, yet keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his good mien the marks of
Grandeur in his Countenance. He
was pityed by all, and the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> being
a gallant and generous Per<U+017F>on, was
pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>eized with <U+017F>uch indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it, that he commanded them forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
on pain of his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind
him upon the place; which they
in<U+017F>tantly did, not daring to di<U+017F>obey
him, who next the <hi>Dey</hi> was of greate<U+017F>t
Authority and Power in the Kingdom:
He asked them the price of their
Slave, and, having commanded him
to be conducted to his Palace, paid
the Cor<U+017F>airs five hundred Patacoons,
being the Money they demanded.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Alexander</hi> having happily
fallen into the hands of <U+017F>o good and

He was Lodged in a hand<U+017F>om Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Chyrurgions
<U+017F>earched his Wounds: And being more

though weak, and <U+017F>ore brui<U+017F>ed by
what he had <U+017F>uffer'd at Sea from the
hands of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who having
no pity for any, had not been too
careful of him; yet there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his Life, the Fever he had was
not great, and they had hopes to <U+017F>ee
him well in few days. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited
him Morning and Evening, and
by degrees his care and kindne<U+017F>s grew

to that height, that he came more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to <U+017F>ee him, and not only took

               <p>Before I proceed, it may not be ami<U+017F>s
to <U+017F>atisfie the Curio<U+017F>ity of the Reader,
in giving him an account of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
the Birth and Character of the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a. Mahomet Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a.</hi> by the Father
of <hi>Sidy Marat,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet Lap<U+017F>y</hi> the
new Beys, was the Son of a Renegado
of <hi>Cor<U+017F>ica,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Petro<U+017F>anty,</hi>
who by the hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
and the excellency of his Wit,
having gained the good Opinion of
the <hi>Dey</hi> or King of the Countrey,
made <U+017F>o good u<U+017F>e of the favour of his
Prince, that he advanced him to the
highe<U+017F>t Office of the Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he left his Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Heir.
But, to <U+017F>horten the Story, <hi>Mahomet</hi>

with the <hi>Dey</hi> and the <hi>Divan,</hi> (who,
jealous of the Authority his Father
had gain'd, would have divided the

as fit for Arms as Gallantry, of a great
Spirit, and excellent Wit, the mo<U+017F>t
Brave, the mo<U+017F>t Generous and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
of Men: He loved the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tians,

a Commerce of Civility with
many Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> He <U+017F>ent and

from the Great Duke of <hi>Tu<U+017F>cany;</hi> in
a word, no Lord of that Countrey
ever carried him<U+017F>elf better, and had
more Merit and Reputation than he:
Some re<U+017F>emblance of this Splendor
may yet be <U+017F>een in the Per<U+017F>on of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
Lap<U+017F>y</hi> his Son; he had inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was charm'd with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

in familiar Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>itting on his

to <U+017F>ee him, and made him Pre<U+017F>ents

to believe the Count a Per<U+017F>on
of no ordinary Quality, but did not
think fit to que<U+017F>tion him on that point;
and had no further knowledge of him,
than that he was an</hi> Italian. <hi>Nor dur<U+017F>t
the Count acquaint him with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
fearing, the knowing of it
might make his Enlargement the more
difficult: But after <U+017F>o many favours
from the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a, <hi>he could not in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
conceal him<U+017F>elf from a Per<U+017F>on

which were joyfully received by the

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as he had recovered his

in Hunting, Walking, Hor<U+017F>e-race; in
all which the Count appeared Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
above others, and became more
Famous than ever any Chri<U+017F>tian was
in tho<U+017F>e Parts; every con<U+017F>iderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
was ambitious to vi<U+017F>it him, and
took plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee, and to treat him,
which is a <U+017F>pecial favour to tho<U+017F>e of
their Countrey, much more to one
who profe<U+017F>s'd a Religion, to which
they are open irreconcileable Enemies.
Hence you may ob<U+017F>erve the power of
Merit, and how irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

his Per<U+017F>on, and the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of his
Temper, and candor of his Actions
as the effectual means for gaining him

is barren, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts more in
the <U+017F>moak of Tobacco than Excellent
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: Their Knowledge is <U+017F>mall,
having ordinarily no advantage of
Reading or Travel. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> alone
had more Wit, and more Rea<U+017F>on than
the re<U+017F>t altogether; but his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the State engaging him in a
thou<U+017F>and indi<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ible Affairs, would
not allow him to be always with
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who in the mean time pa<U+017F>t
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103330:13"/>
his Melancholy hours in the Garden
of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to walk, being a retired and
very plea<U+017F>ant place, and that wherein
he took great delight. But alas, how
different were the<U+017F>e days from tho<U+017F>e
at <hi>Rome!</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> are naturally apt
to be Melancholy, and this Solitude
made the Count <U+017F>o: The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who
loved him <U+017F>incerely, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately
wi<U+017F>hed to have him always in good
humour, was troubled to find him <U+017F>ad
and dejected; but having often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the cau<U+017F>e, could not obtain far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>atisfaction, than that it was an
effect of his Temper: He had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
him to exce<U+017F>s with all that
Countrey could afford for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures
of Life, and could not imagine
the cau<U+017F>e of the grief, but fancied at
la<U+017F>t that to compleat his Diverti<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Alexander</hi> might want the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation
of a Woman. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
being a Per<U+017F>on much given to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
was the more ea<U+017F>ily inclined
to believe he had found the true cau<U+017F>e
of his Melancholy. And looked upon
it as no incurable Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
re<U+017F>olved to find out a Remedy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103330:13"/>
by furni<U+017F>hing him with a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
which was a high <U+017F>train of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ance
in a Per<U+017F>on of his Character;
but there were no limits to the Love
he had for his <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is very <U+017F>evere
in this Point, again<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>ons of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion, though very indulgent
to tho<U+017F>e of his own. Tho<U+017F>e who fall
into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and will
make love to their Women, are under
the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of changing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or Burning: the<U+017F>e Extremities
are hard, yet of the many Chri<U+017F>tians
reduced to tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>traits, I know not
one who hath thought Martyrdom <U+017F>o
charming, as not to prefer Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
before Burning: the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> though
no zealous ob<U+017F>erver of the Law, was
willing however to avoid the Scandal
that might follow if the Intrigue were
di<U+017F>covered, and therefore de<U+017F>ign'd to
marry him to a Chri<U+017F>tian. There
was with the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> his Wife, an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Slave,</hi> a young Maid of good
quality, lovely and witty: it was not
long <U+017F>ince the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had been in love
with her, but without any <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s:

<U+017F>he bore to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,

of Con<U+017F>cience in point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with which <U+017F>he excu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf,
certain it is, his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es were vain;
and after three Months eager per<U+017F>uit
of his de<U+017F>ign, being not accu<U+017F>tom'd to
<U+017F>o much re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, he quitted her, and
ca<U+017F>t his eyes on other le<U+017F>s difficult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>ts:
he hoped that one Chri<U+017F>tian
with another might have better <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
and that <hi>Alexander</hi> being very
lovely, and young, needed only to
<U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf for gaining the love of a
Maid of his Country, profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing the
<U+017F>ame Religion with him: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e her for the purpo<U+017F>e,
by rai<U+017F>ing in her an e<U+017F>teem for the
Gallant he provided her: he had often
<U+017F>poken of him in the Chamber of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> where <hi>Laura,</hi> the Slave we

               <p>And having formed the de<U+017F>ign, he

<hi>Alexander <U+017F>aid that;</hi> of which he gave
them <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant De<U+017F>criptions, that he

               <p>
                  <hi>The Count knew nothing of all

<U+017F>ometimes at his <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, would tell
him, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hortly <U+017F>ee him in a

all things on</hi> Laura<hi>'s <U+017F>ide, (who had
told him, <U+017F>he would not be di<U+017F>pleas'd

the Garden of the</hi> Seraglio <hi>to walk,
and after a turn or two, asked him if
he had ever been in love. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion
did very much <U+017F>urprize him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending,
that being among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<hi>might perhaps have had <U+017F>ome Jealou<U+017F>ie
of him, though he could not imagine
the cau<U+017F>e. But to di<U+017F>abu<U+017F>e him, he
held it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to affect great indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Women, and
(the truth is) to that day he had not
been in love. And though it were ill

of Women, to tell him he had

to commit a <U+017F>olaeci<U+017F>m in court<U+017F>hip,
than to give him the lea<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.
The</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>advi<U+017F>ed him to

our Women are kind, and good natured,
and never are the cau<U+017F>e of any mans
death by coyne<U+017F>s and di<U+017F>dain; the <U+017F>ole diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is in getting a <U+017F>ight of them; gain
but that point, and nothing can be more
ea<U+017F>ie than the re<U+017F>t: your Ladies are <U+017F>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
and <U+017F>hy of <U+017F>hewing favour to their

<U+017F>eeing their Langui<U+017F>h: it is not <U+017F>o odious
to be fond and coming with you, as 'tis to
be cruel and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible here. We follow in
the fir<U+017F>t place the Law of nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it to <hi>Mahomets,</hi> as being Men
before we are <hi>Mu<U+017F><U+017F>ulmans.</hi> We hold
our <U+017F>elves obliged to pay kind regard and
affectionate tenderne<U+017F>s to Female Beauty,
and expect from it a return of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And tho<U+017F>e who approve not the<U+017F>e
<hi>Maxims,</hi> we e<U+017F>teem unworthy to ta<U+017F>te
the plea<U+017F>ures of Love. I know that in
<hi>Europe</hi> you u<U+017F>e this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way, making that Martyrdom which
<U+017F>hould be a delight; but I would fain
know, what the de<U+017F>ign of that Woman
can be, who <U+017F>ees a man every day on his

Why then mu<U+017F>t he be tormented?
Why <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighs, why <U+017F>o many tears
expected from him, when the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of

               <p>
                  <hi>The Count having in this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
him<U+017F>elf, an<U+017F>wered;</hi> I believe,
Sir, that in Love as in other matters eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may have his particular fancy, and
different <hi>Maxims</hi> for conduct: but if I,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103330:16"/>
who was never in Love, may be allow'd
to deliver my opinion of it, I conceive
that Men born under a Law, are in<U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to bear it with ea<U+017F>e. And I
dare confidently affirm, there is more <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and charming delight in the torments
we endure in our way of Loving, than in
tho<U+017F>e ea<U+017F>ie plea<U+017F>ures that co<U+017F>t you nothing:
think not, Sir, tho<U+017F>e torments <U+017F>o cruel as

them only to affect their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es
the more, and to make them more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible.
It would certainly <U+017F>urprize you to hear
them cry, <hi>Increa<U+017F>e, O love, Increa<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a pain:</hi> their <U+017F>ufferings are

not interrupt him, <U+017F>o that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,</hi>
What <U+017F>atisfaction can you find in
a Love that is ful<U+017F>om and dull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pique to make it poynant, and
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>on it for reli<U+017F>h? What diverti<U+017F>ement
to be expected from an innocent <hi>Cupid,</hi> a
Child without wit, without waggery, that
permits you to do in all things as you
plea<U+017F>e? <hi>The</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>could not forbear
laughing, and told him, that to make

by being in Love, enduring with
plea<U+017F>ure all the torments he <U+017F>poke of:</hi>
Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Alexander, I was never in love
in my Country, where you know we have
freedom of living, and Liberty of conver<U+017F>e
with the Female Sex; it is not probable
then I <U+017F>hall fall in love here, where we
are not allow'd <U+017F>o much as a <U+017F>ight of them:
means may be found, <hi>replied the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,
to <U+017F>atisfie you in that particular if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
it. I do not conceive it for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<hi><U+017F>aid the Count,</hi> to thru<U+017F>t my
<U+017F>elf into the fire to try the experiment, or
to change my Religion. No, no, <hi><U+017F>aid the</hi>
Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a, it is with a Chri<U+017F>tian I would have
you acquainted, and one in my judgment
very beautiful, and not unworthy your
<U+017F>ighs: had I been of your mind, and like
the Lovers of your Country, taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
in being vext and tormented, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
might have been done. She made
me pine for her above three Months, till
weary of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s that had <U+017F>o little
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e of my pain, I betook my <U+017F>elf to others
that were more of my humour; her beauty
and wit will certainly charm you, and you
may find her as haughty, as fierce, as
cruel as you can wi<U+017F>h: it may be difficult
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103330:17"/>
to have a <U+017F>ight of her, as being with the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
I had for her, would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to <U+017F>tep out of her Apartment:
but I'le bring you thither di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as an
Eunuch; there is no other way of entrance
for you into the Seraglio: and you are <U+017F>o
young, that by Night you may pa<U+017F>s for
an Eunuch without any <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion. <hi>The
Count gave him a thou<U+017F>and thanks for
the favour, not but that he could have
been very well content to have been
without it, having no great de<U+017F>ire to
engage him<U+017F>elf in Acquaintance in a
Country where he would tarry as

having taken the Habit of an</hi> Eunuch

the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>to the Apartment of the</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103330:17"/>
the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>came <U+017F>milling up to her, and
whi<U+017F>pered her in the Ear, that he had
brought her an Eunuch, who could
tell her News out of</hi> Italy; <hi>pray'd her
to have a care of him, and to u<U+017F>e him

<hi>fell a laughing, and an<U+017F>wered, <U+017F>he
doubted not but the Eunuch <U+017F>hould

The Count, though Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed,

him her hand to lead her into a

Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> I know not what thanks

he hath and daily declares for you.
'Tis true, Madam, <hi>an<U+017F>wered the Count,</hi>
the kindne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> to me is extream;

'tis certainly I, for the favour he

that (as he would have me believe) you
had a hand in it. Sir, <hi>replyed</hi> Laura,
I <U+017F>hall tell you no lye, I have made it <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known to you, I de<U+017F>ired this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from him. He told us things <U+017F>o glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of you, and related them <U+017F>o much to
your advantage, you may ea<U+017F>ily believe, I
(who, for three years I have been here,
have not had the Liberty of Conver<U+017F>e with
any Man) could not but de<U+017F>ire acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of a Per<U+017F>on<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>o generally e<U+017F>teemed.
Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> this Country hath been
favourable in allowing me a Reputation,
which perhaps I may find difficult to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in your Opinion. You need not fear
that, <hi>reply'd</hi> Laura, your Mien confirms
<U+017F>ufficiently the reports that have pa<U+017F>t of
you. But to change the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, do you
know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he <U+017F>miling, that <U+017F>ometimes
'tis dangerous in a Nation like this, to
make your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much the <U+017F>ubject of
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; if not on the Mens account,
yet certainly on the Womens, who fall in
Love meerly on report, without a <U+017F>ight or
knowledge of the Party: <hi>The Count
an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>miling,</hi> Madam, there is no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103330:18"/>
danger of your being of the number of
tho<U+017F>e kind-hearted Ladies, I am not <U+017F>o
Fortunate. And why, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> might
not I be one, who have <U+017F>o long'd for a
<U+017F>ight of you: but to lo<U+017F>e no more time, I
mu<U+017F>t tell you, your Fortune is better than
you think; and I do that for another,
which perhaps I would not have done for
my <U+017F>elf. The de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing a Man is
here reputed a mighty advancement of
Love, where to <U+017F>ee and to agree are all
one. But I have undertaken this affair,
and made the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> believe I have very
favourable thoughts of you. And to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your Curio<U+017F>ity of knowing the Party
for whom I have <U+017F>o much complai<U+017F>ance in
<U+017F>tore, it is for the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a's</hi> Lady, Madam
<hi>Alhie</hi> the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s:</hi> The confidence <U+017F>he
is plea<U+017F>ed to repo<U+017F>e in me is <U+017F>o great, that
<U+017F>he hath entru<U+017F>ted me with this Secret,
and my kindne<U+017F>s for her <U+017F>hould not admit
one moments <U+017F>cruple doing her this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I cannot doubt but you have heard
of her beauty; never was any <U+017F>o famous
in this Kingdom, nor perhaps in the World,
more worthy admiration: And as for her
temper, 'tis the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t lovely
that can be imagined. The fir<U+017F>t view
you have of her, will per<U+017F>wade you <U+017F>he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103330:19"/>
hath an inclination to Love, <U+017F>o tender, <U+017F>o
langui<U+017F>hing is the air of her Countenance.
And though this be natural to the Women
of this Country, and that the fir<U+017F>t thing
they are taught, is to <U+017F>igh, and appear
langui<U+017F>hing, yet I have not ob<U+017F>erved tho<U+017F>e
weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es in her but on your account. To
deduce things from the Original, I mu<U+017F>t
inform you, that when the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> returned
from <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople,</hi> having di<U+017F>patched
the Affair depending there between him,
and the King, and <hi>Divan</hi> of this place,
and being confirmed by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
in the Offices his Father had left him,
which they had di<U+017F>puted; the King, in
order to Reconciliation, was advi<U+017F>ed to
give the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> his Daughter in Marriage.
<hi>Alhie</hi> was then Sixteen Years old, and
her beauty at the height; though at this
day in my judgment, no man that <U+017F>ees her,
but mu<U+017F>t be in Love with her. The<U+017F>e Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of Policy and State-intere<U+017F>t, to
which the Daughters of great ones are <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be Sacrificed, <U+017F>eldom prove Happy.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> E<U+017F>pou<U+017F>ed <hi>Alhie,</hi> and perhaps
loved her a Week, but after that returned
to his former Engagements, and for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
beauties quitted the greate<U+017F>t of the
Kingdom. 'Tis true, it often happens
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103330:19"/>
thus in this Country, where Men abhor
loving by Duty and Obligation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
love Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es better than Wives:
but this Lady, in my Opinion, ought to
have been excepted, as wanting nothing
requi<U+017F>ite to <U+017F>atisfie the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable
Man; but <U+017F>he is as unfortunate
as others. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> though otherwi<U+017F>e a
Per<U+017F>on of much Gallantry, vi<U+017F>its her <U+017F>carce
once in a Month; yet he pays her all the
Re<U+017F>pect in the World, and <U+017F>he hath no
cau<U+017F>e of complaint but of his Love; but
take love from Marriage, what <U+017F>ignifies
the re<U+017F>t? What a trouble it is to a Young
Lady, who knows her own merit, to <U+017F>ee
her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>lighted in that whereof <U+017F>he is
mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible? A Lady who would think
her <U+017F>elf happy in being belov'd, and thinks
<U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves it: you mu<U+017F>t be a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can comprehend the rigor of this
u<U+017F>age, and the greatne<U+017F>s of her misfortune.
But to come to what concerns you; the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> hath ever had a great inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Chri<U+017F>tians; and the greate<U+017F>t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
<U+017F>he takes, is, in <U+017F>tories <U+017F>he makes me
tell of my Country, which <U+017F>urprize her
<U+017F>o (e<U+017F>pecially when I <U+017F>peak of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Men have there with Women) that
<U+017F>he hath a thou<U+017F>and times wi<U+017F>hed her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103330:20"/>
had been as mine, and that <U+017F>he had
fallen into the hands of a Chri<U+017F>tian, who
would have carried her into that Country.
'Tis certain, a Woman had better be a
Slave with us, than free among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
where their Life is nothing but a perpetual
Slavery. The Adventures of Love and
Gallantry have plea<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>o well in the
relation, that <U+017F>he longs for a <U+017F>ight of one
of tho<U+017F>e I called Per<U+017F>ons of Quality and
Merit, who were <U+017F>o Gallant and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om,
as I repre<U+017F>ented. You were no <U+017F>ooner
arrived, but <U+017F>he came with great joy to
tell me, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had newly bought a
Chri<U+017F>tian, of whom they <U+017F>poke Wonders.
I fell a laughing, and ask'd if it were
not <U+017F>uch a one <U+017F>he had often wi<U+017F>h'd for her
Slave. She blu<U+017F>hed, and turning about
with a <U+017F>igh, an<U+017F>wered, who knows what
may happen, and whether Fortune hath
not de<U+017F>igned him for me. She made me
her Bedfellow that Night, to entertain her
on that <U+017F>ubject. On the morrow the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
having confirmed the Reports of you, and
commended your Per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he and I for
<U+017F>everal days had no di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e but of you.
The kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he hath for me, makes me
<U+017F>omewhat familiar with her; nor do we
very <U+017F>trictly ob<U+017F>erve here our di<U+017F>tance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103330:20"/>
great ones; this made me <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take the Liberty to quarrel with
her for the longing <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>t for a Man
<U+017F>he had not <U+017F>een. I confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this
were falling in Love a little too <U+017F>oon, if
we managed our Love as the Chri<U+017F>tians do
theirs. But the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having made <U+017F>uch
a de<U+017F>cription of this Man, there is not a
Woman in the Kingdom who would not
have had a greater Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for him than
I have expre<U+017F>t. And you may believe he
would not have <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o much in his
prai<U+017F>e before the meane<U+017F>t of his Empre<U+017F><U+017F>es;
but though he <U+017F>light me <U+017F>o, that he cares
not what I think, my affections are free.
You would e<U+017F>teem your <U+017F>elf happy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>aid I, to have <U+017F>uch a Chri<U+017F>tian in
Love with you. More happy, <hi>reply'd
<U+017F>he,</hi> than you can imagine. And I will
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I could willingly change the
<U+017F>tate I am in, for the condition of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chri<U+017F>tian Lady: What good does it
me, to abound thus with Riches, to receive
<U+017F>o much Honour, to be the Daughter of a
King, and the Wife of a <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be content, nor do as I would, nor
love where love is due? In a word, if I
am nothing le<U+017F>s than I am taken to be, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103330:21"/>
a Slave more unhappy than tho<U+017F>e under
Chains. Poor <hi>Laura (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
me tenderly)</hi> how I pity thee,
who ha<U+017F>t ta<U+017F>ted the Plea<U+017F>ures and Liberty
of thy Country, and ha<U+017F>t unhappily fallen
into their hands who u<U+017F>e <U+017F>o unworthily all
<U+017F>orts of Women.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es as the<U+017F>e did we
entertain our <U+017F>elves ever <U+017F>ince they <U+017F>poke
of you at <hi>Tunis.</hi> The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> came oftner
to vi<U+017F>it the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> though we knew
not the rea<U+017F>on; and almo<U+017F>t every day
brought us the News of you: And, as he
loves you entirely, took plea<U+017F>ure in relating
every thing you did. Perhaps, had he
known the favourable inclinations the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
had for you, he had been more
<U+017F>paring in his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of you, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe he de<U+017F>igned to prejudice him<U+017F>elf
in <U+017F>peaking obligingly of you. But it was
an over<U+017F>ight, and mo<U+017F>t unpardonable in
him who <U+017F>o well knew the temper of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of this Country: Judge you whether
<U+017F>o good a report from <U+017F>o good a hand could
want its effect. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with them <U+017F>o much to the purpo<U+017F>e,
that what at fir<U+017F>t was a bare inclination,
grew up by degrees to a <U+017F>ettled Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.
Her humour was <U+017F>uddenly chang'd from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103330:21"/>
Merry and Jocund, into Sadne<U+017F>s and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
and I, who alone knew her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper,
could not but pity her <U+017F>ighs and
complaints, and was extreamly afraid <U+017F>he
might fall into a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which they call
Fanta<U+017F>ie, and is a kind of Melancholy that
proves Mortal to many Men and Women
of this Country. I did my endeavour to
cure her of this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by repre<U+017F>enting
to her all the ob<U+017F>tacles in her way to the
happine<U+017F>s <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired. But my Remedies
came too late, I did but trouble her to no
purpo<U+017F>e, having <U+017F>aid to her <U+017F>elf all that
I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>ay to divert her from the
affection <U+017F>he had taken: So that de<U+017F>pairing
of Remedy on that <U+017F>ide, I apply'd my
thoughts another way, and flattered her
hopes of bringing that to pa<U+017F>s, which I
could not di<U+017F>cover the lea<U+017F>t po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility to
effect. But to prevent the growth and
increa<U+017F>e of her Di<U+017F>temper, it was nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary
to deceive her by flatteries and hopes.
At la<U+017F>t, I know not how it fell out, that
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having <U+017F>poken of you to me two
days ago, as he frequently does when he
finds me alone, I told him, I <U+017F>hould be
very glad to <U+017F>ee you, if it might be done
without noi<U+017F>e and <U+017F>oandal: I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd how ea<U+017F>ily he promi<U+017F>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103330:22"/>
it: And you may believe I had not
waited here for you, but that I very well
knew him a Man of his word.</p>

the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> will not permit you to come

to ask him how he liked her; and
whether <U+017F>he appeared <U+017F>o beautiful as
he had repre<U+017F>ented her: the Count
an<U+017F>wered, it was certainly impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to <U+017F>ee a Lady more hand<U+017F>om, or
more witty: and that he was charmed
at her Beauty and Conver<U+017F>ation. The
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> who de<U+017F>ired nothing more than
to <U+017F>ee him in Love, was extreamly
glad at the confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion he made; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103330:23"/>
told him it <U+017F>hould be his fault, if he
<U+017F>aw her not again; and, if he de<U+017F>ired,
he might do it on the morrow, that
he would give him a Key to enter the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that he might go alone;
le<U+017F>t if he brought him in, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
might be jealous: it being not
his cu<U+017F>tom to vi<U+017F>it her <U+017F>o often, the
Count failed not to acquaint him how
highly that favour would oblige him;
<U+017F>o that the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> bid him go to bed,
and take his re<U+017F>t, and told him he
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow about
the time he had <U+017F>een her that day.</p>
               <p>Never was a night <U+017F>o re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s to any
man, as this to the Count, her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
like that he had to marriage,
with the principal and mo<U+017F>t beautiful
Lady of the Kingdom, was a thing <U+017F>o
rare, and <U+017F>o tempting for a Man of
his temper; what <hi>Laura</hi> had <U+017F>aid of
tho<U+017F>e obliging thoughts that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Per<U+017F>on had for him, did <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h
him with plea<U+017F>ure, that in the depth
of misfortune he could not imagine
any man more fortunate than him<U+017F>elf:
But when he con<U+017F>idered, that <U+017F>he was
the Wife of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> a Per<U+017F>on to
whom he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly obliged, he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103330:24"/>
was troubled extreamly, and <U+017F>igh'd
for <U+017F>orrow; the<U+017F>e <U+017F>econd thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
at that time over the other,
he highly reproached him<U+017F>elf for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
a thought of <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
But it is a tickli<U+017F>h bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to repent of a thing that extreamly
delights us, and men <U+017F>eldom charge
them<U+017F>elves home for a fault <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing
and lovely, as the plea<U+017F>ure of being
beloved: tho<U+017F>e reproaches of the <hi>Count</hi>
again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf, were not altogether
the mo<U+017F>t violent that might be, and
<U+017F>ometimes he would be angry with
him<U+017F>elf for making <U+017F>o much ado. At
la<U+017F>t, being a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted by turns, on the
one <U+017F>ide by Rea<U+017F>on, on the other by
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by the Glory of that, and the
tenderne<U+017F>s of this, he got up in the
Morning, without having been able
to take any other re<U+017F>olution than to
yield him<U+017F>elf up to be guided by his
De<U+017F>tiny, to be governed by Fate, and
be meerly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive in the management
of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; that is to <U+017F>ay, to love,
in this particular, like a <hi>Turk,</hi> and to
<U+017F>ee the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> if it were <U+017F>o prede<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated:
but to do nothing in order to
it, though he had promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Laura</hi> to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103330:24"/>
contribute on his part all that lay in
his power, and had told the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> he
<U+017F>hould be extreamly glad to go again
to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> His re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was very tottering and weak,
and to <U+017F>peak truth, 'tis almo<U+017F>t vain to
take one again<U+017F>t love: he wi<U+017F>ht a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
times that day, that his Fate to
who<U+017F>e conduct he had given him<U+017F>elf
up, would incline to bring him to the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s.</hi> He waited the hour with a
great deal of impatience, however he
would fain have per<U+017F>waded him<U+017F>elf
to the contrary: but a young heart
cannot be in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, being <U+017F>o apt to
take fire, that it <U+017F>carce requires any
help to inflame it.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>aw the Count
in the Evening, he <U+017F>hew'd him (<U+017F>miling)
the Key of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with the greate<U+017F>t joy in the
World. <hi>But I give it,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,
<hi>on condition that you make me your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
And I think I have done enough
to engage you to do me that plea<U+017F>ure.</hi>
The hour was come for his going to
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and the Count having
put on his Eunuchs Habit, his Patron
every day more obliging than other,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103330:25"/>
would needs bear him company as far
as the <hi>Seraglio; Laura</hi> having notice
of his coming, had waited for him
above an hour at the Gate, and no
<U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw him arrived, but ravi<U+017F>hed
with joy, <U+017F>he gave him her hand, and
told him. <hi>You are either the mo<U+017F>t dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
or el<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t fortunate Per<U+017F>on
in the World: you bring about things <U+017F>o
difficult, and in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, that all
things <U+017F>eem to joyn in your favour: I am
obliged for it to my fortune,</hi> an<U+017F>wered
the <hi>Count; for, as for Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es I had no
occa<U+017F>ion to u<U+017F>e any, but if you would make
me believe my <U+017F>elf as happy as you <U+017F>ay,
help me to a <U+017F>ight of the</hi> Sultane<U+017F>s. <hi>Laura</hi>
told him, he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently hear of
her, and brought him into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where her Lady was u<U+017F>ed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
vi<U+017F>its. It was her cu<U+017F>tom to <U+017F>eat
her <U+017F>elf in a kind of <hi>Alcove,</hi> the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age
to which, was through her Chamber,
made up with great <hi>Balli<U+017F>tres</hi> guilt, and
covered with a Curtain of very thin
Silk, through which <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ee
tho<U+017F>e whom <U+017F>he honoured only with
a <U+017F>ight of her; which is a piece of State
u<U+017F>ed in that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103330:25"/>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> told the Count, that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
would <U+017F>ee him from behind that
Curtain. <hi>And <U+017F>hall not I then,</hi> <U+017F>aid he,
<hi>have the honour to <U+017F>ee her. I know not,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <hi>Laura, but 'tis a favour <U+017F>o great,
that 'tis never granted but when they are
willing to grant all that may be expected:
Ah Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid the <hi>Count, I be<U+017F>eech
you to de<U+017F>ire that favour for me; tell her
it will be of <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>equence to give a
<U+017F>tranger a <U+017F>ight of her, and that I <U+017F>hall
die with grief if <U+017F>he deny me that honour.
Laura<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  </hi> promi<U+017F>ed him all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
in her power, and leaving him for a
moment, went to adverti<U+017F>e the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s,</hi>
who que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s longed for
news of the arrival of her dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Chri<U+017F>tian. In the mean time
the Count con<U+017F>idered the Riches and
Ornaments of the Chamber, being
the mo<U+017F>t magnificent of the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it was <U+017F>et out with four Chri<U+017F>tal
Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es which had a plea<U+017F>ant effect on
the Gold and the Jewels which glitter'd
all about: Scarce had the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
<U+017F>een <hi>Laura,</hi> but <U+017F>he knew by her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the happy news <U+017F>he brought;
and without allowing her time to <U+017F>ay
any thing, <U+017F>he pa<U+017F>t to the <hi>Alcove,</hi> from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103330:26"/>
whence <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ign'd to take a view of
the Chri<U+017F>tian, before he <U+017F>hould know
that <U+017F>he was there. But <U+017F>he made too
great a noi<U+017F>e at her entrance, and the
<hi>Cavalier</hi> let her know, he had perceiv'd
her, by <U+017F>aluting her, as he did, after
the Turki<U+017F>h mode: <hi>Laura</hi> arrived the
<U+017F>ame time from the other <U+017F>ide, and
going to the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tre,</hi> went to whi<U+017F>per
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who was not able <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to expre<U+017F>s the plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he took
in <U+017F>eeing this Chri<U+017F>tian, and the Charms
that appear'd in his Per<U+017F>on. As for
him, he was <U+017F>trangely perplext at a
vi<U+017F>it of this nature, where he could
neither <U+017F>ee, nor <U+017F>peak to the Party he
vi<U+017F>ited. He went, he came, he turn'd
about as de<U+017F>ired, and at the end of
the Shew, went <U+017F>ilently to the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tre,</hi>
and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
having <U+017F>een a <U+017F>hadow of her through
the Curtain, he told her a thou<U+017F>and
pretty Stories, a thou<U+017F>and Gallantries
to oblige her to afford him a view, for
<U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood <hi>Italian,</hi> and <U+017F>poke it
pretty well, having learnt it of <hi>Laura.</hi>
She was very well pleas'd to hear the
<hi>Count</hi> <U+017F>peak, and heartily laught at it,
but an<U+017F>wered not a word, nor had the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103330:26"/>
Curtain drawn. The <hi>Count</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
and accounting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lo<U+017F>t he <U+017F>pent in that manner,
<U+017F>eem'd to fret and be angry, and in a
frank and free way told her, he <U+017F>hould
die of the Phanta<U+017F>ie, as the People of
that Country, if <U+017F>he denied him this
favour, and that at la<U+017F>t he would with
his own hand draw that trouble<U+017F>om
Curtain: and he had certainly done
it, if <hi>Laura,</hi> who fear'd the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
might take it ill, had not hindred
him. But <hi>Laura</hi> was mi<U+017F>taken, and
her Lady gave her not thanks for her
pains.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Maxim among the Women
of that Country, not to <U+017F>in of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
again<U+017F>t the Rules of their duty;
but pre<U+017F>s them a little, and offer them
the lea<U+017F>t violence, they will pre<U+017F>ently
yield without any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: their
excu<U+017F>e is, that nature is weak, that
men know it well enough, and are
very much to blame to pre<U+017F>s them <U+017F>o
home: that if there be harm done, it
mu<U+017F>t be laid to their <U+017F>core, who cau<U+017F>e
them to do it, and not to them who
are ignorant of it, and innocent in the
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. <hi>Laura</hi> not well ver<U+017F>t in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103330:27"/>
u<U+017F>e of this Maxim, committed a fault,
when <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he had been di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
her duty. The amorous <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
would have been ravi<U+017F>h'd with
joy to have been <U+017F>een by the Chri<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and the officious Slave <U+017F>poil'd all
by a piece of u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s di<U+017F>cretion. But
her Lady was willing to receive the
mi<U+017F>carriage, and <U+017F>atisfie in <U+017F>ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
the extream de<U+017F>ire her dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian
had to <U+017F>ee her; <U+017F>he gave him
leave to ask what he plea<U+017F>ed, to make
him amends for the rigour of the
cu<U+017F>tom of that Country, which made
it undecent for her Sex to <U+017F>hew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to any but their Husband. The
<hi>Count</hi> pre<U+017F>ently de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>he would at
lea<U+017F>t do him the honour of <U+017F>hewing
him one of her fair hands: The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
no <U+017F>ooner heard him, but lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Curtain a little, <U+017F>he gave
him her hand over the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tre.</hi> The
young <hi>Count</hi> was <U+017F>o charmed with this
favour, that tran<U+017F>ported with joy, he
laid his knee to the ground, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed
her hand with <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; that the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> equally tran<U+017F>ported, wrung his
hand, pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it <U+017F>o hard, to let him
know <U+017F>he approved of what he did.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103330:27"/>
She was not over careful to keep her
<U+017F>elf un<U+017F>een; and having put forth her
arm, <U+017F>he could not choo<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appear to him in part by one
chance or other (to which perhaps <U+017F>he
contributed a little.) Her Gallant
could have wi<U+017F>h'd he had had a full
<U+017F>ight of her, but thinking he had
enough for the fir<U+017F>t time, he would
not adventure to de<U+017F>ire any more. The
plea<U+017F>ure the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> took in the <U+017F>ight
of him, was <U+017F>o great, and <U+017F>o charming,
that <U+017F>he could have willingly pa<U+017F>t that
night with him. But knowing that
many eyes were upon her, and that
<U+017F>he lived where men are extreamly
given to jealou<U+017F>ie, and e<U+017F>pecially of
their Wives, <U+017F>he had apprehen<U+017F>ions of
being Lampoon'd in her own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <U+017F>taying <U+017F>o long in the <hi>Alcove,</hi>
at a time <U+017F>o un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for receiving
a vi<U+017F>it. And <hi>Laura</hi> had told her, 'twas
time to withdraw. But how cruel a
thing 'tis to be forced to part from that
which we love? it cannot be done
without pain and regret. Still <U+017F>he
found <U+017F>ome little pretence or other to
<U+017F>tay him a little longer; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he
pretented him with a Gold Chain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103330:28"/>
be<U+017F>et with Jewels, and told him obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
it was not fit a Slave like him
<U+017F>hould wear any other. The happy
<hi>Count</hi> better <U+017F>atisfy'd with this Chain,
than if <U+017F>he had given him the Crown
of <hi>Tunis,</hi> an<U+017F>wered her Gallantry, and
the favour <U+017F>he did him with the mo<U+017F>t
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate and the mo<U+017F>t grateful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
imaginable. And <U+017F>eeing the
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of parting, he took his leave
of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and withdrew with
<hi>Laura,</hi> who accompanied him to the
Gate of the Apartment.</p>
               <p>Pre<U+017F>ents among the <hi>Turks,</hi> are the
fir<U+017F>t Evidences of affections, and often
pa<U+017F>s for declarations of love. <hi>Laura,</hi>
who knew it well enough, made the
<hi>Count</hi> <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, before parting, what
that meant which he had received
from the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> and that he was
not to doubt, having heard and <U+017F>een
<U+017F>o much of her, but <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately
lov'd him. Yet he was to take heed,
and believe he had need of abundance
of di<U+017F>cretion, to deal with the Women
of that Country, who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
love is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o violent, that they
ob<U+017F>erve no bounds; that the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
was indeed the mo<U+017F>t rational <U+017F>he had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103330:28"/>

mo<U+017F>t wit, yet tender and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate as
the re<U+017F>t. That <U+017F>he and he would be
immutably ruined, if the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who had

once have the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of the
Intrigue. That there was not in the

honour than he; and that all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
he had for him, would not <U+017F>ave
him from his indignation, if he once
came to know he had <U+017F>een his Wife.</p>
               <p>As much taken as our young <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was with the plea<U+017F>ant beginnings
of his Amours, and for all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings
at tho<U+017F>e evident kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es
he had received from the greate<U+017F>t
Beauty under Heaven, yet he could
not forbear reflecting on <hi>Laura</hi>'s good
coun<U+017F>els, but went mu<U+017F>ing along the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> what cour<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould take,
what means he <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o
dangerous a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring him to ruin and confu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> going to one of
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, met him by the way,
and <U+017F>eeing him pa<U+017F>s by without <U+017F>o
much as <U+017F>aluting him, he pre<U+017F>ently fell
a laughing, and taking him by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103330:29"/>
arm. <hi>Now,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>I <U+017F>ee that you are
in love.</hi> The Count being confounded
at his <U+017F>urprizing him in that ca<U+017F>e,
made excu<U+017F>es for his fault. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
made an<U+017F>wer, that if he de<U+017F>ir'd to be
pardon'd, he mu<U+017F>t freely confe<U+017F>s the
truth, and acknowledge him<U+017F>elf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
di<U+017F>ordered at the Merits and
Beauty of <hi>Laura: More Sir</hi> (<U+017F>aid the
Count with a very deep <U+017F>igh) <hi>than you
can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly expre<U+017F>s or imagine.</hi> But it being
late, and the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> not willing to <U+017F>tay,
he deferred the more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
to another opportunity, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>s'd
him to his Lodging. This was
a great happine<U+017F>s, and no le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ure
to the young Lover, who was not then
in condition to give the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Amours. Part of that
night he pa<U+017F>s'd walking in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as if he had intended to come to
a Re<U+017F>olution before he went to bed.
It was not the fear of death, or mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that troubled him, but the
horrour of ingratitude; and having
received <U+017F>o much kindne<U+017F>s from the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> thought it inexcu<U+017F>able in him to
have any unju<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igns on his Wife:
<hi>But,</hi> then <U+017F>ays he, <hi><U+017F>hould I not be the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103330:29"/>
mo<U+017F>t ungrateful of men, <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>light the
affection of <U+017F>o charming a Per<U+017F>on, to whom,
if I con<U+017F>ider her Obligations according to
their value, I owe more than to the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a?
<hi>And is it not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to <U+017F>ee, and to
love her within bounds, <U+017F>o as to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
on the one <U+017F>ide and the other? No, no,
if there be ingratitude in that, I cannot
help it, there is nothing in the World can
excu<U+017F>e me to the</hi> Sultane<U+017F>s, <hi>and love ought
to make my excu<U+017F>e with the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a.</p>
               <p>This was the la<U+017F>t Combate between
gratitude and love in the heart of the
Count; the la<U+017F>t carried the day, and
going to bed thereupon, he re<U+017F>ted
very well. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o deeply
in love, that he <U+017F>hould not be able to
deny it, was the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>poke to
him, to return again that day to the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> Lodgings: he gave him the
Key of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and laughing,
told him, he need not make <U+017F>uch
ha<U+017F>te to come back, if he found as
much plea<U+017F>ure as he wi<U+017F>ht him there:
but that he mu<U+017F>t have a care, he did
not engro<U+017F>s all the love to him<U+017F>elf,
but he <U+017F>hould give <hi>Laura</hi> <U+017F>ome part,
unle<U+017F>s he were minded to langui<U+017F>h,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103330:30"/>
as he had done, a long time to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>The amorous <hi>Italian</hi> went <U+017F>traight
to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and <hi>Laura,</hi> who waited
for him, told him at his arrival, he
might pa<U+017F>s to the <U+017F>ame Chamber he
had been in, and that <U+017F>he would give
her Lady notice of his coming; but
<U+017F>he not having the patience of waiting
<U+017F>o long, was got already into the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove.</hi>
The Count having an extream
curio<U+017F>ity, and longing for a <U+017F>ight of
that place, thought it convenient for
the purpo<U+017F>e, to make u<U+017F>e of that time,
when he believed the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> was
ab<U+017F>ent; and coming up to the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tre,</hi>
gently took up the Curtain. But how
was he <U+017F>urprized to <U+017F>ee on the <U+017F>udden,
that charming Per<U+017F>on in a po<U+017F>ture
the mo<U+017F>t capable of any, to make one
in love.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hall not trouble you with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cription
of the <hi>Alcove,</hi> which being a
Room of State for the Wife of <U+017F>o pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F><U+017F>ant
a Lord, you may ea<U+017F>ily believe,
was very noble and rich: It was rai<U+017F>ed
a foot higher than the Chamber; the
approach to it being by a <U+017F>pace cover'd
with a fair Turky Carpet, checkquer'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103330:30"/>
with little <U+017F>quares of Damask wrought
with Gold. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> lay on a
Bed of Damask of like work; and
having de<U+017F>ign'd to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf that
day to the Count, <U+017F>he had not forgot
to put her <U+017F>elf in an equipage and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
capable to charm him at fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ight: <U+017F>he had turned her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Balli<U+017F>ter,</hi> leaning her head
carele<U+017F>tly on her left arm, which you
might clearly <U+017F>ee in her great Tiffany
<U+017F>leeve after the Turki<U+017F>h mode. Her
black hair was partly pleated with
great ropes of Pearl, parting down on
her Brea<U+017F>t, and part on her <U+017F>houlders,
and <U+017F>et off the clearne<U+017F>s of her delicate
Complexion (vying with the Snow in
whitene<U+017F>s) to <U+017F>o much advantage, that
it wrought wonderful effects in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
She had about her body, a
<U+017F>mall Gold Bodice only, her bo<U+017F>om
being half open, and the re<U+017F>t cover'd
with a piece of fine Tiffany, like an
Amazons Scarf: all was vi<U+017F>ible from
her Neck to her Brea<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
to behold, that it had been
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for an eye, having <U+017F>een it,
(as the Count did) to e<U+017F>cape being
enamour'd of it: <U+017F>he had on her head,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103330:31"/>
plumes of <U+017F>everal colours, and in the
mid<U+017F>t of them a cre<U+017F>cent of Silver.
Her Coat was of a light Stuff Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Gold after the fa<U+017F>hion of
the Country, with Diamond Buckles
to tuck it up at the knee: her Leg was
half naked, and the re<U+017F>t covered with
Buskins all laid over with Diamonds
and Pearls; in a word, <U+017F>he was all <U+017F>o
Rich, <U+017F>o Gallant, <U+017F>o full of Charms,
that the poor <hi>Count</hi> was utterly undone
at the <U+017F>ight. His joy and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment
were vi<U+017F>ible to her in that confu<U+017F>ion of
action and words, in which he was <U+017F>o
mi<U+017F>erably plung'd, that he knew not
what was become of him<U+017F>elf, nor what
he would <U+017F>ay to her. But falling into
an Exta<U+017F>ie, and wholly <U+017F>wallowed up
with admiration, his Eyes and his
Sighs were Orators for him. The fair
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, would,
with a Handkerchief <U+017F>he had in her
hand, have covered her face, and hid
from him part of the confu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he
was in. But the happy Lover, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
courage by degrees, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
his arm betwixt the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tres,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
her from it. <hi>Once you might have
had rea<U+017F>on Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>to have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103330:31"/>
kept from my <U+017F>ight tho<U+017F>e trea<U+017F>ures of love,
as knowing full well that no man can <U+017F>ee
them without dying for love of them,
but now 'tis too late to conceal them from
me. I have <U+017F>een more than any heart is
able to bear, without yielding it <U+017F>elf; and
it would be extream cruelty in you, not to
compleat what is <U+017F>o happily begun.</hi> As
the <hi>Count</hi> was <U+017F>peaking to her in this
manner, <U+017F>he look'd upon him with
eyes <U+017F>o tender and piercing, that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>eemed willing to execute what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired.
The crafty Count having <U+017F>eiz'd
one of her hands, (to which, as he
look'd upon it, he gave a thou<U+017F>and
amorous ki<U+017F><U+017F>es) by little and little drew
it out <U+017F>o far on his <U+017F>ide, with <U+017F>o feeble
re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> that <U+017F>he
came at la<U+017F>t to lean her head on the
<hi>Balli<U+017F>tre</hi> ju<U+017F>t over again<U+017F>t the head of
the <hi>Count.</hi> Then it was, he had full
liberty to take a view at his lea<U+017F>ure
of tho<U+017F>e Beauties that put him to
amazement, and ravi<U+017F>hed him with
<U+017F>uch joy as he had never before been
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of. As ill luck would have it,
the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tres</hi> were <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that not
any two of them <U+017F>tood half the head
di<U+017F>tance one from the other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103330:32"/>
the two Lovers meeting half way,
made a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>lip through a great
number of Ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, the mo<U+017F>t charming
and <U+017F>weet that Lovers e're ta<U+017F>ted. The
<hi>Count</hi> being naturally bold, made one
Liberty but a <U+017F>tep to another, and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he was permitted to do, and
the plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he took in it, he pre<U+017F>s'd
his amorous temerity <U+017F>o far, that what
he did may pa<U+017F>s for half an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Till then their entertainment
was made up of dumb engagements, a
thou<U+017F>and times more eloquent than
the fine<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions in the World.
Their eyes, their <U+017F>ighs, their actions,
their toyes had <U+017F>poken a Language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
enough to per<U+017F>wade both
they loved one another intirely. They
had no need of other conver<U+017F>ation;
yet, <hi>Laura</hi> arriving, they changed it
a little, but they <U+017F>poke before her the
mo<U+017F>t tender, and mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate things
you can imagine. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> who
had that confidence in her as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing from her, was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at her coming. But the <hi>Count,</hi>
who took not <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure in
the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es though very obliging,
as in tho<U+017F>e dumb entertainments, made
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103330:32"/>
a <U+017F>ign to <hi>Laura</hi> to take the other turn;
at which the <hi>Saltane<U+017F>s</hi> <U+017F>eeming a little
angry, let down the Curtain, and <U+017F>o
fa<U+017F>tned it behind, that he could not
take it up. But this being in Je<U+017F>t, and
to provoke his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion the more, her
rigour was <U+017F>hort lived, and Peace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
made more firm than ever.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t favours give a priviledge
for others, and a kind of right not
only to hope, but demand them: The
<hi>Count,</hi> to be reveng'd of his <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi>
for the piece of <U+017F>pite <U+017F>he had done
him, thru<U+017F>t both his Arms between
the <hi>Balli<U+017F>tres,</hi> and embracing her on
the <U+017F>udden, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that he forced Blood out of her
lips. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> was <U+017F>o far from
complaining of the rudene<U+017F>s of his
Care<U+017F><U+017F>es, that being charm'd with the
plea<U+017F>ure of them, <U+017F>he carefully <U+017F>aved
all the Blood on her Handkerchief to
pre<U+017F>erve it as a Trophy to <U+017F>hew <hi>Laura,</hi>
as a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible mark of the extream
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion her dear <hi>Alexander</hi> had for
her.</p>
               <p>Let me acquaint you by the way
with a rarity of tho<U+017F>e parts; that for
a Woman to have been beaten by a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103330:33"/>
Man <U+017F>he loves, is e<U+017F>teemed in that
Country a great evidence of affection
to the party beaten. I confe<U+017F>s <U+017F>uch
favours are <U+017F>omewhat rude, but 'tis
the temper of the Country, and <U+017F>uch
is their cu<U+017F>tom: As for the Blood that
came from the lips of the Amorous
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> we may believe it proceeded
from a tran<U+017F>port of Love. With us,
one may be bitten, but not beaten
through extremity of this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;
but blows exceed the limits of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
and that Woman mu<U+017F>t be an
<hi>African,</hi> that loves to be <U+017F>o Courted.
'Tis a fa<U+017F>hion will never pa<U+017F>s in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and though they u<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ometimes, yet
never to oblige Women; none of whom
that I know of, were ever plea<U+017F>ed
with a ba<U+017F>tinade. The re<U+017F>t of this
vi<U+017F>it having been <U+017F>pent in foolery and
toys, though <U+017F>ometimes of much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of Love, I will not
trouble you with the particulars. <hi>Laura,</hi>
who was not far di<U+017F>tant from the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
appeared at the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ign of their
plea<U+017F>ure to have her attend. The
Count and the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> bid each other
adieu with the greate<U+017F>t kindne<U+017F>s ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
And <hi>Laura</hi> brought him to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103330:33"/>
the Door of the Apartment, <U+017F>o deep
in Love, he <U+017F>carce knew where he
was. He went directly from thence
to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who in<U+017F>tantly ob<U+017F>erved
the vi<U+017F>ible change of the Count's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sadne<U+017F>s and Melancholy into a
tender and langui<U+017F>hing air; at which
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> taking occa<U+017F>ion to laugh,
<U+017F>aid, <hi>Well,</hi> Alexander, <hi>hath Love plaid
his part well?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it your pain, or your plea<U+017F>ure hath
<U+017F>o charm'd you to day? I confe<U+017F>s, Sir,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he <hi>with a <U+017F>igh, it is the plea<U+017F>ure
I have met with; but plea<U+017F>ure, I fear, which
may co<U+017F>t me much pain.</hi> The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that to be the Confident of
the Count's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, might be of <U+017F>ome
u<U+017F>e, took him by the hand, and led
him to the Garden, to take a turn in
the Walks. He fell pre<U+017F>ently upon
the <U+017F>ubject of his good Fortune, and
prayed him to tell him truly, how his
Affairs <U+017F>tood. The Count having his
Heart and his Fancy all full of Love,
with very great ea<U+017F>e gave him <U+017F>uch a
ravi<U+017F>hing de<U+017F>cription of his tendere<U+017F>t
affections, and painted the plea<U+017F>ures
he had taken that Evening <U+017F>o much
to the life, adding his <U+017F>ighs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103330:34"/>
with ge<U+017F>tures and looks
<U+017F>o eloquent and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, that he
awaked in the Soul of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> the
affection he had formerly for <hi>Laura,</hi>
and lately laid a<U+017F>leep. What care <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is taken to cure one of this Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
<U+017F>till there remains enough in the
Heart of a Lover to <U+017F>et it on fire by
the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park that falls on it. The
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Laura</hi>
had not Ice enough in them to quench
all the heat of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s affection.
She had only covered it with a<U+017F>hes, to
pre<U+017F>erve it the better again<U+017F>t another
time: Had the Count acted like a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Lover, he had ea<U+017F>ily fore<U+017F>een,
how tickli<U+017F>h and dangerous a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
it is, to make <U+017F>uch repre<U+017F>entations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Per<U+017F>ons who are Amorou<U+017F>ly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined;
and e<U+017F>pecially before a Man
whom he had rea<U+017F>on to con<U+017F>ider as a
Rival, and in who<U+017F>e Power it was to
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him as he plea<U+017F>ed. But the
truth is, that in <U+017F>peaking thus of <hi>Laura,</hi>
he thought he hazarded nothing of
his own; he had really no kindne<U+017F>s
for her, but hoped to do his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
the better, in making the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
believe that he lov'd her; which is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103330:34"/>
the rea<U+017F>on he did not carry him<U+017F>elf in
this with <U+017F>o much caution, as he would
have done in another conjuncture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>lept not that Night. <hi>Laura</hi>
appear'd a thou<U+017F>and times more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om
and charming, in the de<U+017F>cription
of the Count, than ever <U+017F>he had done
in his Eye at full <U+017F>ight. He e<U+017F>teemed
him<U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate of Men,
not only for that he had quitted the
pur<U+017F>uit, but had contributed <U+017F>o much
to <U+017F>ee her in the Arms of another:
Hereupon jealou<U+017F>ie pre<U+017F>ently po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t
him, attended with a train of <U+017F>pite,
rage, and peevi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s to torment him.
What great <U+017F>hame, thought he, could
ever happen to a Man as he was, who
never found re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from a Woman,
than to have been <U+017F>lighted by a Slave,
who was his dependent, and had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to another Slave as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>een him? For after the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<hi>Alexander</hi> had made, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
made no doubt but all was concluded;
he had fancies of this kind that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him extreamly: and if he did
not then hate the Count, 'tis certain,
he retained not for him that kindne<U+017F>s
he had formerly expre<U+017F>t towards him:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103330:35"/>
And as for <hi>Laura,</hi> though he was then
more in Love with her than ever, he
had a pique again<U+017F>t her, and could
not forbear reproaching her all Night,
for her want of di<U+017F>cretion in making
greater account of a mans kindne<U+017F>s,
that could do her no Service, than of
his, by whom <U+017F>he might have made
her Fortune. The<U+017F>e thoughts were
followed by others concerning his
Per<U+017F>on. He accu<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf of ba<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and weakne<U+017F>s of Heart, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him<U+017F>elf with the thoughts of a
Creature that <U+017F>o little de<U+017F>erved his
e<U+017F>teem, or to intend to hinder the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of two Lovers, who<U+017F>e Love
he him<U+017F>elf had cau<U+017F>ed and promoted.
All this notwith<U+017F>tanding, he went on
the morrow with the Count to the
<hi>Seraglio;</hi> but for no other end, but to
ob<U+017F>erve the countenance of <hi>Laura,</hi>
who <U+017F>urprized to <U+017F>ee him come: <hi>This
is extraordinary, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he laughing,
<hi>twice in one week: What will People <U+017F>ay
of it? As for you, <U+017F>aid the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a, <hi>you
will <U+017F>ay no ill of it, I come in <U+017F>o good
Company; and <U+017F>hould others believe as
formerly, that I come for love of you,
you know tis not for my <U+017F>elf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103330:35"/>
you are the more obliged to me. Laura</hi>
very civilly thanked him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
They fell then all three into a
little di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Gallantry, wherein
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o many kind things
to <hi>Laura,</hi> that <U+017F>he might under<U+017F>tand
part of that Amorous trouble he was
in, if <U+017F>he had mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted it; but he
delivered him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>uch an air,
that his Complements, and kind Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
were taken for meer effects
of his good humour. But the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s
coming thither, being under pretence
of <U+017F>eeing the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> he could not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
without giving her a Vi<U+017F>it; but
he was not long with her, being not
able to re<U+017F>t till he return'd to the two
Lovers, which he did with all the
<U+017F>peed in his power. He told <hi>Laura</hi> a
thou<U+017F>and things more obliging than
formerly; and having highly care<U+017F><U+017F>ed
her, gave her at parting <U+017F>uch a look,
that if <U+017F>he had made the lea<U+017F>t reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it, <U+017F>he might have ea<U+017F>ily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the kindne<U+017F>s he had formerly
for her took fire afre<U+017F>h with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
than ever; but <U+017F>he could not
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect in the lea<U+017F>t he would trouble
her any more, after the kindne<U+017F>s he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103330:36"/>
had expre<U+017F>t for his <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been the in<U+017F>trument of the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion between her and the
Count. She took all for Gallantry,
and made it the <U+017F>ubject of raillery with
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> to whom <U+017F>he gave an
account of all that had pa<U+017F>t with the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and with <hi>Alexander.</hi> The fair
<hi>Turk</hi> went that Evening to bed, ill <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with her fate, having been di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of an Entertainment <U+017F>he
had expected, as plea<U+017F>ant as that <U+017F>he
had received the day before from her
dear Chri<U+017F>tian; <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
lament the unluckine<U+017F>s of the
Vi<U+017F>it given her by a man who Courted
other Women, and <U+017F>eemed to have
been born to incommode and give
trouble only to her. <hi>Laura</hi> an<U+017F>wered
in raillery, She had little rea<U+017F>on to
complain of it to her, to who<U+017F>e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance
<U+017F>he was beholding for a <U+017F>ight
of her Lover: <hi>Ah</hi> Laura, <U+017F>aid the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s, who knows for what rea<U+017F>on he
hath been <U+017F>o complai<U+017F>ant? You may very
well believe, it was not to oblige me. I
believe <U+017F>o,</hi> Madam, <hi>replyed</hi> Laura, <hi>but
you are obliged to him however, and ought
to thank him for me.</hi> After this little
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103330:36"/>
raillery, they fell to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, what
could have brought the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> thither
that evening; and could not imagine,
but it was in Complement to the
Count.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> by this time was fallen
into a deep Melancholy, <U+017F>eldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
but when he walked in the
Garden, <U+017F>ometimes alone, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and then not a
word of <hi>Laura,</hi> nor any di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of
going again to the Apartment of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s:</hi> This troubled our Lover,
who be<U+017F>ides his affliction for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the <U+017F>ight of a Per<U+017F>on he
loved better than his Life, and cea<U+017F>ing
to <U+017F>ee her, mu<U+017F>t cea<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o to live; had
a thou<U+017F>and tormenting <U+017F>urmi<U+017F>es and
trouble<U+017F>ome fancies upon the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s
change of humour, which he could
not attribute to any thing but his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken <U+017F>ome umbrage and jealou<U+017F>ie
of him, on the account of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s.</hi>
The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> and her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
were no le<U+017F>s tormented on the
other hand; they had <U+017F>een a fir<U+017F>t, a
<U+017F>econd, a third, and a fourth long
day pa<U+017F>s without a <U+017F>ight of their <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi>
Lovers are very exact Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103330:37"/>
and keep reckoning of the very
moments, but account nothing more
tedious than a day of ab<U+017F>ence. What
<U+017F>hould be the meaning of all this,
<U+017F>aid they one to the other, having a
thou<U+017F>and fears upon them, though
they knew not of what: 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to keep any thing <U+017F>ecret
in places of that nature. Yet they
could not imagine they had given any
occa<U+017F>ion of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, or that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
in the Apartment had made the
lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of their Intrigue. At
la<U+017F>t, on the fifth day, after abundance
of Affliction, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> came to <U+017F>ee
them; but, the mi<U+017F>chief of it was,
that he came alone. Be<U+017F>ides, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<U+017F>o dull, <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>o much
out of humour, they made no more
doubt but he had <U+017F>melt out the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
they held with the Count.
But that which gave them the killing
blow, and rai<U+017F>ed their fears to the
height, was, that <hi>Laura</hi> having, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her cu<U+017F>tom, waited the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> out of the Chamber, and asked
him, what he had done with her dear
<hi>Eunuch?</hi> I am jealous of him (<U+017F>aid
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> making no <U+017F>tay) I need tell
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103330:37"/>
you no more: <hi>Laura</hi> made ha<U+017F>t to
give her <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> the Alarm, and told
her, there was no more doubt to be
made, but jealou<U+017F>ie was the cau<U+017F>e of
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s not bringing <hi>Alexander</hi> with
him, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> him<U+017F>elf having told her
<U+017F>o that in<U+017F>tant; tho<U+017F>e who are guilty,
are ea<U+017F>ily frightned, and fear hath this
property, that it <U+017F>o confounds the
imagination, that the lighte<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
are taken for clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tionable
truths. With what <U+017F>ighs,
what tears did the poor <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
her <U+017F>elf; yet not <U+017F>o much for the
ill con<U+017F>equences <U+017F>he might apprehend
from the jealou<U+017F>ie of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> as for
the fear <U+017F>he had, that if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
jealous of the Chri<U+017F>tian, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould never have a <U+017F>ight of him more.
She did heartily wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>he could have
written to him, but there are few
tru<U+017F>ty Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers to be found in tho<U+017F>e
places, where there is cau<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t
every one you conver<U+017F>e with; and
every Eye that <U+017F>ees you, is a <U+017F>py on
your actions, at lea<U+017F>t if not gained by
Money or Kindne<U+017F>s, wherein, after
all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care, you may be deceived,
as <U+017F>he was in this trouble. <hi>Laura</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103330:38"/>
a Note from the Count, brought
her by an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and carried it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to <U+017F>hew it the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> being
in the<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>Madam, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> every day more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
than other, is plea<U+017F>ed to grant me
the honour of walking with you this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> I
know not whether you can di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e with
your <U+017F>elf till then. Let us take the hour
you think mo<U+017F>t proper. He will be there
with one of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. Send me word,
if you plea<U+017F>e, if I may expect this favour
from you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> would never have thought
of this walk, but out of the extream
de<U+017F>ire he had to know certainly, how
<hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>tood affected one
to the other; and that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him<U+017F>elf of what they <U+017F>hould di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.
The Garden was a place very
fit for his de<U+017F>ign, e<U+017F>pecially by Night,
where he could hear without being
<U+017F>een. He had made the propo<U+017F>al to
the Count, in confidence he would
receive it with a great deal of joy,
which in appearance he did, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of any great <U+017F>atisfaction
from the Adventure, it being <U+017F>carce
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103330:38"/>
probable the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> would permit
<hi>Laura</hi> to come. But that which really
troubled him, was the opinion he had,
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was certainly jealous of his
Wife, <U+017F>ince he gave him <U+017F>o clear proof
of his unwillingne<U+017F>s that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee
<hi>Laura</hi> at her Lodgings any more.</p>
               <p>The Que<U+017F>tion then was, how to
write to the <hi>Slave,</hi> to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e her for
the walk. But the Count having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Billet, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>ent it by an
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> and <U+017F>tay'd for the An<U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> read the Billet, and
was of opinion with her Gallant, that it
was for Love of her the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
he <U+017F>hould come any more to
<U+017F>ee <hi>Laura</hi> in her Apartment. It was
long ere they came to a re<U+017F>olution in
the point, whether <hi>Laura</hi> <U+017F>hould agree
to the a<U+017F><U+017F>ignation: <hi>Laura</hi> very wi<U+017F>ely
thought it better not to go, but the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> wholly led by her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
and too deeply in Love, to act any
thing with rea<U+017F>on that concerned her
affection, notwith<U+017F>tanding any thing
<hi>Laura</hi> could <U+017F>ay, made her write him
this An<U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>It were to act the part of a very ill Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
to be all alone in the Garden, while
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103330:39"/>
others are diverting them<U+017F>elves there: I
con<U+017F>ent for pity, to come and bear you
company, but on condition that you will
be wi<U+017F>e, and that we be at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance
from the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I would not be
known by her, that he brings with him. If
you can promi<U+017F>e me the<U+017F>e two things, I am
for you after the fourth Prayer, when the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> is a Bed. Adieu.</p>
               <p>This An<U+017F>wer was beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the Count, who rejoyced
extreamly at the plea<U+017F>ure he promi<U+017F>ed
him<U+017F>elf with the Slave, from the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> while they
<U+017F>hould continue in the Garden.</p>
               <p>Night being come, and the fourth
Prayer over, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> told him, he
might go, and bring <hi>Laura</hi> to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
while he went for one of his
<hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> who was lodged on the
other <U+017F>ide. It is the cu<U+017F>tom of the
Grandees of that Country, among a
multitude of Women they have in
their <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when they have not a
particular inclination for any one, to
take this to day, and another to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
and having lo<U+017F>t the ta<U+017F>t of Love,
to <U+017F>earch for Plea<U+017F>ure in change and

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103330:39"/>
It may be ea<U+017F>ily imagined, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
received this Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
with a great deal of joy, and was in
no <U+017F>mall ha<U+017F>te to go to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi>
Lodgings. She who was charmed at
the <U+017F>ight of him, could not expre<U+017F>s
her joy without a thou<U+017F>and tran<U+017F>ports
of Love, and the mo<U+017F>t tender care<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
a mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lady could po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
make her deare<U+017F>t Lover. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did his part to admiration, not
only returning tran<U+017F>port for tran<U+017F>port,
and care<U+017F>s for care<U+017F>s, but excelling his
pattern, Love working in him, or he
in the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> <U+017F>uch things as gave her
very great <U+017F>atisfaction. It may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
peradventure that two Per<U+017F>ons
<U+017F>o little acquainted, <U+017F>hould in <U+017F>o few
days become <U+017F>o very good Friends.
But we mu<U+017F>t know, Love in the<U+017F>e hot
Countries makes far quicker progre<U+017F>s
than in the cold, where the Winds,
and the Snow, and the Rain <U+017F>poil his
Wings, and hinder his flight: Whereas
on the contrary, the Sun is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>till at the height, and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a tender Infant, and going al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
naked, thrives there the better,
where he finds Hearts very well

di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, and ready to take fire.</p>
               <p>The Count, who could not <U+017F>tay long
there, was willing to be<U+017F>tow the <U+017F>mall
time he had to <U+017F>pend with the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s</hi>
in gentle reproaches for her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>Laura</hi> to come and walk with
him. You have, <U+017F>aid he, a very good
opinion of my Affection, <hi>Madam,</hi> or
el<U+017F>e you love me with a great deal of
indifference, that this does not in the
lea<U+017F>t trouble you at all. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
an<U+017F>wered, <U+017F>he relied not <U+017F>o much on his
Fidelity, as on <hi>Laura's</hi> Di<U+017F>cretion,
whom <U+017F>he knew too well, to think <U+017F>he
would betray her. Look you to your
<U+017F>elf, as for her I place a confidence in
her, and if you do your Duty, I am
per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he will not be wanting in
hers. Having thus <U+017F>poken, <U+017F>he would
not detain him longer for fear of the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> but retired to the Chamber. The
happy Lover, very well pleas'd with
the lucky moment he had pa<U+017F>t with
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> asked <hi>Laura</hi> if <U+017F>he were
ready; She made him an<U+017F>wer, he <U+017F>hould
not <U+017F>tay for her longer than while <U+017F>he
fetched her <hi>Barnus,</hi> which is a kind of
Hood that covers them from Head to
Foot. The Count <U+017F>eeing her return

mufled up in that Garment, went his
way before, according to their cu<U+017F>tom
there, and <U+017F>he followed: He <U+017F>aid not
a word to her while they were in the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> for fear of being over-heard,
and di<U+017F>covered; but being arrived in
the Garden, where they had liberty
enough, <hi>Who will believe, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid
he, <hi>but we made an Amorous a<U+017F><U+017F>ignation,
being come to a place of Rendezvouz <U+017F>o
fit for the purpo<U+017F>e. And the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>will
not fail to think us the happie<U+017F>t Lovers in
the World. Laura</hi> made him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
but kept on her way, till they
came to the Bower that was a<U+017F><U+017F>igned
them at a convenient di<U+017F>tance from
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s, as <hi>Laura</hi> had de<U+017F>ired. The
Count gave her his hand, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well every turn in tho<U+017F>e
Walks, which he vi<U+017F>ited almo<U+017F>t every

Turf made for the purpo<U+017F>e. <hi>Then,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, <hi>this, Madam, is to try a mans

Surely the</hi> Sultane<U+017F>s <hi>will hence-forward
re<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</hi> The Count
made a pau<U+017F>e, expecting her an<U+017F>wer,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103330:41"/>
but not receiving a word from her, he
proceeded, telling her, I thought we had
not been <U+017F>o debarred the plea<U+017F>ures of an
A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation, but we might have enjoy'd
that of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but for ought I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
you mean to follow the fa<U+017F>hion of
<hi>Turky;</hi> &amp; <U+017F>ince 'tis a favour in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for a Woman to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf, or

the one and the other: But while we
are together, I pray let us live after the
mode of our Country, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>Turki<U+017F>h.</hi> To do otherwi<U+017F>e

and more, I believe, than you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> or <U+017F>he expects at
your hands. Away, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid
he, taking her by the <hi>Barnus,</hi> with this

tell me <U+017F>ome News of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> or
if you plea<U+017F>e, of the Adventures
brought, you hither, which from the
day I fir<U+017F>t had the honour to <U+017F>ee you,
I have had an extream longing to ask
you: This you will not deny me, if
you think I may be any way u<U+017F>eful
to you, as I doubt not but I may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Country-man, and <U+017F>o well
e<U+017F>teemed by the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> as to be able to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103330:41"/>
do you <U+017F>ome Service. All this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o obliging for <hi>Laura,</hi> <U+017F>he heard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
replying a word, or quitting her
<hi>Barnus,</hi> as he had de<U+017F>ired. The Count
<U+017F>eeing this, pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her no further, but
with more <U+017F>erious air <U+017F>aid, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire,
<hi>Madam,</hi> to pa<U+017F>s the Evening in
this manner, it will be very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for me; but I mu<U+017F>t comply. And
removing a few paces from her, he
went and <U+017F>at him down in a corner
of the Bower, where he continued a
while without <U+017F>peaking a word. The
fair Lady fetched a <U+017F>igh, as if <U+017F>he had
been di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at his quitting her.
The <hi>Count</hi> laying hold on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
to be even with her, took his turn
of tormenting, in not an<U+017F>wering her
<U+017F>ighs. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he came to him, took
him by the Arm, and embraced him,
with many grimaces, as if <U+017F>he would
have turned all into ridicule. The
<hi>Count</hi> fell a laughing, and <U+017F>aid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
I be<U+017F>eech you be <U+017F>atisfied with
the Sacrifice I make to Love, without
trying my patience any further; let
us, if you plea<U+017F>e, have a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation,
but an<U+017F>wer me when I <U+017F>peak,
for I do not love talking to my <U+017F>elf.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103330:42"/>
But all would not do; <U+017F>he laughed
under her Hood, and took plea<U+017F>ure in
vexing him. The Count at la<U+017F>t grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient; This is too much, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>ince you will needs
laugh, I'le <U+017F>hew you a trick <U+017F>hall make
you <U+017F>peak in <U+017F>pight of your Heart;
having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he took her in his
Arms, and not being able to take off
her Hood, he u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome Familiarities
with her, would have forced <U+017F>peech
from a Maid of <hi>Laura's</hi> Di<U+017F>cretion
and Mode<U+017F>ty: But the Lady was <U+017F>till
<U+017F>ilent, and <U+017F>o little concerned, that
<U+017F>he <U+017F>carce made any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. At
which the Count was extreamly <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
and after all the e<U+017F>teem he had
for <hi>Laura,</hi> apprehended there might
be a de<U+017F>ign in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and that
he was abu<U+017F>ed: Then it was he did
all in his power to get <U+017F>ight of her
through a little glimmering of light
that came into the Bower. Did the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> know, <U+017F>aid he, the liberty
you allow me, <U+017F>he would give you
no thanks for your <U+017F>ilence, or your
being <U+017F>hie of affording me a <U+017F>ight of
you, which it <U+017F>eems you do to give
me occa<U+017F>ion to attempt greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103330:42"/>
and deny me <U+017F>mall favours to
grant me the principal. The fair Lady
not able to defend her <U+017F>elf longer,
quitted her <hi>Barnus,</hi> and having e<U+017F>cap'd
out of his hands, Ah, little Traytor,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is this the Fidelity you have
promi<U+017F>ed me? Oh Heavens, <hi>Madam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, is it you? It was the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
her <U+017F>elf had taken <hi>Laura's</hi> place, and
you may imagine what a plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
this was to the Count, who
could not on the <U+017F>udden otherwi<U+017F>e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
it than by his exclamations; and
running after her (who fled not too
fa<U+017F>t) he overtook her at the Door of
the Bower, and embracing her mo<U+017F>t
tenderly, My dear <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> <U+017F>aid he
the <U+017F>econd time, is it you? Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he (<U+017F>uffering her <U+017F>elf to be
gently brought back into the Bower)
it is I, who repent me already of what
I have done for you who did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
it. Did you think me <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple,
to expo<U+017F>e into the hands of another,
that which I hold mo<U+017F>t dear in the
World? Do not I <U+017F>ee how ill it is
tru<U+017F>ting of you? Your Con<U+017F>tancy
was very tottering; it was at lea<U+017F>t
half overcome. And had <hi>Laura,</hi> the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103330:43"/>
counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> an<U+017F>wered your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
where would you have been?
Never was Man more confounded
than the <hi>Count</hi> at all the<U+017F>e Reproaches:
He made a free Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>ed
him<U+017F>elf by her carriage towards
him, alledging it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any
Man to have with<U+017F>tood the attaques
<U+017F>he had made. At la<U+017F>t, he carried the
Cau<U+017F>e, all was accommodated, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
made, and Love <U+017F>igned the
Articles.</p>
               <p>To come in <U+017F>earch of a Gallant
(as the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> had done) into a
Garden where <U+017F>he knew her Husband
was pre<U+017F>ent, was an Adventure <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bold: And doubtle<U+017F>s, there are
many Women who will condemn her
conduct as imprudent; but of tho<U+017F>e
who are in Love there, are few, who
being in her place, would not take
the <U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>e. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> though
accompanied with a very Beautiful
Per<U+017F>on, pa<U+017F>t away time <U+017F>omewhat
wor<U+017F>e than the Count: <hi>Chabania</hi> his
<hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> had (be<U+017F>ides Beauty) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wit, and a very taking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which made her pa<U+017F>s for the

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:103330:43"/>
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had formerly been deeply
in Love with her; but Love for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
is not very durable: Her
Patron was not in an humour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
her that Evening, and had not
brought her with him into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but to <U+017F>erve for a pretence to
colour other de<U+017F>igns; <U+017F>he apprehended
as much, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he knew that
<hi>Laura</hi> was in the Garden, which the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> unluckily told her, thinking he
might <U+017F>atisfie her in that point, by
letting her know that <hi>Laura</hi> was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Love with <hi>Alexander,</hi> in who<U+017F>e
company <U+017F>he was. But <hi>Chabania</hi> was
<U+017F>o far from believing it, that <U+017F>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
fancied <hi>Alexander</hi> to be no other
than the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Confident in the affair,
and that he had not brought <hi>Laura</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden but for his Ma<U+017F>ter: <U+017F>he
had been formerly jealous of him, even
to di<U+017F>traction, and I know not how
it came to pa<U+017F>s the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>o over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>een,
as not to have made choice of
<U+017F>ome other of his Women, who might
have been more for his turn on this
occa<U+017F>ion: She was at her wits end for
the <U+017F>mall countenance he gave her;
all the while he was with her <U+017F>he had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103330:44"/>
<U+017F>carcely fewer words from him, and
<U+017F>aw clearly his thoughts were wholly
of <hi>Laura.</hi> This was vexation enough
for a Woman in Love, who knows
her <U+017F>elf hand<U+017F>om, and is high <U+017F>pirited
withal. But that which put her into
ab<U+017F>olute de<U+017F>pair, was, that the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
not able to obtain any truce from his
jealou<U+017F>ie, having <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in
her company, without any care<U+017F>s, or
giving her the lea<U+017F>t evidence of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
though <U+017F>he had more than once
given him occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew it; told
her, he had a longing de<U+017F>ire to go
hearken, and know how the Chri<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the Bower entertained one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<U+017F>he made him no an<U+017F>wer, but
letting him go, <U+017F>he the next minute af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
went another way towards the <U+017F>ame
Bower to ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and <U+017F>ee
what he did there.</p>
               <p>The Nights in that Country are
very clear, e<U+017F>pecially in Summer: the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> notwith<U+017F>tanding all the caution
he had u<U+017F>ed to po<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecurely
near <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quarter, under the
favour of the Hedges that covered his
approach, was perceived by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Laura</hi> in the Bower. She had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103330:44"/>
di<U+017F>covered him by his <U+017F>hadow, and
having made her lover aware of it, he
pre<U+017F>ently went out, and ran to meet
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> to intreat him not to come
any further, but permit him to enjoy
that moment of plea<U+017F>ure he had been
plea<U+017F>ed to procure him. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
not knowing what wind had brought
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> to that <U+017F>ide of the Garden,
and fearing he would come into the
Bower, would not be per<U+017F>waded by
any thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> could <U+017F>ay to
her, to <U+017F>tay after him in the Bower,
but went pre<U+017F>ently out to hide her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in <U+017F>ome corner of the Garden,
where <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he might be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>The mean time the jealous <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi>

laid, <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf to be prevail'd

and returned towards his Bower, as

he was <U+017F>ufficiently amaz'd at mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> but thought <U+017F>he had fled

the Bower to go in <U+017F>earch of her, he

you very waggi<U+017F>h? you would fain have
made me run all about the Garden in
<U+017F>earch of you:</hi> She an<U+017F>wered not a word,
but getting out of his arms, <U+017F>he went
away briskly, and withdrew into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corner of the Bower: the Count
was <U+017F>urprized at this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
being not <U+017F>o gentle as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who loved
him <U+017F>o tenderly; but to undeceive
him<U+017F>elf as <U+017F>oon as he could, and to
find out the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden a
change, he went up to her the <U+017F>econd
time, and taking her by the hand;
<hi>What may be the rea<U+017F>on, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid
he, <hi>that you run away, and hide your <U+017F>elf
from me? there is no fear of the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a;
<hi>he is withdrawn to his quarter, and hath
promi<U+017F>ed not to give us any further di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</hi>
But all this could not make her
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103330:45"/>
an<U+017F>wer a word; <U+017F>o that not knowing
what to think of this rigour, he kneeled
on the ground where <U+017F>he was <U+017F>itting
on a <U+017F>eat of green Turf, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing
her hand, prayed her for loves <U+017F>ake,
to tell him the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed
angry with him; he courted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
her with great pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s,
and <U+017F>he as patiently took it,
but at la<U+017F>t perceiving her laugh a
laughter very different from that of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> he examined her more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knew by the difference of her
<U+017F>hape, and her Cloaths, that he was
mi<U+017F>taken. It was inconceivable, what
a trouble this put him in. He thought
him<U+017F>elf arrived in Fairy-land, to <U+017F>ee
the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t <U+017F>ights in the World. That
<hi>Laura</hi> had been changed into the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s,</hi>
was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprizing as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant,
but that the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> <U+017F>hould be
turned into another Woman, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s, this was
the thing he could not comprehend:
that which troubled him mo<U+017F>t, and
extreamly di<U+017F>quieted him, was the pain
he was in, for not knowing what was
become of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> and the fear
he had, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> might have met her
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103330:46"/>
in the Garden, and known her: this
moved him again to go out in <U+017F>earch
of her, but <hi>Chabania</hi> (for it was <U+017F>he
he had mi<U+017F>taken for the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s)</hi> held
him fa<U+017F>t by the <U+017F>leeve, and <U+017F>taid him,
telling him in the <hi>Moors</hi> Language,
it was not fit for him to quit in that
manner a Lady for whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
expre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>ome affection. The
Count under<U+017F>tood not her language,
prayed her to let him go for fear the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>hould come, and be offended at
his being with her. But all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>he no more under<U+017F>tood his <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
than he her <hi>More<U+017F>que,</hi> and was
<U+017F>o far from letting him go, that <U+017F>he
would have made him <U+017F>it by her, that
<U+017F>he might revenge her <U+017F>elf on the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
for the <U+017F>light he had put upon her.
During this little conte<U+017F>t, which could
not but be <U+017F>omewhat extraordinary
between two Per<U+017F>ons who under<U+017F>tood
not one another, the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> comes
in quite out of breath, and throws her
<U+017F>elf half dead into the arms of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who happened to be in a place
ready to receive her. What frightful
fancies had he then in his head? He
pre<U+017F>ently imagined they were utterly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103330:46"/>
undone, and that <U+017F>he had been di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
But the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> arriving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after, <U+017F>et him right again in <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you run away <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>peaking
to the counterfeit <hi>Laura,</hi> from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
who wi<U+017F>hes you no ill, nor intends
you any; then turning towards <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
he was about to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf
to him for breaking his word, but <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chabania</hi> <U+017F>tand by him, he <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
altered both his mind and his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
asking her in <hi>More<U+017F>que</hi> what
<U+017F>he was come thither for. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him aloud, and gave him a
thou<U+017F>and reproaches for his unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
and weakne<U+017F>s in quitting her, to
follow a Slave that run away from
him. This was a very rare Scene,
and the Dialogue not a little plea<U+017F>ing
to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> but <U+017F>he had not long
to laugh at it, for <hi>Chabania</hi> being vext
to the heart for the <U+017F>light the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had
put upon her, and for what he had
<U+017F>aid to her before her pretended rival,
flew like a Fury upon the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
with that promptitude and <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s,
that neither the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> nor <hi>Alexander,</hi>
who would have <U+017F>taid her, were able
to <U+017F>ave the counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103330:47"/>
<U+017F>omewhat ill handled. The Count
was touched to the quick at this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and no con<U+017F>ideration of life or
of duty, could have prevented him
from having <U+017F>atisfaction, had not his
fear of lo<U+017F>ing the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> prevailed
more upon him than his re<U+017F>entment.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was as angry as he, and
taking the enraged <hi>Chabania</hi> by the
hand, he drew her <U+017F>omewhat rudely
out of the Bower, and led her away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner alone with
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> but embracing her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
<hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, with a pa<U+017F><U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
tone, <hi>what dangers have you gone
through for love of me! what a cruel
a<U+017F><U+017F>ault have you but now endured?</hi> The
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> did nothing but laugh at the
la<U+017F>t adventure <U+017F>he had been in, and told
him <U+017F>he took more plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee
<hi>Chabania</hi>'s de<U+017F>pair, (for whom <U+017F>he had
ever a natural aver<U+017F>ion) than <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>uffered of harm by her outrage and
violence. But <U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ame
time, that <U+017F>he was in extream perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
when <U+017F>he met the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> ranging over
the Garden in <U+017F>earch of that Woman,
and that it was the highe<U+017F>t piece of
good fortune imaginable, that <U+017F>he had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103330:47"/>
her <hi>Barnus</hi> with her, to hide her <U+017F>elf
in. She added that her dear Husband
had <U+017F>aid to her a thou<U+017F>and gallant
things, and had done al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome things
a little extraordinary; but that it was
her good fortune to be not far from
the Bower, and to make her e<U+017F>cape:
<U+017F>he told him further, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
no more doubt of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s
being newly fallen in love with <hi>Laura,</hi>
and that <U+017F>he was very well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of
it by the kindne<U+017F>s of his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions,
and the tran<U+017F>ports <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved him in
at this rencounter; that this was the
true cau<U+017F>e of all their alarms, and the
rea<U+017F>on why he brought him not into
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> as formerly: The <hi>Count</hi>
was of the <U+017F>ame judgment, and both
held it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to make good u<U+017F>e of
the occa<U+017F>ion, and that <hi>Laura</hi> who was
to act the principal part, <U+017F>hould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her be<U+017F>t addre<U+017F>s and complai<U+017F>ance
in their favour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> taking <U+017F>mall plea<U+017F>ure in
the Garden after the unhappy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s
of his amorous de<U+017F>igns, having done his
endeavour to pacifie <hi>Chabania,</hi> would
bring her back to her Lodgings, and
pa<U+017F>s'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Bower, to let
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103330:48"/>
him under<U+017F>tand it was time to with
draw. The <hi>Count</hi> followed him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
being extreamly joyful to have
come off <U+017F>o happily from a walk that
had prov'd <U+017F>o full of adventures: He
bore his dear <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> company into
her Apartment, where he <U+017F>taid not
long for fear of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to his lodging. He pa<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t
of the night very plea<U+017F>antly, though
he <U+017F>lept not at all; and the truth is, he
had rea<U+017F>on enough to be well plea<U+017F>ed,
though his Patron had not, who was
more labouring under mortal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>Laura,</hi> whom he now was more
deeply in Love with than ever, put
him in de<U+017F>pair by her Rigours and
Cruelties: if no more pity from her,
then no more plea<U+017F>ure to be expected
in his life. His great affection for
<hi>Alexander</hi> could not keep him from
being his rival, and wi<U+017F>hing to <U+017F>hare
with him in the favours <U+017F>he did him.
His pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was arrived at a point
which is the highe<U+017F>t of <U+017F>ufferings, that
of not being loved: and when he
thought of the opportunity he had let
<U+017F>lip the night before, when he had
<hi>Laura</hi> in his power, he was <U+017F>o cruelly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103330:48"/>
vext, he could have found in his heart
to be revenged of him<U+017F>elf: yet he had
no great cau<U+017F>e to blame his di<U+017F>cretion,
for he had done enough, and unle<U+017F>s
he would have driven his Gallantry to
the la<U+017F>t pu<U+017F>h of all, he could not have
done more. He was not willing to
declare him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the thoughts he had
newly entertained, as well to prevent
the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure he believed it would
give him, as for that he conceived the
<hi>Count</hi> might be of u<U+017F>e to him in the
de<U+017F>ign, and that the di<U+017F>covery might
be to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>In the Morning as <U+017F>oon as he was
up, he went (as he <U+017F>ometimes was
u<U+017F>ed) to the <hi>Count's</hi> Chamber without
any attendant, and found him in Bed:
<hi>A Man,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>mu<U+017F>t be as happy as</hi>
Alexander <hi>in his Love, before he can
<U+017F>leep as quietly as he.</hi> If there be any,
an<U+017F>wered the <hi>Count,</hi> hath cau<U+017F>e to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his good fortune on that account,
it mu<U+017F>t without doubt be a Per<U+017F>on of
your comline<U+017F>s and Gallantry, who to
gain love, need no more than <U+017F>ay you
are in love. Yes, replied the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi>
with a <U+017F>mile, except it be to <hi>Laura,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:103330:49"/>
who hath made me very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that
I can <U+017F>igh to no purpo<U+017F>e, and that the
ma<U+017F>ter of her per<U+017F>on may not be the
ma<U+017F>ter of her heart; It was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
that <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>hould come from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
to <hi>Africk</hi> to make that Conque<U+017F>t:
This, Sir, replyed the <hi>Count,</hi> may be
an in<U+017F>tance of the Vagaries and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
of Love, who often knows
not where to fix, but follows the effects
of de<U+017F>tiny, or the Stars which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
over the affections. And I
believe Sir, added he <U+017F>miling, as for
the Love of <hi>Laura,</hi> you are already
very well <U+017F>atisfied, and <U+017F>o little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
where <U+017F>he be<U+017F>tows it, that you
never de<U+017F>igned to make me in Love
with her, that you might be my Rival.
However, <U+017F>aid he, ob<U+017F>erving the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
<U+017F>igh, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>hould it <U+017F>o happen,
you cannot do me a greater favour
than in letting me know it. And you
<U+017F>hall find that all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I can have
for her, <U+017F>hall not hinder any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duty I owe you. I will
quit all my pretentions as I know you
have the lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign upon her, that I
may prevent all di<U+017F>pute with a Per<U+017F>on
to whom I am <U+017F>o deeply oblig'd, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103330:49"/>
there can be nothing <U+017F>o dear to me,
but I will part with it for your <U+017F>ake.
Believe it <hi>Alexander,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> it is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a matter to be
di<U+017F>ingaged from a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion like yours:
you may as well per<U+017F>wade me, you
cannot be in Love. I am certainly in
Love, replied the <hi>Count,</hi> and it may
be as deeply as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; but having
<U+017F>o many favours daily heaped on me
from you, there is nothing in the
World I <U+017F>hall Love more than your
repo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>atisfaction: And, Sir, if
<hi>Laura</hi> appear now as amiable as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to you, I mu<U+017F>t tell you again,
I love her no longer; <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was it for the <U+017F>ubtile <hi>Italian</hi> to be
generous in parting with that in which
he was <U+017F>o little concerned. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
asked him if he would <U+017F>ay as much
before <hi>Laura.</hi> He an<U+017F>wered, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him too ju<U+017F>t and too gallant to
de<U+017F>ire him to make a declaration of
that nature before one who had been
his <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</hi> At la<U+017F>t the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
another walk in the Garden
that very day, and at the <U+017F>ame time
prayed him to write about it to
<hi>Laura;</hi> which the Count having not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103330:50"/>
been able to avoid, received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>The burnt child dreads the fire; we do
not commonly expo<U+017F>e our <U+017F>elves twice to the
<U+017F>ame danger. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s u<U+017F>age of me
la<U+017F>t night, gives me <U+017F>mall encouragement
to tru<U+017F>t him the <U+017F>econd time. And you
are an eye-witne<U+017F>s how ill I was handled
by her he had with him. Let it <U+017F>atisfie
you, that if you come hither, I will have
the honour to <U+017F>ee you. But no more
walking.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> much troubled at <U+017F>o unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
an an<U+017F>wer, went out of the
Counts Chamber without <U+017F>aying a
word, and pa<U+017F>s'd in <U+017F>olitude the re<U+017F>t
of the day. But in the Evening he
went to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
met <hi>Laura;</hi> who inquiring of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and why he had not brought
him with him; would it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you,
<U+017F>aid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> if I <U+017F>upplied his place
this Evening: that were too great an
honour for me, replied <hi>Laura</hi> <U+017F>miling,
but the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> expects you, and is
not very well. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> gave her
his hand, and would have led her into
a private Chamber; <hi>Laura</hi> perceiving
it, and that he was in good earne<U+017F>t,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103330:50"/>
Prayed him to let her go; that her
Lady was not well, and he knew well
enough <U+017F>he could not endure her being
a moment out of her <U+017F>ight: I, I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> is <U+017F>ick,
and cannot be a moment without you;
but 'tis becau<U+017F>e 'tis I de<U+017F>ire to pa<U+017F>s that

you could have <U+017F>taid a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>aid this with <U+017F>o plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant

'tis another ca<U+017F>e when you are with

<U+017F>miling, one would venture a little for
a Sweet-heart: Well, well, <U+017F>aid he,
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her to go along with him,
'tis Love hath brought me hither: I,
Sir, an<U+017F>wer'd <U+017F>he <U+017F>triving to get away
from him, and 'tis Love obliges me to
avoid the occa<U+017F>ion of being found
alone in your company; for though I
know you a mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed Per<U+017F>on,
you will allow me to tell you, you
have not too much re<U+017F>pect for our Sex,
and 'tis very hard tru<U+017F>ting you, witne<U+017F>s
your a<U+017F><U+017F>aults la<U+017F>t night in the Garden.
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> made her a thou<U+017F>and Oaths
he would keep within the bounds of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103330:51"/>
that re<U+017F>pect and di<U+017F>cretion <U+017F>he might
expect from the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t vertue, and
prote<U+017F>ted he de<U+017F>ired only one quarter
of an hours di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <hi>Laura,</hi> who
knew the violence and ob<U+017F>tinacy of his
humour, when denyed any thing he
held rea<U+017F>onable to be granted him,
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf to entertain him that
quarter of an hour. He reproached
her a thou<U+017F>and times for her hardne<U+017F>s
and cruelty again<U+017F>t him, and gave her
withall the kinde<U+017F>t words and the mo<U+017F>t
tender and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
<hi>Laura,</hi> to defend her <U+017F>elf,
pleaded her Honour, her Religion, and
her Duty to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> her <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;</hi>
three things <U+017F>he would not betray for
the World: Had you but a little Love
for me, <U+017F>aid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> with a <U+017F>igh, you
would not find <U+017F>o many rea<U+017F>ons for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
I have my Religion as you
have yours, and the Precepts of it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as <U+017F>evere as yours; but Love is
<U+017F>tronger than all the Precepts, the
Laws, the Religions of the World, and
tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>erve him, wor<U+017F>hip no other
God. As for the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> how are
you concerned, that is my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
not yours; and it <U+017F>hall be your fault, if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103330:51"/>
ever <U+017F>he know it. But what do you
tell me of Honour?</p>
               <p>Surely 'tis more for your Honour to
love a Man as I am, than to love <U+017F>uch
a one as <hi>Alexander.</hi> You mi<U+017F>take your
<U+017F>elf, Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Laura,</hi> if you think
that in the vi<U+017F>its he hath made me,
there hath any thing pa<U+017F>s'd contrary to
my duty<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 'Tis not with tho<U+017F>e of our
Nation, as with the People of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
We may be together, and no body
by, yet my Honour <U+017F>ecure. I <U+017F>wear
to you, Sir, <hi>Alexander</hi> never received
that favour from me, which I could
not afford the Per<U+017F>on for whom I am
the lea<U+017F>t concerned in the World. The
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> interrupted her; what, not in
the Garden? Neither in the Garden
nor any where el<U+017F>e, replyed <U+017F>he, had
he ever any other advantage than a
<U+017F>ight of me, which with us is accounted
for nothing. Can you make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
an<U+017F>wered the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> what you
<U+017F>ay? <hi>Laura</hi> told him, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more true, and he might re<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of it: But Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for your better
<U+017F>atisfaction, bring him no more hither,
and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee whether I make my
complaint for it: 'Twere pitty, replyed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103330:52"/>
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> to de<U+017F>troy <U+017F>o fair a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip;
and I do prote<U+017F>t to you, that
were it in my power, I would give
you no trouble, but I am not <U+017F>o much
Ma<U+017F>ter of my <U+017F>elf, to gain this point on
my heart, to be unconcerned in your
Love: But <U+017F>ince you love <hi>Alexander</hi>
with <U+017F>o much indifference, that you
can <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>olve not to <U+017F>ee him
more, I have no cau<U+017F>e to afflict my
<U+017F>elf, but rather to hope you may one
day love me perhaps as much as you do
him.</p>
               <p>After the<U+017F>e words the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> retired,
with a heart a little better at ea<U+017F>e than
when he came in, but as deeply in
Love as before. He gave not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and firm credit to what <hi>Laura</hi> had
told him of her indifference and <U+017F>mall
concernment for <hi>Alexander,</hi> but did
believe her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for the Chri<U+017F>tian
not <U+017F>o great as he had imagined, or
that their Love had been cooled by
<U+017F>ome quarrel, for he had ob<U+017F>erved on
the one <U+017F>ide and the other, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
than is u<U+017F>ually con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent
with that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>But then reflecting <U+017F>uddenly on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
may not this be (<U+017F>aid he, re<U+017F>uming
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103330:52"/>
his jealou<U+017F>ie and diffidence,) an effect
of their policy? may they not be
agreed to deceive me? and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<U+017F>ufficiently a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affections, may they not pretend
they have no Love for one another,
that they may Love one another with
greater <U+017F>ecurity? No, no, adds he, this
cannot be, there is no hiding of Love,
it will appear if not <U+017F>mothered to death:
She love not <hi>Alexander</hi> at all, or loves
him but indifferently; thus he the more
ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>o, in
that he did mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire it
might be <U+017F>o; and thence-forward his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion increa<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, it became
greater than ever. Hope being a pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that more than any other foments
that of Love, ea<U+017F>ily promi<U+017F>es it <U+017F>elf
happy events, and flatters it <U+017F>elf with
expectation of good fortune and <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> gave the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> an accompt
of all the plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> could have wi<U+017F>hed <hi>Laura</hi> had
not been altogether <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere to the

without which <U+017F>he thought
they could not <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>o often
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103330:53"/>
as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired. <hi>Laura</hi> on the contrary
told her, that to have been complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant,
would have <U+017F>poyl'd all, for that
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> would then have entertained
<U+017F>ome hopes of favour from her, and <U+017F>o
become more amorous than before,
and con<U+017F>equently more jealous of his
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed Rival than ever. What <U+017F>hall
I do then, <U+017F>aid the poor <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who
can do nothing but fear, and cannot
expect any thing but cro<U+017F><U+017F>es and mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes?
<hi>Laura</hi> told her, things were
not in <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate a condition, that
<U+017F>he need trouble her <U+017F>elf for it, for the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had promi<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>end <hi>Alexander</hi>
on the morrow, and that they would
con<U+017F>ider with him how to order their
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>The Count did not know that the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had been with the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> but
having not heard from him that day,
he went on the morrow to wait on
him at his ri<U+017F>ing. He found him abed,
<U+017F>o dejected and melancholy, that he
might by his countenance ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the heavine<U+017F>s of his heart. Yet he
received him with that air of kindne<U+017F>s
and friend<U+017F>hip might well a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the
Count, he was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103330:53"/>
him. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>ilent a while, and
then looking on the Count with an air
of friend<U+017F>hip and confidence; <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, I am the mo<U+017F>t unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of men, e<U+017F>pecially, in Love.
<hi>Laura,</hi> added he, <U+017F>ighing, the cruel
<hi>Laura</hi> hath not the lea<U+017F>t tenderne<U+017F>s for
me; no, not the lea<U+017F>t pity for the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ees me <U+017F>uffer for her: and
unle<U+017F>s you will be a little kind to me,
I know not what will become of me.
Ah Sir, an<U+017F>wered the Count, let me
but know what you de<U+017F>ire of me, and
what I can do for you: you know it
is not in my power to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of others
hearts; but if I may contribute to
your <U+017F>atisfaction; if you would have
me <U+017F>peak to her; if—How happy
<U+017F>hould I be, <U+017F>aid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, would you do what you can.
Sir, replyed the Count, if it depend
upon me, you may promi<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> held his peace for
a little time, as if he <U+017F>tudied what to
<U+017F>ay; but <hi>Alexander</hi> pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
him<U+017F>elf, he told him with <U+017F>ome
trouble, that he <U+017F>hould appoint an a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ignation
with <hi>Laura</hi> in a Chamber,
in the Apartment of-the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103330:54"/>
where the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> might meet her in his
<U+017F>tead. The Propo<U+017F>al was <U+017F>o unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and unfit for <hi>Alexander</hi> to con<U+017F>ent
to, that it a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd him on the <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<U+017F>o extreamly, that having blu<U+017F>h'd
at it very much, he knew not what
an<U+017F>wer to make. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> ob<U+017F>erved
the di<U+017F>order he was in, and was more
out of countenance at it than the
Count; but for fear he <U+017F>hould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it otherwi<U+017F>e than intended, and
taking his blu<U+017F>hing for no very good
Omen, he told him, (to be rid of
him) that he might go think of it, and
that if he gave him any an<U+017F>wer, it
<U+017F>hould be a favourable one.</p>
               <p>The Count went out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and made a thou<U+017F>and reflections
on his ill Fortune, which had reduced
him to the extremity of making him
<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on; not but that he
was fully per<U+017F>waded, <hi>Laura</hi> would not
come, and that he <U+017F>hould be little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
though <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould entertain
the motion, and favour the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
his amorous Patron: but be<U+017F>ides the
ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of the imployment he put him
upon, he was mad to think he took
him for <U+017F>uch a Villain, that loving a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103330:54"/>
Maid, as the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> believed he did
<hi>Laura,</hi> could betray her <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely.
This was the only thing troubled him,
nor would he have done it, though he
died for it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having <U+017F>een him leave his
Chamber in that manner, thought
there was <U+017F>mall hope of effecting his
de<U+017F>ign that way; yet being a per<U+017F>on
of great rea<U+017F>on and worth, he was <U+017F>o
far from thinking the wor<U+017F>e of the
Count, or being offended with him on
this occa<U+017F>ion, that he e<U+017F>teemed of him
the better, and con<U+017F>idered of other
means to gain <U+017F>atisfaction to his love
in the enjoyment of <hi>Laura.</hi> His pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was now arrived at a height be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of rea<U+017F>on to manage,
and capable to put him on any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
whatever. The mo<U+017F>t vertuous
of men when changed into a de<U+017F>perate
Lover, become the mo<U+017F>t furious and
extravagant of all; being <U+017F>o much
more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of <U+017F>lights put upon him,
as he conceives him<U+017F>elf a per<U+017F>on of
merit.</p>
               <p>This tran<U+017F>ported Lover having fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his de<U+017F>ign to make <hi>Alexander</hi> of
his Party, to <U+017F>erve his ends in a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103330:55"/>
that included Treachery, re<U+017F>olved
to deceive <hi>Laura</hi> him<U+017F>elf, by going to
<U+017F>ee her that night di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as an <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch.</hi>
The de<U+017F>ign was not very well
laid, but it took, as <U+017F>hall appear by
the <U+017F>equel. He had not the patience
to <U+017F>tay till his ordinary hour of going
to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> but as <U+017F>oon as 'twas
night, he went away di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed like an
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> and came to the apartment,
where he found one old <hi>Moor</hi> at the
gate, who not taking <U+017F>o much notice
of him as to know him, he <U+017F>ent her to
<hi>Laura,</hi> to tell her that an <hi>Eunuch</hi> of
her acquaintance de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with
her in the Chamber of repo<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
becau<U+017F>e it was retired, and far
from noi<U+017F>e, and the place where they
u<U+017F>ed to take <U+017F>ome hours re<U+017F>t after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in Summer. He made choice of
this Chamber as the mo<U+017F>t proper for
his de<U+017F>ign; and the old Woman was
no <U+017F>ooner gone about her me<U+017F><U+017F>age, but
he went to hide him there. <hi>Laura</hi>
was then bu<U+017F>ie, and the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ca<U+017F>ually met the old Woman in
<U+017F>earch of <hi>Laura,</hi> asked her, what <U+017F>he
would have with her? the old Woman
having had no order to keep private
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103330:55"/>
her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, told her freely, there was
an <hi>Eunuch</hi> de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with her in
the Chamber of Repo<U+017F>e. The <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s</hi>
hearing of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> who would
<U+017F>peak with <hi>Laura,</hi> made no que<U+017F>tion
at all but <hi>Alexander</hi> was the Man; and
without further enquiry what kind of
Man the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was, or any other
con<U+017F>ideration, <U+017F>he takes <hi>Laura's Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and goes to the place of a<U+017F><U+017F>ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
had <U+017F>he made the lea<U+017F>t reflection
on the me<U+017F><U+017F>age, <U+017F>he could not have
been <U+017F>o deceived, nor have expo<U+017F>ed
her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily to the danger <U+017F>he
went into. It was not the cu<U+017F>tom of
her Gallant to u<U+017F>e her thus, or to <U+017F>ee
her any where but in the <hi>Alcove</hi>-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
he <U+017F>carce knew the name of the
Chamber where <U+017F>he was told he <U+017F>taid
for <hi>Laura,</hi> and knowing what <U+017F>he did
of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> <U+017F>he had rea<U+017F>on to mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t

the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> was, are <U+017F>ubject to greater
over-<U+017F>ights than the<U+017F>e. She knew that
<hi>Alexander</hi> was not to <U+017F>ee her but by
night, yet <U+017F>he waited for him from
the fir<U+017F>t moment <U+017F>he awoke in the
morning; and in this amorous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
which tantalized her extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103330:56"/>
and kept her in a mortal inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
whether he came or came not,
there needed no help to hurry her
away when the time drew near. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have been in Love, will ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confe<U+017F>s there is nothing <U+017F>o hard as
to be prudent on <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, and
that the name of their Gallant when
expected, hath made them <U+017F>tart up for
joy, and run to meet him e're they
knew whether he were come.</p>
               <p>The pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up her <U+017F>elf to be led blind-fold,
where <U+017F>he thought Love waited for her,
borrowed wings of that God to carry
her the <U+017F>ooner into that Chamber;
there was not any light there, but this
did not <U+017F>urprize her, it being not u<U+017F>ual
to place any in that Chamber. She
plea<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf with the fancy of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Love-trick on <hi>Alexander,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him take her once more for <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
this made her re<U+017F>olve to be <U+017F>ilent a
while, as <U+017F>he had been in the Garden,
and to divert her <U+017F>elf that way. But
as <U+017F>he was entring, <U+017F>he was taken with
a <U+017F>hivering all over, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden
fear, that <U+017F>he was on the point of going
back again. But the Gallant who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103330:56"/>
waited for her, having taken her by
the Hand, <U+017F>he began to recollect her
<U+017F>elf, and went along with him where
he pleas'd: he led her away to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Chamber, where he
was <U+017F>o loth to lo<U+017F>e time for making
u<U+017F>e of the occa<U+017F>ion, that embracing
her with <U+017F>ome tran<U+017F>port, though tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
withal, he had almo<U+017F>t put it out of
her power to defend her <U+017F>elf. The
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> thinking this action too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, began to mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru<U+017F>t;
and having given him his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till then, <U+017F>he did the utmo<U+017F>t in her
power to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, and knew, though
a little too late, that <U+017F>he was abu<U+017F>ed,
and that this Man had neither the
<U+017F>hape, nor the <U+017F>tature, nor face of her
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and that it mu<U+017F>t be the <hi>Ba<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a,</hi>
which <U+017F>ome marks <U+017F>he knew about
him, <U+017F>oon put out of que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>he
changed her method, and <U+017F>tood upon
her guard. The re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance <U+017F>he made
after the kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>t at the
fir<U+017F>t, was ob<U+017F>erved by the Gallant, and
made him perceive that the cheat was
di<U+017F>covered, and no hopes of hiding
him<U+017F>elf. So that without further dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
he made his la<U+017F>t efforts, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103330:57"/>
tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> <U+017F>o u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s,
that he obtained his de<U+017F>ign. This
tran<U+017F>ported Lover was happy at lea<U+017F>t
in conceit, which <U+017F>ufficiently proves
the power of imagination, and that
our greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ures proceed from it.
I am <U+017F>ure, there is no unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but may envy his mi<U+017F>take, and
that chance could not put a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on any Man, than this on the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a.</hi> His pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion thus <U+017F>atisfied, he
withdrew, without <U+017F>aying a word,
and the Lady made all the ha<U+017F>te <U+017F>he
could to her Chamber, for fear the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>hould renew the a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ault.
<hi>Laura</hi> who had been much
troubled at mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing of her, was no le<U+017F>s
amazed to <U+017F>ee her come in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>he was in, which made her throw
her <U+017F>elf on the Bed; where half weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
half laughing, <U+017F>he told her the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the adventure: At which <hi>Laura</hi>
did nothing but laugh, expecting very
plea<U+017F>ant conclu<U+017F>ions from <U+017F>o comical
beginnings.</p>
               <p>The Count had been at the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a's</hi>
in the Evening, and not finding him
within, came on the Morrow to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the re<U+017F>olution he had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103330:57"/>
taken on the propo<U+017F>al. As he entred
the apartment, he was told that the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had been ill that night, and had
not <U+017F>lept at all, and that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
any entrance into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but the Count having more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
than others, they let him pa<U+017F>s,
and he found him abed, and writing
with <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a meen, and <U+017F>o dejected a
countenance, that the Count pre<U+017F>ently
concluded he had had a very ill night;
<U+017F>eeing <hi>Alexander</hi> on the <U+017F>udden, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
a little; but the Count laying
one knee to the ground, I come, Sir,
<U+017F>aid he, to beg one favour more of
you: You are the principal Author of
all the Love I am engaged in; it is my
misfortune that you feel the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Accept, I be<U+017F>eech you, the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
I make you Sir, I will never love,
and if you will have it <U+017F>o, I will never
<U+017F>ee <hi>Laura</hi> more. Ble<U+017F>s me! cryed the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> what Lovers are the<U+017F>e! is it po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
that two per<U+017F>ons who began to
love one another with <U+017F>o tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can part with <U+017F>uch ea<U+017F>e? and
that I, who am not beloved, cannot
bring my <U+017F>elf to this: <U+017F>peak <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and tell me whether it proceeds from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103330:58"/>
any di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>t you have taken, or that
you do it for my <U+017F>ake. No Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the Count, <hi>Laura</hi> is this day as
amiable in my eyes as the fir<U+017F>t day I
<U+017F>aw her; but rather than <U+017F>ee you in
the condition I find you in, I will not
<U+017F>pare the doing my <U+017F>elf any violence I
am capable of; and for your quiet and
my own, I heartily wi<U+017F>h. I never had
<U+017F>een her. This example is <U+017F>o rare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> that nothing le<U+017F>s than
the e<U+017F>teem I have for you, can make it
credible. In the mean time this Billet
will let you <U+017F>ee, that I have not <U+017F>taid
for you to <U+017F>et me a Pre<U+017F>ident, but that
I know in my turn how to give Pre<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
for others to imitate, but not to
out-do. It is written to <hi>Laura,</hi> read
it: And there it will appear to you,
that if I have done you wrong, I know
how to puni<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf for it. I <U+017F>hould
be heartily <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>o virtuous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a per<U+017F>on as you, <U+017F>hould part from
us, with an ill opinion of me. The
Count extreamly <U+017F>urprized at this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
not comprehending the rea<U+017F>on
of it, after an an<U+017F>wer full of re<U+017F>pect
and acknowledgment to his dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
took the Billet, and there read
the<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:103330:58"/>
If all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion Man can have for a
Woman, is not capable to ju<U+017F>tifie the crime
I committed again<U+017F>t you, you ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, at lea<U+017F>t having <U+017F>uffered in one
night all the torments and afflictions of a
cruel repentance, which yet fills my <U+017F>oul
with grief and confu<U+017F>ion. And if by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you and your Lover your Liberty, I
may in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure make amends for my
faults, you may make you ready for your
voyage, for to morrow morning you <U+017F>hall go
both together. Farewel, and think of the
violence I did my <U+017F>elf, in forcing from my
bo<U+017F>om two per<U+017F>ons, whom of all I ever <U+017F>aw,
I loved mo<U+017F>t entirely, and then you will
find me not altogether unworthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>The Count was <U+017F>o confounded at
reading the Billet, as never was Man,
and had much ado to hide the di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it put him in; he kneeled the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, as it were to give the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
thanks for this la<U+017F>t favour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his engagement in Love with the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> had been the greate<U+017F>t he
could have done him; but now after
his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, it was certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
misfortune could befal him. He
was willing by this action to hide from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103330:59"/>
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> the trouble he was in. But
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> took him up, and told him,
he could not <U+017F>ee him in that po<U+017F>ture,
for a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s where he had more cau<U+017F>e
to complain of him, than to thank
him, that he <U+017F>hould know at lei<U+017F>ure
the whole matter from <hi>Laura,</hi> and
that in the mean time he had nothing
to do but prepare for his voyage; that
he had given order to <U+017F>tay a Chri<U+017F>tian
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which <U+017F>hould have gone off
that very day for <hi>Italy,</hi> and <U+017F>hould land
them at <hi>Legorn;</hi> that the weather was
fair, and that without fail he <U+017F>hould
embark with <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow:
for all which he gave him his word.</p>
               <p>The Count having taken leave of
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> went out of the Chamber
with a heart <U+017F>o full of trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
for the News he had received,
that he wanted a more proper place to
comfort him<U+017F>elf, and to vent his
thoughts of the re<U+017F>olution the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had
taken to give him his Liberty, and to
<U+017F>end <hi>Laura</hi> with him. He knew not
what might have obliged him to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution
of this nature, though upon
reading the Billet, he did imagine, the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had committed <U+017F>ome outrage on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103330:59"/>
                  <hi>Laura;</hi> but this was not the thing
troubled him; it was the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> from
whom he mu<U+017F>t part, and mu<U+017F>t bid her
adieu for ever: to part with a Woman
one loved <U+017F>o tenderly, to part with
her for ever, and to part with her in
the height of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ounds very
har<U+017F>h, and where is the Lover could
take <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>olution for any rea<U+017F>on
what-ever? Yet Liberty, which to a
Man who knows what 'tis to be a
Slave, to a Man of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is a thing <U+017F>o attractive; to return
to his Countrey after eight or nine
months ab<U+017F>ence; the plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the con<U+017F>ideration that if he lo<U+017F>t
this opportunity, he might perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have <U+017F>uch another; all this, I <U+017F>ay,
made <U+017F>uch a Party, that the mo<U+017F>t beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and mo<U+017F>t charming Lady in the
World, could not have hindred many
excellent per<U+017F>ons from quitting hers to
take it. But true Love which values
nothing above its own <U+017F>atisfaction,
<U+017F>lights a liberty to be bought with too
many tears: yet in this conjuncture,
it was almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for <hi>Alexander</hi>
to refu<U+017F>e this cruel liberty, being all he
could in appearance de<U+017F>ire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>towed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103330:60"/>
on him by the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> with a
<hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> with whom he believed him
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love. What rea<U+017F>on could
he find to refu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a Pre<U+017F>ent which
had co<U+017F>t the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>o dear, and ought
to be the mo<U+017F>t acceptable to him? He
de<U+017F>paired to find any, and <U+017F>aw clearly
there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of parting, unle<U+017F>s
Love, favourable to Lovers in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
would come to his aid, and
make the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> alter his re<U+017F>olution, as
they commonly do who take any
again<U+017F>t Love; never did Slave pay
more Vows to be delivered from his
Chain, than he did for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Captivity, choo<U+017F>ing rather
to be a Slave the re<U+017F>t of his Life, than
to be for ever removed to <U+017F>uch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
from that which he loved a
thou<U+017F>and times more than his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome hours

he had taken, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to, though it made his heart
ake, called for his <hi>Aga,</hi> and gave him
orders for the departure of the two
Chri<U+017F>tians, cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>tore of Provi<U+017F>ions,
and very rich Pre<U+017F>ents to be carried on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103330:60"/>
board the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; this done he <U+017F>ent his

as of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity for him, and for the ea<U+017F>e

replied the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> re<U+017F>olutions like
that I have now taken in your favour,
go <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t the grain of a
heart affected as mine, that delays may
be dangerous, and time may make
them faulter: make u<U+017F>e of the good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103330:61"/>
motions rea<U+017F>on and equity have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pired
into me. I do not tell you my
thoughts are unalterable. The <U+017F>pite I
have again<U+017F>t my heart for its weakne<U+017F>s,
the outrage I did <hi>Laura</hi> ye<U+017F>terday; my
<U+017F>hame to appear before her after it, and
the <U+017F>mall hopes I have of gaining her
Love, are the true cau<U+017F>es of your good
fortune: All this is yet fre<U+017F>h in my
mind; <U+017F>tay not till time deface the<U+017F>e
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, there being nothing men
are apt <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon to forget, as the injuries
they had done to others.</p>
               <p>As they were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing together,
a huge Moor who <U+017F>erved as Purveyor
for the <hi>Count,</hi> and brought him every
Morning his Provi<U+017F>ion from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
came on the <U+017F>udden into the
Chamber with a great Basket on his
head, not thinking (without doubt)
of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s being there. The Moor
<U+017F>tarted at the <U+017F>ight of him, would have
gone back, but the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> with his hand
made <U+017F>igns for him to <U+017F>tay; he obeyed,
and laid the Basket on the ground,
which appeared very heavy, and <U+017F>o he
withdrew; the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> of pure curio<U+017F>ity
to <U+017F>ee what they had <U+017F>ent <hi>Alexander</hi> to
eat, bid a Moor, who waited in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103330:62"/>
Room, take up the Basket lid, which
he did, and found the Provi<U+017F>ion to be
a Woman very plea<U+017F>antly tucked up
and mufled in her <hi>Barnus</hi> that <U+017F>he might
not be known. But being in the Habit
of a Chri<U+017F>tian (which the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> and
<hi>Alexander</hi> had formerly <U+017F>een <hi>Laura</hi> in)
they made no doubt but it was <U+017F>he.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> at fir<U+017F>t was very much <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
but then fell a laughing, and
<U+017F>aid to the <hi>Count,</hi> the Invention is rare,
and that <U+017F>he had far more wit than the
Women of that Country; but this is
a product of Love the Father of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
However, 'tis certain nothing
could have been done more proper for
our de<U+017F>ign: But <U+017F>hall not we <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid
he, all your Provi<U+017F>ion? <hi>Madam,</hi> you
are here between the two be<U+017F>t Friends
you have in the World, and you have
no rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>hy of <U+017F>hewing your
<U+017F>elf; having <U+017F>aid this, he drew near to
the Lady, and would have taken her
by the arm to help her to ri<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>he
refu<U+017F>ed and thru<U+017F>t him back. I <U+017F>ee
<hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, you have not yet
granted me the pardon I begged of
you. I confe<U+017F>s the offence was too
great to be <U+017F>o quickly forgiven; but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103330:62"/>
you are taking your leave, and it is
not fit we <U+017F>hould part without being
friends; for it would be a perpetual
grief to me, to <U+017F>ee you leave this
Country with hatred in your heart.
Deny not this favour (added he, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth his hand) to a man reduced
to de<U+017F>pair for having offended you, and
puni<U+017F>hing him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o <U+017F>everely for the
fault, that there is no need of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
curelty from you. But all he
<U+017F>poke was in vain, for <U+017F>he hid her <U+017F>elf
more clo<U+017F>ely, and fortify'd her <U+017F>elf in
the Basket to prevent being <U+017F>een. The
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was unwilling to pre<U+017F>s her any
further, but addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
told him, it was his part to make
peace, and to prevail with <hi>Laura</hi> to let
him <U+017F>ee her once more being the la<U+017F>t
time: The Count took it ill that <U+017F>he
made <U+017F>o <U+017F>hy of <U+017F>hewing her <U+017F>elf to a
Per<U+017F>on to whom <U+017F>he was too much
obliged, to deny him his reque<U+017F>t in
<U+017F>uch a conjuncture, what cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>oever
<U+017F>he might have had of quarrel again<U+017F>t
him. Be<U+017F>ides, he was particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to pre<U+017F>s her to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf;
for the la<U+017F>t refuge he had, was his hope
that the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s cenderne<U+017F>s for her, would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103330:63"/>
perhaps at the moment of parting take
fire afre<U+017F>h, and make him change his
re<U+017F>olution; with the<U+017F>e thoughts he
went to her, and gave her all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
he could invent to be reconciled
to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and let him <U+017F>ee her a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but all to no purpo<U+017F>e. He had
not one word of an<U+017F>wer, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
him <U+017F>o, that having taken her
twice or thrice by the arm to make her
ri<U+017F>e, he was ju<U+017F>t going to force up her
<hi>Barnus,</hi> and threatned to do it; but
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer it, bidding
him force her no further; that <U+017F>he had
cau<U+017F>e enough to complain, without
doing her new violence for love of
him. But, <U+017F>ays he, let us make u<U+017F>e of
the time, and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our hands, and you have no
more to do but embark, let us fini<U+017F>h
what we have begun, and perform
what we have undertaken, there never
can be a fairer opportunity; and I
cannot think that <hi>Laura</hi> will be <U+017F>orry
to leave <U+017F>uch a Country as this, or part
with us to go along with you. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
in all probability is yet a<U+017F>leep,
let us not <U+017F>tay till <U+017F>he awake. We mu<U+017F>t
pre<U+017F>ently carry <hi>Laura</hi> (as <U+017F>he is in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103330:63"/>
Basket) into the Ship: you <U+017F>hall bear
her company, and as <U+017F>oon as you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
you <U+017F>hall hoi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ail and away; as
for me, I will pa<U+017F>s the re<U+017F>t of the day
at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and give out <U+017F>uch orders as
may be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that in ca<U+017F>e the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
mi<U+017F>s <hi>Laura,</hi> and find <U+017F>he is
e<U+017F>caped, you may not be <U+017F>taid. Having
<U+017F>aid this, he <U+017F>ent a Moor to the Port,
with order to have a Shallop in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
to carry <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
aboard the Chri<U+017F>tian Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el riding at
<hi>Gouletta.</hi> This done, he <U+017F>ent for the
Captain of his Guards, and bid him
accompany the Count, and commend
the care of that Basket to the Moors
who were to carry it along. Having
given the<U+017F>e orders, he had no more to
do, but bid his dear <hi>Alexander</hi> adieu;
and having embraced him with tears in
his eyes, he bore him company to the
Shallop, and from thence went to
<hi>Bardou</hi> with a heart full of grief. The
poor Count was more to be pittied:
He was not much concerned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
how <U+017F>orry he was to part with
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a;</hi> but as for the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
whom he could have wi<U+017F>hed to have
<U+017F>een once more at lea<U+017F>t, his trouble to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103330:64"/>
leave her was <U+017F>o great, that he felt not
the grief he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>hewed when
he bid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> adieu, who had <U+017F>o high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged him. When he <U+017F>aw he mu<U+017F>t
part, and no hopes of <U+017F>eeing her, his
heart was <U+017F>o full he could not <U+017F>peak a
word; the tears ran down his cheeks,
which much moved the good <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi>
who thought they were <U+017F>hed for him,
and was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf
outdone by a Man who was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
and cordially loved him: At
la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>aw him embarked, and bid him
the la<U+017F>t adieu. The afflicted Count was
<U+017F>o oppre<U+017F>s'd with grief, that from the
Haven to <hi>Gouletta,</hi> having given his
heart a little more liberty than he dur<U+017F>t
have done in pre<U+017F>ence of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> he let
fall <U+017F>uch lamentable expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, looking
towards the Town, that the Captain of
the Guard, and the re<U+017F>t that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, were extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed,
and moved to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. By good luck
they under<U+017F>tood not <hi>Italian,</hi> but his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tures,
his tears, his looks, and the colour
of his countenance expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
trouble and affliction.</p>
               <p>He no <U+017F>ooner got aboard the Ship,
but he threw him<U+017F>elf on a Bed, and was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103330:64"/>
<U+017F>o much be<U+017F>ide him<U+017F>elf, that he did not
as much as think of his Basket; but the
Captain of the Guard had ea<U+017F>ed him of
that care, and cau<U+017F>ed it to be carried
into his Cabbin; after which he took
leave of him, and having commanded
the Captain of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el to hoi<U+017F>e up
his Sails, he went into the Shallop and
returned to <hi>Tunis;</hi> then was it that
<hi>Alexander</hi> finding him<U+017F>elf alone in his
Cabbin, abandoned him<U+017F>elf to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his grief. Ah Fate, <U+017F>aid he, unju<U+017F>t
Fate, what have I done that you u<U+017F>e me
<U+017F>o cruelly, that you force me away
from a Per<U+017F>on without whom I cannot
live. Ah my <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> dear <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
mu<U+017F>t I leave you, mu<U+017F>t I ab<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf
from you for ever? For ever, <U+017F>aid he
again ri<U+017F>ing up: Ah Heavens! let me
rather be <U+017F>et a<U+017F>hore, I <U+017F>hall find pretence
enough with the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a;</hi> let me rather

whom I love, than at this cruel di<U+017F>tance
Having <U+017F>aid this, he went to <U+017F>ee if they
were <U+017F>till at Anchor, but found they
were already a great way from Land,
and <U+017F>ailing with a favourable wind, had

Sword in his hand, <U+017F>ee whether I am
guilty of this ab<U+017F>ence, and receive the
Sacrifice I make you of my Life; with
that he drew his Sword, and was going
to thru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf through, when on a
<U+017F>udden the Per<U+017F>on in the Basket, who

<hi>Tunis; Aly,</hi> who apprehended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
of the affair, made no <U+017F>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(when returned to <hi>Bardou)</hi> to
pre<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf before his Ma<U+017F>ter;
who extreamly enraged to <U+017F>ee his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
broke fir<U+017F>t by him, would neither
hear him, nor receive the Letter he
would have delivered him from the
General of the Gallies. But locking
him<U+017F>elf up, pa<U+017F>t his time till the fourth
Prayer, when he took Hor<U+017F>e to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Town. By the way he
received Letters from <U+017F>everal, but
thinking they came from the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
or <U+017F>ome of her party, he opened not
one of them.</p>
               <p>The General of the Gallies a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd
not to <U+017F>ee him come, after News <U+017F>ent
him what was Plotting again<U+017F>t him,
re<U+017F>olved to go in Per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ee what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103330:67"/>
<U+017F>tay'd him at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and by the way
met him. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>eeing him come
with a very large Train, asked him
<U+017F>miling, if he thought he had been
Be<U+017F>ieged, that he came to meet him
with <U+017F>o numerous a Party. You are
plea<U+017F>ant, Sir, an<U+017F>wered the General;
but I wi<U+017F>h we <U+017F>tand not in need of far
greater Forces before we come to <hi>Tunis.</hi>
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> ob<U+017F>erving him to <U+017F>peak in
good earne<U+017F>t, fixt his Eye upon him a
while without <U+017F>peaking a word, then
askt him, what need there could be
of the Forces he mentioned; and
(with Indignation) what, <U+017F>ays, he,
will they A<U+017F><U+017F>ault me for love of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s?</hi> Do not you think, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the General, there is rea<U+017F>on
enough for't? Can you believe that a
Prince like the <hi>Dey,</hi> your Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
(but from the Teeth outwards)
can brook the injury you have done
him, who loves the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
better than his Life? What injury,
<U+017F>aid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a?</hi> What injury, reply'd
the General? An injury, than which,
in my Opinion, a greater could not
have been offered. What, an<U+017F>wers
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> interrupting him, will they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103330:68"/>
di<U+017F>pute my Power to <U+017F>et two of my
Slaves at liberty at my plea<U+017F>ure? No,
Sir, <U+017F>aid the General, no que<U+017F>tion is
made of your Right or Power in the
particular you mention; but the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
was not your Slave, and unle<U+017F>s
you de<U+017F>ign'd to engage in a new Civil
War, not only the Rules of Honour,
Ju<U+017F>tice, and Religion, but the Maxims
of good Polity, <U+017F>hould have prevail'd
with you, not to deliver her into the
hands of a Chri<U+017F>tian, than which a
greater misfortune cannot befall a
Woman of our Religion. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
thought this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>o extravagant,
that he bur<U+017F>t out a laughing, and gave
him no other an<U+017F>wer, but that he had
taken the Alarm too <U+017F>oon. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
being moved, reply'd with <U+017F>ome
heat, you know me too well to
think me concern'd at that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me with; but when you come
to <hi>Tunis,</hi> you <U+017F>hall judge if I had not
cau<U+017F>e to take the Alarm. If the <hi>Dey,</hi>
an<U+017F>wer'd the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> de<U+017F>ign a breach
with me, he will find a better pretence
than you <U+017F>peak of. True it is, I have
<U+017F>ent away <hi>Laura</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Chri<U+017F>tian, without the con<U+017F>ent of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103330:68"/>
                  <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> but there were rea<U+017F>ons for
it, and <U+017F>uch as the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
living had mo<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to approve.
The General of the Gallies did verily
believe the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly bent
upon raillery, and willing to keep that
as a <U+017F>ecret which all the World knew;
which he took in ill part, and had not
<U+017F>poke a word more on that <U+017F>ubject,
had not the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> continued the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.
But, Sir, <U+017F>aid the General,
interrupting him, what plea<U+017F>ure can
you take in endeavouring to conceal
from me (one of your be<U+017F>t Servants
and Friends) a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o notorious
to all? Every body knows <hi>Laura</hi> is in
your <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> is
embarqued with <hi>Alexander.</hi> Not to
mince the matter, I mu<U+017F>t tell you, the
general voice is, that for Love of this
Slave, you have rid your hands of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that you
de<U+017F>ign to Marry <hi>Laura,</hi> though a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian.
But give me leave to tell you,
that be<U+017F>ides the novelty of the thing
(the like having never happened in
this Kingdom) not only the <hi>Dey</hi> and
<hi>Divan</hi> will oppo<U+017F>e it, but your Friends,
will to their power ob<U+017F>truct it, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103330:69"/>
prevent it if they can; and I dare
undertake, you will <U+017F>carce find a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of your <U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> hearing him <U+017F>peak in this
manner, thought him di<U+017F>tracted, and
would have u<U+017F>ed him accordingly, but
re<U+017F>trained by the Friend<U+017F>hip he had
for him; <hi>Laura,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, whom I <U+017F>aw
carried in a Basket, whom I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
to the Port (where they put
her aboard a Shallop) whom the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of my Guard conducted to the
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el in which <U+017F>he was Embarked,
and he <U+017F>aw under <U+017F>ail, this <hi>Laura</hi> is
in my <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and I am to Marry
her. Sir, an<U+017F>wered the General, did
I not know you very well, and were
fully per<U+017F>waded of the good e<U+017F>teem
you are plea<U+017F>ed to Honour me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I <U+017F>hould not know what to think
of your Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for it cannot be
but you know the whole Affair better
than any Man. But to end the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
let us go to your Palace, where
you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee whether it be <hi>Laura</hi> or
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> that is there.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere they arrived at
the Palace. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who took all
that the General had <U+017F>aid to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103330:69"/>
and vain, would not <U+017F>o much as
have <U+017F>ent to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to know how
things <U+017F>tood, thinking it foolery to
doubt of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> being there.
However in complai<U+017F>ance, and by
way of raillery, he ordered <hi>Aly</hi> to
wait on the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
her for him, upon the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure
<U+017F>he took for the departure of <hi>Laura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captain of the Guard not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
his Ma<U+017F>ter ignorant of what
was pa<U+017F>t, took his Order for a meer
matter of Addre<U+017F>s, and a colour only
to hide the truth of what he would
have conceal'd; and approve him<U+017F>elf
able to manage the intrigue, as one
who could penetrate into the de<U+017F>ires
of the Per<U+017F>on who employ'd him, he
went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
learnt what he formerly knew,
that 'twas <hi>Laura</hi> was there; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> made him a civil
an<U+017F>wer as from the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s.</hi> This
put the General into very great di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and gave the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> new occa<U+017F>ion
to laugh, telling him, he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
the de<U+017F>ign of the <hi>Dey,</hi> in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
tho<U+017F>e Reports to procure him the
ill will of his Friends, and hatred of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103330:70"/>
People, and renew their former broyls
with greater violence than ever; but
that he <U+017F>hould find the means to bring
him to Rea<U+017F>on, and that in the fir<U+017F>t
place, he would expo<U+017F>e the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> to
view of all the People, and then <U+017F>end
her home to the <hi>Dey,</hi>—to let him <U+017F>ee
how unwilling he was to have any
Alliance with a man who made it his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to find occa<U+017F>ions to ruin
him.</p>
               <p>As they were Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, they
heard a great noi<U+017F>e on the <U+017F>udden in
the Palace, followed by Vollies of
Mu<U+017F>quet-<U+017F>hot, and People crying, to
Arms, to Arms. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
out of his Chamber to <U+017F>ee what
the matter was, and met <hi>Aly</hi> coming
to tell him, that the Palace was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>ted
on all <U+017F>ides, and that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
had been made to enter it by
force, but that he had beat them back
with ten or twelve Souldiers of the
Guard, who by good Fortune hapned
to be with him. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> of all
men the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to fear, and of
a ready Wit, and admirable Judgment
in the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urprizing occa<U+017F>ions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him<U+017F>elf de<U+017F>titute then of Forces
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103330:70"/>
to make any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and hearing
them threaten to <U+017F>et fire on the Palace
if the Gate were not opened, order'd
they <U+017F>hould cry out at the Windows
that the Gate <U+017F>hould be open'd, that
tho<U+017F>e who had begirt the Palace round,
and were, for the mo<U+017F>t part, drawn
thither with hopes of Plunder, might
run all to the Gate, and give him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to make his e<U+017F>cape another
way.</p>
               <p>This Stratagem took according to
his de<U+017F>ire, and he made his e<U+017F>cape by
a private way form his Enemies, who
had <U+017F>hewed him no Mercy had he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into their hands. But he, with
the General of the Gallies, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guard, got <U+017F>afe to the
Mountains, Inhabited by the <hi>Moors,</hi>
who had great love for him. He no
<U+017F>ooner gave them notice of the need
he had of their help, but they came
to him that Night, <U+017F>o that by break
of day he found him<U+017F>elf at the Head
of 8000 Men, Armed <U+017F>ome with Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
<U+017F>ome with Pikes, both equally
u<U+017F>eful to them.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> was alone, abandoned
to the Mercy of this Popular Torrent,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103330:71"/>
who having pillaged in a moment that
Rich and Sumptuous Palace, without
re<U+017F>pect to the place or the Sex, entred
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> by Order from the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and took out thence the unfortunate
Slave, leaving the re<U+017F>t expo<U+017F>ed to the
will of the Rabble. It was <hi>Laura's</hi>
good Fortune, that he who had the
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to take her, was a Per<U+017F>on
of great hone<U+017F>ty and worth, a private
Friend of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and one who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd
as much re<U+017F>pect for her as <U+017F>he
could wi<U+017F>h in <U+017F>uch a Conjuncture.
She was carried to the Ca<U+017F>tle, where
<U+017F>he was committed to the <U+017F>ame Officers
Cu<U+017F>tody, being a Secretary, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
e<U+017F>teemed by all the <hi>Divan.</hi>
And being the only Per<U+017F>on could <U+017F>peak
to her without danger of being heard,
he confidently told her the fir<U+017F>t time
he <U+017F>aw her, that the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who<U+017F>e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
till then appeared admirable, had
committed a fact no le<U+017F>s difficult to
be repaired, than generally condemn'd
by the be<U+017F>t of his Friends, but that
he feared the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>mart would be
hers. The poor Slave <U+017F>ufficiently A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
by <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf forced out of
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and made the <hi>Dey</hi>'s
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103330:71"/>
Pri<U+017F>oner, was frightned much more
by the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this <hi>Turk,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to her a very credible Per<U+017F>on;
<U+017F>he prayed him for Heavens <U+017F>ake to
tell her what the matter was, what
fault the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had committed, and
how <U+017F>he was concern'd in it, that <U+017F>he
mu<U+017F>t be thus handled? If you are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages this day, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the Secretary, I will let you
know them.</p>
               <p>I believe, continues he, that you
know <hi>Chabania,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t have heard
talk of her, all the World is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the Malignity of her Nature,
and illne<U+017F>s of Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition: But to the
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in hand; that which <U+017F>he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
is grounded on Proofs <U+017F>o preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and Rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o clear, that her
Malice hath compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the effect <U+017F>he
de<U+017F>ired. Whether <U+017F>he was jealous of
you, or in di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t with the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> I
know not, but <U+017F>he is the cau<U+017F>e of the
di<U+017F>order you have <U+017F>een; which, if not
remedied, may prove the ruin of
the Kingdom: The <hi>Dey</hi> was at <hi>Che<U+017F>s</hi>
when word was brought him, that a
Lady from the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio</hi> de<U+017F>ired
to <U+017F>peak with him on bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103330:72"/>
importance. In<U+017F>tantly he quitted his
Game, and retiring into a Chamber
to give the Woman Audience, he <U+017F>ees
<hi>Chabania</hi> enter, attended with her
<hi>Eunuchs</hi> who U<U+017F>her'd her, who falling
before him on her knees, <U+017F>pake to this
purpo<U+017F>e. <hi>Sir, I bring you News, which
doubtle<U+017F>s will trouble you. But if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
Death for not being able to endure
an injury done to your Royal Blood, and
the whole Nation, without giving you
Adverti<U+017F>ement, I am content to <U+017F>uffer for
it, having the <U+017F>atisfaction to <U+017F>ee you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the wrong has been done you, which
is, that your Daughter is gone, that <U+017F>he
is delivered over into the hands of that

and that a pitiful Slave is to <U+017F>ucceed in
her place, to the infinite di<U+017F>honour of your
Highne<U+017F>s and the Nation. Take your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of the Author of this di<U+017F>order, and
execute that Ju<U+017F>tice which you ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
<U+017F>o cruel an attempt, acted to the
di<U+017F>honour of God, the injury of your Blood,
and di<U+017F>honour of your Country.</hi> Scarce
had <U+017F>he made an end, but the <hi>Dey</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with Anger, and extreamly
enraged, called in tho<U+017F>e who had

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103330:72"/>
able to <U+017F>peak for the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he was
in, made <hi>Chabania</hi> repeat before them
all that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid to him. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
fell out that all who were
there, were Enemies to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and
in<U+017F>tead of appea<U+017F>ing the <hi>Dey,</hi> took the

him to get <U+017F>atisfaction for <U+017F>o

made their report, that the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>

a Woman in the Chri<U+017F>tian Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el that
<U+017F>ail'd away this Morning; the an<U+017F>wer
he gave was, that the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el was <U+017F>ail'd
away without being <U+017F>earch'd, and that
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had <U+017F>ent order to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
by the Captain of his Guards,
who accompanied the Chri<U+017F>tian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the Ship. The<U+017F>e Circum<U+017F>tances
<U+017F>o clear and apparent, did but too
much confirm what <hi>Chabania</hi> had <U+017F>aid.

Hereupon divers Councils were held;
and the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
ill-affected to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t
too Zealous for the <hi>Dey,</hi> the Re<U+017F>ult
was, that Revenge <U+017F>hould be taken.
I cannot conceive how it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had no news what pa<U+017F>t, the
report having been pre<U+017F>ently noi<U+017F>ed
over the Town. It was de<U+017F>igned he
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urprized at <hi>Bardou,</hi> where
it was believed he would have lain <hi>this
Night.</hi> But News being brought, that
he was on his way hither, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s
<hi>Aga</hi> had Order, if deny'd entrance,
to <U+017F>et upon the Palace, and <U+017F>eize
his Per<U+017F>on living or dead. And I
at the <U+017F>ame time was to go to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
and to carry you away. They
mi<U+017F>s'd of him, and it was well for you
he e<U+017F>caped; for had he been taken,
both he and you had been by this
time dead. But having <U+017F>o luckily
made his e<U+017F>cape, and being Ma<U+017F>ter of
the Militia and <hi>Moors</hi> of the Kingdom,
he may become formidable to the
<hi>Dey,</hi> and be in a capacity to deliver
you from danger.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate <hi>Laura,</hi> too much
acquainted with the unkindne<U+017F>s of her
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103330:73"/>
Stars, did nothing but <U+017F>igh and groan
at the apprehen<U+017F>ions of the new <U+017F>torms
that threatned her. She knew better
than any, the little rea<U+017F>on they had to
charge the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> with the flight of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> and being of Opinion, that
by ju<U+017F>tifying the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> her cau<U+017F>e would
appear better before the <hi>Dey;</hi> <U+017F>he told
this <hi>Turk,</hi> that her Patron was not,
perhaps, <U+017F>o guilty as they thought. I
know not, continued <U+017F>he, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he left
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> this Morning; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
you have expre<U+017F>t in me, in the
freedom of your <U+017F>peech to me, and
your generous carriage obliging me
not to be <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd to you, as I would
to another; and <U+017F>eeing the extremity
matters are reduced to, I mu<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that if the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>ent away
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> with the Chri<U+017F>tian, as is
reported, <U+017F>he was very willing to go.
And becau<U+017F>e it is probable you will
hardly believe me, without telling you
more, I <U+017F>hall be forced to relate part
of a <U+017F>tory which may <U+017F>erve at lea<U+017F>t
to excu<U+017F>e, if not ju<U+017F>tifie the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know, Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> loved <hi>Alexander;</hi> and that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103330:74"/>
<U+017F>he loved him entirely, the occa<U+017F>ion
was this: The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> whom every one
knows to have had a mighty affection
for that Chri<U+017F>tian, had a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
(whether for Diverti<U+017F>ement, or
to fa<U+017F>ten him more clo<U+017F>ely to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on)
to <U+017F>ee him Love with <U+017F>ome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and was of Opinion, I might be
fit for the purpo<U+017F>e, if he could but
contrive how to bring us together.
But becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>tirred not out of the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that it would have been
a very <U+017F>candalous thing, to <U+017F>ee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian
enter a Palace, where none of
your Religion but <hi>Eunuchs</hi> have acce<U+017F>s;
he put the <U+017F>tranger into the habit of
an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and having prevailed with
me to accept of a Vi<U+017F>it from him,
brought him to me one Evening. The
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> already full of good thoughts
for the Chri<U+017F>tian, whom the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had
a thou<U+017F>and times <U+017F>poke to her of, was
extreamly glad to hear of the de<U+017F>ign,
to bring him to her very Apartment,
and with very great earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to procure her the
plea<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>eeing him. This proved
no hard task for me to perform: The
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who <U+017F>eldom came to vi<U+017F>it the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103330:74"/>
                  <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> <U+017F>ending him almo<U+017F>t every
day di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed like an <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the
<hi>Seraglio;</hi> <U+017F>o that I had no more to do
but provide for the Secrecy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
between my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
They had a <U+017F>ight of each other;
and if <hi>Alexander</hi> was <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om, as
to plea<U+017F>e the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <U+017F>o Beautiful a Lady could
not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him. Their Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed
day by day to that height,
that they <U+017F>aw one another very often.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Chri<U+017F>tian in Love,
and thinking me the object of it, took
<U+017F>ingular plea<U+017F>ure in it. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had
formerly had <U+017F>ome kindne<U+017F>s for me,
which cool'd by my re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; but
having one day for Diverti<U+017F>ement
cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Alexander</hi> to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the progre<U+017F>s of his Amour,
the fire of his Love <U+017F>o long raked up
and <U+017F>mothered, kindled afre<U+017F>h into a
flame; and gathering from the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s
of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Addre<U+017F>s, that I was not
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as I pretended to him; he
renewed his Court<U+017F>hip, intermingled
now and then with Reproaches for
the little e<U+017F>teem I had for him in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the affection of a Slave before
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103330:75"/>
his: I fore-<U+017F>aw the danger, but was
unwilling to make him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his
mi<U+017F>take, to <U+017F>ave the two Lovers from
the inconveniences which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
attend the di<U+017F>covery. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my <U+017F>elf a Sacrifice to the plea<U+017F>ure
of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> I let him believe I
was not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Merit of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
The affair thus managed, there
followed many plea<U+017F>ant Adventures
and Intrigues, which for fear of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
you too much at pre<U+017F>ent, I <U+017F>hall
defer the relation of it to a better Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
The mean time, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>
extreamly pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, and reproached
me daily for <U+017F>lighting his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and
at the <U+017F>ame time favouring a Chri<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
far le<U+017F>s worthy of my affection. He
left no <U+017F>tone unturned to compa<U+017F>s his
Amorous de<U+017F>igns, in<U+017F>omuch as at la<U+017F>t
he found the means to have a private
and dumb interview in the dark with
his Wife, whom he mi<U+017F>took for me,
and did her all the violence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be revenged of the in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility
I had for him. Having <U+017F>atisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
he parted with her without
knowing her, ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf for the
good Fortune of having obtained that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103330:75"/>
which he might have commanded
every day. But grieved at la<U+017F>t for
the outrage he thought he had done
me, and not knowing how to excu<U+017F>e
him<U+017F>elf to a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
he judg'd no better amends
could be made for his fault, than <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at Liberty two Lovers, who<U+017F>e
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>tly injured, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having been not only the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but fir<U+017F>t Author of their Love.
He <U+017F>ent me the News of his Re<U+017F>olution
by a Billet he writ to me, wherein he
pleaded in excu<U+017F>e the great Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he
had for me; that to expiate his fault,
he would deprive him<U+017F>elf for ever of
the <U+017F>ight of me, and <U+017F>end me back with
my Love to my Country, being all
could be de<U+017F>ired from a generous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val:
And that if I were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of
the pain and regret my ab<U+017F>ence would
co<U+017F>t him, I <U+017F>hould find him puni<U+017F>hed
beyond his de<U+017F>ert. My joy was not
greater than the trouble of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
upon receiving this News, which put
her into an un<U+017F>peakable affliction. Her
Nights and her Days were wholly
<U+017F>pent in Tears; <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed all means
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to prevent the misfortune <U+017F>he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103330:76"/>
apprehended from <hi>Alexander</hi>'s return
into <hi>Italy.</hi> I gave her way, choo<U+017F>ing
rather to renounce my Liberty than
<U+017F>ee her die for grief in the condition
<U+017F>he was in. But the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> the firme<U+017F>t
of men in what he re<U+017F>olves on, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he had to oppo<U+017F>e
a de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he had more rea<U+017F>on than he
to promote, con<U+017F>idering the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
<U+017F>he knew he had for me, which mu<U+017F>t
needs trouble her, was true to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution;
and knowing there was in
the Port a Chri<U+017F>tian Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el ready to
Sail for <hi>Italy,</hi> he cau<U+017F>ed it to be <U+017F>taid
for our Embarking therein. What a
trouble was it to the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> to <U+017F>ee
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate, and us on the
point of departing! Never was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<U+017F>o plunged in a Sea of de<U+017F>pair,
never were <U+017F>ighs <U+017F>o lamentable as hers;
I was resolved to entreat the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> to
put off our departure to another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion,
that I might gain time to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
her to grant me the favour; but
whether it were for the <U+017F>hame to <U+017F>ee
me, or for fear that the <U+017F>ight of me
might melt him into a tenderne<U+017F>s that
might alter the Re<U+017F>olution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he appear'd not at the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103330:76"/>
Morning we were to be gone, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olate
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> re<U+017F>olved to die, or to
follow us; <U+017F>he had long <U+017F>tudied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
a way how to do it: I was her
Bed-fellow, but neither of us <U+017F>lept a
wink. <hi>Laura,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, having con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
well what <U+017F>he would do, thou
knowe<U+017F>t the affection I ever had for
thee, that I have u<U+017F>ed thee more like
a Si<U+017F>ter than a Slave. Thou knowe<U+017F>t
my heart, and I need not tell thee I
cannot live without <hi>Alexander.</hi> I de<U+017F>ire
no acknowledgment of what I have
done for thee, (added <U+017F>he, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing me
with her face all bath'd in tears) but
for pity <U+017F>ake, for<U+017F>ake me not in the
mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate condition that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Love as I am, can be reduced
to, but do <U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ave my Life:
had <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired mine with <U+017F>uch melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, I could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it her, which <U+017F>he might perceive
by the tears I <U+017F>hed to accompany hers.
Then <U+017F>he told me of an intention <U+017F>he
had thought of, whereby get aboard
with us, and that <U+017F>he doubted not of
the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had the Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
he pretended to have for her; and
if he had not, <U+017F>he would comfort her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103330:77"/>
and find plea<U+017F>ure in Rage for the
ab<U+017F>ence of <U+017F>o ingrate a Per<U+017F>on; that
without the knowledge of any one in
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> <U+017F>he would be carried to his
Lodging, and thence aboard the Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el
we were to Embark in; and that
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>ending for me to be gone,
we might all three get aboard before
any Di<U+017F>covery could be made of her
departure. To give her content, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, but did really
apprehend the <U+017F>uce<U+017F>s of this affair,
and pre<U+017F>age, I know not how, that I
<U+017F>hould be the <U+017F>ufferer. 'Tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to yield ones <U+017F>elf up to
the conduct of Lovers, in that which
concerns the intere<U+017F>t of their affections;
they are apt to flatter them<U+017F>elves, to
puff them<U+017F>elves up with hope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no fear. When the day began
to appear in our Chamber, we thought
it high time to <U+017F>et about and take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for what we thought nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for
accompli<U+017F>hing our de<U+017F>ires. We got up,
and the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> having put on a Suit
of mine, commanded me to call her
one of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who was Purveyor
for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ready to Sacrifice
his Life for the Service of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103330:77"/>
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him for the basket wherein he
u<U+017F>ed to carry the Provi<U+017F>ion, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her <U+017F>elf in it, wrapt up in my
<hi>Barnus,</hi> commanded him to carry her
to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Lodging. I <U+017F>aw her go
away in this manner, waiting with
fear and impatience enough to hear
the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of this contrivance of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and expecting every moment
Orders from the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> for my going
away. At la<U+017F>t, the time of Embarking
being over<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
I was de<U+017F>irous to be informed

a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure enough,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> was gone, and that the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> having brought him to the Port,
returned for <hi>Bardon.</hi> Then it was, Sir,
I felt the <U+017F>troke of my ill Fortune, in
lo<U+017F>ing, not only the hope of returning
to my Country, which might have
given me <U+017F>ome comfort, but of ever
<U+017F>eeing the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> the Per<U+017F>on of the
World I had mo<U+017F>t kindne<U+017F>s for, and
one who rendred my Captivity plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing.
I could not doubt but her flight
would be laid to my charge; but the
con<U+017F>ideration of a Life <U+017F>o unhappy

re<U+017F>olutions for death, that, had you
taken notice at your arrival, you could

And in good earne<U+017F>t the lo<U+017F>s
of my dear <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> afflicted me <U+017F>o,
that the appearance of death could not
have done more. They asked me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
what was become of her? the
an<U+017F>wer I made, was, that I knew not:
But having been long taken for her
Confident, I was <U+017F>hrewdly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.
As for the re<U+017F>t of her Servants, you
might have read in their countenances,
the trouble of their minds.</p>
               <p>This is that, Sir, I had to <U+017F>ay to you
of the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s;</hi> and if you think this
Story may be of u<U+017F>e to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and
conduce to the procuring peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the <hi>Dey,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad you would relate it to him,
though I may appear guilty of having
committed a crime again<U+017F>t the one and
the other. But they have prudence
enough to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the condition
of a poor Slave, who<U+017F>e happine<U+017F>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
in her complaisance to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
who loved her <U+017F>o well as to
make her confident in affairs of this
con<U+017F>equence. The Turk made an<U+017F>wer,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103330:78"/>
that the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had <U+017F>o much kindne<U+017F>s for
her, and <U+017F>o little for the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> that
he would ea<U+017F>ily pardon the Trea<U+017F>on
<U+017F>he was guilty of; and as for the <hi>Dey,</hi>
he could not be much offended with
her, for having done his Daughter <U+017F>o
eminent a <U+017F>ervice, in a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting her in a
piece of unfaithfulne<U+017F>s to a Husband
who (the <hi>Dey</hi> knows) had not any
Love for her: and that he would make
u<U+017F>e of the particulars of this Story to
reconcile them; that he would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with <U+017F>ome Friends of
the <hi>Divan,</hi> and particularly with the
<hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Deys</hi> favourite, who had
great influence over him, and though
a Renegade, loved the Chri<U+017F>tians very
well, and might do her <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice.
To the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions he added a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
a<U+017F><U+017F>urances on his part, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
enough to oblige her extreamly.
This done, he withdrew, to avoid the
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion her Guard might have of a
longer di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it being already very
late, but promi<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee her again on
the morrow, and bring her News of
all that pa<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> being now at the Head of
<U+017F>o many <hi>Moors,</hi> thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>trong

enough to take the Field, and as <U+017F>oon
as it was day, marched down towards
the Town, to favour the retreat of his
Friends, and of the Souldiers who
came flocking in to him; <U+017F>o that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noon he had an Army of <hi>Moors</hi>
and <hi>Turks</hi> above ten thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>trong.
The <hi>Dey</hi> u<U+017F>ed all diligence po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
arm his people, but found him<U+017F>elf not
<U+017F>trong enough that day to encounter
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who<U+017F>e Arms were already
grown terrible to his Enemies, who
from his ju<U+017F>t indignation again<U+017F>t them
apprehended a Siege. But his quarrel
being chiefly to the <hi>Dey,</hi> and wanting
Cannon to attack him in the Ca<U+017F>tle
he was in, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was forced to wait
the arrival of the Artillery he had <U+017F>ent
for to the Port whereof he was Ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, having a<U+017F><U+017F>embled
the principal of his Friends, to make
his complaint to them of the unju<U+017F>t
proceedings of the <hi>Dey,</hi> and to demand
their advice, he was not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to hear them all maintain the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Galleys; that it was his
Wife was gone away with the Chri<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

for what he had done, in the belief he
was in of the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s intentions to make
away his Daughter. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> who
<U+017F>till fancied that they were abu<U+017F>ed,
would not vouch<U+017F>afe to contradict
them, but calling in the Captain of
his Guards, asked him before them, if
he had not the day before <U+017F>poken with
the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s.</hi> Poor <hi>Aly</hi> <U+017F>hivering for

before the General of the Galleys, he
had <U+017F>een the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> there, but that in

found only <hi>Laura</hi> weeping for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> for all this would not be

laught at the adventure, and could not

He was not much troubled at the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>take

He never <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected any treachery in

               <p>Sir, I was born at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and of one of
the be<U+017F>t Families of that Republick, but you
<U+017F>hall excu<U+017F>e me, if I conceal the name: I will
<U+017F>ave my Family that <U+017F>hame, <U+017F>ince my mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
can do it no credit. I was born in a
pro<U+017F>perous and flouri<U+017F>hing E<U+017F>tate, and my
Parents having no other Child, I was bred
with that care and expence I may rather
call profu<U+017F>e than great. It was my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that my Mother died when I was but
12 years old, and that my Father, though
aged, married a young Lady more con<U+017F>id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for Birth than E<U+017F>tate; but my Father
had <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>atisfie the ambition or
pride of a woman of quality. But the<U+017F>e were
not the Vanities my Mother-in-law was
<U+017F>ubject to, it was Love had the A<U+017F>cendent
over her. My Father was old, <U+017F>he was young
and hand<U+017F>om, and he had cau<U+017F>e to be jealous
of her: He let her <U+017F>tir but very rarely out of
her Lodging, and never but in his company,
and then only to Church, or to make a vi<U+017F>it
to a Friend or Relation. But who can re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
his fate? My Mother-in-law, little plea<U+017F>ed
with the <U+017F>evere hand my Father held over
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103330:83"/>
her, found her inclination to be unfaithful
to him, increa<U+017F>e more and more; nothing
provokes de<U+017F>ire more than re<U+017F>traint, and
difficulties and <U+017F>traits are Si<U+017F>ters of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<U+017F>he made u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>everal to carry on
<U+017F>ome little intrigues in the Town, but all to
no purpo<U+017F>e; my Father, an old Ma<U+017F>ter in
Gallantry, was <U+017F>o cunning and mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful,
that nothing could e<U+017F>cape him. So that the
kind Lady de<U+017F>pairing of relief from abroad,
was willing to try if <U+017F>he could find at home
any means to <U+017F>atisfie her inclinations. She
ca<U+017F>t her eyes on a Man, of condition <U+017F>o
mean, I dare not for her reputation let you
know what it was, though otherwi<U+017F>e very
hand<U+017F>om, hone<U+017F>t, and till then very faithful
to my Father, who had more tru<U+017F>t in him,

and familiarity <U+017F>o di<U+017F>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Lady of her quality, la<U+017F>ted for
<U+017F>ome time without being di<U+017F>covered, till at
la<U+017F>t by ill fortune for them and for me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid me down to <U+017F>leep on a bed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
in my Mother-in-laws chamber, I was
an eye-witne<U+017F>s of their Infamy: they were
not aware of me, my Maid having by
chance covered me with a piece of Tape<U+017F>try,
laid u<U+017F>ually on the bed. I <U+017F>aw them, and they
me, with what <U+017F>urprize you may imagine.

I was then 14 or 15 years old. Was he not
a Slave, <U+017F>ays the <hi>Turk?</hi> interrupting with
a tone full of joy and <U+017F>urprize. Yes, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd
<hi>Laura</hi> (a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht at the Que<U+017F>tion,
which made her look earne<U+017F>tly on him) he
was a Slave, and of <hi>Turky.</hi> Ah Madam,
cries the other, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, is
it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould not know <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en?</hi> and
that you <U+017F>hould be Madam <hi>Elinor?</hi> At
this <hi>Laura</hi> was mute for <U+017F>ome time, and
then recollecting her <U+017F>elf, Oh Heavens! is it
you, my poor <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he? By what good
fortune have I met you here, and fallen in
your hands? By the be<U+017F>t fortune in the
world both for you and me, <U+017F>ays the <hi>Turk,</hi>
ravi<U+017F>hed with joy to find him<U+017F>elf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to <U+017F>erve her, and being under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
I am to you, I <U+017F>hould be the mo<U+017F>t
ingrateful of men, if I imploy not my <U+017F>elf
in your <U+017F>ervice. I know you may accu<U+017F>e me
on the account of your Mother-in-law, but
what could a poor <U+017F>lave have done, tempted
by the charms of a fair Lady, who offered
him Money and Liberty when he plea<U+017F>ed?
You will confe<U+017F>s, men are gain'd by le<U+017F>s mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that if I committed a Crime in
doing as I did, after the Confidence <U+017F>o good
a Ma<U+017F>ter as your Father repo<U+017F>ed in me, and
the bounty he <U+017F>hewed me, yet it is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103330:84"/>
at lea<U+017F>t I believe I have made
<U+017F>ome amends for my fault, in <U+017F>aving
your Lives, which your Mother would have
robbed both you and him of by poy<U+017F>on. But I
had that influence over her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that
I diverted her from it. She made me a
thou<U+017F>and promi<U+017F>es, if I would put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
that horrible de<U+017F>ign; but becau<U+017F>e
you are ignorant what followed that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
I will tell you in few words.</p>
               <p>Your <U+017F>ight of us, as you <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
extreamly both the one and the
other; and in that de<U+017F>perate Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
your Mother-in-Law was then in, I
know not what <U+017F>he would have done
to have been rid of you. But, as I
told you, I oppo<U+017F>ed her, and made her
under<U+017F>tand, that the cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed,
would certainly plunge us into
irreparable Mi<U+017F>chiefs, and doubtle<U+017F>s,
co<U+017F>t us both our Lives. That it were
better to endeavour to gain you by fair
means, in hopes that being very good-natur'd,
you would not pur<U+017F>ue our
de<U+017F>truction, by making your Father
acquainted with that which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be the cau<U+017F>e of his Death, and
bring him to his Grave You cannot but
remember I went alone with you out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103330:84"/>
of the Chamber to per<U+017F>wade you.
And that I told you, it concern'd the
Honour of your Hou<U+017F>e to keep the
matter private, with <U+017F>everal other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
with which you expre<U+017F>s'd your
<U+017F>elf convinced. At la<U+017F>t, you promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
me not to make any more noi<U+017F>e
of it, if your Mother-in-Law would,
for the future, keep within the bounds
of her Duty. I made a relation of
all this to her, expecting that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of your di<U+017F>cretion, <U+017F>o well
known in the Family, would have
pa<U+017F>t for current Security, for your
keeping your word. But it could not
<U+017F>ecure her from <U+017F>trange inquietude
and trouble of Mind. She could not
<U+017F>ee you without <U+017F>hame, nor come near
your Father without trembling. She
buzz'd in<U+017F>tantly in my Ears, that there
was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of making you both a
Sacrifice to her Repo<U+017F>e; and that till
then <U+017F>he could not expect any Plea<U+017F>ure
in her Life. She told me, I mu<U+017F>t help
her to effect the de<U+017F>ign, or expect to
be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould feel the weight
of her wrath. I endeavoured the be<U+017F>t
I could to reduce her to Rea<U+017F>on, but
for <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>he would not hear any.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103330:85"/>
At la<U+017F>t, her ill humour de<U+017F>ired only
the <U+017F>atisfaction of your being put out
of<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> your Lodging, and was content to
find out <U+017F>everal pretences to per<U+017F>wade
your Father to put you into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
or at lea<U+017F>t out of his Hou<U+017F>e.
Notwith<U+017F>tanding all the Arts of her
Complai<U+017F>ance and Cunning, <U+017F>he found
it no ea<U+017F>ie matter to bring this about;
but for the quiet of the Hou<U+017F>e, it was
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to plea<U+017F>e her, and place you
under Pen<U+017F>ion in a Nunnery. Shortly
after, whether it were that you had
di<U+017F>covered the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, or that <U+017F>he
fear'd you had done <U+017F>o, or rather that
<U+017F>he was willing to be rid of me, by
this Stratagem <U+017F>he came one Night to
my Chamber, while your Father was
a<U+017F>leep, and with a fright in her looks
told me, I was undone, that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
knew all, and that I had no more
but that Night for to <U+017F>ave my <U+017F>elf.
Whereupon <U+017F>he gave me Money, and
<U+017F>eeing me re<U+017F>olved to be gone, bid me
her la<U+017F>t farewel. I kept, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the Keys of the Hou<U+017F>e, and
<U+017F>o got ea<U+017F>ily out. I had, for a Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e,
taken a black Suit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and as <U+017F>oon as it was day, and the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103330:85"/>
Port open, I hired a Felucca, which
carried me to <hi>Legorne,</hi> where I lay
private three days, <U+017F>taying for a Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el
of the Great Dukes, which was to
carry a Pre<U+017F>ent to <hi>Mahomet Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> my
Ancient Friend, who made u<U+017F>e of
his Intere<U+017F>t with the <hi>Dey</hi> to re<U+017F>tore me
my E<U+017F>tate, which <U+017F>ince I was a Slave,
had been Confi<U+017F>cated, upon a belief
I was dead. But having fail'd of his
de<U+017F>ire, he procured me in recompence,
the Secretaries place, which is no
great matter here. This, Madam, is the
account of my Life <U+017F>ince I left <hi>Italy.</hi>
You may oblige me in acquainting
me with yours, which I could not
come to the knowledge of, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard <U+017F>ince from <hi>Genoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which remains to be told you,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Elinor</hi> (whom we will yet call
<hi>Laura)</hi> is a <U+017F>tory full of troubles and
misfortunes; the more difficult for me
to relate, that a Per<U+017F>on of Quality
cannot but be a<U+017F>hamed of them. But
I will be free with you.</p>
               <p>Having <U+017F>pent two Years in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
I was placed in, my Father mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with many tears, took me home;
where for the time I <U+017F>tayed there, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103330:86"/>
was under continual Per<U+017F>ecution from
my Mother-in-Law; who having got
the A<U+017F>cendent over the good Man,
made him believe what <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed.
She had new de<U+017F>igns in her Head,
which you may believe was the
cau<U+017F>e of the fear <U+017F>he put you in: for
my Father never had the lea<U+017F>t know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your familiarity, and was much
troubled at your running away, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he had lo<U+017F>t in you the be<U+017F>t Servant
he had. He had de<U+017F>igned to have <U+017F>et you
at Liberty, which was the rea<U+017F>on he
<U+017F>ent not after you as he might have
done. I was by this time become <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
clear <U+017F>ighted, and what I knew
of my Mother-in-Law, made me <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
every thing <U+017F>he did: I watched
her narrowly, and in few days di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a new Gallant. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that after the mi<U+017F>chiefs <U+017F>he had
done me, I fail'd not to do her all the
ill Offices in my power: it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our Sex never to Pardon. But
be<U+017F>ides the plea<U+017F>ure of Revenge, I was
engaged in Honour again<U+017F>t her. This
rai<U+017F>ed a War between us more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than ever, and my Father had
trouble enough to content us both.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103330:86"/>
At fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf hard
enough for me, having once already
turn'd me out of the Hou<U+017F>e, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<U+017F>ent you packing; and putting
on a bold face, fear'd nothing, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I would not accu<U+017F>e her of any
thing, but her impudence could bring
her off, my Evidence being gone. But
when <U+017F>he perceived by my ob<U+017F>tructing
her new practices, rallying her on all
occa<U+017F>ions, and other cutting effects of
my re<U+017F>entment, that I under<U+017F>tood her
Secrets, <U+017F>he <U+017F>pared nothing that Rage
and Fury could <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t to her again<U+017F>t
me. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he fell heavy upon me
with my Father; and having not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to return me into the
Mona<U+017F>tery, forced him to turn me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
out of his Hou<U+017F>e, and place me
with his Relations; where I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ix
Months with one, and <U+017F>ix Months with
another, to the great di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of the
Family. Till at la<U+017F>t a Grandee of
<hi>Spain,</hi> an old Friend of my Fathers,
having been created Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by <hi>Genoa</hi> to go and take
Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Government, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intreated him to take me along
with him, which he readily did. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103330:87"/>
Viceroy and his Lady received and
entertained me, not only as the
Daughter of their intimate Friend, but
as their own, and honoured me with
<U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Civility and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I thought my <U+017F>elf too happy
in being of their Train. And the
truth is, I was not deceived; the<U+017F>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of kindne<U+017F>s growing every
day to greater perfection, e<U+017F>pecially on
the part of the Viceroy's Lady, who
appeared not able to live a moment
without me. She had been a great
Beauty, and was not then unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome,
though not very young. She
kept nothing from me, but imparted
to me her mo<U+017F>t private thoughts, and
made me the Confident of her deare<U+017F>t
affections. This la<U+017F>ted as long as I
was di<U+017F>intere<U+017F>s'd, but there is no tru<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another of our Sex, e<U+017F>pecially
in matters of Love. I was reputed not
unhand<U+017F>om, and having a full Pur<U+017F>e
at command, I lived at that Court
with Splendor enough. It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
known, I was not the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>iderable
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<U+017F>et off with a little Beauty, rai<U+017F>ed
<U+017F>o great a number of Pretenders to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103330:87"/>
me, that I could not pa<U+017F>s a day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
treats and addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of Love. The
Court of <hi>Naples</hi> hath always pa<U+017F>s'd for
the mo<U+017F>t Gallant of <hi>Italy,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of
the multitude of Per<U+017F>ons of Quality
in the Kingdom, but was never <U+017F>o
plea<U+017F>ant as then. I was <U+017F>o young that
I knew not what Love was, and was
not concerned to make ha<U+017F>te to learn
it, but made the Cares and Sighs of tho<U+017F>e
in Love, my <U+017F>port and diverti<U+017F>ement.
But Love will in time be revenged,
and make <U+017F>port of us that made <U+017F>port
of him. I had not yet <U+017F>een the man
who had the <U+017F>ecret to affect my heart,
no not one who could plea<U+017F>e, though
that Court had of all <U+017F>orts, and <U+017F>ome
very hand<U+017F>ome. The Son of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,
being a young Lord very well
accompli<U+017F>hed, and not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for me, did but give me trouble.
But as I hinted before, I pay'd dear for
that indifference and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>lights I
gloried <U+017F>o much in Five or <U+017F>ix months
after our arrival at <hi>Naples,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at Court a young Gentleman
whom Love <U+017F>eems to have rai<U+017F>ed up
for my ruin. It was the Marque<U+017F>s
<hi>Hippolito</hi> of the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Accelyn,</hi> equally
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103330:88"/>
con<U+017F>iderable for his good parts as his
Birth; a Youth who<U+017F>e out<U+017F>ide was
taking enough to charm at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight,
but as traiterous and wicked within,
as he was outwardly hand<U+017F>om and
well accompli<U+017F>hed. When you have
heard out my <U+017F>tory, you will <U+017F>ay I
<U+017F>peak with too much moderation. It
is hard to hate what we have been
once truly in Love with. In <U+017F>pite of
that unpardonable outrage he did me,
I find that if I <U+017F>aw him, and had it in
my power to take my revenge of him
by death, which he hath but too
well de<U+017F>erved, my re<U+017F>entment would
give place to the inclination I had for
him. He was newly come from <hi>France,</hi>
and had got the Court-air, <U+017F>o peculiar
and natural to tho<U+017F>e of quality of that
Nation. I was extreamly plea<U+017F>ed to
<U+017F>ee him, and looked upon him with
delight, the fir<U+017F>t time he appeared at
Court; and was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it, though
with <U+017F>hame and anger at my <U+017F>elf. From
thenceforth he was con<U+017F>tantly in my
thoughts, though very trouble<U+017F>ome to
me. I was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with my <U+017F>elf for
it, and would upon any terms have
put him out of my mind, but the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103330:88"/>
more I endeavoured it, the more I
found him <U+017F>ettled there. I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times after, and to the end the
War within me would fain have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
my <U+017F>elf, it was not for my
honour to entertain <U+017F>uch thoughts of
that Gentleman; but I found in the end
my ingenuity deceived me. That
which contributed mo<U+017F>t to my ruin,
that both by his looks and his actions
he <U+017F>eemed to prefer me before all the
Ladies of the Court, and though he
did not declare <U+017F>o much, yet I could
ob<U+017F>erve he had more than an ordinary
re<U+017F>pect for me, and would now and
then <U+017F>ay to my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome things I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
he might and would have <U+017F>aid to
me. At la<U+017F>t I made my <U+017F>elf of his Party,
and blaming my pa<U+017F>t coyne<U+017F>s, I thought
it very allowable and ju<U+017F>t, to have
<U+017F>ome e<U+017F>teem for a man who merited
it from all the World: Having once
entertained this thought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it as rea<U+017F>onable, my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
and Love finding my heart already
more than half open, pre<U+017F>s'd in and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
took it. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, who
often diverted her <U+017F>elf in entertaining
me with all the Intrigues of the Court,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103330:89"/>
having one day told me <U+017F>everal Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
asked me if I knew the Marque<U+017F>s
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, for that, for <U+017F>ome
days pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved him very <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and out of humour, which <U+017F>he
took for an effect of <U+017F>ome inclination.
Had <U+017F>he look'd upon me when <U+017F>he
asked me the que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>he might read
in my countenance how much I was
concerned; for I chang'd colour three
or four times. But being upon the
Tarra<U+017F>s of the Palace on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he was looking that way
and took no notice of me; <U+017F>o that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
time to recover my <U+017F>elf, I an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an affected coldne<U+017F>s, that he
was a dull young fellow, and I believed
incapable of Love: and thereupon out
of Jealou<U+017F>ie her que<U+017F>tion had rai<U+017F>ed
in me, I made a de<U+017F>cription of him as
really unlike him, as contrary to the
thoughts I had of him. The Viceroy's
Lady fell a laughing, and having look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon me <U+017F>o, as <U+017F>he believed, would
have put me out of countenance; is it
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, that you <U+017F>hould think
<U+017F>o of a man whom all the other Ladies
e<U+017F>teem the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t of the Court?
If I were not very well per<U+017F>waded of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103330:89"/>
your indifference for all men, I <U+017F>hould
believe of you quite contrary to what
you <U+017F>ay. But look to your <U+017F>elf, for
<U+017F>ooner or later you will be met with,
and your in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible heart <U+017F>hall have
her turn as well as others. As for me,
I confe<U+017F>s, were I as you, that young
Gentleman would plea<U+017F>e me, and I
would not have you <U+017F>light him: think
of it, he is a Per<U+017F>on of merit and worth,
and wants nothing of what may ju<U+017F>tly
de<U+017F>erve Love from a fair Lady as you
are. Who would not have believed but
<U+017F>he <U+017F>poke in good earne<U+017F>t? Who could
have mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted her after <U+017F>o many
kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es and favours <U+017F>he daily laid
out on me? I know not whether
I was to blame, but mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I
yielded my <U+017F>elf to be taken, and
was ready to un<U+017F>ay in her pre<U+017F>ence
all that I had <U+017F>poken again<U+017F>t the
Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and to acknowledge
I had prevented her in the thoughts <U+017F>he
had been plea<U+017F>ed to in<U+017F>pire into me of
him, but my mode<U+017F>ty re<U+017F>trained me. I
thought my <U+017F>elf concerned in honour,
to expect an Addre<U+017F>s from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would confe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf taken. I
could never di<U+017F>cover perfectly this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103330:90"/>
Ladies de<U+017F>ign, but as far as I can gue<U+017F>s
by the con<U+017F>equence, <U+017F>he que<U+017F>tion'd
me of pure jealou<U+017F>ie, endeavouring to
di<U+017F>cover whether I had any affection
for the Marque<U+017F>s. She had often <U+017F>een us
talk together; judging by her thoughts
of him, that it was hard enough for
a Lady to be acquainted with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of <U+017F>o many charming Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
without loving him; <U+017F>he had
doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome apprehen<U+017F>ion I had
on his account ceas'd to be in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible.
But finding by what I <U+017F>aid, that I
continued indifferent, her jealou<U+017F>ie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
place to Love-policy, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired
to <U+017F>ettle <U+017F>ome friend<U+017F>hip between him
and me, to <U+017F>erve her for a pretence to
<U+017F>ee him as oft as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired. At lea<U+017F>t I
am of opinion the<U+017F>e were the rea<U+017F>ons
obliged her to <U+017F>peak of me as <U+017F>he did,
and to tell me, if ever I meant to love, I
could not make a better choice. I <U+017F>tood
out <U+017F>tifly to the end, telling her, my
Liberty was <U+017F>o precious, that I would
not part with it for any con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World, if the keeping de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
wholly on me: But becau<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e of my condition were not born
to enjoy it all their Life; whatever I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103330:90"/>
endured, I would be guided by my
Friends, and ab<U+017F>olutely obey their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
who had the right to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of
me. Hereupon <U+017F>he embraced me, and
<U+017F>aid, All the Maids of the World would
be wi<U+017F>e, were they of my humour, and
followed my example. In the mean
time, <U+017F>ince I was re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>light
the Coun<U+017F>el of Friends, it was her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I <U+017F>hould admit the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
to <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>ometimes. But Madam,
<U+017F>aid I, interrupting her, hath he de<U+017F>ired
leave to do it, and is it at his reque<U+017F>t
that you make the motion? She
an<U+017F>wered, <U+017F>aying, that I need not
trouble my <U+017F>elf for that, but might
believe this overture came not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from her; and that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>s
had found me out as well as
others. You may imagine what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
<U+017F>he did me, in telling me this, who
de<U+017F>ired nothing more than the love of
that Gentleman.</p>
               <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e being over, we parted
extreamly mi<U+017F>taken in our thoughts
of one another. She imagin'd I was
<U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame, and altogether in<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
of love; and I thought <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>poken as a Friend, and really de<U+017F>ired to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103330:91"/>
<U+017F>ee me in love with the Marque<U+017F>s:
We began to have the young Lords
company, after the particular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
between him and <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o,</hi>
Son to the Viceroy, gave him free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
where he plea<U+017F>ed; and the
Viceroy having no <U+017F>mall e<U+017F>teem for the
Marque<U+017F>s, was not only glad to <U+017F>ee him
at Court, but ingaged him by his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to come to him oftner. I <U+017F>hall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
mentioning what the Lady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
on her part; but you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it very probable, that having the
kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had for him, <U+017F>he omitted
nothing in her power to further the<U+017F>e
Vi<U+017F>its. At fir<U+017F>t he was altogether for
me, at lea<U+017F>t in appearance; for <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
days he wanted nothing of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or complai<U+017F>ance to plea<U+017F>e me.
Whereever I went he <U+017F>till waited upon
me, approved all that I <U+017F>aid, and
took my part on all occa<U+017F>ions. In a
word, he practi<U+017F>ed all that may be
done, for gaining a-Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; and was
pre<U+017F>ently looked upon in Court as a
new Servant of mine. Many of my
Friends congratulated my Conque<U+017F>t,
and I could not but laugh at them. Not
but that I believed it, being ea<U+017F>ily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103330:91"/>
to credit what I <U+017F>o much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired,
but that I was afraid to believe it
<U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, and was unwilling it <U+017F>hould be
known, to avoid the <U+017F>hame that might
attend a mi<U+017F>take. He had not as then
<U+017F>poke to me of Love; and the lea<U+017F>t I
could do, was to expect he <U+017F>hould
declare him<U+017F>elf. A Lover of <U+017F>o much
Wit as the Marque<U+017F>s, could not fail of
finding an occa<U+017F>ion. But I know not
whether fortune befriended him <U+017F>o ill,
as not to afford him one. However, 'tis
certain he never took any to di<U+017F>cover
his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion by Speech: All that I
knew of it, was from his looks and
his <U+017F>ighs, which perhaps my kindne<U+017F>s
interpreted too favourably. Men being
now accu<U+017F>tomed to a general Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that in <U+017F>hew and appearance, both
their words and their actions <U+017F>peak
altogether of Love. The<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>ing
blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms of an apparent affection, were
all bla<U+017F>ted on the <U+017F>udden. I was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at it to a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, to <U+017F>ee him
<U+017F>o far advanced to make <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden
a <U+017F>top, at a time I lea<U+017F>t expected it,
and prepared my <U+017F>elf to give occa<U+017F>ion
to di<U+017F>cover his affection, which I
fear'd his re<U+017F>pect for me, or his fear
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103330:92"/>
to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, had hindered from
doing. I could not imagine the cau<U+017F>e
of <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden a change; for three whole
days he ab<U+017F>ented from the Court, and
when he appeared there, he looked like
a man <U+017F>o cold, <U+017F>o altered, as if he dur<U+017F>t
not ca<U+017F>t an eye upon me, whereas before
he was jovial and complai<U+017F>ant, and his
eye never off me, you cannot ea<U+017F>ily
imagine how terribly this vext me. I
was upon the point of asking him the
rea<U+017F>on, and had certainly done it, but
that I was over-rul'd by a little haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine<U+017F>s
and pride, which making me
look on his incon<U+017F>tant proceeding, as
an effect of manife<U+017F>t Treachery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pired
me with <U+017F>corn and aver<U+017F>ion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
him; which however I <U+017F>marted
for in the end: for two whole days I
did nothing but weep and complain of
Love and my own wickedne<U+017F>s. The
Viceroy's Lady ob<U+017F>erving me <U+017F>ad and
dejected, though I did all in my power
to hide part of my trouble, asked me
what I did ail, which probably <U+017F>he knew
but too well, but was willing to have
the plea<U+017F>ure of hearing what I would
<U+017F>ay, I, who till then had not the lea<U+017F>t
rea<U+017F>on to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t her, made no <U+017F>cruple
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103330:92"/>
of telling her in plain terms the cau<U+017F>e
of my grief, and told her, <U+017F>he had
more than any contributed thereto.
This made her blu<U+017F>h, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the <U+017F>udden what I meant, but
thinking without doubt I had di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her <U+017F>ecret. But I fell unhappily
to explaining my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly
confe<U+017F>s'd to her, that what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid
to me of the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Hippolito,</hi> had
produced in me <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of
kindne<U+017F>s for him, which co<U+017F>t me then
very dear, having been very confident
<U+017F>he would not have deceived me, but
that the Marque<U+017F>s had now deceived
us both. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ays the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<U+017F>s,
I was willing to conceal from
you the incon<U+017F>tancy and change of a
fooli<U+017F>h young fla<U+017F>h, and did de<U+017F>ign
not to <U+017F>peak to you any more of him,
not thinking you could be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for him after what I had heard
you <U+017F>ay of him. But <U+017F>ince you are
aware of his incon<U+017F>tancy, and <U+017F>o much
concern'd at it, I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that to
my grief as much as yours, I have di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
he is otherwi<U+017F>e engaged.
She perceived me blu<U+017F>h extreamly at
that word, and in truth I was <U+017F>o
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103330:93"/>
di<U+017F>ordered within, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to hide my de<U+017F>pair. Otherwi<U+017F>e enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged!
Madam, <U+017F>aid I, <U+017F>ighing: Yes,
an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, to a new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s very
lately. Judge you, continued <U+017F>he,
what I <U+017F>aid to him on that occa<U+017F>ion,
and whether he did de<U+017F>erve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
having expre<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for you, that I thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
a man could have been more
deeply in Love. Oh Heavens, cry'd
<U+017F>he, how deceitful are men now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days!
He excu<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf by the
Friend<U+017F>hip he hath for my Son; that
to be his Rival, were to betray him,
and that the confidence he had in him,
in acquainting him at his arrival, with
his affection for you, obliged him to
make a Sacrifice of his heart, to <U+017F>erve
my Sons intere<U+017F>t. Sorry excu<U+017F>es, I
confe<U+017F>s <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, but how can we help
it? 'Tis a mercy however, he knows
not the favourable inclination you
have for him, for which he is unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
beholding to me, as the cau<U+017F>e of
your kindne<U+017F>s. He <U+017F>hould never have
known the<U+017F>e worthy inclinations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I: I never di<U+017F>covered them to
any but your <U+017F>elf Madam, for whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103330:93"/>
I had no re<U+017F>erve, and I hope you have
not told him. Think not, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, I
could <U+017F>o far forget my <U+017F>elf; though I
were not <U+017F>o much your Friend as you
know I am; I know very well with
what caution to manage their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
who repo<U+017F>e a confidence in me.
Then I asked her trembling, whether
<U+017F>he knew the fair Lady had robbed us
of him? That, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, I cannot learn
of him, but I will endeavour to di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it by my Son, who without que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
knows who <U+017F>he is; leave that to me,
and I will bring you news of her as
<U+017F>oon as I can di<U+017F>cover her.</p>
               <p>Thus did my Rival triumph and
laugh at me. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fool, in that I had not then more
wit, than to tru<U+017F>t any Woman; but it
was the confidence I had in her, that
blinded me. Yet when I call to mind
a thou<U+017F>and things then <U+017F>poken and
done, I cannot but wonder, I who had
<U+017F>een <U+017F>o much of the world, could not
make di<U+017F>covery of the treachery they
acted again<U+017F>t me. I did nothing
but torment my <U+017F>elf night and day,
and avoided all occa<U+017F>ions of being
with the Marque<U+017F>s, for fear my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103330:94"/>
<U+017F>hould to my di<U+017F>grace prevail over
my re<U+017F>olutions. I <U+017F>aw him entertain
him<U+017F>elf commonly with the Viceroys
Lady, and asking her one day, what
it was they di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>he had di<U+017F>covered the <U+017F>ecret I
was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to know; <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, no, but that I <U+017F>hould not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my <U+017F>elf, for the Marque<U+017F>s would
come to me again; and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
how to bring it about. I was
vext at this, and told her I did not
de<U+017F>ire it: that <U+017F>he might do her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,
but that I de<U+017F>ired to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
And the truth is, the pains I
endured, would, I believe, by degrees
have made me in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and cured
me at la<U+017F>t. But on a day the Viceroy
treated us in the Garden, I quitted
the Company, and walking a<U+017F>ide to
mu<U+017F>e in a dark and <U+017F>olitary place, I
met with the Marque<U+017F>s. I thought it
an effect of the Ladies care, and that
<U+017F>he had made u<U+017F>e of this occa<U+017F>ion to
reconcile us. I know not whether he
took the haughtine<U+017F>s and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s
of the Looks I entertain'd him with
for an ill Omen, or not; but <U+017F>ure I
am, he trembled as he approached me,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103330:94"/>
and with a very <U+017F>ettled tone, told me,
it was very <U+017F>trange to <U+017F>ee a per<U+017F>on of
my Humour finding out <U+017F>o <U+017F>olitary a
Walk, there being <U+017F>o much good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the Garden: it had been, <U+017F>aid
he, excu<U+017F>able in any other, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of <U+017F>ome amorous thoughts; but
for you Madam—for me, replied I,
interrupting him, and who hath told
you but I may have been led hither
by Love? Ah Madam, an<U+017F>wered he,
we know you too well to entertain
any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion; and I am <U+017F>ure, if
you can love any thing, it mu<U+017F>t be
only your <U+017F>elf, 'Tis well, replied I,
if it be true as you <U+017F>ay, that I love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all; but as for what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me with, 'tis reported you are
not altogether indifferent: there is
<U+017F>ome ground for the report, Madam,
indifference being a Quality I never
<U+017F>tood much upon, e<U+017F>pecially towards
you of all the people in the World.
What not towards me? replied I,
when you knew me in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. 'Tis
true, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, I was told
<U+017F>o, but <U+017F>ubmitted however to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tiny
of tho<U+017F>e many unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
you have made <U+017F>uch in this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103330:95"/>
Court. In matter of affection, <U+017F>aid I,
we are not to be led by example; <U+017F>ome
have more merit, or at lea<U+017F>t better
Fortune than others; we are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
towards <U+017F>ome, when we are not <U+017F>o to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others: One per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e,
without knowing wherefore among<U+017F>t
an infinite of others who <U+017F>hall not
have that advantage though equally
hand<U+017F>om. In a word, every one hath
his lucky moment: you may believe
I could not have <U+017F>aid all this without
blu<U+017F>hing. The Marque<U+017F>s having heard
me with <U+017F>uch attention, as clearly di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
him <U+017F>urpriz'd at my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
was ju<U+017F>t going to an<U+017F>wer me, when
the Viceroys Lady, who would never
with her good will have us both out of
her <U+017F>ight, unhappily interrupted us,
and <U+017F>urprizing us on the <U+017F>udden, <U+017F>aid,
I dare lay a good wager you were
<U+017F>peaking of Love: 'tis true, an<U+017F>wered
I <U+017F>miling, we were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of a
very plea<U+017F>ant que<U+017F>tion, occa<U+017F>ioned by
being reproached by the Marque<U+017F>s for
my in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility. He hath rea<U+017F>on,
Madam, replied the Lady<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> to prevent
an an<U+017F>wer from the Marque<U+017F>s; he who
is <U+017F>o deeply in Love, may ju<U+017F>tly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103330:95"/>
you: if you know it not, I
can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of it, and will in time
tell you more. I thought, <U+017F>aid I, we
had not been <U+017F>o great <U+017F>trangers, but I
might have known it from him<U+017F>elf,
without being obliged to another for
the News, and if we two were alone,
I know how I would quarrel with him
for it. All this was <U+017F>poken with an
air of raillery, which wrought very
effectually on the inclinations of the
Marque<U+017F>s, which the Lady di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed
of; I applied to my <U+017F>elf, imagining
what <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of it, was done for my
honour, and to engage me to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
an<U+017F>wer which I gave. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
fell into other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
led us in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly towards the company.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, the Marque<U+017F>s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mu<U+017F>ed all night on what I had
<U+017F>aid, found me alone looking out at a
window of the Palace, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
on the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
asked me, though I had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to love, whether I would be
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at one who loved me
with the greate<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the
World: I an<U+017F>wered, there were
but few I would allow that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103330:96"/>
to; and that in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
I knew but one I could permit to
u<U+017F>e that priviledge. I believe he could
not but under<U+017F>tand I meant him, and
my looks did but too much confirm
him in the opinion; he, though he
ob<U+017F>erv'd it, but would not take notice
of it. I know, Madam, <U+017F>ays he, it is
extreamly imprudent to propo<U+017F>e a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of a meaner rank than yours, or
one of <U+017F>mall merit, or not Ma<U+017F>ter of
Qualities worthy your e<U+017F>teem; but
the per<U+017F>on I <U+017F>peak of, is beyond all
exception. Finding him take a cour<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o contrary to what I expected, I had
not patience to permit him to make
an end, having ground enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it was not for him<U+017F>elf he made
this Declaration; and interrupting
him briskly, A Lover, <U+017F>aid I, (blu<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with anger and <U+017F>hame) perhaps
would not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e, provided he were
like the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Hippolito;</hi> any other
may come too late. I had <U+017F>carce <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the<U+017F>e words, but I repented me of
them, and unwilling to hear any more
in the confu<U+017F>ion the torrent of my
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had put me in, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.
Oh Heavens! cry'd he, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103330:96"/>
after to <U+017F>tay me, How unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
am I? Unfortunate, <U+017F>aid I, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward him: Is the e<U+017F>teem I have
for you a means to make you unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Yes, Madam, replied he with
a <U+017F>igh; that precious and charming
e<U+017F>teem, I was made believe, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be gain'd, which I would have
purcha<U+017F>ed with all I have dear in the
World—He <U+017F>topped there. Well,
<U+017F>aid I, what of that e<U+017F>teem? Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
an<U+017F>wered he, they have made
me renounce it. I had no <U+017F>ooner
heard the<U+017F>e words but I went on my
way, having given him <U+017F>ome looks
full of indignation; but <U+017F>eeing him
follow me, and not able for very grief
to <U+017F>peak to him, I made <U+017F>igns to him
with my hand, that he <U+017F>hould come
no further. It is beyond imagination
what a de<U+017F>perate condition I was in
that night: Rage, <U+017F>hame, <U+017F>pite, fury,
repentance; in a word, all the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Lover, mock'd, betrayed,
a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted me by turns I fell <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick, that
for many days I kept my Bed; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>peak to him once
more, to know who had cau<U+017F>ed him to
renounce my e<U+017F>teem, as he had told me.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103330:97"/>
I pre<U+017F>ently fancied it was <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o;</hi>
but was very de<U+017F>irous to learn how
the matter had been managed, and
expected every day to <U+017F>ee him with
his Friend, or with the Viceroys La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that I <U+017F>hould find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to <U+017F>peak to him of it. In the
mean time he came not to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
though all the Court did me that
honour, for the <U+017F>hort time I continued
indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed: this <U+017F>urprized me extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and hearing one day he was in my
Anti-chamber, I <U+017F>ent <hi>Clarice</hi> my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to de<U+017F>ire him to come and <U+017F>ee
me, having <U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ay to him.
He would have come in<U+017F>tantly, as the
Maid brought me word; but the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys
Lady, with whom he was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>ing,
<U+017F>tay'd him: at which I was not
a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed; but much more,
when <U+017F>oon after I <U+017F>aw him come in, in
the company of that Lady. He looked
very pale, and his countenance much
altered, which contributed not a little
to allay my bitterne<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t him,
though I had <U+017F>mall rea<U+017F>on to think my
<U+017F>elf concerned in honour of that
change that appeared in his looks. You
<U+017F>ee, Madam, <U+017F>aid I to the Lady at their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103330:97"/>
entrance, this Gentleman mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ent
for, if we de<U+017F>ire the plea<U+017F>ure of his
Company. The<U+017F>e are favours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
I, not u<U+017F>ual with me, and <U+017F>uch
as I would not by any means have
done him, while it was in my power
to have any e<U+017F>teem for him. But
<U+017F>ince he hath told me, they have made
him renounce my e<U+017F>teem, you may
believe, Madam, I am not much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to have any e<U+017F>teem for him;
and that what I now do, proceeds not
from any <U+017F>uch cau<U+017F>e. 'Tis true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the Lady, he does not de<U+017F>erve
your e<U+017F>teem, but you mu<U+017F>t pardon his
Youth. I will pardon him, replyed
I, on condition he will tell me who
had the power over his Heart or Wit,
to make <U+017F>light of an e<U+017F>teem not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unworthy a Gentleman of
his Quality; and 'tis for that purpo<U+017F>e
I have <U+017F>ent for him hither. He <U+017F>tood
mute; <U+017F>o that turning my Head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lady, to ask her the rea<U+017F>on
of his <U+017F>ilence, I was again <U+017F>urpriz'd
to find the Lady in greater di<U+017F>order
than he. I was ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>peaking to him
again, when I <U+017F>aw him ri<U+017F>e to tell me
with trouble in his face; I will <U+017F>atisfie
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103330:98"/>
you, Madam, in that particular, but
intreat you let me take a fitter time.
A fitter time, <U+017F>aid I, and why not
now? Is it my Lady that hinders
you? You know I conceal nothing
from her. Ah, if it be I, <U+017F>aid the
Lady, I will withdraw to leave you
at liberty; and with that <U+017F>he retired
towards a Window, in far greater
di<U+017F>order than if <U+017F>he had been angry.
This made me more curious than ever
to hear what the Marque<U+017F>s would <U+017F>ay
to me. Yet he declared him<U+017F>elf no
further, but reaching forth his hand
towards me, he <U+017F>hewed me a Billet,
which I would not have received on
any other occa<U+017F>ion; but in this
Conjuncture I made no <U+017F>cruple of it,
believing I <U+017F>hould find in it the Secret
I longed for: Hereupon he withdrew
without <U+017F>aying a word. And the Lady
returning towards me; Well, Madam,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how comes it he is gone,
without naming to you the Per<U+017F>on
you have <U+017F>o much cau<U+017F>e to hate? I
mu<U+017F>t tell you, 'tis I, and that will <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
you. It really did <U+017F>o, the word
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken having a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd me,
I could <U+017F>carce make her an an<U+017F>wer:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103330:98"/>
You mu<U+017F>t know then, continued <U+017F>he,
that having told me he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
on the account of my Son to
change his thoughts of you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him<U+017F>elf to another Beauty; I
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him for your <U+017F>ake to tell me
who it was; and after a long refu<U+017F>al,
he had the in<U+017F>olence to tell me, 'twas
I. You may imagine how I u<U+017F>ed him
on <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion: However, I was
of Opinion, that a little more than
ordinary complai<U+017F>ance I had expre<U+017F>s'd
for him, had given him that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But finding him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of
his error, I was a little better pacified,
and let him <U+017F>ee he was mi<U+017F>taken on all
hands. That he <U+017F>hould not have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the de<U+017F>ign of <U+017F>erving you, being
unque<U+017F>tionably the be<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erving in
this Court of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and e<U+017F>teem of
a Per<U+017F>on of his Quality, and that he
was very ill advi<U+017F>ed to make addre<U+017F><U+017F>es
to me, who was neither for Gallant,
nor Gallantry. I was no <U+017F>tranger to
the Character of this Lady, and knew
very well what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the inclinations of her temper.
And having had lei<U+017F>ure while <U+017F>he
<U+017F>poke, to recover my <U+017F>elf from the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103330:99"/>
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>he had ca<U+017F>t me in at the
beginning of this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and to
ob<U+017F>erve the alteration of her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
I made no doubt of her perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s.
This, Madam, <U+017F>aid I very
<U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, was to engage further in my
concerns than I de<U+017F>erved, and in truth
than I de<U+017F>ired. You had formerly told
me, this young Gentleman would have
plea<U+017F>ed you, had you been as I; and
<U+017F>ince he preferred you before me, it
was too much for you to part with
him for my <U+017F>ake. I did, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, but
what I ought both for you and my
<U+017F>elf. This, Madam, replyed I, is a
piece of more than ordinary Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip;
and I que<U+017F>tion very much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
among the be<U+017F>t Friends of our
Sex, the plea<U+017F>ure of being beloved by
a Per<U+017F>on whom all the Ladies of the
Court own to be the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t and
be<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h'd in <hi>Naples,</hi> would not
prevail over their Friend<U+017F>hip, and make
it appear that one Woman <U+017F>eldom
<U+017F>cruples to be treacherous to another
in ca<U+017F>es of this Nature. But, Madam,
methinks what you now <U+017F>ay, is <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
contrary to what you formerly
told me of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Marque<U+017F>s
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103330:99"/>
then wholly for me. I thought <U+017F>o
then, I confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but I was
mi<U+017F>taken. And is it not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you
<U+017F>hould be now al<U+017F>o mi<U+017F>taken, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, for I have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to doubt
it. You do but deceive your <U+017F>elf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<U+017F>he. Well, Madam, <U+017F>aid I with
<U+017F>ome heat, let us try which of us is
deceived; peradventure it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this Billet I received from him.
Whereupon I fell to the opening of it.
The Lady much <U+017F>urpriz'd, asked me,
if it came from the Marque<U+017F>s. I told
her, it did; and that nothing but the
curio<U+017F>ity I had to clear this Affair,
could have prevail'd with me to take
it from him. Alas, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, what a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urance
can that give you of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of a man who changes them
every moment; and will, it may be,
tell you the <U+017F>ame he hath told me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
I was in <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te to open
the Letter, that I made her no an<U+017F>wer,
but fell to reading it, being to this

the Billet, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould have
the Confidence to ju<U+017F>tifie the mo<U+017F>t vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
incon<U+017F>tancy man was ever guilty
of, and to accu<U+017F>e others of it? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>aid I without any Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, 'tis
fit we <U+017F>hould hear him <U+017F>peak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf;
and if you plea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>tay, we will
<U+017F>end for him, and <U+017F>ee how he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t you. Alas, <U+017F>ays
<U+017F>he, what <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>tay for? I am not
otherwi<U+017F>e concerned than on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
You may now do as you plea<U+017F>e,
but if you will be advi<U+017F>ed by me, <U+017F>ee
him no more. That mu<U+017F>t not be,
Madam, replyed I, though it were
but to know who they are he <U+017F>peaks
of in the Billet; I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee him once
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103330:101"/>
more, and then I <U+017F>hall under<U+017F>tand
what mea<U+017F>ures to take. I had hardly
done <U+017F>peaking but the Marque<U+017F>s came
in. He thought without doubt the
Vice-Roy's Lady would not have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
me <U+017F>o long with her company
after he had been gone; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
he had to know how I took
what he wrote in the Billet, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to tell me what made me <U+017F>o
earne<U+017F>t to be informed of, made him
pre<U+017F>ently return. He was not a little
<U+017F>urprized to find us together. He was
ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>tepping back to be gone, but I
prayed him to come in. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's
Lady <U+017F>eeing him, and confounded
at the <U+017F>ight of him, or for fear I
would put him upon making the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
before her, as I had certainly
done in the condition things were in,
<U+017F>tood up, and taking him by the hand,
turning towards me: I have <U+017F>omething
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) to tell him; after which
you may <U+017F>atisfie your <U+017F>elf. This action
of hers moved more my pity than my
jealou<U+017F>ie. I know very well <U+017F>he was
not a Woman of the be<U+017F>t conduct in
the World, but I <U+017F>hould never have
imagined her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion could have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103330:101"/>
her <U+017F>o far as (after all <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid
to me) as to make her give in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence
<U+017F>uch an in<U+017F>tance of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
I let them go without <U+017F>aying a
word to one or other, but expected to
<U+017F>ee the Marque<U+017F>s again, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured
my <U+017F>elf of very plea<U+017F>ant diverti<U+017F>ement
by what he <U+017F>hould tell me of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
But he came not at all that day,
which anger'd me not a little. On
the morrow I perfectly recovered. My
malady was a pure effect of jealou<U+017F>ie
and vexation, and when I knew how
matters <U+017F>tood, I was <U+017F>oon cured of
both: Not but that I had rea<U+017F>on to
fear the <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> Lady. But the <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cour<U+017F>e I <U+017F>aw her take, and her piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conduct, <U+017F>ecured me from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ion
of any harm <U+017F>he could do
me: I was well enough to appear at
Court, but hearing there was a Ball
at night, I re<U+017F>olved to be <U+017F>ick one day
more, that I might <U+017F>teal at night in
<hi>Ma<U+017F>querade</hi> to the <hi>Ball,</hi> and there <U+017F>peak
with the Marque<U+017F>s. My de<U+017F>ign took
not, for he came not thither all the
while I <U+017F>tayed. But by rea<U+017F>on of my
going to and fro to <U+017F>eek him out, the
<hi>Vice-Roys</hi> Lady knew me, and being
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103330:102"/>
Alarm'd at my Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, followed me
to my Chamber, where I was amazed
to <U+017F>ee her, and could not believe it
was <U+017F>he. Well, and what News of
the Marque<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? I mu<U+017F>t know
that of you, Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, for
I have not <U+017F>een him <U+017F>ince ye<U+017F>terday,
when you denied me the plea<U+017F>ure to
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e him one moment in a bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
you and I were <U+017F>ufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to be <U+017F>atisfied in. I believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<U+017F>he, you are now to <U+017F>eek for <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
How can that be, reply'd
I, when I have not <U+017F>poken with him
never <U+017F>ince. It is reported however,
an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, you were this Evening
together in Ma<U+017F>querade. Tho<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid
I, who report it, are very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taken;
but I mu<U+017F>t beg your pardon,
Madam, if I tell you there is not any
one but you capable of <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>take.
I know what becomes me, and there
are but few who make a doubt of it:
Per<U+017F>ons of my Honour are <U+017F>eldom
guilty of <U+017F>uch faults. The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s
Lady having a de<U+017F>ire to vex and fall
out with me, never gave over till I
had told her part of my mind, and let
her under<U+017F>tand I was not to be fool'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103330:102"/>
by her. The truths I told her, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to that degree, that <U+017F>he broke
out into expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>o cruelly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive,
I could not forbear crying, and
unwilling <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have the plea<U+017F>ure
to <U+017F>ee the Tears run down my Cheeks,
I ro<U+017F>e up to retire into my Clo<U+017F>et.
What, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, I interrupt your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
in the Charms of your fine
Marque<U+017F>s, is not that the cau<U+017F>e of your
withdrawing? Or rather, continued
<U+017F>he, to provoke me yet more, are you
going to <U+017F>eek him in your Clo<U+017F>et where
you have hid him? That which you
<U+017F>ay, Madam, doth <U+017F>o little become
you, that nothing but extream mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
could have made you think <U+017F>o
unworthy of me; but I <U+017F>ee what pleads
your excu<U+017F>e. What, reply'd <U+017F>he, I hope
I have not great rea<U+017F>on to tru<U+017F>t her that
will not tru<U+017F>t me. And the right I
have to over-<U+017F>ee and regulate your
Conduct gives me the priviledge to
vi<U+017F>it any place I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect. With that
<U+017F>he took up a Flambeau that lay lighted
on my Table, and went up towards
my Clo<U+017F>et: I looked upon her with
that <U+017F>light and indifference as wholly
unconcern'd at her action, which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103330:103"/>
angred her more than any thing I
could have <U+017F>aid to her. I do not yet
know what was her de<U+017F>ign; for <U+017F>he
knew me too well to have the lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of what <U+017F>he charged me
with, but it <U+017F>eems <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olv'd to
try me to the utmo<U+017F>t, and be reveng'd
of me that way. In the mean time,
by very ill Fortune for me, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>s
was in the Clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>he was
the fir<U+017F>t that di<U+017F>covered him; <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hrieked out with the <U+017F>urprize of it,
which made me turn about that way,
and put me into <U+017F>uch a fright, that
together with the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
gave me, ca<U+017F>t me into a <U+017F>ound,
and made me fall as dead upon the
Bed near which I then <U+017F>tood. The
Marque<U+017F>s <U+017F>eized with true or feigned
grief for his being the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
an accident, begged my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
on his knees with tears in his Eyes.
What the Lady <U+017F>aid to this I know
not, but one of my Chamber-Maids,
who came to help me, told me <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw her go out <U+017F>o angry, that fire
<U+017F>eemed to <U+017F>parkle out of her Eyes.
When I was come to my <U+017F>elf, I <U+017F>aw
her not, but the Marque<U+017F>s kneeling
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103330:103"/>
before me with a countenance <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad
and <U+017F>o dejected, it melted me into
pity, and ea<U+017F>ed me of more than half
of my anger. What have you done,
Sir, <U+017F>aid I? you have utterly ruined
me. Go and <U+017F>ee me no more but at
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hours, and when every body
might <U+017F>ee me; after which, though I
was very well plea<U+017F>ed with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I pray'd him to withdraw, to
prevent further occa<U+017F>ion of Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, dear <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> I <U+017F>pend

in entertaining you with <U+017F>uch
trifles. But this having been the be<U+017F>t
of my time in that Court, and be<U+017F>t
part of my <U+017F>tory, you will excu<U+017F>e the

the relation of Accidents <U+017F>o <U+017F>hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

is more terrible than Death. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
having an<U+017F>wered, that all <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid
was very material; and that he thought

Circum<U+017F>tances of her Life, as well

The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady having fallen
out with me, and finding rea<U+017F>on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of difference with the Marque<U+017F>s,
who in <U+017F>pight of her vi<U+017F>ited me often,
you may believe <U+017F>he pa<U+017F>t her time very
melancholy and <U+017F>ad. The fir<U+017F>t time
the Marque<U+017F>s came to <U+017F>ee me, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted,
that if he de<U+017F>igned to plea<U+017F>e me,
he <U+017F>hould begin to do it by telling me
in particular all the kindne<U+017F>s and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>es
pa<U+017F>t between the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady
and him. But he intreated me with
<U+017F>o much Ingenuity not to make u<U+017F>e of
the power I had over him, to oblige
him to a thing <U+017F>o mean, that his Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
prevailed over my Curio<U+017F>ity,
and made me e<U+017F>teem him the better
for it: however he let me know 'twas
of her he <U+017F>poke in the Billet, as I had
ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s'd. The di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Lady,
who could not but be concern'd for
us, was willing to <U+017F>eek Peace, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found a fair pretence for it, <U+017F>ent
me word by one of her Women, that
I might do her a plea<U+017F>ure if I would
give her a Vi<U+017F>it, which I fail'd not to
do. She received me chearfully, and
with <U+017F>miles in her Countenance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of Di<U+017F><U+017F>embling, after <U+017F>ome Civilities
<U+017F>hewed me, <U+017F>he brought me to the
Clo<U+017F>et, where beginning her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with a very great <U+017F>igh, Well, my dear

very precious and dear to me.
'Tis enough, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; come, tell me

Marriage between the Marque<U+017F>s and

Character of the Letter, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

as to plea<U+017F>e my Affection; I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hed
with Joy, but let it appear as
little as I could, mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
e<U+017F>pecially being in the hands of
a Per<U+017F>on who would dearly repent it,
before it could be effected. I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with the mo<U+017F>t acknowledging
and affectionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions I could
invent; and there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>o many
Care<U+017F><U+017F>es on the one <U+017F>ide and on the
other, that you would have thought
we had never been <U+017F>o great Friends
before. At my return I found the
Marque<U+017F>s in my Chamber, where
he waited to bring me this plea<U+017F>ing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103330:105"/>
News, with a Countenance full of
Joy; and that the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> had given
him free liberty to vi<U+017F>it me. I told
him I had heard all this from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
he could not ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s, and in
truth it was hardly credible it <U+017F>hould
be the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady. I told him it
was <U+017F>he, and related all our Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>The Liberty granted the Marque<U+017F>s
to vi<U+017F>it me when he plea<U+017F>ed, having
heightned the affection we had one for
another, degenerated by degrees into
a kind and tender familiarity. He took
a little more upon him than had been
allowed him, and more indeed than
I ought to have permitted him. But
'tis hard for one in Love, <U+017F>o deeply as
I was, to be proof again<U+017F>t the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of a Man <U+017F>he expects to
be her Husband on the Morrow. At
fir<U+017F>t I made re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance enough, and
would not <U+017F>o much as give him my
hand to ki<U+017F>s; but Love blinds <U+017F>o, that
he doth in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly lead us away, and
accu<U+017F>tom us to things we never dur<U+017F>t
think of. After the fir<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h, the re<U+017F>t
follows of cour<U+017F>e. We expected with
equal impatience my Fathers an<U+017F>wer.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103330:106"/>
We were already mutually engaged,
<U+017F>o that if his an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>hould not have
proved favourable, we were re<U+017F>olved
to compleat our happine<U+017F>s: Such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
given to <U+017F>ave a Maids Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
are but <U+017F>nares Love lays for her
Virtue. The Marque<U+017F>s, as all true
Lovers, being impatiently earne<U+017F>t for
the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of my Per<U+017F>on as well as
Affection, whereof he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ured,
and fearing cro<U+017F>s Accidents that might
hinder our Bli<U+017F>s, let me know, among<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ome little favours I allowed him to
take, that he was very de<U+017F>irous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of my gift what I had forbid him
to hope without my Fathers con<U+017F>ent;
and that if I loved him, I would make
it appear in obliging him in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
I made as if I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
him, but by degrees he
<U+017F>poke <U+017F>o intelligibly, that I was under
the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of being very angry
with him, or of defending my <U+017F>elf with
Arguments: Finding it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
be angry with a Man I loved, I fell
to Di<U+017F>puting, but he was too hard for
me. And certainly, in matters of
Love, a Maid that comes to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oning,
is in danger of being lo<U+017F>t.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103330:106"/>
However our combat la<U+017F>ted long
enough, to make me fancy I had <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my humour; but at la<U+017F>t I mu<U+017F>t
yield. I thought there needed not <U+017F>o
much caution, with a per<U+017F>on who had
given the <hi>Viceroy</hi> his word that he
would marry me, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me (as
I believed) by a thou<U+017F>and Oaths, that
he would make me his Wife. He was
to come to me in my Chamber at
night, an hour after all <U+017F>hould be in
bed; and becau<U+017F>e my Chamber was
near that of the <hi>Viceroys</hi> Ladies, where
I had liberty of entrance at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,
I told him I would leave the
door open, and pray'd him not to
make a noi<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>peak a word, le<U+017F>t
the Lady <U+017F>hould hear us. You <U+017F>ee
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> I conceal nothing from you;
though I might alledge many rea<U+017F>ons
in excu<U+017F>e of my fault. I cannot tell
you all this without blu<U+017F>hing; for I
mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s had I been more wi<U+017F>e, or
more prudent, I could not have been
<U+017F>o unfortunate as I am. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>
was gone that day out of Town; all
things <U+017F>eemed to favour us, but it was
for my ruin. The hour was come,
and I heard a man entring <U+017F>oftly into
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103330:107"/>
my Chamber, for there was no light
to <U+017F>ee him by, and I ea<U+017F>ily believed it
was my dear Servant. I received him
with the kindne<U+017F>s of a Woman in
Love, and made no doubt but it was
he; for he had the <U+017F>ame imbroider'd
Wa<U+017F>tcoat, which he had cau<U+017F>ed to be
made again<U+017F>t our Wedding, being one
of the riche<U+017F>t ever <U+017F>een in the Court.
Part of the night we pa<U+017F>s'd in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<U+017F>ilence, till at la<U+017F>t he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>leep.
As for me, I found my <U+017F>elf a
little indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, and wanting a light
to find <U+017F>omething to take, I ventured
to go into the Ladies Chamber, which
commonly had a watch-light burning
all night. Having opened the door
from my Chamber to hers, I was not
a little <U+017F>urprized, when approaching
the watch-light, and ca<U+017F>ting my eyes
towards her to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>he were a<U+017F>leep,
the Curtains being all open becau<U+017F>e
of the hot weather, I <U+017F>aw a man in
his cloaths lying by her. I doubted
very much whether it were be<U+017F>t to go
back whence I came, or take away
the watch-light; but the need I had
of this prevail'd with me to go on, and
light the candle I had in my hand:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103330:107"/>
and having <U+017F>een <U+017F>o much, I was
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with a Spirit of curio<U+017F>ity to
know who that fortunate Gallant
might be; I perceived him in the
habit of Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Hippolito.</hi> I was
<U+017F>urpriz'd at the adventure, and had
I not been fully per<U+017F>waded I had
newly left him in my Chamber, I
do not know what extravagances
I might have run into. However
this Circum<U+017F>tance inflamed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
of knowing who it was. I
perceived he was of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the Marque<U+017F>s, and had
the <U+017F>ame hair; the Ladies arm was
over his face, <U+017F>o that I could not
<U+017F>ee it. I was at the beds feet, and
could not be mi<U+017F>taken; I trembled
all over, as an Omen of my mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
Heavens! <U+017F>aid I within
my <U+017F>elf, am I awake or a<U+017F>leep? is
not that the Marque<U+017F>s? could he
quit me this night to come to this
Lady? perhaps they held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pondence
together, and <U+017F>he knew
he was to pa<U+017F>s this night with
me. All the<U+017F>e Reflections were
made in a moment, and the next
moment after that, I came into
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103330:108"/>
my own Chamber, to find out the
truth. But how was I a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed
to find the Marque<U+017F>s there too?
Oh Heavens! cry'd I, which of
the two is the counterfeit? And
drawing near him in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I perceiv'd by the colour of
his Hair, how unhappily I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and that it was <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon<U+017F>o</hi>
was there. What a Fury,
what Rage did this put me in? I
<U+017F>eiz'd the Ponyard he had laid on
my Table, and not knowing with
which of the three to begin, being
all equally perfidious, I thought
the Marque<U+017F>s as mo<U+017F>t criminal, was
fir<U+017F>t to be <U+017F>acrificed to my ju<U+017F>t
revenge, for fear of an E<U+017F>cape. So
that I went into the other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but the noi<U+017F>e that I made,
having awaked <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o,</hi> he
was amazed to <U+017F>ee a Light, and
perceiving me enter his Mothers
Chamber, he got up in a trice,
and frightned at the <U+017F>ight of the
Ponyard in my Hand, he ran after
me, and laid hold on me by the
Arm, ju<U+017F>t as I was going to <U+017F>tab
that Traytor the Marque<U+017F>s: but he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103330:108"/>
was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee
me lifting up my hand to kill the
Marque<U+017F>s, lying by his Mothers
<U+017F>ide. He was enraged at the <U+017F>ight,
and to wa<U+017F>h away the <U+017F>tain of his
Family with the bloud of the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
was ready to execute that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
he had hindred me to take;
but I <U+017F>taid him, and throwing my
<U+017F>elf upon him, Traitor, <U+017F>aid I, this
blow was not re<U+017F>erved for thee,
thou <U+017F>halt not have the plea<U+017F>ure
of being fir<U+017F>t reveng'd. At the<U+017F>e
words, and the bu<U+017F>tle that we
made, the Marque<U+017F>s and the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>'s
Lady awaking, were at their
wits end, not knowing what re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to take. The Marque<U+017F>s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Ponyard <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o</hi>
had in his Hand, threatned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
him, made u<U+017F>e of the time I
held him, to lay hold of his own,
and <U+017F>tand on his Guard. I left
them in this furious Di<U+017F>order, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
they would <U+017F>ufficiently revenge
one on another, for their Trea<U+017F>on
again<U+017F>t me; and re-entring my
Chamber, I <U+017F>hut the door on that
<U+017F>ide, and having taken with me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103330:109"/>
all that was con<U+017F>iderable in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Jewels, I went out at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
door, and ran through the
Streets like a mad Woman, to <U+017F>eek
a Felucca in the Port, to carry me
to any place my de<U+017F>pair would
lead me. I was <U+017F>o unhappy as not
to find one ready, and had not the
patience to <U+017F>tay, for fear of being
pur<U+017F>ued, and forced back to that
Court, where I had rather die than
appear. At la<U+017F>t with much ado I
found a Barque bound for <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona;</hi>
provided they went far enough
from <hi>Italy,</hi> and that my Name
and my Birth were concealed, I
cared not whither they carried me;
<U+017F>o that I went on board, without
taking a moment to con<U+017F>ider. 'Tis
not a <U+017F>ingle Accident makes us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
the greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters have
commonly a large train of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
Thus far my <U+017F>oul enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not a thought, but what the
tran<U+017F>ports of de<U+017F>pair and re<U+017F>entment
had <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted. But when I <U+017F>aw
my <U+017F>elf at Sea, and in no other
Company than that of five or <U+017F>ix
poor Mariners, who knew not what
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103330:109"/>
to think of me, my heart was <U+017F>o
full, that nothing could ea<U+017F>e it but
a torrent of tears. I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with a Relation of the <U+017F>ad
thoughts I had for two or three
days that I had the opportunity of
a <U+017F>olitary entertainment; but on the
fourth I found my <U+017F>elf plunged into
new afflictions. About Sun-ri<U+017F>ing the
Sea-men put up <U+017F>uch a lamentable cry,
it almo<U+017F>t broke my heart: I thought
we had been Shipwrack'd, and asked
what the matter was, more out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>ity
than any fear of death, being
the thing I heartily wi<U+017F>h'd for. I
found the Gallies of <hi>Bi<U+017F>erti</hi> had us in
Cha<U+017F>e, and took us an hour after: I
received this di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter with <U+017F>uch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of <U+017F>pirit, as really a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht all
the Spectators. All my fear was for
my per<U+017F>on, having fallen into the
hands of men who are the mo<U+017F>t bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and inhumane on earth, and
have no re<U+017F>pect for our Sex. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether it was my particular
good fortune, or that they had <U+017F>ome
regard for a Woman which appeared
of more than ordinary Quality, I may
truly <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine<U+017F>s
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103330:110"/>
and rudene<U+017F>s of their fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
in forcing open the door of
my Cabbin with their feet; I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
u<U+017F>ed than the re<U+017F>t, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
than I expected. As <U+017F>oon as
the Souldiers <U+017F>aw me, not one of them
entred; only the Captain of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
took that liberty, and very civilly
asked me in <hi>Italian</hi> who I was, and
for what place I was bound. I hid
from him both my Name and my
Quality, telling him, I was called
<hi>Laura,</hi> and went for <hi>Barcellona</hi> to my
Father, then in the <U+017F>ervice of the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Then I put into his
hand a little Box, in which were my
Money and my Jewels; and the more
to oblige him, I told him I made him
a Pre<U+017F>ent worth above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Crowns (as in truth it was) and
that I might have thrown it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
as mo<U+017F>t of the Sea-men had
done their Cloaths and their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.
The acknowledgment I de<U+017F>ired
of him, was that I might be civilly
u<U+017F>ed; which he promi<U+017F>ed me, and the
<U+017F>ame time told me, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Box, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring me of a
<U+017F>hare at our arrival at <hi>Tunis.</hi> I was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103330:110"/>
ravi<U+017F>hed at this Conjuncture, not <U+017F>o
much for the hopes he gave me of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toring
part of my Jewels, but becau<U+017F>e
this <U+017F>ecret rendred me u<U+017F>eful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to the Captain, and obliged
him to a greater care of me. And the
truth is, I had no rea<U+017F>on to complain;
he cau<U+017F>ed me to be pre<U+017F>ently carried
aboard his Galley, and gave me his
own Cabbin, and never came into it
till we arrived at <hi>Bi<U+017F>erti.</hi> Our Voyage
was not long; we had a great Calm,
and having in three days gain'd the
Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> we got <U+017F>afe on the
fourth into the Port of <hi>Bi<U+017F>erti;</hi> where
being landed, I was put into a kind of
Litter carried by a Camel, and <U+017F>o
carried to <hi>Tunis,</hi> under a Guard of five
or <U+017F>ix Hor<U+017F>e-men. I fell to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s
<U+017F>hare, who joyful of it, made a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
of me to his Lady.</p>
               <p>Thus you have, dear <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of a Maid born of an illu<U+017F>trious
Family, and to a plentiful E<U+017F>tate, as
you very well know. The <hi>Turk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfectly acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of her Family, could not <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
admire the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of her
fate, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her of his be<U+017F>t endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103330:111"/>
to make her more happy for the
future, and to gain her liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her Countrey, which <U+017F>he had
no cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>cruple; That the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at <hi>Naples</hi> was a di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
by her Marriage with the Son
of the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> who doubtle<U+017F>s would
be glad of it: That if it <U+017F>hould fall out
otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he had many excellencies
and advantages to comfort her again<U+017F>t
all the di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters of her life: That her
misfortune in the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Court
could not be laid to her fault, but the
infamous Trea<U+017F>on of a man, who <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later was <U+017F>ure to be puni<U+017F>hed for
his Crime. In a word, after long di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
to this purpo<U+017F>e, he renewed
prote<U+017F>tations of his readine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve
her, and to leave no <U+017F>tone unturned
to free her from her mi<U+017F>ery: That he
had many good Friends about the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and was very well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he could
not take any <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter re<U+017F>olution again<U+017F>t
her, but he mu<U+017F>t have notice of it
time enough to prevent, or e<U+017F>cape it.
<hi>Laura</hi> was not wanting to her duty of
gratitude, for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ignal te<U+017F>timonies
of Affection to her Family and her;
and could not <U+017F>ufficiently thank Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

that in the mid<U+017F>t of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<U+017F>he had met a Man <U+017F>o devoted
to her Service, and of unque<U+017F>tionable
fidelity.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> left her a little comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

expre<U+017F>s'd his wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment.
He thought it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary

(you may call it) folly to run <U+017F>uch

to ea<U+017F>e you of the fear of being charg'd

is gone away with the Chri<U+017F>tian, and
that <hi>Laura</hi> is at home with the <hi>Dey,</hi>
are the things that prevail with me,
nothing but a <U+017F>ight of her, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me 'tis true; the more I think

would be <U+017F>atisfied at lea<U+017F>t how the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
was carried, and there is no

were the rea<U+017F>ons I have told you,
not <U+017F>ufficient to make you approve of the

               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, held
his peace, in expectation of <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>'s

<hi>God pre<U+017F>erve you Sir from the

How impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible it was to effect <U+017F>ome
of the things he de<U+017F>ired; that he could
not enter the Ca<U+017F>tle without being

Chri<U+017F>tian Girl his Slave, he hazarded
the ruin of him<U+017F>elf, his friend, and
his party, that a little patience would
make him ma<U+017F>ter of his de<U+017F>igns
without pains or danger. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi>
in<U+017F>tead of being per<U+017F>waded by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madan</hi>'s

after the re<U+017F>olution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
His pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion tempted him to
try his fortune, and deprived him
of patience as incompatible with
love.</p>
               <p>The night being pretty well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf the be<U+017F>t
he could; and having given <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
<U+017F>uch orders as were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary,
that his ab<U+017F>ence might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he went away with the <hi>Moor,</hi>
who led him a way he came the
night before: they entred the Town
without meeting any, but being heard
by <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e, they fell among
a company of People belonging to
the <hi>Divan,</hi> the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s <U+017F>worn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
But by good fortune he
pa<U+017F>s'd undi<U+017F>covered, for which he
was obliged to the <hi>Moor,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103330:114"/>
a witty fellow, told tho<U+017F>e who
would have <U+017F>taid them, that he was
one <U+017F>ick of the Plague, whom he
had in charge to carry to the Pe<U+017F>t-hou<U+017F>e.
This made them <U+017F>tand at a
di<U+017F>tance, and give them free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age;
though that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be not <U+017F>o dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
there as in other places, being
very common and ordinary in tho<U+017F>e
parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was glad of <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie an
e<U+017F>cape; and when he got to <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s,
he rewarded the <hi>Moor</hi> according to
the merit of <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>en <hi>was abroad at the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a<hi>'s
arrival, but was extreamly <U+017F>urprized
at his return to <U+017F>ee the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>there.</hi>
Ah! Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid he, embracing him,</hi> is
it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you would hazard your <U+017F>elf
thus? it might have been excu<U+017F>able
in a hare-brain'd young fellow, who
had nothing to lo<U+017F>e but his life, but
for a man of your prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
(being the <U+017F>econd Per<U+017F>on of the
Kingdom) to come, without de<U+017F>ign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
at lea<U+017F>t without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to
throw your <U+017F>elf into your Enemies

dangers. This Sir, how ill <U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you take it, is a thing I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardon you: For Sir, <hi>adds he,</hi> what
could have oblig'd you to hazard your <U+017F>elf
thus?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> fell a laughing, and
taking all in good part that was
<U+017F>poken by <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who<U+017F>e kindne<U+017F>s
he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of, asked him if
he had ever been in love, and
whether he knew not that love had
made the greate<U+017F>t of men guilty
of faults, and that tho<U+017F>e faults had
always their pardon: <hi>But Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en, what have you to do with love?
is it not</hi> Laura <hi>you are in love with?
and is not <U+017F>he in the Ca<U+017F>tle? Yes,</hi>
replies the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a, but being in your
cu<U+017F>tody, it cannot be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
have a <U+017F>ight of her. A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> would
have di<U+017F><U+017F>uaded him from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign,
as the mo<U+017F>t extravagant and
ra<U+017F>h he had ever enterprized;
but prevailed no more than the
ma<U+017F>ter of the Gallies. Strength of
rea<U+017F>on and fear of dangers are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tacles
too weak to <U+017F>top the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s
of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lover. Love feeds
upon hope, and death is not half
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103330:115"/>
<U+017F>o formidable as the happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is charming and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> re<U+017F>olved, whatever
befell him, to go into the Ca<U+017F>tle. But
it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to do it by Night,
the Gates being then open only for
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> and others the <hi>Dey</hi>'s principal
Officers. So that it mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity
be between Nine in the Morning and
Six at Night; and the <U+017F>trict Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they u<U+017F>ed in that time would have
cool'd any Man but the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> from
proceeding in <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate a de<U+017F>ign.
But tho<U+017F>e <hi>Southern</hi> Lovers are too hot
to be cold by Ob<U+017F>tructions that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
invincible to others. A<U+017F><U+017F>en <hi>told
him, he had no better way than to put
him into one of the Meal-<U+017F>acks he had
order to <U+017F>end into the Ca<U+017F>tle on the morrow
in a Cart.</hi> The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was content,
and thought it an excellent invention;
and that there could be no danger in
it at all. Having re<U+017F>olved on this,
they pa<U+017F>t part of the Night in Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of the pre<U+017F>ent po<U+017F>ture of Affairs,
what pa<U+017F>t at the <hi>Divan,</hi> what de<U+017F>igns
the <hi>Dey</hi> had, what Forces were rai<U+017F>ed,
and <U+017F>uch other particulars as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
for the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> to know. After
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103330:116"/>
this, they went to Bed, where <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
took his re<U+017F>t; but as for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he
had no mind to <U+017F>leep, he dreamt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeing the
fair <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow.</p>
               <p>At length the day appear'd, and the
Cart was loaded with Meal-<U+017F>acks for
the Ca<U+017F>tle, and among them the Bag
with the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> in't, was <U+017F>o plac'd, that
he lay pretty conveniently. The <hi>Moor</hi>
led the Hor<U+017F>es, and <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> walked at
<U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance before; the Ca<U+017F>tle-gate
was opened<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and no <U+017F>earch made in
the Cart, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Secretary was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onally
Convoy to. They pa<U+017F>t freely
to the Magazin of Victuals, where
<U+017F>everal <hi>Moors</hi> in<U+017F>tantly attended to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load;
but <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> very dextrou<U+017F>ly got
rid of them, <U+017F>ending them away on
<U+017F>everal Errands. This was well for
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who having been almo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>tifled in the Bag, had untyed it, to
take a little breath, and had certainly
been di<U+017F>covered, had tho<U+017F>e <hi>Moors</hi> <U+017F>taid
in the Magazin. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> left him there
all that day, not thinking it fit to
bring him to <hi>Laura</hi> till Night; <U+017F>o
that he locked him up there, took
the Key in his Pocket, and went
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103330:116"/>
to the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Palace to learn what
News.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> being all day alone,
thought it very long, and with great
impatience wi<U+017F>h'd for the Night, that
<U+017F>he might have a <U+017F>ight of her dear
Friend <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en.</hi> At length the hour
came he u<U+017F>ually vi<U+017F>ited her, but no
news of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> which troubled her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he heard the Door
open, and ri<U+017F>ing to meet him, <hi>Did you
but know,</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>en, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi>the Sufferings I
lye under in the condition I am in, having
no Friend but you, you would not have
made me pine <U+017F>o long for a <U+017F>ight of you;
for in good truth, I am half dead with
<U+017F>taying for you. A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> fell a laughing,
and turning about to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who
followed him, here is one, <hi><U+017F>ays he,</hi> knows
how to bring you to Life again, and
I doubt not but for his <U+017F>ake you will
pardon my long <U+017F>tay. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> had not
told the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> of the Ancient intimate
Acquaintance he had with <hi>Laura;</hi> this
made him interrupt her <U+017F>o quickly,
to make her take notice of him. But
he was <U+017F>o white all over with lying in
the Meal-<U+017F>ack, that <U+017F>he took him for
one of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s Men; but <U+017F>eeing him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103330:117"/>
laugh, <U+017F>he viewed him more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knew him, <hi>Oh Heavens! is it
you, Sir?</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he. <hi>Oh! whither are
you come in <U+017F>earch of an unfortunate
wretch, which hath already given you
<U+017F>o much trouble, and too great cau<U+017F>e of

to pardon tho<U+017F>e we love. But is it
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you are here, and that the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> is gone away in your <U+017F>tead?
tell me, was it <U+017F>he that betray'd you,
or was it <hi>Alexander?</hi> I know not what
to think of it; but when I con<U+017F>ider his
proceedings in this la<U+017F>t adventure, I
cannot <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect him treacherous. For
'twas not his fault I di<U+017F>covered not the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> it was I hindred him to take
off her <hi>Barnus,</hi> that I might <U+017F>ee her,
However, if <U+017F>he loved you, I am <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Reveng'd of you, for you
have lo<U+017F>t more than I, and if he was
fal<U+017F>e to you, you may comfort your

of a Per<U+017F>on not <U+017F>o unworthy of your

put <hi>Laura</hi> to the blu<U+017F>h; but making
no an<U+017F>wer to them, <hi>As for me, Sir,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>I neither lo<U+017F>t a Lover in him,

me much, replies the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and
make me conclude you an excellent

Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays Laura, <hi>what I told you <U+017F>o often,
that my affection for</hi> Alexander <hi>was very
indifferent; and to be taken off when I
plea<U+017F>ed. The Ladies of your Country dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
very much from tho<U+017F>e of Chri<U+017F>tendom

equally uncon<U+017F>tant. Ours are more <U+017F>hie
of engaging in Love, but when engaged,
their love is more la<U+017F>ting. You believed
me a</hi> Turk, <hi>and <U+017F>everal times did me
Honours, due only to the</hi> Sultane<U+017F>s, <hi>whom
you often mi<U+017F>took for me.</hi> The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
replies the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> much <U+017F>urpriz'd at the

<hi>for 'tis now time to di<U+017F>abu<U+017F>e you; and <U+017F>ince
I may ju<U+017F>tly glory to have made of my
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for</hi> Alexander <hi>a Sacrifice to her
Love, I may now be allowed to declare it,
when <U+017F>he is out of all danger of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
by my owning it.</hi> The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi>
Sir, continued <U+017F>he, more affected than
I with the good qualities of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103330:118"/>
looked upon him as worthy of
her Love. But permit me to <U+017F>ay, you
may thank your <U+017F>elf for it, who fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ought out the means to gain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of finding a Gallant for your
Lady. You may believe, replies the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> I de<U+017F>ign'd no <U+017F>uch matter, yet
I pardon it in a Woman I had no
kindne<U+017F>s for. But the fal<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of the
Chri<U+017F>tian was unpardonably ba<U+017F>e, who
be<U+017F>ides the regard he <U+017F>hould have had
for the daily favours I did him, ought
to have ob<U+017F>erved at lea<U+017F>t the Laws of
Ho<U+017F>pitality. The <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> Sir, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Laura,</hi> had a Beauty of power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the mo<U+017F>t upright of Men; and
had <U+017F>he been anothers Wife, I dur<U+017F>t
not have undertaken for your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
in the ca<U+017F>e. I had a de<U+017F>ire to
<U+017F>ee the Chri<U+017F>tian; you brought him
into the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> <U+017F>he had a <U+017F>ight of
him: He was hand<U+017F>om, <U+017F>he loved
him, and told him <U+017F>o; what could he
do? The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> could not forbear
laughing at her relating the <U+017F>tory.
And 'tis all the concern the <hi>Turks</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
for the fal<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of their Wives,
e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e they have no love for,
having <hi>Seraglio's</hi> well <U+017F>tor'd, and the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103330:118"/>
priviledge to change Wives at plea<U+017F>ure.
The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> very patiently took the lo<U+017F>s
of his <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and told <hi>Laura</hi> it
mu<U+017F>t be her fault if he <U+017F>hould not be
now more happy than ever. The <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Slave, very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible how u<U+017F>eful he
might be to her in the pre<U+017F>ent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
thought it un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to
give him a repul<U+017F>e, but re<U+017F>olv'd to
manage to advantage <U+017F>o good an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<U+017F>he told him only, that was not
a time to make Love. <hi>You <U+017F>ee, Sir,</hi>
continues <U+017F>he, <hi>I am here in a Pri<U+017F>on, I
know not how to get out of.</hi> But I know
how to do it, replies the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily;
and if within three days you be
not at Liberty, I'le fill the Streets of
this Town with the Bodies of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
<hi>Ah Sir! an<U+017F>wers</hi> Laura,
<hi>that were the way not to <U+017F>ave me, but to
ha<U+017F>ten my Death. And it beeing known
I am the cau<U+017F>e of this Di<U+017F>order, you may
ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s what Mercy I <U+017F>hall find. If
you have, Sir, any value for my Life,
<U+017F>ince it may be <U+017F>aved without <U+017F>hedding
Blood, and that matters are now in a
way of accomodation, let me intreat you
not to think of tho<U+017F>e horrible extremities.</hi>
Believe me, <U+017F>ays the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> 'tis their
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103330:119"/>
de<U+017F>ign to amu<U+017F>e me, till the Troops
they expect from <hi>Tripoly</hi> be arriv'd;
but I <U+017F>hall take Order for that, and
if you will prevent inconveniences
that may happen, you mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve to
get out hence this Evening, and go
along with me. <hi>Get out hence, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi>
Laura, <hi>and how <U+017F>hall it be done, out
of a Ca<U+017F>tle where I am under Guard, and
have <U+017F>o many Gates to pa<U+017F>s?</hi> You <U+017F>ee,
<U+017F>ays the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> <U+017F>pight of all tho<U+017F>e Guards,
and tho<U+017F>e Gates, I have entred, and
re<U+017F>olve to get out again; and may not
you <U+017F>o too? <hi>But, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays Laura, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
I am a Woman, and however di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ed,
may be ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered by my
gate, or my <U+017F>tature; and the lea<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>tacle
we meet with, will put me into <U+017F>uch a
fright, will infallibly ruin both you and
me.</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>en fortified her Rea<U+017F>ons with
his, and ab<U+017F>olutely condemned the
Enterprize propo<U+017F>ed, as expo<U+017F>ing the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> and her to apparent danger of
inevitable ruin. You <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, <hi>Sir,</hi>
adds he, by the difficulty you and I
<U+017F>hall find to get out, the trouble we
<U+017F>hould have to get a Woman along
with us. I am of Opinion with the
re<U+017F>t of your Friends, 'tis be<U+017F>t to come
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103330:119"/>
to an accommodation. The Troops
from <hi>Tripoly</hi> will be long a coming,
and if you keep the Town <U+017F>treightly
block'd up a few days longer, you will
oblige the People to Petition the <hi>Dey</hi>
to make Peace, which we of your
Party will not fail to help forward:
And the <hi>Dey</hi> being of a timerous irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olute
temper, will be glad of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to come to an Agreement.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> though more inclin'd to
violent than moderate actions, yielded
this time to the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
who were the deare<U+017F>t to him of
any, and who<U+017F>e intere<U+017F>t he knew it
was not give him any Coun<U+017F>el to
his di<U+017F>advantage. He told them he
would <U+017F>tay a Week longer, but if in
that time neither the Threats nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of his Friends <U+017F>hould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
he would make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to reduce the Town; and if
that failed, he would employ all his
Force to bring the <hi>Dey</hi> to Rea<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> was ea<U+017F>ily induced to a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to
all this, knowing the Town was ill
provided of Corn, and that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
began already to be <U+017F>treight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and murmured at the exigences
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103330:120"/>
they were reduc'd to, and not without
cau<U+017F>e, although it was given out the<U+017F>e
murmurs were rai<U+017F>ed by tho<U+017F>e of the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Party, in favour of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>hifting his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e from
the general affairs to his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
de<U+017F>ired <hi>Laura</hi> to give him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Amour
with the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> which <hi>Laura</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the mo<U+017F>t civil expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>he
could, not forgetting the Adventure
in the Chamber of Repo<U+017F>e, where
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had mi<U+017F>taken his Lady for
her: the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> could hardly believe
this, and was more vext at it, than all
the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>tory. Then <U+017F>he told
him the de<U+017F>ign the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> and <U+017F>he
had to go both aboard, and why the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
had put her <U+017F>elf into the Basket
without acquainting <hi>Alexander</hi> with
her intentions. I do verily believe it,
<U+017F>aid the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> for I was in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when the Basket was brought in,
and feign'd it was you; and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>hould do you the
lea<U+017F>t violence. I gave Order my <U+017F>elf
to have it carried aboard, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Alexander</hi> went along with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103330:120"/>
it to the Port. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> and <hi>Laura</hi> could
not forbear laughing. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> told
them he was as ready to laugh at it as
they, but that <hi>Laura</hi> made one of the
party, and had a hand in putting the
trick on him. For as for his Wife,
the hatred he bore her Father, and the
<U+017F>mall kindne<U+017F>s he had for her, were
<U+017F>ufficient a<U+017F><U+017F>urances he was not <U+017F>orry
to be rid of her. But he expected <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from <hi>Laura</hi> for the ill Offices
<U+017F>he had done him; none being more
guilty than <U+017F>he of the Trea<U+017F>on of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s.</hi> Raillery made up the re<U+017F>t
of the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and the Night being
far gone, <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> not affected as the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> with the Charms of <hi>Laura,</hi> told
him it was time to withdraw. The
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> intreated him to <U+017F>tay a little
longer, and <U+017F>aid, while Night la<U+017F>ted,
he thought there was no danger; and
that he had not taken <U+017F>o much pains
to enjoy that lovely Girl only for a
moment. At la<U+017F>t, <hi>Laura</hi> acquainted
him with the fear <U+017F>he was in, having
been <U+017F>o long together, which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the danger; giving the Guards
cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect <U+017F>o long an interview,
and to <U+017F>top his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age if he <U+017F>taid
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103330:121"/>
much longer. The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> to <U+017F>atisfie
her, retired, making new prote<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lover, who
would rather peri<U+017F>h a thou<U+017F>and times,
than not <U+017F>ee her delivered from the
hands of her Enemies by an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace, or a bloody War.</p>
               <p>A new invention mu<U+017F>t be thought
of for the getting out of the Ca<U+017F>tle,
where the Examination was as <U+017F>trict
almo<U+017F>t at going out as at entrance.
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> led the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> back again to the
Magazin, and having daubed his
Face <U+017F>ufficiently with Meal, laid a
parcel of empty Sacks on his <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
without any di<U+017F>turbance, pa<U+017F>t
all the Guards with him, as a Servant
of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s. It was not yet day; and
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> thought it fit to make u<U+017F>e of
his time, to return before Morning to
the Camp, where he thought his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence
very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> bore him
company to the Walls of the Town,
and having help'd him over, took his
leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> longed extreamly to hear
what was become of him, and could
not re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en. Cheer you,
Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, as he entred her
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103330:121"/>
Chamber. <hi>The</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a <hi>is out of danger,
and all will be well. Alas! dear A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi>
an<U+017F>wers <U+017F>he, <hi>peradventure things may
go well, but not for me.</hi> You will be
certainly <U+017F>et at Liberty, replies <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi>
and in very few days. <hi>Yes,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Laura,
I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>et at Liberty from the</hi> Dey,
<hi>to be made Pri<U+017F>oner to the</hi> Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a, <hi>who<U+017F>e
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion will render my Impri<U+017F>onment a
thou<U+017F>and times more unfortunate than
my pre<U+017F>ent re<U+017F>traint. Heard you not
what he <U+017F>aid? And what will become of
me, when in his power? Ah,</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>en,
adds <U+017F>he, with Tears in her Eyes, <hi>I
did but too clearly fore-<U+017F>ee the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that did threaten me, unle<U+017F>s Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
divert them. A Maid of my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had better die a Pri<U+017F>oner, than buy
her Liberty at that rate. A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> <U+017F>ighing
for pity, an<U+017F>wered, he had already
thought of all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, and that it
was not without cau<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>o much
oppo<U+017F>ed the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s de<U+017F>igns of taking
her away that Night. That he could
have found means enough for it, had
he thought it for her advantage;
But that he re<U+017F>olved to repre<U+017F>ent
to her fir<U+017F>t, how much harder it
would be for her to get out of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103330:122"/>
                  <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s hands than the <hi>Dey</hi>'s. And
that he was very glad <U+017F>he had fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>poken of it; that he would keep his
word with her, to do her all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he could, to help her back into
her Countrey; that he was very <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
it was as much as his Fortune
was worth, and perhaps his Life;
both which he mu<U+017F>t hazard in the
ca<U+017F>e: but that he never <U+017F>crupled to
expo<U+017F>e the one, or the other, but was
ready to <U+017F>acrifice both for the intere<U+017F>t
of a Family he was more indebted
to; and that he was very willing to
return among the Chri<U+017F>tians, who<U+017F>e
Religion and Cu<U+017F>toms he loved far
better than tho<U+017F>e of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>This u<U+017F>hered in a long Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of
the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in hand; the Conclu<U+017F>ion
was, that <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
of his Friends with the <hi>Dey,</hi> to
per<U+017F>wade him to <U+017F>et <hi>Laura</hi> at liberty,
and <U+017F>end her back into her Country,
to prevent the Confu<U+017F>ion to be feared,
if he <U+017F>hould be obliged to re<U+017F>tore
her to the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> and <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his Daughter St. <hi>Room.</hi> That,
if this would not take, he <U+017F>hould
try the utmo<U+017F>t extremities, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103330:122"/>
the getting her on board
a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of his, which <U+017F>hould
be made ready to carry her away
with the fir<U+017F>t Opportunity. Poor
<hi>Laura,</hi> deeply <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<U+017F>he had to <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>t a
Man, told him more than once,
he might a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he would
not be ungrateful for <U+017F>o con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Services; and that he <U+017F>hould
never fail of a Friend while <U+017F>he
lived, but might command any
thing in the power of her Family.
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who needed no promi<U+017F>es to
per<U+017F>wade him in this particular, took
his leave; and went to <U+017F>pend the
re<U+017F>t of the Night in thinking of the
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, for which his inclination
and gratitude were motives <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
powerful to engage his utmo<U+017F>t
endeavours. He <U+017F>lept not a wink,
but as <U+017F>oon as it was day, he went to
vi<U+017F>it tho<U+017F>e he thought to make u<U+017F>e of,
to <U+017F>peak to the <hi>Dey.</hi> Of the<U+017F>e, <hi>Beyran-Aga,</hi>
the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Favourite, was one, in
whom he placed mo<U+017F>t confidence, as
mo<U+017F>t favouring the Chri<U+017F>tians, and his
particular Friend. He found him
ready to <U+017F>erve him, but at the <U+017F>ame
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103330:123"/>
time, he de<U+017F>ired the favour of <U+017F>eeing

went <U+017F>traight to the <hi>Dey,</hi> to beg leave

reported concerning the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> and
the Chri<U+017F>tian, who was fled. The

<hi>Laura</hi> was in fear <U+017F>till, and <U+017F>o much

of the two <hi>Beyran</hi> <U+017F>eemed mo<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
He viewed and reviewed her
Countenance, her <U+017F>tature, her hair,

too extraordinary, not to <U+017F>urprize
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> to whom he had not yet <U+017F>aid

And at the <U+017F>ame time falling

You little know, <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>ays the

With that <U+017F>he falls into a <U+017F>econd
Swoun into the arms of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who

the <U+017F>ight of him might be the death of
the poor Maid, not knowing who he

Alas! <U+017F>he knows me too well, being the

<U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ied with endeavouring to fetch

<hi>Ah cruel,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>What Fate brought

Beyran</hi> could not hear that Language,

without falling the <U+017F>econd time at her

<hi>Leave me Traytor,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi>leave me,
that I may dye in quiet, rather than be
deluded again with thy tears, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully

The <hi>Aga</hi> was a Renegado arrived at

for him, which <U+017F>he could not
have retained, but for one <U+017F>he had

bottom of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, but thought
it un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to interrupt them, and

You know well enough the

if we give him time to <U+017F>ee her once

the People being already extreamly
incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t her, as the cau<U+017F>e of
all this di<U+017F>order; and upon the noi<U+017F>e

The <hi>Aga</hi> looked upon him as a man

'Tis true, <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Beyran,</hi> with

I have de<U+017F>erved death, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

nor had I e<U+017F>caped death, but that

hath been full of afflictions <U+017F>ufficient
to expiate any Crime, if not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again<U+017F>t you. <hi>Laura</hi> took plea<U+017F>ure

<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who thought one night at lea<U+017F>t

ready to obey this order, begged the

made it appear he was altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
as to the matter of <hi>Alphon<U+017F>o,</hi>
and that her hatred of him <U+017F>hould
be at an end. She made him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,

found her entertainment. The re<U+017F>t

think of <hi>Beyran</hi>'s fortune, whom <U+017F>he
believed, turned Turk for de<U+017F>pair;
at the thought of this, the tears
trickled down her Cheeks, and <U+017F>he
perceived, that if what he told her
was true, of her having been betrayed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103330:130"/>
by her Maid, and that he had not any

                  <hi>When I arrived at</hi> Naples, <hi>I found

rather in the conformity of our age,

new-comer <U+017F>hould be a little in<U+017F>tructed
in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages there, he took the pains
to tell me all the principal Intrigues and

of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for the fair</hi> Eleanor,
<hi>expecting from the fair friend<U+017F>hip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, I would, when acquainted with
her, do him the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice in my
power; I had a <U+017F>ight of her, and by the
fir<U+017F>t effects of that view, could ea<U+017F>ily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ee
there was no continuing</hi> Alphon<U+017F>o<hi>'s
Friend, without becoming his Rival: I
was troubled at it, and reproached my
<U+017F>elf for my unfaithfulne<U+017F>s; but what
<U+017F>ignified that when there was love in
the ca<U+017F>e? There was no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting</hi> Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<hi>charms, and I had in<U+017F>tantly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the re<U+017F>olution to love her, had not
the Vice-Queen u<U+017F>ed all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible arts to
divert me; <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>s'd no <U+017F>mall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance

only <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> her Son, and my

that a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion we cannot ma<U+017F>ter,
was not to be complain'd of, nor
blam'd, and that her Son could not be

of my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>o that my words
gave no offence; but on the contrary,
being extreamly glad, no Beauty at
Court but <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s plea<U+017F>ed me, <U+017F>he
told me <U+017F>miling, <hi>She would find me out
a Per<U+017F>on, that wanted nothing of what
might engage the affections of a gallant
man, and that <U+017F>he was very well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd,
I would not deny it.</hi> I gave her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
thanks, not doubting in the lea<U+017F>t
of the good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of her choice, but
was very unwilling to abu<U+017F>e her great
goodne<U+017F>s: that as to <hi>Eleanor,</hi> <U+017F>he had
done her plea<U+017F>ure; but that the re<U+017F>pect
due to her, would not permit me to
give away, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find me a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. She told
me, <U+017F>he took delight in't; that <U+017F>he
was loth any ones Affections <U+017F>hould be
lo<U+017F>t for want of being engag'd; and
that knowing my merit, <U+017F>he would
think it a plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>erve me, and
take care I wanted nothing in her
Court.</p>
               <p>

All this <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid with an air <U+017F>o free,
<U+017F>o full of goodne<U+017F>s, it charm'd me:
And I had almo<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wered, She
might without further <U+017F>earch, find in
her <U+017F>elf what <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed me el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The truth is, <U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide her
Age, <U+017F>he might have pa<U+017F>s'd for one of
the faire<U+017F>t and be<U+017F>t humoured Women
of the Kingdom; but I was not willing
to venture <U+017F>o far for fear of mi<U+017F>carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and was content to wait for a <U+017F>ight
of her, <U+017F>he would provide for me. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
her not to make me langui<U+017F>h, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an impatient Lover, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required pre<U+017F>ent remedy. She
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, I <U+017F>hould hear from her that
day, and that I had no more to do, but
prepare my <U+017F>elf to be deeply in Love.</p>
               <p>At this we were interrupted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
coming in, which oblig'd me to
withdraw. I <U+017F>pent the re<U+017F>t of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in mu<U+017F>ing of what pa<U+017F>s'd between
us, gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he meant one

knew mo<U+017F>t intimate with her, and mo<U+017F>t
proper for the de<U+017F>ign, but could not fix
my judgment on any. This gave me
<U+017F>ome di<U+017F>quiet and trouble, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the Vice-Queen
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103330:134"/>
again. I made in the afternoon forty
journeys to Court, to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>he had any
thing to <U+017F>ay to me; <U+017F>he laughed at my
ha<U+017F>te, and at length told me, my hour
was not yet come, nor the day gone;
that I <U+017F>hould go home and have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and when the time came, <U+017F>he
would <U+017F>end me news. Night came, but
no news from the Vice-Queen, which
made me believe, <U+017F>he fool'd me; <U+017F>o that
I could not forbear returning to the
Palace, where I heard <U+017F>he was gone to
vi<U+017F>it a Lady her Friend. I was <U+017F>o ready
to imagine it was the Lady <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke
of, that I enquired her name, and where
<U+017F>he lived; but could not learn either.
The caution <U+017F>he had u<U+017F>ed in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
fully convinc'd me, <U+017F>he was gone
about my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and that <U+017F>he made
the vi<U+017F>it private, that my love might be
as <U+017F>ecret; and the Court kept ignorant,
how far her complai<U+017F>ance had carried
her to <U+017F>erve me.</p>
               <p>I return'd in all ha<U+017F>te to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of all this; nor was I much
mi<U+017F>taken, for I was <U+017F>carce got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but I received from her a Billet,
brought me by a Lady attended with
two Chairs, and expre<U+017F>s'd as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:103330:135"/>
I have done what you de<U+017F>ired, and I
think, found out the per<U+017F>on you wanted;
you will ea<U+017F>ily confe<U+017F>s I am very much your
friend: the <U+017F>ole acknowledgment I expect is,
you would not make me a Lyar, having
promi<U+017F>ed the Lady that upon the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cription
I made you of her, you would bring
her a heart full of love. See you do it,
for it you deceive me in this, I <U+017F>hall never
pardon you the fault. You have no more to
do but follow her that brings you this Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
without noi<U+017F>e or attendance; for you
are to come into a place of <U+017F>afety.</p>
               <p>Had it come from any other I
<U+017F>hould not have gone without a Guard
at di<U+017F>tance, but coming from the Vice-Queen,
I could not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect danger.
All I thought of it was, that being a
jovial and plea<U+017F>ant Lady, <U+017F>he had a
frollick in her head, and re<U+017F>olved to
put on me <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant trick: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, I made me ready to
laugh with her in good earne<U+017F>t: I
went into one of the Chairs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her who brought the Billet, and
was got into the other. They carried
us a great way into a private part of
the Town, and there <U+017F>et down the
Chairs which my Guide <U+017F>ent away, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103330:135"/>
we marched a little further, till we
came to a hou<U+017F>e which made a fair <U+017F>hew;
I learnt afterwards it belong'd to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of her Bed-Chamber, her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
who indeed was my Guide, and
having open'd the door, made me go
in without noi<U+017F>e: I <U+017F>aw neither lacquey
nor light. This <U+017F>urpriz'd me, and made
me the more confident, <U+017F>ome frollick
intended: I <U+017F>ald not a word but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
in ca<U+017F>e things went not as I could
wi<U+017F>h, to have my <U+017F>hare of the mirth
with them, who came to laugh at my
co<U+017F>t. At la<U+017F>t the Lady took me by the
hand to lead me up a pair of <U+017F>tairs in
the dark, which brought us to a room
no lighter then the <U+017F>tairs, and thence
into a Chamber where were two
Flamboys lighted. It appeared a good
room, but what plea<U+017F>ed me mo<U+017F>t
was, the <U+017F>ight of a fair Lady, who
carele<U+017F>ly laid on a very rich bed, <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a<U+017F>leep with her hood over her face.
I began to repent my cen<U+017F>ure of the
Vice-Queen, whom I then thought to
have written in good earne<U+017F>t: I <U+017F>ay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Lady but what plea<U+017F>ed
me extreamly, and to <U+017F>peak the
truth, it was the <U+017F>ole moment I
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103330:136"/>
may be <U+017F>aid to have forgot the fair
<hi>Eleaner,</hi> <U+017F>ince I loved her. She was
in a loo<U+017F>e dre<U+017F>s, but hand<U+017F>om, and
rich beyond expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: I had not <U+017F>een
the like at Court, and knew not what
to think, the Richne<U+017F>s of the furniture,
as well as her dre<U+017F>s declaring her to
be a Lady of no ordinary quality:
but I was very much perplext to gue<U+017F>s
who <U+017F>he was. I made up to her, and
<U+017F>poke; and the amorous impatience I
had to know her not permitting the
u<U+017F>e of much Ceremony towards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that <U+017F>tayed for me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I put my knee to
the Ground, and laying Hold on one
of her fair hands, which <U+017F>he allowed
me to ki<U+017F>s; It was but rea<U+017F>on, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid I, <hi>I <U+017F>hould have langui<U+017F>hed all
this day as I have done, who could
not expect this happine<U+017F>s, without being
put to the pain at lea<U+017F>t of longing for it.</hi>
I looked for an an<U+017F>wer in hopes to
know the voice, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid not a
word. I intreated her to ea<U+017F>e me of
the pain, <U+017F>he might believe I was in,
and that if <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved not to be <U+017F>een,
<U+017F>he would however vouch<U+017F>afe to <U+017F>peak
to me, that where I was directed
to bring a heart of love, I hoped to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103330:136"/>
<U+017F>ee a Lady that had Beauty and Wit;
that as yet <U+017F>he had only moved my
curio<U+017F>ity, but if <U+017F>he meant to reach
my heart, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee her. As I <U+017F>poke
thus, I perceived her laugh, which gave
me the boldne<U+017F>s to lift up her hood:
She put back my hand, but <U+017F>o weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I thought it would not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e
her to pre<U+017F>s a little further: there were
but we two in the Room, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
having doubtle<U+017F>s received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to withdraw, and I was ready to
put her to the <U+017F>queek, when at la<U+017F>t
<U+017F>he threw off her hood. But how was
I <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee 'twas the Vice-Queen.
Well <hi>Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, blu<U+017F>hing, <hi>will you
be content with your good fortune? And
will it not be pre<U+017F>umption in me to fancy
my <U+017F>elf capable to make you forget all
other Beauties.</hi> I an<U+017F>wered her more
like a Gallant then a Lover: <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>atisfi'd however, and without
ingaging further in the relation of a
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, of which you may gue<U+017F>s
the con<U+017F>equence, I will tell you only
that having <U+017F>pent two or three hours
in her company, I return'd to my

the Pallace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103330:137"/>
I <U+017F>aw her on the morrow, and our
Corre<U+017F>pondence held for <U+017F>ome time,
but cur'd not my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Her Son

he was not content to make me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

expecting more benefit from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce<U+017F><U+017F>ion

concern'd her <U+017F>elf in my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. I

di<U+017F>ingage my <U+017F>elf by degrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103330:137"/>
declaring on the <U+017F>udden for <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
I ob<U+017F>erved the be<U+017F>t I could the
mea<U+017F>ures I had taken, but 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to conceal a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion from a
jealous and a witty Woman. The
Vice-Queen perceived my relap<U+017F>e, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I made <hi>Eleanor</hi> acquainted with
it; <U+017F>he puni<U+017F>hed my Apo<U+017F>tacy with a
thou<U+017F>and reproaches, which were <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with tears, and I (the better

to her. But what will
not a <U+017F>lighted Lady do? or what
more dangerous than a jealous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
I was thenceforward more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of <U+017F>eeing and <U+017F>peaking with the
beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and avoided the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions

what was true, from what was feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <U+017F>he gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed exactly right of
the private<U+017F>t of my thoughts. One
day as I walked with her in the
Garden, <U+017F>he told me, we had both lo<U+017F>t

now did, was but the effect of my civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to a Lady of her quality, who
had expre<U+017F>t kindne<U+017F>s for me. But 'twas
time to put an end to our pain, and to
<U+017F>atisfie me <U+017F>he intended it. She a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, <U+017F>he would no longer oppo<U+017F>e
my Inclination, and that I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, upon the Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>he made
me, that I might expect from <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
not only a kind reception, but
<U+017F>omething of love; yet I put no great
confidence in all the<U+017F>e good words, as
coming from a party too lyable to <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition:
But when by an Exce<U+017F>s of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s

more then any other to my <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and procure a Letter from the

per<U+017F>wade him to con<U+017F>ent I <U+017F>hould have
his Daughter I was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported

procured from the Vice-Roy, I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not of being compleatly happy in
few days. The news was confirmed
by the beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and I had
the plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee her glad of it as
I was: nothing troubled me then but
the <U+017F>low pace of time. The Vice-Roy

this minute. With that he took out a
little Pur<U+017F>e from his pocket, and out of
the Pur<U+017F>e the Billet, which he read to
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> in the<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>I am heartily <U+017F>orry, my dear <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi>
I mu<U+017F>t fail my a<U+017F><U+017F>ignation. But an
unhappy accident I mu<U+017F>t not now tell you
of, will for a few days retard our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:
you may believe me, as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it
as you are, but love me as you have done.
Love will furni<U+017F>h us with opportunity
enough, <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had never received a Letter from
<hi>Eleanor,</hi> nor knew her Character; <U+017F>o
that it was ea<U+017F>ie for <hi>Clarice</hi> to make
me believe that Billet came from her:
I asked her what her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s ail'd;
<hi>Nothing,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he laughing, <hi>but that <U+017F>he
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103330:139"/>
is not very well this evening.</hi> I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
I under<U+017F>tood her meaning, and
examin'd her no further; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with my
ill fortune that night, when a Page
of the Vice-Queens met me coming
down <U+017F>tairs, and told me, his Lady
de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with me. In the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
I was in, I could have wi<U+017F>h'd a
Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation from waiting upon her;
but not knowing what excu<U+017F>e to make
being <U+017F>o near her, and fearing <U+017F>he
might have <U+017F>omething to tell me from
<hi>Eleanor,</hi> being the common <U+017F>ubject of
her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with me, I followed
the Page into her Chamber, where
I found her expecting my coming:
<U+017F>he was at her Toilet, and the Vice-Roy
being out of Town, as <U+017F>oon as
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me, <U+017F>he reproached me for
de<U+017F>erting her <U+017F>o: <U+017F>he could of late
<U+017F>carce <U+017F>ee me in the croud; that if I
would not out of Gallantry, I <U+017F>hould at
lea<U+017F>t out of civility have afforded her
my company, when de<U+017F>titute of other.
I was not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed for giving her
<U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing an an<U+017F>wer as I would
have done another time, however I
<U+017F>aid not any thing to di<U+017F>oblige her:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103330:140"/>
I was melancholy and vext, but <U+017F>o
deeply in love, I had a <U+017F>tock of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and complai<U+017F>ance which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furni<U+017F>hed me with plea<U+017F>ing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions,
which the Vice-Queen did
not di<U+017F>approve of: I had not <U+017F>een her in
a better humour; and falling into di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>he kept me with her a great
part of that night; but <U+017F>he thought me
out of humour, and quarrelled with
me upon't: I excu<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf, as having
<U+017F>at up all the night before at play.
Hereupon <U+017F>he invited me to lye on her
Bed; I was priviledg'd to be familiar,
and without further intreaty made u<U+017F>e
of my liberty: for the truth is, I was
almo<U+017F>t dead for want of <U+017F>leep; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
le<U+017F>s than two hours I was awak'd
on the <U+017F>udden by the light of a Flam-boy,
held before my eyes, and the fir<U+017F>t
object I <U+017F>aw, was <hi>Eleanor</hi> with a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
in her hand, to take away my
life, had not <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> laid hold on
her arm, and prevented the <U+017F>troke.
Judge you what amazement I was
in, I might with <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on have
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected all this a Dream: But my
Rival having <U+017F>eized the Ponyard, to
execute what he had hindered <hi>Eleanor</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:103330:140"/>
to do, had <U+017F>he not done me in her
turn the like Service. I thought it high
time to take care of my life, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to my Arms, put my <U+017F>elf in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
of defence. The Vice-Queen half
dead with the fright, came running
to part us, but was like to have been
kill'd by her Son, who <U+017F>eemed as
eager to di<U+017F>patch her as me: I happily
<U+017F>aved her two or three times, and at
la<U+017F>t <U+017F>tanding before her, the fury <hi>Don
Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> was in, made him run on my
Weapon, and kill him<U+017F>elf rather than be
killed by me: I <U+017F>aw him fall, which
troubled me extreamly, fore<U+017F>eeing the
dreadful Con<U+017F>equence of <U+017F>uch a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
I turn'd towards the unhappy
Mother, to ask her what <U+017F>he would
do, and found her <U+017F>woun away, and
lying without motion: I was <U+017F>o
much afflicted with the <U+017F>pectacle, I
wi<U+017F>h'd my <U+017F>elf dead: at la<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing me to withdraw, I entred
<hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Chamber, to <U+017F>ee her once
more, and dye at her feet, if <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired
my life to expiate my fault, but I found
her not, and <U+017F>o left the Pallace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ob<U+017F>tacle. My de<U+017F>ign was to
pa<U+017F>s into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being in <U+017F>earch of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103330:141"/>
a <hi>Felucca</hi> to embark in, found <hi>Clarice</hi>
almo<U+017F>t drown'd in tears at the Port.
I knew her, and asked whither <U+017F>he
went, and what <U+017F>he would have: <hi>Ah
Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>I have been looking for my
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who the Mariners tell me, is
embarqued not a quarter of an hour
<U+017F>ince for</hi> Barcellona. I was <U+017F>trangely
<U+017F>urprized at the news, and without
further deliberation, took the fir<U+017F>t
<hi>Felucca</hi> I met, and <hi>Clarice</hi> being very
willing to go with me in <U+017F>earch of her
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, or rather to get away from
a Court, where <U+017F>he had rea<U+017F>on to fear
the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t extremities, after the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
lately happen'd, wherein <U+017F>he
knew her <U+017F>elf concern'd; I put her
aboard, and had the weather <U+017F>o fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable,
we hoped to reach <hi>Barcellona</hi>
before <hi>Eleanor</hi> could be there. I took
care to inquire the Name of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca</hi>
<U+017F>he was embarqued in, and the
Ma<U+017F>ters. I was till then <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tracted and
oppre<U+017F>s'd with grief and de<U+017F>pair, it was
not in my power to make any re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on all the<U+017F>e misfortunes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got to Sea, I recollected my <U+017F>elf,
and con<U+017F>idered all tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters; but
the more I thought on them, the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103330:141"/>
more was I perplex'd about them. I
could not imagine by what accident
<hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> <U+017F>hould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to <U+017F>urprize me in the Vice-Queens
Chamber; unle<U+017F>s we had been
betray'd, or <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> more in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Eleanor</hi> than I believed: and
if that were <U+017F>o, why <U+017F>hould my Rival
prevent my death, as he did, and why
did <U+017F>he take her turn too, to <U+017F>ave
my life from <hi>Alphon<U+017F>o,</hi> unle<U+017F>s both
were ambitious of the hour to have
killed me. However I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I
de<U+017F>erv'd death, and wi<U+017F>h I had received
it at <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s hand; I <U+017F>hould not then
have had the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of imbrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my hands in the Blood of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
who had all the rea<U+017F>on in the
World to be reveng'd of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarice</hi> was very ill in the <hi>Felucca,</hi>
of the fright <U+017F>he had taken, or el<U+017F>e
Sea-<U+017F>ick. I had not <U+017F>een her all the
time of the di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter at <hi>Naples,</hi> I told her
part of the <U+017F>tory, and found it <U+017F>o much
afflicted her; e<U+017F>pecially when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the death of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon<U+017F>o,</hi>
<U+017F>he grew wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e: I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her <U+017F>everal que<U+017F>tions, which <U+017F>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
with a great deal of trouble, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103330:142"/>
Ignorance, but in <U+017F>uch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as gave me cau<U+017F>e enough to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
the contrary, and believe <U+017F>he was more
concerned in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s than I was
aware of: I was unwilling to pre<U+017F>s her
in the condition <U+017F>he was in, to reveal
the <U+017F>ecret, though I was curious of a
di<U+017F>covery, but hoped to make it, when
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be a little better.</p>
               <p>We arriv'd at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> but no
news of the Bark <hi>Eleanor</hi> went aboard
of: I re<U+017F>olved to have patience a
while, as well as the Merchants, who
had effects in it of great value: But
how careful <U+017F>oever I was of <hi>Clarice,</hi>
<U+017F>he grew wor<U+017F>e than at Sea, and all the
Phy<U+017F>icians could do for her, prevented
not her being reduced to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
they gave her over as de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<U+017F>o that finding her <U+017F>elf at
deaths door, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for me to her
Chamber, and having de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak
with me in private, the re<U+017F>t of the
company quitted the Room, and <U+017F>he
told me, that <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> having
gained her, <U+017F>he did him all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<U+017F>he could again<U+017F>t me with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;
and having over-heard part of
my la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Eleanor,</hi> <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103330:142"/>
acquainted my Rival with it,
who tran<U+017F>ported with rage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair,
again<U+017F>t a de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>o fatal to his
Affection, re<U+017F>olved by any means to
defeat it, and if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of it for him<U+017F>elf. That in order
to this, he made her write a Letter,
and carry it me, as from her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;
that <hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o</hi> took his time, and
his mea<U+017F>ures accordingly, having
learnt from her the hour, and the
manner of my coming to <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s
Chamber; that he got in without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
but what pa<U+017F>s'd further, <U+017F>he
knew not; only <U+017F>ome hours after,
hearing the noi<U+017F>e of Swords, <U+017F>he ran
in, where <U+017F>he found her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s all in
di<U+017F>order, packing away; that <U+017F>he
would have followed her, but her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
begg'd of her to let her go alone.
At la<U+017F>t finding the noi<U+017F>e increa<U+017F>e in
the Vice-Queens Chamber, <U+017F>he was
frighted, and went towards the Port,
where I found her; with that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Girl with abundance of tears,
begged that now at her death, I would
pardon her a Crime had co<U+017F>t her her
life. She <U+017F>aid no more, but two hours
after died: I will not tell you the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103330:143"/>
different motions of my heart, during
the di<U+017F>mal Relation this Wretch made
me; but the appearance of Death in
her face made me pardon her. As for
<hi>Don Alphon<U+017F>o,</hi> I heartily wi<U+017F>h'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
again, as not <U+017F>ufficiently puni<U+017F>hed
by one Death for his Trea<U+017F>on; but
the Traytors being both in another
World, I had no Subject to exerci<U+017F>e
my Revenge on, unle<U+017F>s my ill Fate,
again<U+017F>t which I <U+017F>pent my time in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
Complaints.</p>
               <p>To compleat my mi<U+017F>ery, News
came, the Bark we expected was lo<U+017F>t,
which was confirmed by Advice from
<U+017F>everal Parties. Never man in <U+017F>uch
de<U+017F>pair as I; I will not tell you the
extravagancies it made me run into;
it di<U+017F>tracts me to think on't: there
was no other remedy to bring me to
my <U+017F>elf, but to per<U+017F>wade me the News
from Sea were not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure, but that
we had rea<U+017F>on to expect further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
and that Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els reported
ca<U+017F>t away, came frequently <U+017F>afe into
Port: that the Sea was a large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and one Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el might be ea<U+017F>ily
mi<U+017F>taken for another, and that many
fell into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103330:143"/>
were <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to have been wracked,
becau<U+017F>e they were not heard of. This
gave me but <U+017F>mall comfort; yet I
thought I had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on of hope,
undertaking a Voyage to vi<U+017F>it all
the Ports of the <hi>Levant,</hi> till I <U+017F>hould

<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> told him, he was very glad for
his <U+017F>ake, that Matters pa<U+017F>s'd otherwi<U+017F>e
than <hi>Eleanor</hi> believed; that it would
be no hard matter to make his peace,
when <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood the Treachery of

you, whom <U+017F>he found in the Arms of

one to you, that you might leave him
the other. <hi>Ah!</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>en, replies the
<hi>Aga</hi> with a <U+017F>igh, <hi>let's talk no more of
what's pa<U+017F>t; as innocent as I am of the
one <U+017F>ide, I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge my <U+017F>elf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to excu<U+017F>e and extenuate the fault as
much as you can before her; or rather
never <U+017F>peak of it, but endeavour only
to di<U+017F>abu<U+017F>e her, and alter the ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<U+017F>he hath of me, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your
<U+017F>elf, what-ever Fortune befal me, I
will not be ungrateful for the Service
you will do me. I believe you have
heard from her who I am, and if the
condition <U+017F>he is in, or any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
hath oblig'd her to conceal her
Birth, and other things concerning
her, that might render her more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the zeal you have for her Service,
I will <U+017F>atisfie your curio<U+017F>ity in every
particular. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> thanked him, and
fell a laughing, and an<U+017F>wered, He had
known her too long to want In<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in tho<U+017F>e Particulars, and could
give a better account of her Birth and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103330:144"/>
Family than any Per<U+017F>on what-ever.
The <hi>Aga,</hi> <U+017F>urpriz'd at it, entreated

how he being a <hi>Turk,</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o long
and <U+017F>o particularly know her. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It was day by that time <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> had
done, which put them in mind of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<U+017F>ome re<U+017F>olution about the de<U+017F>ign
in hand, and the means to be made
u<U+017F>e of, to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Ca<U+017F>tle
without danger. They thought of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, but all appeared full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and inconvenience; yet
they two could be<U+017F>t do it of any, the
one having all the power over <hi>Laura</hi>'s
Guards, and the other over the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of the Ca<U+017F>tle. But all things were
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly examined by the vigilance
of the inferior Officers, whom the
<hi>Dey</hi> (a man as vigilant as fearful) had
<U+017F>trictly commanded to be always on
Guard, and not permit any to come
in, or go out, without taking exact
notice of them, that it was ab<U+017F>olutely
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to take right mea<U+017F>ures, and
<U+017F>till fear the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> at length
bethought him<U+017F>elf of a Stratagem, the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103330:145"/>
le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to di<U+017F>covery, as covered
under a cloak of Religion, though in
truth, apt to <U+017F>tartle a nice Girl as <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
There was a Souldier of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tle
dead the night afore, to be buried
that day; he re<U+017F>olved to lock up the
Corps in a Chamber, and carry out
<hi>Laura</hi> on the Bier, as if <U+017F>he had been
the Souldier, to be buried in the
Church-yard behind the Ca<U+017F>tle. The
<hi>Aga</hi> was of opinion, there could be no
danger in the expedient, but doubted
much whether <hi>Laura</hi> could be induc'd
to make u<U+017F>e of it; yet after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ultation,
and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of other
means, they thought that not only the
be<U+017F>t, but the only one they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
them<U+017F>elves a good de<U+017F>ign from.
But to prevent the trouble <hi>Laura</hi> might
have upon the apprehen<U+017F>ion of Death,
or other <U+017F>ad Accident, they agreed
not to tell her of the Bier, but propo<U+017F>e
carrying her out in a Chair. This
being re<U+017F>olved on, <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who was to
<U+017F>ee her that morning, undertook to
per<U+017F>wade her to it, and the <hi>Aga</hi> in the
mean time gave order, the dead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<U+017F>hould not be buried till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He recommended to <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103330:145"/>
care of his Affairs with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
gave him <hi>Clarices</hi> Letter to produce in
ju<U+017F>tification of him; and after a great
deal of Civility and Kindne<U+017F>s on both
<U+017F>ides, they parted, to meet again at
Dinner at <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s, for fear their long
Conferences in the Ca<U+017F>tle might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion in the Garri<U+017F>on, being
extreamly jealous and mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful.
<hi>Laura,</hi> who had <U+017F>carce re<U+017F>ted all night
for Dreams, which troubled her, was
very joyful to <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> come <U+017F>o early,
to divert her from the thoughts of
them. <hi>Well, dear</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>en, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi><U+017F>hall
we be once ea<U+017F>ed of our Chains? and mu<U+017F>t

of Lovers. <hi>Ah!</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi>I fore<U+017F>aw he
would corrupt even your fidelity; I know
too well the power he hath to gain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had rea<U+017F>on enough to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t him.</hi>
Be not <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty, <hi>Madam, replies the
Turk,</hi> to condemn a man unheard.
Why, <hi>what <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he,</hi> can he offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
what I have <U+017F>een? Did not I
find him with the Vice-Queen? Was
it not he that help'd the Traytor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon<U+017F>o</hi>

to let me tell you, what you know
well enough, that he loved you too
well, to be capable of an action of
that kind; and to clear all your doubts,
<hi>adds he,</hi> <U+017F>hewing her <hi>Clarices</hi> Letter,
Know you that Character? <hi>Well,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>urpriz'd, <hi>'tis my

and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee who was guilty of
the Trea<U+017F>on. <hi>Laura</hi> read it, and had
<U+017F>carce done, when relenting at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done <hi>Hippolito,</hi> or troubled for the
Treachery of a Maid, <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much
confided on; <hi>O God of Vengeance,</hi>
cry'd <U+017F>he with tears, <hi>wilt thou leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puni<U+017F>hed
a Wretch <U+017F>o treacherous, and one
who hath been the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>a<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi>
No <U+017F>ure, <hi><U+017F>ays A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> for <U+017F>he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
dead, if not as her Trea<U+017F>on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved,
yet for grief of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it. With that he related to
her, what <U+017F>he knew not of the Story
of the <hi>Marque<U+017F>s,</hi> and found it not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to appea<U+017F>e the great wrath
<U+017F>he had expre<U+017F>s'd again<U+017F>t him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him her general pardon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her con<U+017F>ent for his going along
with them. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> like a dexterous
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103330:146"/>
Confident, <U+017F>aid not a word of what
concerned the Vice-Queen; and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
who had no de<U+017F>ire to be any more
angry with her dear Servant, was not
very curious to que<U+017F>tion him on that
point: <U+017F>he was content to believe him
innocent of one <U+017F>ide, and to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
with a pretence not to hate him;
<U+017F>o hard a matter is it to u<U+017F>e ill tho<U+017F>e
we love, how criminal <U+017F>oever. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
then told her of the re<U+017F>olution taken
by the <hi>Aga</hi> and him, to have her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out in a Chair, and found her
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to do what-ever they <U+017F>hould
think fit, but with condition there
<U+017F>hould be no more danger for them
than for her. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> undertook it, and
told her, <U+017F>he had no more to do, but
make ready again<U+017F>t the fir<U+017F>t Watch,
whil<U+017F>t the <hi>Aga</hi> and he took Orders for
other things. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> went home, where
<hi>Beyran-Aga,</hi> came <U+017F>hortly after, and
gave him an account of all he had
done. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> laboured with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and dexterity to <U+017F>ee the <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
well <U+017F>tored with Nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries; you
may believe, <hi>Beyran</hi> failed not, as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie
as he was, to de<U+017F>ire an account of
what mo<U+017F>t concerned him, the <U+017F>tate
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103330:147"/>
of his Affair with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. His
dear Confident acquainted him with
what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s he had di<U+017F>charged the
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion he gave him, which <hi>Bey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
was <U+017F>o glad of, as it was not in his
power to expre<U+017F>s his Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All was ready, and <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Orders, as well
for the <hi>Brigandine,</hi> as for Hor<U+017F>es and
Men. The <hi>Aga</hi> and he went together
to the Ca<U+017F>tle, where the <hi>Aga</hi> made him
a Pre<U+017F>ent of all the Jewels he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at <U+017F>everal times from the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and entreated him to accept them not
as a <U+017F>atisfaction, but a pledge of the
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance he had given him to be ever
his Friend, and <U+017F>erve him on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions.
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> who endeavoured, but
in vain, to refu<U+017F>e his liberality, would
not accept of it, but on condition
the <hi>Aga</hi> would make u<U+017F>e on all occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of what he had be<U+017F>towed, as <U+017F>till
his own, and believe <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible,
he had not <U+017F>ufficiently obliged him
to merit <U+017F>o rich a Pre<U+017F>ent. They
went from the Ca<U+017F>tle, to make their
Court to the <hi>Dey;</hi> and the hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> fir<U+017F>t changed <hi>Laura</hi>'s
Guards, relieving them by three of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103330:147"/>
his Servants, whom he was to take
with him, that none might be left
behind to di<U+017F>cover the De<U+017F>ign, or
the Road they <U+017F>hould take. The
<hi>Aga</hi> quickly followed him, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>ee <hi>Laura;</hi> he fell down at
her feet in <U+017F>uch a Tran<U+017F>port of Joy
and Love, it moved her to that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he could not forbear em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him. As <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>ed him
from the Ground, they were falling
into amorous Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
told them, it was not a time to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
but to put their De<U+017F>ign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
unle<U+017F>s they had a mind to <U+017F>ee
it mi<U+017F>carry; and that when they
<U+017F>hould be once out of danger, they
<U+017F>hould have lei<U+017F>ure enough to <U+017F>ay
what they plea<U+017F>ed. <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Beyran,</hi>
who de<U+017F>ired nothing more than to
<U+017F>ee them<U+017F>elves at liberty, were ea<U+017F>ily
per<U+017F>uaded to follow his Advice. And
the Chair being brought by the <hi>Aga</hi>'s
Order, who had hidden the Corps,
they wrapt up <hi>Laura</hi> in a clean Sheet,
and without <U+017F>aying a word of the Bier,
put her in it, and cau<U+017F>ed it to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of her Chamber, where having
according to the cu<U+017F>tom of the Place,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103330:148"/>
thrown a Carpet over her, one of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s
men took the Lanthorn, and the other
two carried the Bier; <hi>Beyran</hi> leading the
Van, and <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> bringing up the Rear.
A Corps is a <U+017F>acred thing among the
<hi>Turks;</hi> nor would any of the Guard have
thought of <U+017F>earching the Bier, though
neither <hi>Beyran</hi> nor <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> had been with
it. They went to the Church-yard,
where having taken <hi>Laura</hi> out of her
Grave, they marched towards the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage-gate,</hi>
which the <hi>Aga</hi> commanded
to be opened, that they might take
Hor<U+017F>e, which attended them hard by.
<hi>Laura</hi> and the <hi>Aga,</hi> whom we will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
call by their names, could not yet
take any plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee them<U+017F>elves out
of the Ca<U+017F>tle and City, for fear of ill
Accidents, but long'd to <U+017F>ee them<U+017F>elves
at Sea; however they were glad they
got happily <U+017F>o far, in hopes Fortune
would in favour of Love, improve
that lucky beginning to a <U+017F>uitable
end. But this <U+017F>mall Lightning of Joy
quickly vani<U+017F>hed, being da<U+017F>h'd out by
the cruelty of their Fate; for being
arriv'd, where they expected to take
Hor<U+017F>e, they found by <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s Servants,
the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Sophies had taken them
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103330:148"/>
away. In what perplexity then was
this unfortunate Company? they
were five or <U+017F>ix Leagues di<U+017F>tant from
the Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
was; they had no time to lo<U+017F>e,
and knew not what to re<U+017F>olve on,
when on the <U+017F>udden they heard the
noi<U+017F>e of Hor<U+017F>es making towards them.
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> hid <hi>Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> under
an old Wall, and advanced with <U+017F>ome
of his people towards the Hor<U+017F>e-men:
They marched apace, and quickly
asked, who is there? <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> told them
who he was, and by good fortune,
found it was <hi>Romadan,</hi> the Ma<U+017F>ter of
the Gallies, coming from <hi>Port-farm</hi>
with a Guard. He told him, the <hi>Ba<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a</hi>'s
Sophies had taken from his people
<U+017F>ome Hor<U+017F>es he had in readine<U+017F>s to go
for <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to <U+017F>ee a <hi>Brigandine</hi>
he was <U+017F>ending out to Sea. <hi>Romadan,</hi>
who knew the re<U+017F>pect the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had for
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> was angry for what was done
by the Sophies; and to remedy the
inconvenience, told <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> he might
take his choice of what Hor<U+017F>es he plea<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his Troop, and not trouble
him<U+017F>elf for his own, they <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>ent him where he plea<U+017F>ed to order.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103330:149"/>
                  <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en,</hi> glad of the opportunity, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his offer; and <hi>Romadan</hi> taking him
a<U+017F>ide, told him, The <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
to come again to him, and by
any means to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tle,
and that he would do well in his
return from <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to take the
Camp in his way, and endeavour to
divert the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> from <U+017F>o dangerous an
Enterprize. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> having promi<U+017F>ed
it, di<U+017F>-engaged him<U+017F>elf from <hi>Romadan</hi>
as <U+017F>oon as he could; but <hi>Romadan</hi>
would oblige him at parting, with
two of his Hor<U+017F>e-men, to accompany
him, and <U+017F>erve him from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were abroad, and might <U+017F>et
upon him unknown. This put <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
into a little perplexity, but he would
not refu<U+017F>e the kindne<U+017F>s, for fear of
giving cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken his leave, he advanced
towards his company, and acquainted
the two Lovers in few words, what
fortune he had met with. All mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Eleanor</hi> in Boys Cloaths,
pa<U+017F>s'd for a young Slave of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s,
the night helping to cover the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e,
they made all the ha<U+017F>te po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

having in few days expre<U+017F>s'd no <U+017F>mall

Turk, and <U+017F>ent me for the purpo<U+017F>e to
a famous Cady to be in<U+017F>tructed in
their Faith: this <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctor
was a very hone<U+017F>t man, and witty;
he was the Son of a Renegado, and
had le<U+017F>s Faith than his Father in
what he taught others: he <U+017F>poke very
freely to me, and I opened my <U+017F>elf
to him, and pray'd him to make the
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> believe I was turn'd Turk; he

Nephew who was jealous of it, and
often quarrelled with me on that

produced further inconvenience. The

The wind chopped about, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Storm, the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el being <U+017F>mall,
they thought it inconvenient to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

about, making towards <hi>Bi<U+017F>erti,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to <U+017F>ail near the Coa<U+017F>t of
<hi>Barbary,</hi> till they <U+017F>hould come over
again<U+017F>t <hi>Sardinia,</hi> that they might
cro<U+017F>s over (as <U+017F>oon as the weather
<U+017F>erved) into the I<U+017F>les of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
where they hoped to anchor. This
was their re<U+017F>olution, and 'twas well
for them they followed it, for the
Storm was <U+017F>o great, they were forced
to lye at Anchor three or four days
among the Rocks on the Coa<U+017F>t of
<hi>Barbary.</hi> They were <U+017F>o far from
<hi>Tunis,</hi> they had no cau<U+017F>e to fear
pur<U+017F>uit, being at Anchor in a place
where a thou<U+017F>and Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els might have
pa<U+017F>s'd by without di<U+017F>covering them in
the <U+017F>torm.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>torm at length was pretty

her Voyage along the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi>
meeting by the way <U+017F>everal
Creeks, floating Hog<U+017F>heads, and Planks,

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103330:152"/>
away in the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>torm. For two days
they crui<U+017F>ed along that Sea; they
were frequently entertained with
tho<U+017F>e lamentable <U+017F>pectacles, and at
la<U+017F>t heard the voice of a Man, which
they fancied mu<U+017F>t have come from
a Rock at lea<U+017F>t three miles di<U+017F>tant
from Land; they pre<U+017F>ently concluded
it was one e<U+017F>caped out of the late
Shipwracks. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was moved to
pity at the cry, and <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> at her
reque<U+017F>t, turn'd the prow of his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
towards the Rock. The Sea
was then calm, and when they got
within <U+017F>ome paces of the Rock, they
<U+017F>aw a man almo<U+017F>t naked, without
Hat, without Stockins, without Shoes,
<U+017F>o maimed and disfigured, they knew
not whether they <U+017F>hould more fear
him or pity him. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Sea-men to cea<U+017F>e rowing,
asked him in <hi>More<U+017F>que,</hi> how he came
upon that Rock, and what he would
have. I am an unfortunate Chri<U+017F>tian
<hi>(an<U+017F>wers he in Italian)</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to you, and if you will take
the pains to get foot on land here,
you will find what perhaps you are

time, otherwi<U+017F>e your help may come
too late. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> amazed to hear him
<U+017F>peak <U+017F>o, ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>omething in his
Countenance, made him think he had
<U+017F>een him el<U+017F>ewhere. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was
particularly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at his voice,
and fancied <U+017F>he knew it; but the man
was <U+017F>o disfigured, <U+017F>he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
call to mind who he was
<hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi> asked him his name, and where
he had <U+017F>een him to know him: I tell
you, <hi>an<U+017F>wers the man,</hi> I have here
what you perhaps go in <U+017F>earch of
much further; the man you <U+017F>ee is
<hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Slave, and if
he has <U+017F>ent thee for his Wife, thou
may'<U+017F>t find her on this Rock half
dead with her Sufferings the<U+017F>e two
days we have been here: he had
<U+017F>carce done <U+017F>peaking, but <hi>Eleanor</hi>
invaded at once with joy and grief
cry'd out, which made the man turn
his face, and <U+017F>he knew him to be
<hi>Alexander. Ha Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi>is it po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

commanded the Oars to turn

pa<U+017F>s'd over it fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Hippolito</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all to embrace poor <hi>Alexander,</hi> who
was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, he could

get him <U+017F>omething from aboard to
comfort his dear <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who had
not eat any thing for three days
pa<U+017F>t. They gave order accordingly,
and in<U+017F>tantly ran towards the place
where the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> lay under a
Bu<U+017F>h, where they found her half
dead; a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>ight for <hi>Laura,</hi> yet mixt
with joy to <U+017F>ee her; but what an
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hing <U+017F>urprize was this to the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> who could <U+017F>carce open her
eyes, and knew not whether <U+017F>he
were awake or in a Dream, and
whether what appeared to her, were
Per<U+017F>ons or Spirits. You may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> began to recover, but had
not <U+017F>trength to <U+017F>peak long. <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>
told <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>he would be better

<U+017F>till. The Count, who had not yet

where they were bound for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

for a final Adieu, when the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el
giving a great crack, made me turn
my eyes towards the Window of my
Cabin, where I <U+017F>aw a Rock almo<U+017F>t
touching the Poop; this <U+017F>urprized me
not a little, and taking a <U+017F>uden re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
I placed the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> on my
back, got upon the Deck, and in <U+017F>pite
of the Sea-men, who would have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
me, I leaped on the Rock
without doing my <U+017F>elf or the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi>
harm. A moment after, the Sea which
ca<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el on the Rock, carried
it off again, leaving me and the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane<U+017F>s</hi>
there helple<U+017F>s of help, unle<U+017F>s our
Sea-men would pity us, but they could
not ma<U+017F>ter the winds, and the night
was far gone, <U+017F>o that no good was to
be expected from them till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
if the <U+017F>torm would over. A <U+017F>ad
night it was, the poor <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to comfort me with hopes the
Mariners would not for<U+017F>ake us; but
what a lamentable <U+017F>pectacle had I at
break of day, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103330:155"/>
half a Ship a float, which by the
number of People I <U+017F>aw returning
from one end to another to get nearer
land, was <U+017F>unk by the greatne<U+017F>s of the
waves, and all the men drown'd. What
afflicted me mo<U+017F>t, was the <U+017F>ight of the
<hi>Sultane<U+017F>s,</hi> though <U+017F>he by I know not
what pre<U+017F>age, would not de<U+017F>pair of
good Fortune, but would tell me <U+017F>till,
<hi>Heaven</hi> had not <U+017F>aved us from the Sea,
to let us peri<U+017F>h on that Rock; but
would <U+017F>end to our aid one of the many
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that pa<U+017F>s'd by that way. It was
a piece of good Fortune I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
yet I looked con<U+017F>tantly about to
di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ail, when at la<U+017F>t having
almo<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>t hope, having for two days
<U+017F>een nothing on the Sea, I ken'd on
the <U+017F>udden <U+017F>omething floating on the
water, but being at di<U+017F>tance, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
no <U+017F>ail, I knew not whether
to think it a Wrack, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el with Oars; yet <U+017F>eeing you
draw towards the Coa<U+017F>t, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the objects magnifying them
every moment, I knew it to be a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
that brought the <hi>Sultane<U+017F>s</hi> the
News, who was not much plea<U+017F>ed
with it, fearing the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el came from
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:103330:156"/>
                  <hi>Tunis,</hi> and being more willing to dye
on the Rock, than return thither, I
hollowed, and cry'd, and had the good
luck to be heard by you; and if I did
not pre<U+017F>ently expre<U+017F>s that joy which
might have been expected upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, you will pardon it as an
effect of the mi<U+017F>erable condition I was
reduced to, and will ea<U+017F>ily believe it
could not but be great.</p>

of all the<U+017F>e adventures, mingling <U+017F>ighs
with their joy, which increa<U+017F>ed at the
news of one of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>en</hi>'s Servants, that he
di<U+017F>cerned land, and that it could be
no other but <hi>Sardinia:</hi> He was in the
