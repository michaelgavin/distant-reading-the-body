         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ob<U+017F>erving tho<U+017F>e that are call'd <hi>Occult,</hi>
to be Subjects uncultivated enough, (at
lea<U+017F>t in the way that <U+017F>eem'd to him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,)
he propos'd to handle them more
largely than mo<U+017F>t of the re<U+017F>t; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that De<U+017F>ign he judg'd it almo<U+017F>t
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to premi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Con<U+017F>iderations
and experimental Collections <hi>about</hi> the
Nature and power of Effluviums, <hi>about</hi>
the Pores of Bodies and Figures of Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles,
and <hi>about</hi> the efficacy of <U+017F>uch Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-motions
as are wont either to be
judged very faint, or to be pa<U+017F>s'd by
unheeded. For he had often look'd upon
the<U+017F>e three Doctrines, of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> of
<hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and of <hi>Unheeded
Motions,</hi> as the three principal Keys
to the Philo<U+017F>ophy of Occult Qualities. But
having hereupon made <U+017F>uch Collections,
as upon review appear'd too large to pa<U+017F>s
for Notes on <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a
Text, he was induc'd to
draw them<note n="*" place="margin">And <U+017F>ome that were publi<U+017F>h'd <hi>An.</hi> 1669. under the Title of <hi>The Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pheres of con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent Bodies.</hi>
               </note> into the
form (they now appear

would not put him<U+017F>elf to
the trouble of doing it, with care to keep
<pb facs="tcp:44036:3"/>
them from retaiaing much of their fir<U+017F>t
want of exact Method and Connexion.
Nor was the Author <U+017F>olicitous to fini<U+017F>h
them up, in regard that his other Studies
and occa<U+017F>ions made him perceive, that
in what he had de<U+017F>ign'd about Occult
Qualities, he had cut him<U+017F>elf out more
work than probably he <U+017F>hould during many
years have opportunity to <U+017F>et upon in
earne<U+017F>t, and complete. And in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the<U+017F>e Papers lay for divers years,
(as is well known to <U+017F>everal that <U+017F>aw
them, or even tran<U+017F>crib'd <U+017F>ome of them,)
and might have continued to do <U+017F>o, if
the Author had not been induc'd to let
them come abroad, <hi>partly</hi> by con<U+017F>idering,
that though the Subjects, (however he
handled them) were as well important
as curious, yet he did not find him<U+017F>elf
prevented by others in what he had to
publi<U+017F>h about them; and <hi>partly</hi> by the
References he had made to them in <U+017F>ome
other Papers, that he had promi<U+017F>ed his
Friends, wherein <U+017F>everal things here
deliver'd are vouched, and others <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
And becau<U+017F>e the Notes concerning
the Poro<U+017F>ity of greater Bodies and the
<pb facs="tcp:44036:4"/>
Figurations of minute Particles, together
with the Paper about unregarded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
having been long laid a<U+017F>ide among
other neglected papers, were <U+017F>ome of
them mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, and others <U+017F>o mis-us'd,
that they could not ea<U+017F>ily be made ready
to accompany tho<U+017F>e that now come abroad;
the Author, that he might keep this
Book from having its dimen<U+017F>ions too di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate,
was content to add to the
thickne<U+017F>s of it, by <U+017F>ubjoyning one of tho<U+017F>e
little Tracts, that lay by him, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Flame,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of the Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the preceding Doctrine about <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums</hi>
in general, and Experiments
that <U+017F>hew in particular the Subtilty and
the Efficacy of tho<U+017F>e of Fire and Flame. And
though, to that Tract it <U+017F>elf, there belong
another, de<U+017F>ign'd to examine, Whether the
matter of what we call the <hi>Sun-beams,</hi>
may be brought to be ponderable; yet
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing this, hitherto cold and wet
Summer, to be like to be as unfriendly
to the Tryals to be made with Burning-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es
as of late years <U+017F>ome other Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
have prov'd, he was ea<U+017F>ily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with, not to make tho<U+017F>e Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

what I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
on another

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:9"/>
That Silver, who<U+017F>e Ductility and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctility
are very much inferiour to
tho<U+017F>e of Gold, was, by my procuring,
drawn out to <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender a Wire, that,
when we mea<U+017F>ur'd it, which was
<U+017F>omewhat trouble<U+017F>om to do, with a
long and accurate mea<U+017F>ure, we found,
that eight Yards of it did not yet
fully counterpoi<U+017F>e one Grain: So that
we might add a Grain more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making the Scale, wherein 'twas
put, manife<U+017F>tly preponderate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
the Tenderne<U+017F>s of the
Ballance. Whence we concluded,
that a <U+017F>ingle Grain of this Wire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to 27 Foot, that is, 324
Inches. And <U+017F>ince Experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that half an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Inch can
by Diagonal Lines be divided into 100
parts great enough to be ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd,
even for Mechanical u<U+017F>es, it
follows, that a Grain of this wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
Silver may be divided into
64800 parts, and yet each of the<U+017F>e
will be a true metalline, though but
<U+017F>lender and <U+017F>hort, Cylinder, which we
may very well conceive to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44036:9"/>
yet of a multitude of minuter parts.
For though I could procure no Gilt
Wire near <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender as our newly
mention'd Silver-wire; yet I tryed
that <U+017F>ome which I had by me was
<U+017F>mall enough to make one Grain of
it fourteen foot long: At which
rate an Ounce did amount to a full
Mile, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of 1000 Geometrical
Paces, (of 5 foot a-piece,) and 720
foot over and above. And if now
it be permitted to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Wire
to have been, as in probability it
might have been, further drawn out
to the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd
Silver-wire, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
will <U+017F>till be far more con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
for in this ca<U+017F>e, each of tho<U+017F>e
little Cylinders, of which 64800 go
to the making of one Grain, will have
a <U+017F>uperficial <hi>Area,</hi> which, except at
the <hi>Ba<U+017F>is,</hi> will be cover'd with a Ca<U+017F>e
of Gold; which is not only <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from it by a mental Operation,
but perhaps al<U+017F>o by a Chymical one.
For I remember, that from very <U+017F>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
gilt Wire, though I could get
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44036:10"/>
none <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender as this of meer Silver,
I did more than once, for Curio<U+017F>ities
<U+017F>ake, <U+017F>o get out the Silver, that the
golden Films, whil<U+017F>t they were in a
Liquor that plumpt them up, <U+017F>eem'd
to be <U+017F>olid wires of Gold: But when
the Liquor was withdrawn, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
(as indeed they were) to be
oblong and extremely thin and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Membranes of that Metal, which,
with an In<U+017F>trument that had been
delicate enough, might have been
ripp'd open, and di<U+017F>played, and been
made capable of further. Divi<U+017F>ions
and Subdivi<U+017F>ions. To this I <U+017F>hall
add, that each of the little <U+017F>ilver Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders
I lately <U+017F>pake of, mu<U+017F>t not only
have its little <hi>Area,</hi> but its Solidity;
and yet I <U+017F>aw no rea<U+017F>on to doubt, but
that it might be very po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, if the
Artificer had been <U+017F>o skilful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as I wi<U+017F>h'd, to have drawn the
<U+017F>ame quantity of Metal to a much
greater length, <U+017F>ince even an Animal
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is capable of being brought
to a <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s much <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing that
of our Wire, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the Truth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44036:10"/>
of an Ob<U+017F>ervation of very credible
Per<U+017F>ons critical enough in making
Experiments, which, for a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and an Improvement of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
Argument, I <U+017F>hall now <U+017F>ubjoyn.
An Ingenious Gentlewoman of my
Acquaintance, Wife to a Learned
Phy<U+017F>ician, taking much plea<U+017F>ure to
keep Silk-worms, had once the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity
to draw out one of the Oval Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
(which the Silk-worm <U+017F>pins, not,
as 'tis commonly thought, out of its
Belly, but out of the Mouth, whence
I have taken plea<U+017F>ure to draw it out
with my Fingers,) into all the Silken-wire
it was made up of, which, to
the great wonder as well of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as her <U+017F>elf, who both inform'd
me of it, appeared to be by mea<U+017F>ure
a great deal above 300 Yards, and
yet weigh'd but two Grains and a
half: <U+017F>o that each Cylindrically <U+017F>hap'd
Grain of Silk may well be reckon'd
to be at lea<U+017F>t 120 Yards long.</p>
                     <p>Another way, I remember, I al<U+017F>o
employed to help men by the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibility
of Gold the better to conceive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44036:11"/>
the Minutene<U+017F>s of the Parts of Solid
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>We took <U+017F>ix beaten Leaves of Gold,
which we mea<U+017F>ured one by one with
a Ruler purpo<U+017F>ely made for nice Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
and found them to have a
greater equality in Dimen<U+017F>ions, and
to be nearer true Squares, than could
be well expected: The <U+017F>ide of the
Square was in each of them exactly
enough three Inches and 2/8, (or 1/4,)
which number being reduc'd to a
Decimal Fraction, <hi>viz.</hi> 3125/100, and
multiplied by it <U+017F>elf, affords 10|5625/10000
for the <hi>Area,</hi> or <U+017F>uperficial Content of
each <U+017F>quare Leaf: And this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 6, the number of the Leaves,
amounts to 63|3750/10000 <U+017F>quare Inches, for
the <hi>Area</hi> of the <U+017F>ix Leaves. The<U+017F>e
being carefully weigh'd in a pair of
tender Scales, amounted all of them
to one Grain and a quarter: And <U+017F>o
one Grain of this foliated Gold was
extended to <U+017F>omewhat above fifty
Inches; which differ'd but about a
fifth part from an Experiment of the
like nature, that I remember I made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44036:11"/>
many years ago in a pair of exact
Scales; and <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a difference may
very well be imputed to that of the
pains and diligence of the Gold-Beaters,
who do not always work
with equal <U+017F>trength and skill, nor
upon equally fine and ductile Gold.</p>
                     <p>Now if we recal to mind what
I was lately <U+017F>aying of the actual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ibility
of an Inch into an hundred
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible parts, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e an Inch
<U+017F>o divided to be applied to each <U+017F>ide
of a <U+017F>quare Inch of the Leaf-Gold
newly mention'd, 'tis manife<U+017F>t that by
<U+017F>ubtle parallel Lines, drawn between
all the oppo<U+017F>ite Points, a Grain of
Gold mu<U+017F>t be divi<U+017F>ible into five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thou<U+017F>and little Squares, very
minute indeed, but yet di<U+017F>cernible by
a <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>harp-<U+017F>ighted Eye. And
if we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e an Inch to be divided
into two hundred parts, as I lately told
you it was in a Ruler I employ, then,
according to the newly recited way,
the number of the Squares, into which
a <U+017F>ingle Grain is capable of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
will amount to no le<U+017F>s than two
Millions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:12"/>
There is yet another way that I
took to <U+017F>hew, that the exten<U+017F>ibility,
and con<U+017F>equently the divi<U+017F>iblene<U+017F>s of
Gold is probably far more wonderful,
than by the lately mention'd Tryal
it appears.</p>
                     <p>For this purpo<U+017F>e I went to a great
Refiner, whom I u<U+017F>ed to deal with
for purify'd Gold and Silver, and
inquir'd of him, how many Grains of
Leaf-Gold he was wont to allow to
an Ounce of Silver, when it was
to be drawn into gilt Wire as <U+017F>lender
as an Hair? To this he an<U+017F>wer'd
me, that eight Grains was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
he allowed to an Ounce
when the Wire was to be well gilt;
but if it were to be more <U+017F>lightly
gilt, <U+017F>ix Grains would <U+017F>erve the turn.
And to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd
by a skilful Wire-drawer.
And I remember, that de<U+017F>iring the
Refiner to <U+017F>hew me an Ingot of Silver,
as he did at fir<U+017F>t gild it; he <U+017F>hew'd
me a good fair Cylindrical Bar,
whereon the Leaf-Gold, that overlaid
the <U+017F>urface, did not appear to be by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:12"/>
odds <U+017F>o thick as fine <hi>Venetian</hi> Paper;
and yet comparing this with gilt
Wire, which I al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee,
the Wire appeared to be the better
gilt of the two; po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly becau<U+017F>e the
Gold in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the various
Holes, was by the <U+017F>ides of them not
only extended but poli<U+017F>hed, which
made it look more vividly than the
unpoli<U+017F>h'd Leaves that gilded the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>
                     <p>So that, if we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e an Ounce
of the gilt Wire formerly mention'd
to have been gilt with <U+017F>ix Grains of
Leaf-Gold, it will appear by an ea<U+017F>ie
calculation, that at this rate one
Ounce of Gold, employ'd on gilding
Wire of that <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s, would reach
between ninety and an hundred Miles.
But if now we further <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, as
we lately did, that the <U+017F>lender Silver-wire,
mention'd at the beginning of
this Chapter, were gilt; though we
<U+017F>hould allow it to have (becau<U+017F>e of
its exceeding <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s,) not, (as
the former) 6 Grains, but 8 Grains
of Leaf-Gold to an Ounce of Siver,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:13"/>
it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledged, that an
hollow Cylinder or <U+017F>heath of Gold
weighing but eight Grains, may be
<U+017F>o <U+017F>tretch'd, that 'twill reach to no
le<U+017F>s than 60 times as much (in weight)
of Silver-wire as it covers: [I <U+017F>aid
60 times, for <U+017F>o often is 8 contain'd
in 480, the number of Grains in an
Ounce;] and con<U+017F>equently (a Grain
of <hi>that</hi> Wire having been found to
be 27 foot long,) the Ounce of Gold
would reach to <U+017F>even hundred <U+017F>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<U+017F>even thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ix hundred foot,
that is, an hundred fifty five Miles and
above a half. And if we yet further
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e this <U+017F>uperficial or hollow
Cylinder of Gold to be <U+017F>lit all along,
and cut into as <U+017F>lender li<U+017F>ts or

a multitude of manife<U+017F>tly vi<U+017F>ible
Corpu<U+017F>cles, I thought upon, and
more than once try'd, the rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it into Vapors by help of an
<hi>Aeolipile,</hi> wherein, when I made the
Experiment the la<U+017F>t time, I took the
pains to regi<U+017F>ter the Event as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>We put an Ounce of common
Water into an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> and having
put it upon a Cha<U+017F>ing-di<U+017F>h of coals,
we ob<U+017F>erv'd the time when the
<U+017F>treams of Vapors began to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t.
This <U+017F>tream was for a good
while impetuous enough, as appear'd
by the noi<U+017F>e it made, which would
be much increa<U+017F>ed, if we applied to
it at a convenient di<U+017F>tance a kindled
brand, in which it would blow up
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:14"/>
the fire very vehemently. The <U+017F>tream
continued about a quarter of an hour
(<U+017F>ixteen minutes or better,) but
afterwards the Wind had pau<U+017F>es and
gu<U+017F>ts for two or three minutes before
it quite cea<U+017F>ed. And by rea<U+017F>on of
the <U+017F>hape of the <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fram'd chiefly for other purpo<U+017F>es,
was not <U+017F>o convenient for this) a
great portion of the Vapors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd
in the upper part of it, and
fell down in drops; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing
that they al<U+017F>o had come out in the
form of Wind, and the bla<U+017F>t had not
been intermitted toward the latter
end, I gue<U+017F>s'd it might have continued
uninterruptedly 18 or 20 minutes.
<hi>Note,</hi> That applying a mea<U+017F>ure to

                     <p>After the rarefaction of Water

but one in<U+017F>tance, and that
very ea<U+017F>ie to be tryed; of which I

                     </p>
                     <p>Having oftentimes burnt Spirit of
Wine, and al<U+017F>o Oyl in Gla<U+017F>s-lamps,
that for certain u<U+017F>es were <U+017F>o made,
that the <U+017F>urface of the Liquor was
<U+017F>till circular, 'twas obvious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve,
how little the Liquor would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:15"/>
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>ide by the wa<U+017F>t that was made
of it, in about half a quarter of an

the naked Eye after <U+017F>ome Exerci<U+017F>e,
may, as I have often tryed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cern
the motions of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> that
<U+017F>wings fa<U+017F>t enough to divide a <U+017F>ingle
minute of an hour into 240 parts,
and con<U+017F>equently half a quarter of an

into how many parts of the
time imployed by a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,
<U+017F>low enough to be di<U+017F>cerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the Eye, may be mentally
<U+017F>ubdivided; and if we further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider,
that without intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the
Oyl is preyed upon by an actual
Flame, and the particles of it do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
furni<U+017F>h a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>tream
of <U+017F>hining matter, that with a
<U+017F>trange celerity is always flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
we may very well conceive,
that tho<U+017F>e parts of Flame into which
the Oyl is turned, are <U+017F>tupendiou<U+017F>ly
minute, <U+017F>ince, though the wa<U+017F>ting
of the Oyl is in its progre<U+017F>s too <U+017F>low
to be perceived by the Eye, yet 'tis
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:16"/>
undoubted that there is a continual
decrement of the depth of the Oyl,
the Phy<U+017F>ical <U+017F>urfaces whereof are
continually and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and turn'd into flame; and the
<U+017F>trange <U+017F>ubtilty of the Corpu<U+017F>cles of
flame would be much the <U+017F>tronglier
argued, if we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of common Oyl the flame were
nouri<U+017F>h'd by a fewel <U+017F>o much more
compact and durable, as is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance made of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
Body, of who<U+017F>e la<U+017F>tingne<U+017F>s
I have el<U+017F>ewhere made
particular mention,<note place="margin">In <U+017F>ome Papers about <hi>Flame.</hi>
                        </note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having taught the
way of preparing it.</p>
                     <p>Having in a pair of tender Scales
carefully weigh'd out half a Grain
of good Gunpowder, we laid it on
a piece of Tile, and whelm'd over it
a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of gla<U+017F>s (el<U+017F>ewhere de<U+017F>crib'd,
and often mention'd) with a Bra<U+017F>s-plate
to cover the upper orifice of it.
Then having fir'd the Gunpowder,
we ob<U+017F>erv'd that the <U+017F>moak of it did
opacate, and as to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e <U+017F>o fill the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44036:16"/>
whole cavity of the Gla<U+017F>s, though
its <hi>Ba<U+017F>is</hi> were eight inches, its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
height above twenty
inches, and its figure far more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
than if it were conical, and
this <U+017F>moak, not containing it <U+017F>elf
within the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out at two or
three little intervals, that were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
left between the orifice of the
ve<U+017F><U+017F>el and the plate that lay upon it.
This cover we then remov'd, that
we might ob<U+017F>erve how long the
<U+017F>moak would continue to a<U+017F>cend;
which we found it would do for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half a quarter of an hour, and
during near half that time, <hi>(viz.</hi> the
three fir<U+017F>t minutes) the continually
a<U+017F>cending <U+017F>moak <U+017F>eem'd to be, at its
going out, of the <U+017F>ame Diameter with
the orifice at which it i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd; and it
would a<U+017F>cend <U+017F>ometimes a foot, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
half a yard, <U+017F>ometimes two
foot or more into the Air, before it
would di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e and vani<U+017F>h into it.</p>
                     <p>Now if we con<U+017F>ider, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of this round Orifice was two
inches in Diameter, how many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44036:17"/>
of vi<U+017F>ible Corpu<U+017F>cles may we
ea<U+017F>ily conceive throng'd out at <U+017F>o
large an out-let in the time above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
<U+017F>ince they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
thru<U+017F>ting one another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
And into <U+017F>o many vi<U+017F>ible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <U+017F>moak mu<U+017F>t we admit, that
the half Grain of Powder was <U+017F>hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
be<U+017F>ide tho<U+017F>e multitudes, which,
having been turn'd into actual flame,
may probably be <U+017F>uppos'd to have
<U+017F>uffer'd a comminution, that made
them become invi<U+017F>ible. And though
I <U+017F>hall not attempt <U+017F>o hopele<U+017F>s a
work, as to compute the number of
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall Particles, yet to make an
e<U+017F>timate whereby it would appear to
be exceeding great, I thought fit to
con<U+017F>ider, how great the Proportion
was between the <U+017F>paces, that to the
Eye appear'd all full of <U+017F>moak, and
the dimen<U+017F>ions of the Powder that
was re<U+017F>olv'd into that <U+017F>moak. Cau<U+017F>ing
then the Gla<U+017F>s to be fill'd with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, we found it to contain
above two and twenty Pints of that
liquor, and cau<U+017F>ing one of tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44036:17"/>
mea<U+017F>ures to be weigh'd, it was found
to weigh <U+017F>o near a pound (of <U+017F>ixteen
ounces,) that the computation of the
whole Water amounted to at lea<U+017F>t
160000 grains, and con<U+017F>equently
320000 half grains. To which if
we add, that this Gunpowder would
readily <U+017F>ink to the bottom of Water,
as being (by rea<U+017F>on of the Saltpeter
and Brim<U+017F>tone, that make up at lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ix parts of <U+017F>even of it) <hi>in <U+017F>pecie</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than it, and in likelyhood twice
as heavy, (for 'tis not ea<U+017F>ie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it exactly,) we may probably
gue<U+017F>s the <U+017F>pace to which the <U+017F>moak
reach'd to exceed 500000 times that,
which contain'd the unfir'd Powder;
and this, though the <U+017F>moak, being
confin'd in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, was thereby
kept from diffu<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far as
by its <U+017F>treaming out it <U+017F>eem'd likely
that it would have done.</p>
                     <p>To the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>tances from Inanimate
Bodies I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ubjoyn one more
taken from Animals. Whereas then
men have with Rea<U+017F>on wonder'd,
that <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a Body as a Chee<U+017F>e-mite,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:18"/>
which by the naked Eye is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not to be taken notice of, unle<U+017F>s
it move, (if even then it be <U+017F>o,) <U+017F>hould
by the Micro<U+017F>cope appear to be an
Animal furni<U+017F>h'd with all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
parts; whereas this, I <U+017F>ay, has given
ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to conclude, that the
Corpu<U+017F>cles that make up the parts
of <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall an Animal, mu<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
be extremely <U+017F>mall; I think
the Argument may be much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the following Con<U+017F>ideration.
Tho<U+017F>e that have had the Curio<U+017F>ity to
open from time to time Eggs that
are <U+017F>at upon by a hatching Hen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but have ob<U+017F>erved, how <U+017F>mall
a proportion in reference to the bulk
of the whole Egg the Chick bears;
when that, which the Excellent <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
calls <hi>Punctum <U+017F>aliens,</hi> di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>es the
motion of the Heart, and the colour
of the Blood; and that even about
the <U+017F>eventh or eighth day the whole
Chick now vi<U+017F>ibly form'd, bears
no great proportion to the whole
Egg, which is to <U+017F>upply it with
Aliment, not only for its nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:18"/>
but <U+017F>peedy growth for many
days after.</p>
                     <p>To apply this now to the matter
in hand, having <U+017F>everal times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
and <U+017F>hewn to others, that
Chee<U+017F>e-mites them<U+017F>elves are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Eggs, if we conceive, that in
the<U+017F>e Eggs, as in ordinary one, the
Animal at its fir<U+017F>t formation bears
but a <U+017F>mall proportion to the bulk of
the whole Egg, the remaining part
being to <U+017F>uffice for the food and
growth of the <hi>Embryo</hi> probably for
a pretty while; <U+017F>ince, if an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
per<U+017F>on, that I de<U+017F>ired to watch
them, did not mis-inform me, they
u<U+017F>ed to be about ten or twelve days
in hatching; this whole Egg it <U+017F>elf
will be allowed to be but little in
reference to the Mite it came from,
how extremely and unimaginably
minute may we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e parts
to be, that make up the Alimental
Liquors, and even the Spirits, that
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Nerves or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
parts, <U+017F>erve to move the Limbs
and Sen<U+017F>ories of but, as it were,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:19"/>
the Model of <U+017F>uch an Animal, as,
when it re<U+017F>ts, would not (perhaps)
it <U+017F>elf to the naked Eye be <U+017F>o much
as vi<U+017F>ible; and in which we may
pre<U+017F>ume the nobler <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>tabler
parts to be of an amazing <U+017F>lender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
if we con<U+017F>ider, that, though in
other hairy Animals, the Optick or
<U+017F>ome other of the larger Nerves do,
I know not how many times, in
thickne<U+017F>s and circuit <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s a hair
of the <U+017F>ame Animal; yet in a Chee<U+017F>e-Mite,
though none of the large<U+017F>t of
tho<U+017F>e Creatures, we have divers
times manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>een, as is before
intimated, <U+017F>ingle Hairs that grow
upon the Legs.</p>
                     <p>Another way there is, that I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to give men cau<U+017F>e to think,
that the invi<U+017F>ible <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Bodies
that wander through the Air may
be <U+017F>trangely minute; and this was,
by <U+017F>hewing how <U+017F>mall a fragment of
matter may be re<U+017F>olved into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
minute enough to a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves

<U+017F>o much more den<U+017F>e than Air, as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:19"/>
Water is, as to impart a determinate

<hi>Colours</hi> may inform you; but I <U+017F>hall

the palene<U+017F>s of the native colour of
the Gold may make it in the end le<U+017F>s
con<U+017F>picuous, though, if I had then
had by me a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> as I <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had, that would di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Gold
blood-red, perhaps the experiment
with Gold would have <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s'd that,
which 'tis now time I <U+017F>hould begin
to relate, as <U+017F>oon as I have hinted
to you by the way, that, for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<U+017F>ake, I made a tryal with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
calcin'd <hi>per <U+017F>e,</hi> that I might not
be accu<U+017F>ed of having omitted to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:20"/>
employ a Metal who<U+017F>e Body Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e to be much opened by
Calcination. And though the event
were notable even in Compari<U+017F>on of
that of the experiment made with
<hi>Cocheneel,</hi> yet my conjectures inclin'd
me much to preferr the way de<U+017F>crib'd
in the following Account.</p>
                     <p>We carefully weigh'd out in a pair
of tender Scales one grain of Copper
not-calcin'd, but barely fil'd; and
becau<U+017F>e, as we made choice of this
Metal for its yielding in mo<U+017F>t <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums</hi>
a Blew, which is a deep and
con<U+017F>picuous colour; we al<U+017F>o cho<U+017F>e
to make a <U+017F>olution, not in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>
or <hi>Aqua regis,</hi> but the Spirit of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi>
(as that is an urinous Spirit,)
having found by former tryals, that
this <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> would give a far deeper
<U+017F>olution than either of the others.
This lovely Liquor, of which we us'd
a good proportion, that all the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
might be throughly di<U+017F><U+017F>olved,
we put into a tall cylindrical Gla<U+017F>s
of about four inches in Diameter,
and by degrees pour'd to it of di<U+017F>till'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:20"/>
Water, which is more proper in this
ca<U+017F>e than common Water, which
has oftentimes an inconvenient Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s,
'till we had almo<U+017F>t fill'd the
Gla<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>aw the colour grow <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pale, without being too dilute
to be manife<U+017F>t; and then we warily
pour'd this liquor into a conical
Gla<U+017F>s, that it might be the more
ea<U+017F>ie to fill the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>everal times to
the <U+017F>ame height. This conical Gla<U+017F>s
we filled to a certain mark four times
con<U+017F>ecutively, weighing it, and the
liquor too, as often in a pair of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Scales purpo<U+017F>ely made for Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
experiments, and which, though
<U+017F>trong enough to weigh <U+017F>ome pounds
in each Scale, would, when not too
much loaden, turn with about one
grain. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal weights of the
Gla<U+017F>s, together with the contained
liquor, we added together, and then
carefully weighing the empty Gla<U+017F>s
again, we deducted four times its
weight from the above-mentioned
<U+017F>umm, and thereby found the weight
of the liquor alone, to be that, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44036:21"/>
reduc'd to grains amounted to 28534;
<U+017F>o that a grain of Copper, which is
not full half <U+017F>o heavy <hi>in <U+017F>pecie</hi> as fine
Gold, communicated a Tincture to
28534 times its weight.</p>
                     <p>But now if you plea<U+017F>e to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the <U+017F>cope of my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to <U+017F>hew, into what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of parts one grain of Copper
might be divided, you will allow
me to con<U+017F>ider, as I did, that this
multitude of parts mu<U+017F>t be e<U+017F>timated
by the Proportion, not <U+017F>o much in
weight as in bulk, of the tinging
Metal to the tinged Liquor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently,
<U+017F>ince that divers Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tatical
tryals have inform'd me, that
the weight of Copper to the weight
of Water of the <U+017F>ame bulk is <hi>proximè</hi>
as 9 to 1, a grain-weight of Copper
is in bigne<U+017F>s but the ninth part of as
much Water as weighs a grain; and
<U+017F>o the formerly mention'd number of
the grains of Water mu<U+017F>t be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 9, to give us the Proportion
between the tinging and tinged Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that is, that a <U+017F>ingle grain of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44036:21"/>
Copper gave a blewne<U+017F>s to above
256806 parts of limpid Water, each
of them as big as it. Which, though
it may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>tupendious, and <U+017F>carce
credible; yet I thought fit to pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Experiment <U+017F>omewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by pouring all the liquor out
of the tall cylindrical Gla<U+017F>s into
another clean ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, whence filling
the conical Gla<U+017F>s twice, and emptying
it as often into the <U+017F>ame cylindrical
Gla<U+017F>s, the third time I fill'd the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Gla<U+017F>s with colourle<U+017F>s di<U+017F>till'd
Water, and pouring that al<U+017F>o into
the cylindrical Gla<U+017F>s, we found the
mixt liquor to have yet a manife<U+017F>t,
though but a pale, blewne<U+017F>s. And,
la<U+017F>tly, throwing away what was in
the cylindrical Gla<U+017F>s, we poured into
it, out of the <U+017F>ame conical Gla<U+017F>s, equal
parts of di<U+017F>till'd colourle<U+017F>s Water,
and of the tincted Liquor we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<U+017F>et apart in the clean Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
and found, that, though the colour
were very faint and dilute, yet an
attentive Eye could ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cern it
to be blewi<U+017F>h; and <U+017F>o it was judg'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44036:22"/>
by an intelligent Stranger that was
brought in to look upon it, and was
de<U+017F>ir'd to di<U+017F>cover of what colour he
thought it to be. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that one grain of Copper was
able to impart a colour to above
double the quantity of Water above
mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment I have allow'd
my <U+017F>elf to be the longer and more

though I have not tryed this in all
<U+017F>orts, yet having tryed it in Metals
them<U+017F>elves, I am apt to think, the
general Rule admits of very few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
e<U+017F>pecially, if that can be
fully made out, which is affirm'd
about the perviou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of Gla<U+017F>s to
the Effluxions of the Load<U+017F>tone.
For, not only Gla<U+017F>s is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be as clo<U+017F>e a Body as any is,
but (which weighs more with me)
I have by Tryals purpo<U+017F>ely made,
had occa<U+017F>ion to admire the clo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s
of very thin pieces of Gla<U+017F>s. But
the rea<U+017F>on why I ju<U+017F>t now expre<U+017F>s'd
my <U+017F>elf with an <hi>If,</hi> was, becau<U+017F>e I
was not entirely <U+017F>atisfied with the
Proof wont to be acquie<U+017F>c'd in, of
the perviou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of Gla<U+017F>s; namely,
that in Dials and Sea-Compa<U+017F><U+017F>es that
are cover'd with plates of Gla<U+017F>s, the
Needle may be readily moved to and
fro by a Load<U+017F>tone held over it. For
the<U+017F>e Plates being commonly but
fa<U+017F>ten'd on with Wax, or at be<U+017F>t
with Cement, a Sceptick may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that the magnetical <hi>Effluvia</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:25"/>
pa<U+017F>s not through the Gla<U+017F>s, but
through that much more pervious
matter, that is imployed to <U+017F>ecure the
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ures, only from the acce<U+017F>s
of the Air. To put then the matter
pa<U+017F>t doubt, I cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome Needles to
be Hermetically <U+017F>eal'd up in Gla<U+017F>s-pipes,
which being laid upon the
<U+017F>urface of water (whereon by rea<U+017F>on
of the bigne<U+017F>s of the Cavities they
would lightly float,) the included
Needles did not only readily feel the
virtue of an externally applied Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone,
(though but a weak one) but
complied with it <U+017F>o well, that I could
ea<U+017F>ily, by the help of the Needle, lead,
without touching it, the whole Pipe,
this was <U+017F>hut up in, to what part of
the <U+017F>urface of the water I plea<U+017F>ed. And
I al<U+017F>o found, that by applying a better
Load<U+017F>tone to the upper part of a <U+017F>ealed
Pipe, and a Needle in it, I could make
the Needle leap up from the lower
part as near to the Load<U+017F>tone as the
interpo<U+017F>ed Gla<U+017F>s would give it leave.</p>
                     <p>But I thought it would be more
con<U+017F>iderable, to manife<U+017F>t that the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:25"/>
Magnetical <hi>Effluvia,</hi> even of <U+017F>uch a
dull Body, as the Globe of the Earth,
would al<U+017F>o penetrate Gla<U+017F>s. And
though this <U+017F>eem difficult to be tryed,
becau<U+017F>e no ordinary Load<U+017F>tone, nor
any Iron touch'd by it, was to be
imployed to work on the included
Iron; yet I thought fit to attempt it
after this manner: I took a cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
piece of Iron of about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of ones little finger, and between
half a foot and foot long, (for I had
formerly ob<U+017F>erved, that the quantity
of unexcited Iron furthers its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon excited Needles,) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Hermetically <U+017F>eal'd it up in a
Gla<U+017F>s-pipe but very little longer than
it; I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, that if I held it in a
perpendicular po<U+017F>ture; the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, penetrating
the Gla<U+017F>s, would make the lower
extreme of the Iron an<U+017F>werable to the
North Pole; and therefore having
applied this to the point of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in a Dial, or Sea-Compa<U+017F>s, that
look'd toward the North, (for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
mean not all the <U+017F>ame thing by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44036:26"/>
the Northern Pole of a Needle or
Load<U+017F>tone,) I pre<U+017F>um'd it would,
according to the Laws Magnetical
(el<U+017F>ewhere mention'd) drive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which accordingly it did.
And having for farther tryal inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the included Iron, (<U+017F>o that the
end which was formerly the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermo<U+017F>t,
was now the uppermo<U+017F>t)
and held it in a perpendicular po<U+017F>ture
ju<U+017F>t under the <U+017F>ame point of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
that extreme of the Iron-rod,
which before had driven away this
point, being by this inver<U+017F>ion become
(in a manner) a South-Pole, did (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <U+017F>ame Laws) attract it:
By which <U+017F>udden change of Poles,
meerly upon the change of <U+017F>ituation,
it al<U+017F>o appear'd, that the Iron ow'd
its Virtue only to the Magneti<U+017F>m of
the Earth, not that of another Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone,

how one Body <U+017F>hould communicate to
another a <U+017F>olitary and naked Quality,
unaccompanied by any thing Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
to <U+017F>upport and convey it. But I
would not have you think, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi>
that the only matter of fact I have to
countenance this notion, is that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
which has convinc'd divers
Chymi<U+017F>ts and Phy<U+017F>icians, otherwi<U+017F>e
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44036:27"/>
not friends to the Corpu<U+017F>cular Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy,
that Medicines may operate
without any con<U+017F>umption of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves.
For, <hi>though</hi> divers of the<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>ome of them Learned men, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
written, that <hi>Gla<U+017F>s of Antimony</hi>
and <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> being either of
them infus'd in a great proportion of
Wine, will make it vomitive; and
if that liquor be poured off, and new
be poured on, every new portion of
<U+017F>uch liquor will be impregnated with
the <U+017F>ame virtue, and this though the
liquor be chang'd a thou<U+017F>and times,
and yet the <hi>Antimonial Gla<U+017F>s</hi> or <hi>Crocus</hi>
will continue the <U+017F>ame as well in

<hi>Helmont</hi> <U+017F>peaks of <U+017F>ome of his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi>
by irradiation: <hi>Yet,</hi> I confe<U+017F>s,
I have <U+017F>ome doubts, whether the
Experiment have been competently
tryed, and <U+017F>hall not fully acquie<U+017F>ce
in what has been <U+017F>aid, till <U+017F>ome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Experimenter deliver it upon his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44036:27"/>
own Tryal, and acquaint us too, with
what In<U+017F>truments and what Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pection
he made it. For, be<U+017F>ides
that the Ingeniou<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>icians I
have que<U+017F>tion'd about it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Ta<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ometimes the
Colour of the Wine to be alter'd by
the infus'd Mineral, I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie<U+017F>ce
in the affirmation of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Chymi<U+017F>t or Apothecary, or even
Phy<U+017F>ician, if he <U+017F>hould barely averr,
that he had weigh'd an Antimonial
Medicine before 'twas put to infu<U+017F>e,
and after the infu<U+017F>ion ended, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
no decrement of weight. For
I have had too much experience (as
I el<U+017F>ewhere mention) of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of making exact Statical tryals;
not to know, that <U+017F>uch Scales, as are
wont to be imployed by Chymi<U+017F>ts
and Apothecaries in weighing Drugs,
are by no means fit to make tryals
with the nicety which that I am
<U+017F>peaking of requires: It being ea<U+017F>ie,
even with the better <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>uch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate
Scales, e<U+017F>pecially if they be
not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended from <U+017F>ome fixt thing,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44036:28"/>
but held with the hand, to mi<U+017F>take
half a grain or a grain; and perhaps
a greater quantity, and at lea<U+017F>t more
than by divers of the Experiments of
this E<U+017F><U+017F>ay appears nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be
<U+017F>pent upon the impregnating of a
con<U+017F>iderable proportion of Liquor
with Corporeal Effluxions. Be<U+017F>ides,
that if, when the beaten <hi>Crocus</hi> or
<hi>Gla<U+017F>s</hi> be taken out of the Wine to be
weigh'd again, the Experimenter be
not cautious enough to make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for the Liquor that will adhere
to the Medicament, 'tis plain that he
may take notice of no decrement of
weight, though there may be really
<hi>Effluviums</hi> of the Mineral amounting
to <U+017F>everal grains, imbib'd by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
And though he be aware of
this, and dry the powder, yet 'tis
not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie, even for a skilful man,
to be <U+017F>ure that none of the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cous
particles of the Liquor <U+017F>tick to
the Mineral, and being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible upon
the Ballance, though not to the Eye
or Hand, repair the rece<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e
emetick Corpu<U+017F>cles that diffus'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44036:28"/>
them<U+017F>elves into the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum.</hi> And
the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e difficulties put me
upon the attempting to make <U+017F>o no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Experiment with excellent
Scales, and the care that it de<U+017F>erves:
But after a long tryal, an unlucky
accident fru<U+017F>trated at la<U+017F>t my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
But though, till competent
Relators give us an account of this
matter upon their own tryal, and
repeat the Infu<U+017F>ion very much oftener,
than, for ought I find, any man has
yet done, I mu<U+017F>t not acquie<U+017F>ce in all
that is <U+017F>aid of the Impregnation of
Wine or other Liquors by <hi>Antimonial
Gla<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> yet that
after divers repeated Infu<U+017F>ions the
Mineral <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
dimini<U+017F>h'd in bulk or virtue,
may well <U+017F>uffice to make this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
though not the only or chief
that may be brought for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
yet a pertinent one to it. For
that there is a powerful Emetick Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
imparted to the Liquor, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t
by experience; and that the
Mineral does not impart this virtue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44036:29"/>
as 'twere by irradiation, but by <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantial
effluxion, <U+017F>eems to me very
probable; not only becau<U+017F>e I conceive
not, how this can be done otherwi<U+017F>e,
but becau<U+017F>e, as 'tis noted above, the
Wine does oftentimes change colour
by being kept a competent time upon
the Mineral, as if it drew thence a
Tincture; and even when it is not
di<U+017F>colour'd, I think it un<U+017F>afe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> has not
wrought upon it. For I have kept
good Spirit of Vinegar for a con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time upon finely powder'd
Gla<U+017F>s of Antimony made <hi>per <U+017F>e,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding the Spirit to be at all
ting'd, though 'tis known, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial
Gla<U+017F>s is <U+017F>oluble in Spirit of
Vinegar, as mine afterwards appear'd
to be, by a longer dige<U+017F>tion in the
<U+017F>ame Liquor. But there may be a
great number of minute particles di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
in the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> before they
be numerous enough to change the
Colour of it. And with this agrees
very well what is ob<U+017F>erv'd, That
though too great a quantity of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44036:29"/>
prepar'd Antimony be put into the
liquor, yet it will not be thereby
made too <U+017F>trongly Emetick. For the
Wine, being a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> will, like
other <hi>Men<U+017F>truums,</hi> be impregnated but
to a certain mea<U+017F>ure, without di<U+017F><U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the overplus of the matter that
is put into it. And <hi>Mars,</hi> which is
a harder and heavier body than Gla<U+017F>s
of Antimony, is it <U+017F>elf in part <U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in good <hi>Rheni<U+017F>h</hi> or other white
Wine, (and that in no long time,)
and <U+017F>ometimes even in Water.</p>
                     <p>I do not therefore reject the Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Infu<U+017F>ion, as unfit to have a place
in this Chapter, but till the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been a little more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
made, I think it inferiour, as
to our purpo<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
to be met with in the next
Chapter, and perhaps al<U+017F>o to that
mention'd by <hi>Helmont,</hi> and tryed by
more than one of my Acquaintance,
concerning the Virtue of killing
Worms, that Mercury imparts to
the water or wine wherein it has

<U+017F>ome other things, Chymical and
Philo<U+017F>ophical, keep me from being of
their opinion, who think that in this
ca<U+017F>e the Mercury impregnates the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
as it were by Irradiation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in a Corporeal manner, yet
the Eye does not perceive, that even
limpid water takes any thing from
clean and well purg'd Mercury,
which we know that divers corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
liquors them<U+017F>elves will not work
upon.</p>
                     <p>To this In<U+017F>tance I mu<U+017F>t add one
that is yet freer from exceptions,
which is, that having for Curio<U+017F>ity
<U+017F>ake <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in a pair of exact
Scales, that would turn with a very
<U+017F>mall part of a grain, a piece of
<hi>Amber-greece</hi> bigger than a Walnut,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44036:30"/>
and weighing betwixt an hundred and
<U+017F>ix-<U+017F>core grains, I could not in three
days and a half that I had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to make the tryal, di<U+017F>cover, even
upon that Ballance, any decrement
of weight in the <hi>Amber-greece;</hi> though
<U+017F>o rich a perfume, lying in the open
Air, was like in that time to have
parted with good <U+017F>tore of odoriferous
Steams. And a while after <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Lump of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>a foetida</hi> five days
and a half, I found it not to have <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain'd
any di<U+017F>cernible lo<U+017F>s of weight,
though, in <U+017F>pite of the unfavourable
cold weather, it had about it a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Atmo<U+017F>phere repleni<U+017F>h'd with
foetid exhalations. And when twelve
or fourteen hours after, perhaps upon
<U+017F>ome change of weather, I came to
look upon it, though I found that
in that time the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> was
<U+017F>omewhat alter'd, yet the whole Lump
had not lo<U+017F>t half a quarter of a grain;
which induc'd me to think, that
there may perhaps be Steams di<U+017F>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible
even by our No<U+017F>trils, that are
far more <U+017F>ubtil than the odorous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44036:31"/>
exhalations of Spices them<U+017F>elves.
For, having in very good Scales <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pended
in the Month of <hi>March</hi> an
ounce of Nutmegs, it lo<U+017F>t in about
<U+017F>ix days five grains and a half. And
an ounce of Cloves in the <U+017F>ame time
lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>even grains and five eigths.</p>
                     <p>You will perhaps wonder, why I
do not preferr to the In<U+017F>tances I make
mention of in this Chapter, that
which may be afforded by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone,
that is acknowledg'd conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to emit multitudes of Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Steams without decrement of
weight. But though I have not
thought fit to pa<U+017F>s this wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<U+017F>ilence; yet I forbear to lay <U+017F>o
much <U+017F>tre<U+017F>s on it, not only becau<U+017F>e
my Ballances have not yet <U+017F>atisfied
me about the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Load<U+017F>tones,
(for I take them not all to be equally
diffu<U+017F>ive of their Particles;) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I fore<U+017F>ee it may be doubted,
<hi>whether</hi> Load<U+017F>tones, like odorous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
do furni<U+017F>h afre<U+017F>h of their own,
all the Corpu<U+017F>cles<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that from time to
time i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from them? <hi>Or,</hi> whether
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:31"/>
they be not continually repaired,
<hi>partly</hi> by the return of the Magnetical
Particles to one Pole that <U+017F>allied out
of the other; and <hi>partly</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of Magnetical matter
(<U+017F>upplied by the Earth or other
Mundane Bodies) it make the Pores
or Channels of the Load<U+017F>tone their
con<U+017F>tant Thorow-fares.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but it will make it
more probable, that a <U+017F>mall Quantity
of matter being <U+017F>catter'd into invi<U+017F>ible
<hi>Effluvia</hi> may be exceedingly rarified
and expanded, if it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that this little portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>hall, for a con<U+017F>iderable time,
emit multitudes of vi<U+017F>ible parts, and
that in <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e an order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
as to <U+017F>eem in their Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
but one intire liquor, endow'd
with a <U+017F>tream-like motion, and a
di<U+017F>tinct <hi><U+017F>uperficies,</hi> wherein no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is to be <U+017F>een, even by an
Eye plac'd near it. To devi<U+017F>e this
Experiment, I was induc'd, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering,
that hitherto all the (total)
di<U+017F><U+017F>olutions that have been made of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44036:32"/>
Pigments, have been in liquors natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cold, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting probably
of much le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubtile, and certainly
of much le<U+017F>s agitated parts, than that
fluid aggregate of <U+017F>hining matter that
we call <hi>Flame;</hi> whereas I argued,
that if one could totally di<U+017F><U+017F>olve a
Body compos'd of parts <U+017F>o minute as
tho<U+017F>e of a Metal into actual Flame,
and husband its Flame <U+017F>o, as that
it <U+017F>hould not immoderatly wa<U+017F>te, I
<U+017F>hould thereby di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Metal in
a far more <U+017F>ubtil <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> than our
common water, or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or
<hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> or any other known
<hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> I have yet imployed.
And con<U+017F>equently the attenuation
and expan<U+017F>ion of the Metal in this
truly Igneous <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> would much
<U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s not only what happens in
ordinary Metalline <U+017F>olutions, but
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly al<U+017F>o what I have noted in
the third Chapter of this <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <U+017F>trange diffu<U+017F>ion of Copper
di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in Spirit of Urine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In pro<U+017F>ecution of this de<U+017F>ign,
I <U+017F>o prepar'd one <U+017F>ingle grain of that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44036:32"/>
Metal, by a way that I el<U+017F>ewhere
teach, that it was di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in about
a <U+017F>poonful of an appropriated <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum.</hi>
And then having caus'd a
<U+017F>mall Gla<U+017F>s-lamp to be purpo<U+017F>ely
blown to contain this liquor, and
fitted it with a <U+017F>ocket and wieck, we
lighted the Lamp, which, without
con<U+017F>uming the wieck, burnt with a
flame large enough and very hot, and
<U+017F>eem'd to be all the while of a greeni<U+017F>h
blew, as if it were a but finer and
<U+017F>hining <U+017F>olution of Copper. And yet
this one grain of prepar'd Metal
ting'd the flame that was from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to moment produc'd, during
no le<U+017F>s than half an hour and <U+017F>ix mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.
And now if we con<U+017F>ider, that
in this flame there was an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of multitudes of
colour'd Particles newly extricated,
and flying off in every of tho<U+017F>e many
parts wherein a minute of time may
either actually or mentally be divided;
<hi>and,</hi> if we con<U+017F>ider Flame as a light

not tru<U+017F>ting much to tho<U+017F>e Relators,

<U+017F>o as to be perceptible enough to a

that the <U+017F>cent of a flying and heated
Deer will <U+017F>ometimes continue upon
the ground from one day to the next
following.</p>
                     <p>And now we may con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e
three things; <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> That the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
left upon the gra<U+017F>s or ground
by the tran<U+017F>ient tread of a Partridge,
Hare, or other <hi>animal,</hi> that does but
pa<U+017F>s along his way, does probably
communicate to the gra<U+017F>s or ground
but <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e Effluxions, that
tran<U+017F>pire out of his feet, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>mall enough to e<U+017F>cape the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cernment
of the Eye, may probably
not amount to one grain in weight,
or perhaps not to the tenth part of it.
<hi>Next,</hi> That the parts of fluid Bodies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44036:35"/>
as <U+017F>uch, are perpetually in motion,
and <U+017F>o are the invi<U+017F>ible particles that
<U+017F>wim in them, as may appear by
the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of Salt or Sugar in
water, and the wandering of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous
Vapours through the Air,
even when the Eye perceives them
not. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> That though the
Atmo<U+017F>phere of one of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall
parcels of the exhaling matter we are
<U+017F>peaking of, may oftentimes be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
va<U+017F>t in compari<U+017F>on of the

the di<U+017F>tance, at which <U+017F>ome Setters,
or Blood-hounds, will find the <U+017F>cent
of a Partridge, or Deer; yet in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
expos'd to the free air or wind,
'tis very likely that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>teams are
a<U+017F><U+017F>iduou<U+017F>ly carried away from their
Fountain, to maintain the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Atmo<U+017F>phere for <U+017F>ix, eight, or
more hours, that is, as long as the
<U+017F>cent has been ob<U+017F>erv'd to lye, there
will be requi<U+017F>ite a continual recruit
of <U+017F>teams <U+017F>ucceeding one another
And that <U+017F>o very <U+017F>mall a portion of

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44036:36"/>

an Atmo<U+017F>phere incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
greater than it <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>upply
it with almo<U+017F>t continual recruits,
we cannot but think, that the
<U+017F>teams it parts with, mu<U+017F>t be of an
extreme and <U+017F>carce conceivable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutene<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>And we may further con<U+017F>ider,
that the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, which emit the<U+017F>e
<U+017F>teams, being <U+017F>uch as newly belong'd
to Animals, and were, for the mo<U+017F>t
part, tran<U+017F>pir'd through the pores of
their feet, mu<U+017F>t be in likelihood a
far more evaporable and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipable
kind of Bodies than Minerals or adu<U+017F>t
Vegetables, <U+017F>uch as Gunpowder is
made of; <U+017F>o that if the grains of
Gunpowder emit Effluviums capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being by <U+017F>ome Animals per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at a di<U+017F>tance by their <U+017F>mell,
one may probably <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that the
<U+017F>mall grains of this powder may hold
out very many times longer to <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
an Atmo<U+017F>phere with odorable
<U+017F>teams, than the Corpu<U+017F>cles left on

                     <p>Now though it be generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree'd
on, that very few Birds have

will think, perhaps, no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange
than any of the re<U+017F>t, which is, that
though they that are skilful in the
perfuming of Gloves, are wont to
imbue them with but an incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quantity of odoriferous matter,
yet I have by me a pair of <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi>
Gloves, which I had by the favour
of your fair and virtuous Si<U+017F>ter <hi>(F.)</hi>
that were <U+017F>o skilfully perfum'd, that
partly by her, partly by tho<U+017F>e, that
pre<U+017F>ented them her as a Rarity, and
partly by me, who have kept them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44036:39"/>
<U+017F>everal Years, they have been kept
about eight or nine and twenty years,
if not thirty, and they are <U+017F>o well
<U+017F>cented, that they may, for ought
I know, continue fragrant divers
years longer. Which in<U+017F>tance, if
you plea<U+017F>e to reflect upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider,
that <U+017F>uch Gloves cannot have
been carried from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or <U+017F>o much as uncover'd
(as they mu<U+017F>t often have been) in
the free Air, without diffu<U+017F>ing from
them<U+017F>elves a fragrant Atmo<U+017F>phere,
we cannot but conclude tho<U+017F>e odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Steams to be unimaginably <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that could for <U+017F>o long a time

perfum'd matter lodged in the

richly <U+017F>tock'd with particles of the

rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome removes, in which I
took not the Gloves along with me,)
I forgot ever <U+017F>ince I had them, to keep

and imagine that <U+017F>uch minute Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
(if they grant that there are
<U+017F>uch,) as are not, for the mo<U+017F>t part

tendere<U+017F>t and quicke<U+017F>t of Sen<U+017F>es, the
Sight, cannot have any con<U+017F>iderable
Operation upon other Bodies. But
I take this to be an error, which,
<hi>as</hi> it very little becomes Philo<U+017F>ophers,
<hi><U+017F>o</hi> it has done no little prejudice to
Philo<U+017F>ophy it <U+017F>elf, and perhaps to
Phy<U+017F>ick too. And therefore though
the nature of my de<U+017F>ign at pre<U+017F>ent did
not <hi>require</hi> it, yet the importance of
the <U+017F>ubject would <hi>invite</hi> me to <U+017F>hew,
That this is as ill-gounded as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
a Suppo<U+017F>ition.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if we Con<U+017F>ider the
<U+017F>ubject attentively, we may ob<U+017F>erve,
That though it be true, that, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> the greatne<U+017F>s of Bodies doth,
in mo<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>es, contribute to that of
their Operation upon others, yet Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Body being in its own preci<U+017F>e
nature an unactive or movele<U+017F>s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
one part of the Ma<U+017F>s acts upon
another but upon the account of its
Local Motion, who<U+017F>e Operations are
facilitated and otherwi<U+017F>e diver<U+017F>ified
by the Shape, Size, Situation and
Texture both of the Agent and of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44036:42"/>
Patient. And therefore if Corpu<U+017F>eles,
though very minute, be numerous
enough, and have a competent degree
of motion, even the<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall Particles,
e<U+017F>pecially if fitly <U+017F>hap'd, when they
chance to meet with a Body, which
the congruity of its texture di<U+017F>po<U+017F>es
to admit them at its Pores, and receive
their either friendly or ho<U+017F>tile impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions,
may perform <U+017F>uch things in the

Bodies, but le<U+017F>s conveniently <U+017F>hap'd
and mov'd, would be utterly unable
(on the <U+017F>ame Body) to effect.</p>
                     <p>And that you may with the le<U+017F>s
difficulty allow me to <U+017F>ay, that the
Effluviums of Bodies, as minute as they
are, may perform Con<U+017F>iderable things,
give me leave to ob<U+017F>erve to you, that
there are <hi>at lea<U+017F>t</hi> <U+017F>ix ways, by which
the Effluviums of a Body may nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
operate upon another; namely,
1. By the <hi>great number</hi> of emitted Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles.
2. By their <hi>penetrating</hi> and
pervading nature. 3. By their <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and other Modifications of their
Motion. 4. By the <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44036:43"/>
of their Bulk and Shape to the
Pores of the Bodies they are to act
upon. 5. By the <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>one</hi> part
<hi>upon another,</hi> that they excite or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
in the Body they work upon
according to its Structure. And <hi>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi>
By the Fitne<U+017F>s and Power they have
to make them<U+017F>elves be <hi>a<U+017F>si<U+017F>ted,</hi> in their
Working, by the <hi>more Catholick Agents</hi>
of the Univer<U+017F>e. And though it may
perhaps be <U+017F>ufficiently proved, that
there are <U+017F>everal ca<U+017F>es wherein a Body
that emits Particles, may act notably
upon another Body by this or that
<U+017F>ingle way of tho<U+017F>e I have been
naming; yet u<U+017F>ually the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are performed by the a<U+017F><U+017F>ociation
of two, three or more of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to produce the <U+017F>ame Effect.
Upon which <U+017F>core when I <U+017F>hall in the

                     <p>TAking tho<U+017F>e things for granted,
that have, I hope, been <U+017F>ufficiently
proved in the former Tract about the
<U+017F>ubtlety of Effluviums, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it will
readily be allowed, That the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of a Body may be extremely
minute; whence it may be rightly
inferr'd, that a <U+017F>mall portion of matter
may emit great multitudes of them.</p>
                     <p>Now that the great number of
Agents may in many ca<U+017F>es compen<U+017F>ate
their littlene<U+017F>s, e<U+017F>pecially where they
Act or Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <hi>per modum unius,</hi> (as they
<U+017F>peak,) men would perhaps the more
ea<U+017F>ily grant, if they took notice to this
purpo<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome familiar In<U+017F>tances.</p>
                     <p>We <U+017F>ee that not only le<U+017F><U+017F>er Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods
that overflow the neighbouring
Fields, but tho<U+017F>e terrible Inundations
that <U+017F>ometimes drown whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
are made by Bodies <U+017F>ingly <U+017F>o
<U+017F>o <U+017F>mall and incon<U+017F>iderable as Drops
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44036:44"/>
of Rain when they continue to fall in
tho<U+017F>e multitudes we call Showers.</p>
                     <p>So the aggregates of <U+017F>uch minute
Bodies as grains of Sand being heaped
together in <U+017F>ufficient Numbers, make
Banks wherewith greate<U+017F>t Ships are
<U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>plit, nay and <U+017F>erve in mo<U+017F>t
places for Bounds to the Sea it <U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>And though a <U+017F>ingle Corn of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
or two or three together,
are not of Force to do much mi<U+017F>chief,
yet two or three Barrels of tho<U+017F>e Corns
taking Fire all together are able to
blow up Ships and Hou<U+017F>es, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
prodigious things.</p>
                     <p>But in<U+017F>tead of multiplying <U+017F>uch
In<U+017F>tances, afforded by Bodies of
<U+017F>mall indeed but yet vi<U+017F>ible Bulk,
I <U+017F>hall (as <U+017F>oon as I have intimated,
that the above-mentioned drops of

the Operations of Invi<U+017F>ible particles.</p>
                     <p>And fir<U+017F>t, we <U+017F>ee, that though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44036:44"/>
Aqueous Vapours be look'd upon as
the fainte<U+017F>t and lea<U+017F>t active Effluviums
that we know of, yet when multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of them are in Rainy weather
di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed thorow the Air, and are
thereby qualified to work on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
expo<U+017F>ed to it, their Operations
are very con<U+017F>iderable, not only in
the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of Salts, as Sea-Salt,
Salt of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive
changes they produce in many
Bodies, but in the intume<U+017F>cence they
cau<U+017F>e in Oak and other <U+017F>olid Woods;
as appears by the difficulty we often
find in and before Rainy weather, to
<U+017F>hut and open Doors, Boxes, and other
Wooden pieces of work, that were
before fit enough for the Cavities they
had been adju<U+017F>ted to.</p>
                     <p>I might here urge, that though the
<U+017F>trings of Viols and other Mu<U+017F>ical
In<U+017F>truments are <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>trong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain con<U+017F>iderable weights,
yet if they be left <U+017F>crewed to their full
ten<U+017F>ion, (as it frequently happens)
they are oftentimes by the <U+017F>upervening
of moi<U+017F>t weather made to break, not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:45"/>
without impetuo<U+017F>ity and noi<U+017F>e. But
it may <U+017F>ute better with my pre<U+017F>ent
aim, if I mention on this occa<U+017F>ion,
(what I el<U+017F>ewhere more fully take
notice of:) Being de<U+017F>irous to try what
a multitude even of Aqueous Steams
may do, I cau<U+017F>ed a Rope that was long,
but not thick, and was in part <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tained
by a Pully, to have a Weight
of Lead <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>tned to the end of it, as
not to touch the ground, and after
the Weight had lei<U+017F>ure allowed it to
<U+017F>tretch the Cord as far as it could,
I ob<U+017F>erved that in the moi<U+017F>t weather
the wateri<U+017F>h particles, that did invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
abound in the Air, did <U+017F>o much
work upon and <U+017F>horten the Rope, as
to make it lift up the hanging Weight,
which was, if I mis-remember not,
about an hundred Pounds.</p>
                     <p>The invi<U+017F>ible Steams, i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out
of the Walls of a newly pla<U+017F>ter'd or
whited Room, are not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to tho<U+017F>e that do but tran<U+017F>iently
vi<U+017F>it it, or make but a very <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tay
in it, though there be a Charcoal-fire
in the Chimney; but we have many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44036:45"/>
in<U+017F>tances of per<U+017F>ons, that by lying for
a night in <U+017F>uch Rooms, have been the
next morning or <U+017F>ooner found dead
in their Beds, being <U+017F>uffocated by the
multitude of the noxious Vapours
emitted during all that time.</p>
                     <p>And here I think it proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve,
That it may much a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us to
take notice of the multitude of <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
and make us expect great matters from
them, to con<U+017F>ider, that they are not
emitted from the Body that affords
them all at once, as Hail-<U+017F>hot out of
a Gun, but i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from it as the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous
Winds do out of an Aeolipil
well heated, or Waters out of a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in continued Streams, wherein
fre<U+017F>h parts <U+017F>till <U+017F>ucceed one another;
<U+017F>o that though as many Effluxions of
a Body as can be <U+017F>ent out at one time
were numerous enough to Act but
upon its Superficial parts, yet the
Emanation of the next minute may
get in a little farther, and each <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t
portion of time <U+017F>upplying fre<U+017F>h Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
and perhaps urging on the
Steams already entred, the Particles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44036:46"/>
may at length get into a multitude
of the pores of the invaded Body, and
penetrate it to the very innermo<U+017F>t

of a very piercing nature, though
we <U+017F>hall not now enquire upon what

by <U+017F>everal Examples. For not only

Steams, unexcited by heat, are of <U+017F>o
piercing a nature, that not only they
will powerfully affect the Eyes and
No<U+017F>trils, and Throats, and <U+017F>ometimes
the Stomachs too (yet without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Vomitive,) of the Patients they
invade, but al<U+017F>o when a great cold
has <U+017F>o clog'd the organs of <U+017F>melling,
that neither <U+017F>weet nor <U+017F>tinking odours
would at all affect them, the<U+017F>e piercing
Steams have not only in a few minutes
both made them<U+017F>elves a way, and
which is more, <U+017F>o open'd the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages,
that <U+017F>oon after the Patient has been
able to <U+017F>mell other things al<U+017F>o. And
by the <U+017F>ame penetrating Spirit, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of Quality was, <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>ince,
re<U+017F>tored to a power of <U+017F>melling, which
he had lo<U+017F>t for divers Years, (if he ever
had it equally with other men.) I could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44036:47"/>
ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ubjoyn Examples of this kind,
but they belong to other places. And
here I <U+017F>hall only add, that the <U+017F>teams
of Water it <U+017F>elf a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by warmth,
are capable of di<U+017F><U+017F>olving the Texture
of even hard and <U+017F>olid bodies, that
are not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to be Saline; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Philo<U+017F>ophical calcination
(as Chymi<U+017F>ts call it) wherein <U+017F>olid
pieces of Harts-horn are brought to
be ea<U+017F>ily friable into pouder, by being
hung over waters, whil'<U+017F>t their <U+017F>teams
ri<U+017F>e in di<U+017F>tillation and without the
help of Furnaces. The Exhalations,
that u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>wim every night in the
air, and almo<U+017F>t every night fall to the
ground in the form of Dews (which
makes them be judged Aqueous,) are
in many places of the Torrid Zone
of <U+017F>o penetrating a nature, that, as
Eye-witne<U+017F><U+017F>es have informed me, they
would in a very <U+017F>hort time make
Knives ru<U+017F>t in their <U+017F>heaths, and
Swords in their <U+017F>cabbards, nay and
Watches in their ca<U+017F>es, if they did not
con<U+017F>tantly carry them in their pockets.
And I have known even in <hi>England</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:48"/>
divers hard bodies, into which the
Vapours <U+017F>wimming in the air have
in<U+017F>inuated them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o far as to make
them friable throughout. But of the
penetration of Effluviums, I have
given, in <U+017F>everal places, <U+017F>o many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances,
that 'tis not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to add
any here. And therefore to <U+017F>hew,
that, as I intimated at the beginning
of this Chapter, the Penetrancy and
the multitude of Effluviums may
much a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t each other, I <U+017F>hall now
<U+017F>ubjoyn; That we mu<U+017F>t not for the
mo<U+017F>t part look upon Effluviums as
<U+017F>warms of Corpu<U+017F>cles, that only beat
again<U+017F>t the out<U+017F>ides of the Bodies they
invade, but as Corpu<U+017F>cles, which by
rea<U+017F>on of their great and frequently
recruited numbers, and by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of their Parts, in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
them<U+017F>elves in multitudes into
the minute pores of the bodies they
invade, and often penetrate to the
innermo<U+017F>t of them; <U+017F>o that, though
each <U+017F>ingle Corpu<U+017F>cle, and its di<U+017F>tinct
action, be incon<U+017F>iderable, in re<U+017F>pect
of the multitude of parts that compo<U+017F>e
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:48"/>
the body to be wrought on; yet
a va<U+017F>t multitude of the<U+017F>e little Agents
working together upon a corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
number of the <U+017F>mall parts of the
body they pervade, they may well be
able to have powerful effects upon
the Body, that tho<U+017F>e parts con<U+017F>titute;
as, in the ca<U+017F>e mentioned in the former
Chapter, the Rope would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have been enabled to rai<U+017F>e <U+017F>o
great a weight, though a vehement
Wind had blown again<U+017F>t it, to make
it lo<U+017F>e its perpendicular <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s,
but a va<U+017F>t multitude of Watery Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
getting by degrees into the pores
of the Rope, might, like an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
company of little wedges, <U+017F>o
widen the pores as to make the
thrids or <U+017F>plinters of Hemp, the Rope
was made up of, <U+017F>well, and that <U+017F>o
forcibly, that the depending weight
could not hinder the <U+017F>hortning of the
Rope, and therefore mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity
be rais'd thereby. And I have more
than once known <U+017F>olid and even
heavy Mineral Bodies, bur<U+017F>t in pieces
by the moi<U+017F>ture of the Air, though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:49"/>

<U+017F>o well with the main <U+017F>cope of this

<U+017F>ubjoyn <U+017F>ome others, which, though

more congruous to my pre<U+017F>ent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign.
That the Corpu<U+017F>cles whereof
Odours con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, <U+017F>wim to and fro in

by mo<U+017F>t, I pre<U+017F>ume, be granted, and
may be ea<U+017F>ily prov'd. But I have el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<U+017F>hewn, That the motion of the
Effluviums of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ufficiently odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Bodies, has too little Celerity to
make a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans

be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted to beat more forcibly upon
the No<U+017F>trils by the Air, which hurries
them along with it, when it enters
the No<U+017F>trils in the form of a <U+017F>tream,
in the act of In<U+017F>piration. And I have
by familiar ob<U+017F>ervation of Hunters,
Fowlers, and partly of my own
made manife<U+017F>t, that Setting-dogs,
Hounds, Crows and <U+017F>ome other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
will be much more affected with
<U+017F>ents, or the odorous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,

the Wind blows from the object to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the contrary way, which way <U+017F>oever
the No<U+017F>trils of the animal be obverted,
<U+017F>o the Air be imbued with the odorous
Steams: And con<U+017F>equently the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<U+017F>eems to proceed from this,
that when the No<U+017F>trils are obverted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44036:50"/>
to the Wind, the Current of the Air
drives the Steams forcibly upon the
Sen<U+017F>ory, which otherwi<U+017F>e it does
not.</p>
                     <p>That there is a briskne<U+017F>s of motion
requi<U+017F>ite, and more than ordinarily
conducive to <hi>Electrical</hi> attractions,
may be argued from the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that
we u<U+017F>ually find by rubbing Amber,
Jett, and other Electrical bodies, to
make them emit tho<U+017F>e Steams, by
which 'tis highly probable their action
is performed: And though I have
el<U+017F>ewhere <U+017F>hewn, that this precedent
rubbing is not alwayes nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to
excite all Electrical bodies; yet in
tho<U+017F>e that I made to attract without
it, it would operate much more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorou<U+017F>ly
after attrition; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
makes a reciprocal motion
among<U+017F>t the more <U+017F>table parts, and
does thereby as 'twere di<U+017F>charge and
<U+017F>hoot out the attracting Corpu<U+017F>cles;
who<U+017F>e real emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though it may
be probably argued from what has
been already <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>eems more <U+017F>trongly
proveable by an Ob<U+017F>ervation that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:50"/>
I made many years ago, and which
I have been lately inform'd to have
been long <U+017F>ince made by the very
Learned <hi>Fabri.</hi> The Ob<U+017F>ervation
was this; That if, when we took
a vigorou<U+017F>ly excited Electrick, we
did at a certain nick of time (which
circum<U+017F>tances may much vary, but
was u<U+017F>ually almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as the
body was well rubbed) place it at a
ju<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tance from a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended Hair
or other light body, or perhaps from
<U+017F>ome light powder; the Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
would not be attracted to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrick,
but driven away from it, as
it <U+017F>eem'd, by the briskly moving
<U+017F>teams that i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the Amber or
other light body.</p>
                     <p>This Argument I could confirm by
another Phaenomenon or two of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with this, if I <U+017F>hould not borrow
too much of what I have el<U+017F>ewhere
noted about the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Electricity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know a certain <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which
though made by di<U+017F>tillation, does in
the cold emit but a very mild and
inoffen<U+017F>ive <U+017F>mell, but when the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44036:51"/>
that holds it is heated, though no
<U+017F>eparation of con<U+017F>tituent Principles
appear to be thereby made, (the Body
being in all u<U+017F>ual tryals homogeneous,)
the Effluviums will be <U+017F>o altered, that
I remember a Virtuo<U+017F>o, that, to <U+017F>atisfie
his curio<U+017F>ity<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> would needs be <U+017F>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to it, when 'twas heated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to me, that he thought the
Steams would have killed him, and
that the Effluviums of Spirit of <hi>Sal
Armoniack</hi> it <U+017F>elf were nothing near
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and piercing as tho<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>And even among <U+017F>olid Bodies, I
know <U+017F>ome, which, though abounding
much in a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance wherein <U+017F>ome
rank <U+017F>mells principally re<U+017F>ide, yet (if
they were not chafed) were <U+017F>carce
at all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly odorous; but upon the
rubbing of them a little one again<U+017F>t
the other, the attrition making them,
as it were, dart out their Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ions,
would in a minute or two make them
<U+017F>tink egregiou<U+017F>ly.</p>
                     <p>And as the Celerity of motion
may thus give a vigor to the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Bodies, <U+017F>o there may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:51"/>
other modifications of motion, that
may contribute to the <U+017F>ame thing,
and are not to be wholly neglected in
this place. For as we <U+017F>ee, that greater
Bodies do operate differingly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch modifications;
as there is a great difference between
the effects of a Dart or Javelin, <U+017F>o
thrown as that its point be alwayes
forwards, and the <U+017F>ame weapon if it be
<U+017F>o thrown, that during its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive
motion the extremes turn about the
Center of gravity or <U+017F>ome inward
parts, as it happens when Boyes
throw <U+017F>ticks to beat down fruit from
the tops of trees; <U+017F>o there is little
doubt to be made, but that in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
them<U+017F>elves 'tis not all one, as
to their effects, whether they move
with or without rotation, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch a line, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with or without undulation,
trembling or <U+017F>uch a kind of con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
and in <U+017F>hort, whether the
motion have or have not this or that
particular modification; which how
much it may diver<U+017F>ifie the Effects
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:52"/>
of the Bodies moved, may appear
by the Motion, that the Aerial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are put into by Mu<U+017F>ical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments.
For, though the effects
of harmony, di<U+017F>cord and peculiar
<U+017F>ounds be <U+017F>ometimes very great, not
only in Human bodies, but, as we <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>hew in the following Tract, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
ones too; the whole efficacy
of Mu<U+017F>ick and of Sounds that are not
extraordinarily loud and different,
<U+017F>eems, as far as 'tis a<U+017F>cribable to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous

and the congruity or incongruity
which they may have upon that <U+017F>core

take notice of tho<U+017F>e effects of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

to the peculiar relation between the

I know that many <U+017F>trange things
that are delivered about the Effects
of what the Latins call <hi>Fulmen</hi> (which
our Engli<U+017F>h word <hi>Lightning</hi> does not

an Eye-witne<U+017F>s of, within le<U+017F>s than
a quarter of an hour after that the
things happened. And though it be
very difficult to explicate particularly
many of the<U+017F>e true Phenomena, yet it
<U+017F>eems warrantable enough to argue
from them, that there may be Agents
<U+017F>o qualified, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>wiftly moved,
that notwith<U+017F>tanding their being <U+017F>o
exceedingly minute, as they mu<U+017F>t be,
to make up a flame, which is a fluid

<U+017F>ome of them without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
their Texture, burn, break,
melt, and produce other very great
changes in other Bodies that are fitted
to be wrought on by them. And of
this I mu<U+017F>t not forget to mention this
remarkable in<U+017F>tance; That a per<U+017F>on
Curious enough to collect many rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
bringing me one day into the
Study where he kept the choice<U+017F>t of
them, I <U+017F>aw there among other things
a fine pair of Drinking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es that
were <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>lender, but extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
tall; they <U+017F>eem'd to have

But before I <U+017F>aw them,
that re<U+017F>emblance was much le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd
by the Lightning, that fell between
them in <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a manner, that,

as to make it <U+017F>tand quite awry, and
give it a po<U+017F>ture, that I beheld not
without <U+017F>ome amazement. And I
cannot yet but look upon it as a very
<U+017F>trange thing, and no le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderable
to our pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, that Nature
<U+017F>hould in the free Air make of Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and that <U+017F>uch as probably
when they a<U+017F>cended were invi<U+017F>ible,
<U+017F>uch an aggregate of Corpu<U+017F>cles, as
<U+017F>hould without breaking <U+017F>uch frail
Bodies as Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, be able in its
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age thorow them, that is, in
the twinkling of an Eye, to melt
them; which to do is wont even in
our Reverberatory Furnaces to co<U+017F>t
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:54"/>
that active flames a pretty deal of
time.</p>
                     <p>And this calls into my memory,
that upon a time, hearing not far off
from me <U+017F>uch a clap of Thunder as
made me judge and <U+017F>ay, that que<U+017F>tion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
<U+017F>ome of the neighbouring places
were thunder-<U+017F>trook, I <U+017F>ent pre<U+017F>ently
to make inquiry; which having ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my conjecture, I forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to the hou<U+017F>e, where the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was done, by <U+017F>omething, which
tho<U+017F>e, that pretended to have <U+017F>een
it coming thither, affirm'd to be like
a flame moved very obliquely. To
omit the hurt, that <U+017F>eemed to have
been done by a Wind that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, or was perhaps produced by
it, to divers per<U+017F>ons and cattel; that
which makes me here mention it,
was, that ob<U+017F>erving narrowly what
had happen'd in an upper room,
where it fir<U+017F>t fell, I <U+017F>aw, that it had
in more than one place melted the
Lead in its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, (though that
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly outla<U+017F>ted not the twinkling
of an Eye,) without breaking to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:54"/>
pieces the gla<U+017F>s-ca<U+017F>ements, or burning
(that I took notice of) either the Bed
or Hangings or any other combu<U+017F>tible
hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff; though near the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
it had thrown down a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the <U+017F>olid <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Wall,
through which it <U+017F>eem'd to have
made its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in or out. And that,
which made me the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>cruple to
mention this accident, is, that having
curiou<U+017F>ly pry'd into the Effects of the
<hi>Fulmen,</hi> not only in that little upper
room, but in other parts of the Hou<U+017F>e,
beneath who<U+017F>e lowermo<U+017F>t parts it
<U+017F>eem'd to have ended its extravagant
cour<U+017F>e, I could not but conclude,
That if <U+017F>o be it were the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
it mu<U+017F>t have more than once
gone in and out of the Hou<U+017F>e, and
that the line of its motion was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>traight, nor yet reducible to
any curve or mixed line, that I had
met with among Mathematicians;
but that, as I then told <U+017F>ome of my
Friends, it moved to and fro in an
extravagant manner, not unlike the
irregular and wrigling motion of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:55"/>
tho<U+017F>e fired Squibs that Boys are wont
to make by ramming Gunpowder
into Quills. But about Thunder more
perhaps el<U+017F>ewhere. I <U+017F>hall here only
add, That whereas 'tis a known Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which my own Ob<U+017F>ervations
heedfully made <U+017F>eem now and then
to confirm, that vehement Thunder,
if Beer be not very <U+017F>trong, will u<U+017F>ually
(for I do not <U+017F>ay alwayes) <U+017F>owre it in
a day or two; if this degeneration
be not one of the con<U+017F>equences of the
great and peculiar kinds of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of the Air that happens in
lowd Thunder (in which ca<U+017F>e the
Phenomenon will belong to the next
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,) the effect may probably
be imputed to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubtile Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
diffu<U+017F>ed thorow the Air, which,
penetrating the pores of the Wooden
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, who<U+017F>e contexture is not very
clo<U+017F>e, imbue the liquor with a kind
of acetous Ferment; which conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I <U+017F>hould think much confirmed
by a tryal, it <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted to me, if I
had made it often enough to rely
upon it. For con<U+017F>idering that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:55"/>
pores of Gla<U+017F>s are <U+017F>traight enough to
be impervious (for ought I have
yet ob<U+017F>erved) to the Steams or <U+017F>piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
parts of Sulphur as well as to
other odorous Exhalations, I thought
it worth trying, whether there be
any <U+017F>ulphureous Steams or other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
diffu<U+017F>ed thorow the Air in
time of Thunder, that would not be
too gro<U+017F>s to get in at <U+017F>uch minute
pores as tho<U+017F>e of Gla<U+017F>s. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
having Hermetically <U+017F>ealed
up both Beer and Ale apart, I kept
them in Summer time till there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a great Thunder, a day or two,
after which the Beer which we drank,
that was good before, being generally
complained of as <U+017F>owred by the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I <U+017F>uffer'd my liquors to continue
at lea<U+017F>t a day or two longer, that
the <U+017F>owring Steams, if any <U+017F>uch there
were, might have time enough to
operate upon them, and then breaking
the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, I found not that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
had been <U+017F>owred, though we
had purpo<U+017F>ely forborn to fill the Gla<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
to facilitate the degeneration of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:56"/>
the liquors. Perhaps it will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
on this occa<U+017F>ion to mention
a practice, which is u<U+017F>ual in <U+017F>ome
places where I have been, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
employ'd by a great Lady,
that is a great hou<U+017F>e-keeper, and is
very curious and expert in divers
Phy<U+017F>ical Ob<U+017F>ervations; for, talking
with her about the remedies of the
Sowring of Beer and other drinks by
Thunder, which is <U+017F>ometimes no
<U+017F>mall prejudice to her, <U+017F>he affirm'd
to me, that <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ually found the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
I was mentioning, <U+017F>ucceed:
And that before the then la<U+017F>t great
Thunder, of which I had ob<U+017F>erved
the Effects upon Beer, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>erved
hers by putting, at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
under the Barrels, Chaffing-di<U+017F>hes
of Coals, when <U+017F>he perceiv'd
that the Thunder was like to begin,
which practice, if it con<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
may put one a con<U+017F>idering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Fire do not by rarifying the
Air and di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ulphureous or
other Steams, by altering them, or
by uniting with them the Exhalations
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:56"/>
of the Coals, or by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch kind of
way, render ineffectual the<U+017F>e <U+017F>owring
Corpu<U+017F>cles, which perhaps require a
determinate bulk and <U+017F>hape, be<U+017F>ides
their being crowded very many of
them together, to have their full
Operation on Barrell'd Liquors. But
the<U+017F>e things are but meer Conjectures,

into which the Internal parts of

Organical and living Bodies. To

<U+017F>tructure as to be very much alterable
by the appropriated Effluviums of
other Bodies, as may be in<U+017F>tanc'd in
the power, that I have known <U+017F>ome
vigorous Load<U+017F>tones to have, of taking
away in a trice the attractive virtue

Odours have notable Effects even

And I remember, that one day being

a man that had a parcel of Musk

to mo<U+017F>t of us was delightful, that in

as that of Damask-Ro<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even of Red-Ro<U+017F>es, in <U+017F>o much

him<U+017F>elf at a di<U+017F>tance from the Bu<U+017F>hes,
which bore many of them Red-Ro<U+017F>es;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44036:60"/>
he abruptly broke off the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
we were engag'd in, to complain of
the harm the Perfume did his Head,
and de<U+017F>ired me to pa<U+017F>s into a Walk,
that had no Ro<U+017F>es growing near it.</p>
                     <p>If it were not for the Sex of this
per<U+017F>on, I could relate an In<U+017F>tance that
would be much more con<U+017F>iderable of
the Operation of Ro<U+017F>es. For I know
a di<U+017F>creet Lady to whom their <U+017F>mell
is not <hi>unplea<U+017F>ing,</hi> (for <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer'd
me that 'twas not <U+017F>o at all,) but <U+017F>o
<hi>hurtful,</hi> that it pre<U+017F>ently makes her
<U+017F>ick, and would make her <U+017F>woon if
not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably prevented: And <U+017F>he
told me that being once at a Court
in which <U+017F>he was a Maid of Honour,
though <U+017F>he her-<U+017F>elf did not know
whence it came, <U+017F>he found her <U+017F>elf
extremely ill on a <U+017F>udden, and ready
to <U+017F>ink down for faintne<U+017F>s; but being
then in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e
High Quality <U+017F>he payd her profound
re<U+017F>pect to, her Civility, that kept her
from complaining or withdrawing,
might have been dangerous if not
fatal to her, had not the Prince<U+017F>s
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:61"/>
who was <U+017F>peaking with her, and
who knew her Antipathy to Ro<U+017F>es,
taken notice that her Face grew
<U+017F>trangely pale, and was covered with
a cold <U+017F>weat. For thereby pre<U+017F>ently
gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing what might be the cau<U+017F>e,
which the <U+017F>ick Lady her <U+017F>elf did not,
<U+017F>he asked aloud whether <U+017F>ome body
had not brought Ro<U+017F>es (which were
then in <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on) into the Bed-chamber,
which que<U+017F>tion occa<U+017F>ioned a <U+017F>peedy
withdrawing of a Lady, that <U+017F>tood
at a di<U+017F>tance off, and had about her
Ro<U+017F>es, which were not <U+017F>een by the
Patient, who was by this means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
from falling into a <U+017F>woon,
though not from being for a while
very much di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>But this you may tell me was the
ca<U+017F>e of a <hi>Woman,</hi> who complain'd her
malady affected her Heart, not her
Head. Wherefore returning to what
I was <U+017F>peaking of before I mention'd
Her, I <U+017F>hall proceed to tell you, that as
Odours may thus give Men the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
<U+017F>o I have often found the <U+017F>mell
of rectified-Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:61"/>
to free Men as well as Women from
the Fits of that di<U+017F>temper; and that
<U+017F>ometimes in <U+017F>o few Minutes, that
the per<U+017F>on reliev'd could <U+017F>carcely
imagine, they could <U+017F>o quickly
be <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>To which I <U+017F>hall not add the Tryals
that I have <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully made upon
my <U+017F>elf, becau<U+017F>e being, thanks be to
God, very <U+017F>eldom troubled with that
di<U+017F>temper, the occa<U+017F>ions I have had
of making them have not been many.
And though I have not <hi>alwayes</hi> found
<U+017F>o <U+017F>light a Remedy to work the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
Cure, yet that it does it often,
even in Men, is <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>hew the
Efficacy of Sanative Effluviums.</p>
                     <p>Now, to manife<U+017F>t, that Steams do
not Operate only upon Hy<U+017F>terical
Women, or per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ubject to the
Head-ach, I will add <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tances
of the Effects they may produce upon
other per<U+017F>ons, and parts.</p>
                     <p>'Tis but too well known an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation,
that Women with Child

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44036:62"/>
though perhaps the <U+017F>moak a<U+017F>cending

the invi<U+017F>ible Corpu<U+017F>cles, a good while
before it arriv'd at the No<U+017F>trils of
the unhappy Woman; and what
violent and <U+017F>training motions Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are frequently accompanied
with, is <U+017F>ufficiently known already.</p>
                     <p>I think I have el<U+017F>ewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that a Gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
a proper and lu<U+017F>ty man,
will be put into the fits of Vomiting
by the <U+017F>mell of Coffee, boyl'd in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I <U+017F>hall therefore rather mention,
that I know a Phy<U+017F>ician, who having
been, for a long time when he was
young, frequently compelled to take
<hi>Electuarium lenitivum,</hi> one of the
gentle<U+017F>t and lea<U+017F>t unplea<U+017F>ant Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Shops, conceived <U+017F>uch a
di<U+017F>like of it, that <U+017F>till, as him<U+017F>elf has
complained to me, if he <U+017F>mell to it,
as he <U+017F>ometimes happens to do in
Apothecaries Shops, it will work
(now and then for <U+017F>everal times) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and downwards with him.</p>
                     <p>I know another very ingenious

per<U+017F>ons of the <U+017F>ame faculty, that has
been a Traveller by Sea and Land,
who has complain'd to me, that the
<U+017F>mell of the Grea<U+017F>e of the Wheels of
a Hackney-coach, though it do but
pa<U+017F>s by him, is wont to make him <U+017F>ick
and ready to Vomit.</p>
                     <p>Every body knows, that Smoak is
apt to make mens Eyes water, and
excite in the organs of Re<U+017F>piration
that trouble<U+017F>om and vehement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
we call Coughing. But we
need not have recour<U+017F>e at all to vi<U+017F>ible
Fumes, for the production of the like
Effects; <U+017F>ince we have often ob<U+017F>erved
them, and repeated Sneezings to boot,
to proceed from the invi<U+017F>ible Steams
of Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> when Vials
containing that liquor, though they
were perhaps but very <U+017F>mall, were
approached too ha<U+017F>tily, or perhaps
too near to the No<U+017F>trils.</p>
                     <p>And becau<U+017F>e in mo<U+017F>t of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
In<U+017F>tances, the chief Effects
<U+017F>eem to be wrought, by the con<U+017F>ent
of parts, on the <hi>genus Nervo<U+017F>um</hi> and
the action of one of them upon the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44036:63"/>
other, and thereby upon <U+017F>everal other
parts of the Body, I will <U+017F>ubjoyn a
remarkable in<U+017F>tance of the Operation
of a mild and grateful Odour upon
the Humors them<U+017F>elves, and that
in a Man.</p>
                     <p>A famous Apothecary, who is a
very tall and big man, <U+017F>everal times
told me, that though he was once
a great lover of Ro<U+017F>es, yet having had
occa<U+017F>ion to employ great quantities
of them at a time, he was <U+017F>o altered
by their Steams, that now, if he come
among the Ro<U+017F>e-bu<U+017F>hes, the <U+017F>mell does
much di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>e him. And the
odour of Ro<U+017F>es, (I mean Incarnate-Ro<U+017F>es,
which we commonly call
Damask-Ro<U+017F>es, though they be not
the true ones,) makes <U+017F>uch a colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
of Humors in his Head, that
it <U+017F>ets him a coughing, and makes
him run at the No<U+017F>e, and gives him
a <U+017F>ore throat; and by an affluence
of Humors makes his Eyes <U+017F>ore, in
<U+017F>o much that during the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of
Ro<U+017F>es, when quantities of them are
brought into his Hou<U+017F>e, he is oblig'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44036:63"/>
for the mo<U+017F>t part to ab<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf

                     <p>ONE may <U+017F>hew on this occa<U+017F>ion,
that as there might be con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
things performed by Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums,
as they make one part of a

Gravity or <U+017F>ome other of the
more Catholick Agents of Nature, as
the World is now con<U+017F>tituted. But not
to injure another Tract, I <U+017F>hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this, when I <U+017F>hall have taken
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44036:64"/>
notice, that in the In<U+017F>tances hitherto
produced, there has been a vi<U+017F>ible
Local di<U+017F>tance between the Body that
emits Steams, and that on which they
work. But if I thought it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary,
it were not difficult to <U+017F>hew, that
one might woll enough referr to the
title of this Tract divers Effects of
Bodies that are applied immediately
to ours; <U+017F>uch as are Blood-<U+017F>tones,
Cornelions, Nephritick-<U+017F>tones, <hi>Lapis
Malacen<U+017F>is,</hi> and <U+017F>ome Amulets, and
other <U+017F>olid <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances applied by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
outwardly to our Bodies. For
in the<U+017F>e applications the gro<U+017F>s Body
touches but the Skin, and the great
Effects, which I el<U+017F>ewhere relate my
<U+017F>elf to have <U+017F>ometimes (though not
often, much le<U+017F>s alwayes) ob<U+017F>erved
to have followed upon this External
contact or near application, may
rea<U+017F>onably be derived from the <U+017F>ubtle
Emanations, that pa<U+017F>s thorow the
Pores of the Skin to the inward parts
of the Body: As is evident in tho<U+017F>e,
who by holding <hi>Cantharides</hi> in their
Hands, or having them apply'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44036:64"/>
to <U+017F>ome remote External part, have
grievous pains produc'd in their
Urinary parts, as it has happen'd to
Me as well as to many others. And
to the in<U+017F>inuation of the<U+017F>e minute
Corpu<U+017F>cles, that get in at the Pores
of the Skin, <U+017F>eems to be due the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of <U+017F>ome Medicines, that purge,
vomit, re<U+017F>olve the Humors, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
notably alter the Body being
but externally applied; of which I
could here give <U+017F>everal In<U+017F>tances, but
that they belong more properly to
another place, and are not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
in this, where it may <U+017F>uffice to name
the notorious Power, that Mercurial
Oyntments or Fumes, either together
or apart, have of producing Copious
Salvations, to <U+017F>hew in general, that
both the Steams and the Emanations

of Terre<U+017F>trial and Aqueous matter

mixt Bodies, that emit Effluviums,
which make, as it were, little Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pheres
about divers of them, it will
be congruous to our Doctrine and
De<U+017F>ign, to add in this place, That
be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>light and obvious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
taken notice of by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi>
the Steams of Bodies may be almo<U+017F>t
as various as the Bodies them<U+017F>elves
that emit them; and that therefore
we ought not to look upon them
barely under the general and confu<U+017F>ed
notion of Smoak or Vapours, but
may probably conceive them to have
their di<U+017F>tinct and determinate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
oftentimes (though not always)
<U+017F>uitable to that of the Bodies from
whence they proceed.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the newly mentioned
Divi<U+017F>ion of the <hi>Schools</hi> gives us <U+017F>o
<U+017F>light an account of the Emanations
of Bodies, that, methinks, it looks

                     <p>I con<U+017F>ider'd then, that Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may be of very unequal den<U+017F>ity
and gravity, as is evident in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilver,
Water and pure Spirit of
Wine; which, notwith<U+017F>tanding their
great difference in <U+017F>pecifick gravity,
may yet agree in the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite
to Fluid Bodies. Therefore
pre<U+017F>uming, that by what I could make
appear vi<U+017F>ible in one, what happens
analogically in the other, may be ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
illu<U+017F>trated, I took <U+017F>ome Ounces
of Roch-allom, and as much of fine
Salt-peter. I took <hi><U+017F>ome Ounces</hi> of each,
becau<U+017F>e, if the quantity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
be too <U+017F>mall, the concoagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
grains will be <U+017F>o too, and the

The<U+017F>e being di<U+017F><U+017F>olved together in fair

Effluviums of many Bodies retain
a determinate Nature oftentimes in
an invi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s, and oftener in
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ize as makes them little enough

by this, that the<U+017F>e <hi>Effluvia</hi> being

they appear to be of the <U+017F>ame
nature with the Body that emitted
them. Thus in moi<U+017F>t weather, the
Vapours of Water, that wander

with Marble-Walls or Pavements, or
other Bodies, by their Coldne<U+017F>s and

Mercury having been <U+017F>everal times

                     <p>A ma<U+017F>s of purified Brim<U+017F>tone being

conden<U+017F>e into what the Chymi<U+017F>ts call
<hi>Flores Sulphuris,</hi> which is true Sulphur
of the <U+017F>ame nature with that, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
expo<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ublimation; and
may readily by melting be reduced
into <U+017F>uch another ma<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>And to give you another like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of dry Bodies; I tryed, that
by <U+017F>ubliming good Camphire in clo<U+017F>e
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it would all, as to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, be

of the Subliming-gla<U+017F>s in the form of
dry Camphire as it was before.</p>
                     <p>Nay though a Body be not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but Art compounded of <U+017F>uch
differing Bodies as a Metal and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mineral, and two or three Salts;
yet, if upon Purification of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from its gro<U+017F><U+017F>er parts, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
and finer parts be minute
enough and fitly <U+017F>hap'd, the whole
liquor will a<U+017F>cend, and yet in the

form of a tran<U+017F>parent Fluid,
compo<U+017F>ed of differing Saline and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
parts. This is evident in the
Di<U+017F>tillation of what Chymi<U+017F>ts call
<hi>Butter,</hi> or <hi>Oyl</hi> of Antimony, very well
rectified. For, this Liquor will pa<U+017F>s
into the Receiver diaphanous and
fluid, though, be<U+017F>ides the Particles
of the Sublimate, (which is it <U+017F>elf
a factitious compounded Body) it
abounds with Antimonial Corpu<U+017F>cles,
carried over and kept invi<U+017F>ible by the
corroding Salts; whatever <hi>Angelus
Sala,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e Chymi<U+017F>ts that follow
him, have affirm'd to the contrary;
as might be ea<U+017F>ily here proved, if
this were a fit place to do it in.</p>
                     <p>I found by inquiring of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
per<U+017F>on, that had an intere<U+017F>t in
a Tin-Mine, that I was not deceived
in gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing, that Tin it <U+017F>elf, though
a Metal who<U+017F>e Ore is of a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
fu<U+017F>ion, and which I have by it
<U+017F>elf kept long upon the Cupel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding it to fly away, would yet
retain its Metalline nature in the form
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:72"/>
of fumes or flowers. For this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Gentleman an<U+017F>wer'd me, that
divers times they would take great
<U+017F>tore of a whiti<U+017F>h Sublimate from the
upper part of the Furnaces or Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
where they brought their Ore
to fu<U+017F>ion, or wrought further upon it;
and that this Sublimate, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
elevated to the height of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Man, would, when melted
down, afford at once many Pounds
of very good Tin. On which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
I <U+017F>hall add, that I have my <U+017F>elf
more than once rai<U+017F>ed this Metal in
the form of white Corpu<U+017F>cles by the
help of an Additament, that did <U+017F>carce
weigh half <U+017F>o much as it.</p>

                     <p>THe <U+017F>econd way, by which we
may di<U+017F>cover the Determinate
Nature of Effluviums, is, by the
difference that may <U+017F>ometimes be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
in their Sen<U+017F>ible Qualities. For,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:73"/>
the<U+017F>e Effluviums that are endow'd
with them, proceed from the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>ort of Bodies, and yet tho<U+017F>e afforded
by one kind of Bodies being in many
ca<U+017F>es manife<U+017F>tly differing from tho<U+017F>e
that fly off from another, this evident
di<U+017F>parity in their Exhalations argues
their retaining di<U+017F>tinct natures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to tho<U+017F>e of the re<U+017F>pective
Bodies whence they proceed.</p>
                     <p>I will not now <U+017F>tay to examine,
whether in the Steams, that are made
vi<U+017F>ibly to a<U+017F>cend from the Terre<U+017F>trial
Globe by tho<U+017F>e grand Agents and
u<U+017F>ual rai<U+017F>ers of them, the Sun, and
the agitation of the Air, the Eye can
manife<U+017F>tly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the diver<U+017F>ity of
colours: But in <U+017F>ome productions
of Art <U+017F>uch different colours may be
di<U+017F>covered in the Exhalations, even
without the application of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heat to rai<U+017F>e them. For, when
Spirit of Nitre, <hi>for example,</hi> has been
well rectified, I have often ob<U+017F>erv'd,
that even in the cold the fumes would
play in the unfill'd part of the <U+017F>top'd
Vials it was kept in, and appear in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44036:73"/>
it of a reddi<U+017F>h colour, and, if tho<U+017F>e
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els were open'd, the <U+017F>ame fumes
would copiou<U+017F>ly a<U+017F>cend into the Air,
in the form of a reddi<U+017F>h or orange-tawny
Smoak. Spirit or Oyl of Salt
al<U+017F>o, if it be very well dephlegm'd,
though it will <U+017F>carce in the cold vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
a<U+017F>cend in the empty part of a
Vial, whil<U+017F>t it is kept well <U+017F>top'd;
yet, if the free Air be allow'd acce<U+017F>s
to it, it will, in ca<U+017F>e it be <U+017F>ufficiently
rectified, fly up in the form of a
whiti<U+017F>h fume. But this is incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in compari<U+017F>on of what happens
in a volatile Tincture of Sulphur, I
have el<U+017F>ewhere taught you to make
with Quick-lime. For, not only upon
a <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion the vacant part of
the Vial will be fill'd with white
fumes, though the Gla<U+017F>s be well <U+017F>top'd;
but upon the opening the Vial the<U+017F>e
fumes will copiou<U+017F>ly pa<U+017F>s out at the
neck, and a<U+017F>cend into the Air in the
form of a Smoak, more white than
perhaps you ever <U+017F>aw any. And both
this and that of the Spirit of Salt-peter
do by their operation, as well as <U+017F>mell,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44036:74"/>
di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>e what they are; the latter
being of a Nitrous nature, (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s'd)
and the former, of a Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous:
In <U+017F>o much that having for
curio<U+017F>ities <U+017F>ake in a fitly <U+017F>hap'd Gla<U+017F>s
caught a competent quantity of the
a<U+017F>cending white fumes, I found them
to have conven'd into Bodies tran<U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and Geometrically figur'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
'twas ea<U+017F>ie to di<U+017F>cover by their
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible qualities, that there were <U+017F>tore
of Sulphureous particles mixt with
the Saline ones. That the liquors of
Vegetables, di<U+017F>till'd <hi>in Balneo</hi> or in
Water, are not wont to retain any
thing of the colour of the Bodies that
afforded them, is a thing ea<U+017F>ie to be
ob<U+017F>erv'd in Di<U+017F>tillations made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Retorts or the violence of the Fire.
But it may be worth while to make
tryal, whether the E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Oyl of
Wormwood a<U+017F>cend colour'd like the
Plant, whence 'tis fir<U+017F>t drawn over
with Water in the Limbec, or recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>in Balneo.</hi> For, I forgot to take
notice of it, when upon <U+017F>ome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities,
I ob<U+017F>erv'd in that Plant,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:74"/>
my curio<U+017F>ity led me to find, that not
only in the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tillation in a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Limbec, tinn'd on the in<U+017F>ide, the
Oyl came over green, but by a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
purpo<U+017F>ely made in a Gla<U+017F>s-ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
the purified liquor was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of that colour.</p>
                     <p>The mention of the<U+017F>e E<U+017F><U+017F>ential
Oyls, as Chymi<U+017F>ts call tho<U+017F>e that are
drawn in Limbecs, leads me to tell
you, that, though the<U+017F>e liquors be but
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Vegetables they are
di<U+017F>till'd from, condens'd again in the
Receiver into liquors; yet, as <U+017F>ubtile
as they are, many of them retain the
genuine ta<U+017F>te of the Bodies, whence
the heat elevated them; as you will
ea<U+017F>ily find, if you will ta<U+017F>t a few drops
of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Oyl of Cinamon, <hi>for

by the intervention of Sugar or Spirit
of Wine in a convenient quantity of
Water, Wine, or Beer. For, by this
means you have the natural ta<U+017F>te of
this Spice or Herb. And Wormwood
is a Plant, who<U+017F>e <hi>Effluvia</hi> do <U+017F>o retain
the nature of the Body that parts with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44036:75"/>
them, that I mu<U+017F>t not forbear to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
here an Ob<U+017F>ervation of mine,
that may <U+017F>hew you, that 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
though not u<U+017F>ual, that even without
the help of the Fire the expirations
of a Body may communicate its ta<U+017F>t.
For, among other things, that I had
occa<U+017F>ion to ob<U+017F>erve about <U+017F>ome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Wormwood laid up together,
I remember, I took notice, and made
others do the like, that coming into
a room, where 'twas kept, not only
the organs of <U+017F>melling were power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wrought upon by the Corpu<U+017F>cles
that <U+017F>warm'd in the Air, but al<U+017F>o the
Mouth was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly affected with a
bitter ta<U+017F>t. Perhaps you will <U+017F>carce
think it worth while, that after this
in<U+017F>tance I <U+017F>hould add, that I found
the expirations of <hi>Amber,</hi> kept a while
in pure Spirit of Wine, ta<U+017F>t upon the
tongue like Amber it <U+017F>elf, when I
chew'd it between my teeth. But
I choo<U+017F>e to mention this in<U+017F>tance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it will connect tho<U+017F>e lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
with another <U+017F>ort, very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e. For,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:75"/>
the expirations that I have obtain'd
from Amber, both with pure Spirit
of Wine, and a more piercing <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
did manife<U+017F>tly retain in both
tho<U+017F>e liquors a peculiar <U+017F>mell, with
which I found it to affect the
No<U+017F>trils, when, for tryals <U+017F>ake, I
excited the Electrical faculty of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
by rubbing. And as for Odours,
'tis plain, that the E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Oyls of
Chymi<U+017F>ts, well drawn, do many of
them retain the peculiar and genuine
<U+017F>ent of the Spices or Herbs that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them. And that the<U+017F>e Odours
do really con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of, or re<U+017F>ide in certain
invi<U+017F>ible Corpu<U+017F>cles that fly off from
the vi<U+017F>ible Bodies, that are <U+017F>aid to be
endow'd with <U+017F>uch Smells, I have
el<U+017F>ewhere prov'd at large; and it may
<U+017F>ufficiently appear from their <U+017F>ticking
to divers of the Bodies they meet
with, and their la<U+017F>ting adhe<U+017F>ion to
them.</p>
                     <p>Other Examples may be given of
the <U+017F>etled difference of Effluviums
directly perceivable by Humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of Sen<U+017F>e, as dull as they are;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:76"/>
which la<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion I add, becau<U+017F>e
I <U+017F>carce doubt, but that, if our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ories
were <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ubtile and
tender, they might immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in the <U+017F>ize, <U+017F>hape, motion, and
perhaps colour too of <U+017F>ome now invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
Effluviums, as di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hable
differences, as our naked Eyes in their
pre<U+017F>ent con<U+017F>titution <U+017F>ee, between the
differing <U+017F>orts of Birds, by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
and their manner of flying
in the Air, as Hawks, and Partridges,
and Sparrows, and Swallows. To
make this probable I will not urge,
that in fine white Sand, who<U+017F>e grains
by the una<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted Eye are not wont
to be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible

as to bulk, figure, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as to colour: And that in <U+017F>mall
Chee<U+017F>e-mites, which the naked Eye
can very <U+017F>carcely di<U+017F>cern, <U+017F>o far is it
from di<U+017F>covering any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, one may (as was noted
in the la<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ay) plainly <U+017F>ee, be<U+017F>ides an
obvious difference in point of bigne<U+017F>s,

many particular parts, on who<U+017F>e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
the <U+017F>tructure of tho<U+017F>e <hi>moving
points</hi> may difference them from each
other. And I have <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>een
a very evident di<U+017F>parity even in point
of <U+017F>hape between the very Eggs of
the<U+017F>e <hi>living Atoms,</hi> (as a Poet would
perhaps <U+017F>tile them.) But the<U+017F>e kinds
of proofs (as I was <U+017F>aying) I <U+017F>hall
forbear to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on, that I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to countenance my conjecture
by the effects of the Effluviums, that
are properly <U+017F>o call'd, upon Animals.</p>
                     <p>And fir<U+017F>t, though the Touch be
reckon'd one of the mo<U+017F>t dull of the

Animals; yet the gro<U+017F>s Organs of
that, may, in Men them<U+017F>elves, even
by accident, be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd, as to be

Of this in another Paper I give
<U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tances. And I know not
whether divers of the Pre<U+017F>ages of

(for I do not <U+017F>ay alwayes) proceed
(at lea<U+017F>t in part) from invi<U+017F>ible and

either from the <U+017F>ubterraneal parts, or
from <U+017F>ome Bodies above ground, do

was very quickly cured, and that
without the breaking of any Tumor;
yet it left <U+017F>uch a change in <U+017F>ome parts
of his Body, that he <U+017F>ubjoyns this

And I <U+017F>hall now add,
that I know an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentlewoman (Wife to a famous
Phy<U+017F>ician) who was of a very curious
and delicate complexion, that has <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, that <U+017F>he can very
readily di<U+017F>cover, whether a per<U+017F>on,
that comes to vi<U+017F>it her in Winter,
came from <U+017F>ome place where there is
any con<U+017F>iderable quantity of Snow;
and this <U+017F>he does, (as <U+017F>he tells me) not
by feeling any unu<U+017F>ual cold (for if the
ground be frozen but not cover'd
with Snow, the Effect <U+017F>ucceeds not,)
but from <U+017F>ome peculiar impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
which <U+017F>he thinks, <U+017F>he receives by the
organs of Smelling. I might add,
that I know al<U+017F>o (as I may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
told you) a very ingenious
Phy<U+017F>ician, who falling into an odd
kind of Feaver, had his <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby made <U+017F>o very nice and
tender, that he very plainly heard <U+017F>oft
whi<U+017F>pers, that were made at a con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
di<U+017F>tance off, and which were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:78"/>
not in the lea<U+017F>t perceiv'd by the
healthy by-<U+017F>tanders, nor would have
been by him before his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s.
Which (<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s) I mention as the
thing, that gave his organs of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this preternatural quickne<U+017F>s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
when the Feaver had quite left
him, he was able to hear but at the
rate of other men. And I might tell
you too, that I know a Gentleman
of eminent parts and note, who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a di<U+017F>temper he had in his Eyes,
had his organs of Sight brought to
be <U+017F>o tender, that both his friends
and him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o have a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, that
when he wak'd in the Night he could
for a while plainly <U+017F>ee and di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h
Colours, as well as other objects, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cernable
by the Eye, as was more
than once try'd, by pinning Ribbands
or the like Bodies of <U+017F>everal colours,
to the in<U+017F>ide of his Curtains in the
dark. For if he were awaken'd in
the Night, he would be able to tell
his bed-fellow, where tho<U+017F>e Bodies
were plac'd, and what colour each of
them was of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:78"/>
I have mention'd the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>tances
only to <U+017F>hew you, that if our Sen<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were more delicate and quick,
they would be <U+017F>ufficiently affected by
Objects, that, as they are generally
con<U+017F>tituted, make no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions at
all upon them. For otherwi<U+017F>e I know,
that the <hi>Species</hi> (as they call them) both
of Sounds and Colours, are not held
by many of the Moderns, (from whom
in that I di<U+017F><U+017F>ent not,) to be <U+017F>o much
corporeal Effluxions, trajected through
the <hi>medium,</hi> as peculiar kinds of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Motion convey'd by it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I <U+017F>hall now confirm the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I would countenance by the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination
made by the organs of
other Animals of <U+017F>uch <hi>Effluvia</hi> as to
us men are not only invi<U+017F>ible but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible.
And therefore partly to
<U+017F>trengthen what I deliver'd, and
partly to confirm what I am now di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>ing
of, it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to <U+017F>ubjoyn two or three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I had from per<U+017F>ons of very
good credit, whom I thought likely
to make me no un<U+017F>atisfactory returns
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:79"/>
to my Que<U+017F>tions about things they
were very well vers'd in.</p>
                     <p>A per<U+017F>on of Quality, to whom I
am near allied, related to me, that to
make a tryal, whether a young Blood-hound
was well in<U+017F>tructed, (or as
the Hunt<U+017F>men call it, <hi>made)</hi> he caus'd
one of his Servants, who had not
kill'd, or <U+017F>o much as touch'd any of
his Deer, to walk to a Countrey-town,
four Mile off, and then to a
Market-town three Miles di<U+017F>tant from
thence; which done, this Nobleman
did, a competent while after, put
the Blood-hound upon the <U+017F>cent of the
man, and caus'd him to be follow'd
by a Servant or two, the Ma<U+017F>ter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
thinking it al<U+017F>o fit to go after
them to <U+017F>ee the event; which was,
that the Dog, without ever <U+017F>eeing the
Man he was to pur<U+017F>ue, follow'd him
by the <U+017F>cent to the above-mentioned
places, notwith<U+017F>tanding the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Market-people that went along
in the <U+017F>ame way, and of Travellers
that had occa<U+017F>ion to cro<U+017F>s it. And
when the Blood-hound came to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:79"/>
chief Market-town, he pa<U+017F>s'd through
the <U+017F>treets, without taking notice of
any of the people there, and left not
till he had gone to the Hou<U+017F>e, where
the Man, he <U+017F>ought, re<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elf,
and found him in an upper Room to
the wonder of tho<U+017F>e that follow'd him.
The particulars of this Narrative the
Nobleman's Wife, a per<U+017F>on of great
veracity, that happen'd to be with
him when the tryal was made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to me.</p>
                     <p>Enquiring of a <U+017F>tudious per<U+017F>on,
that was Keeper of a Red-dear-park
and vers'd in making Blood-hounds,
in how long time, after a Man or
Deer had pa<U+017F>s'd by a gra<U+017F><U+017F>y place, one
of tho<U+017F>e Dogs would be able to follow
him by the <U+017F>cent? He told me,
that it would be <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even Hours:
Whereupon an ingenious Gentleman,
that chanc'd to be pre<U+017F>ent, and liv'd
near that Park, a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us both, that
he had old Dogs of <U+017F>o good a <U+017F>cent,
that if a Buck had the day before
pa<U+017F>s'd in a Wood, they will, when
they come where the <U+017F>cent lies,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:80"/>
though at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance of time
after, pre<U+017F>ently find the <U+017F>cent and
run directly to that part of the Wood
where the Buck is. He al<U+017F>o told me,
that though an old Blood-hound will
not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily fix on the <U+017F>cent of a <U+017F>ingle
Deer, that pre<U+017F>ently hides him<U+017F>elf in
a whole herd; yet if the Deer be
chas'd a little till he be heated, the
Dog will go nigh to <U+017F>ingle him out,
though the whole herd al<U+017F>o be chas'd.
The above-nam'd Gentleman al<U+017F>o af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
that he could ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h
whether his Hounds were in cha<U+017F>e
of a Hare or a Fox by their way of
running, and their holding up their
No<U+017F>e higher than ordinary when they
pur<U+017F>ue a Fox, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>cent is more
<U+017F>trong. The<U+017F>e Relations will not be
judg'd incredible by him that reflects
on <U+017F>ome of the In<U+017F>tances that have
already (in the foregoing E<U+017F><U+017F>ay) been
given of the <U+017F>trange <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia:</hi>
To which I <U+017F>hall now add,
that I remember, that to try whether
I could in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure make Art
imitate Nature, I prepared a Body
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:80"/>
of a vegetable <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which,
though it were actually cold, and
both to the Eye and Touch dry, did
for a while emit <U+017F>uch determinate and
piercing, though invi<U+017F>ible, Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that having for Tryals <U+017F>ake
applied to it a clear Metalline Plate
(and that of none of the very <U+017F>ofte<U+017F>t
kind neither) for about one Minute of
an Hour, I found, that, though there
had<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> been no immediate contact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, I having pur<U+017F>po<U+017F>ely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo<U+017F>ed
a piece of Paper to hinder it;
yet there was imprinted on the <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Plate a con<U+017F>picuous <U+017F>tain
of that peculiar colour, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with who<U+017F>e Steams I had imbued
the vegetable <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, was fitted
to give a Plate of that mix'd Metal.
And though it be true, that in <U+017F>ome
circum<U+017F>tances, the lately mention'd
In<U+017F>tances about Blood-hounds have
a con<U+017F>iderable advantage of this I
have now recited; yet that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is much le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd, not to <U+017F>ay coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail'd,
by <U+017F>ome circum<U+017F>tances of
our Experiment. For, not to repeat,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44036:81"/>
that the emittent Body was firm
and cold, the Effect produced by the
Effluvium that guided the Setting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog,
was wrought upon the Sen<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a living and warm Animal;
and <U+017F>uch an one, who<U+017F>e organs of
Smelling are of an extraordinary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Con<U+017F>titution above tho<U+017F>e of Men
and other Animals, and probably
the Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion was but tran<U+017F>ient;
whereas in our ca<U+017F>e the invi<U+017F>ible
Steams of the vegetable <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
wrought upon a Body which was
of <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and inorganical a Texture
as a (compounded) Metal, though it
were fenc'd by being lapt up in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
notwith<U+017F>tanding which the<U+017F>e
Steams invaded it in <U+017F>uch numbers,
and <U+017F>o notably, as to make their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on it manife<U+017F>t to the Eye, and
con<U+017F>iderably permanent too; <U+017F>ince
coming to look upon the Plate after
the third day, I found the induced
Colour yet con<U+017F>picuous, and not like
<U+017F>uddenly to vani<U+017F>h.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto in this <hi>Chapter</hi> I have
argued from the con<U+017F>tant and <U+017F>etled
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44036:81"/>
difference of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Qualities of
Effluviums, that they do not always
lo<U+017F>e their di<U+017F>tinct natures, when they
<U+017F>eem to have lo<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hing
into Air. But before I di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>s
this Subject, I mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider an
Objection, which I know may be
made again<U+017F>t the Opinion we have
been countenancing. For it may be
alledg'd, that there may be many
ca<U+017F>es, wherein the Effluviums of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are, in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the
Air, <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly alter'd, or do affect the
Organs of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e otherwi<U+017F>e than each
kind of them apart would do: Nor
is this difficulty altogether irrational.
For it <U+017F>eems con<U+017F>onant enough to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould
be admitted, and therefore in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I have, where I
thought it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, forborn to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
my <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch general and ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
terms, as otherwi<U+017F>e I might have
done. But, as for <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es as I have
in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted upon, and many more, I <U+017F>hall
now repre<U+017F>ent, that the objected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
need not hinder, but that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44036:82"/>
Effluviums at their fir<U+017F>t parting from
the Bodies, whence they take wing
(if I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak,) may retain as
much of the nature of tho<U+017F>e Bodies,
as we have a<U+017F>cribed to them, <U+017F>ince
the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent change may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be deduc'd from the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or coalitions of divers Steams
a<U+017F><U+017F>ociating them<U+017F>elves in the Air,
and acting upon the Sen<U+017F>ory, either
altogether and conjointly, or at lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>o near it, that the Sen<U+017F>e cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Operations as di<U+017F>tinct.
This I <U+017F>hall elucidate, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to prove, by what happens in
Sounds and Ta<U+017F>ts. For if, by way
of in<U+017F>tance, in a Mu<U+017F>ical in<U+017F>trument,
two <U+017F>trings tun'd to an eight, be
touch'd together, they will <U+017F>trike the
Ear with a <U+017F>ound, that will be judg'd
one, as well as plea<U+017F>ing, though each
of the trembling <U+017F>trings make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinct
noi<U+017F>e, and the one vibrates as
fa<U+017F>t again as the other. And if, into
Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> you drop
a due proportion of Spirit of Nitre,
and exhale the <U+017F>uperfluous moi<U+017F>ture,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44036:82"/>
the Acid and Alcalizate Corpu<U+017F>cles,
that were <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall as to <U+017F>wim invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
in tho<U+017F>e liquors, will convene
into Nitrous Concretions, who<U+017F>e
ta<U+017F>t will be compounded of, but very
differing from, both the ta<U+017F>ts of the
Acid and Tartareous Particles; which
Particles may yet, for the mo<U+017F>t part,
by a skilful Di<U+017F>tillation, be divorc'd
again. And <U+017F>o, if to a <U+017F>trong <U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pot-a<U+017F>hes or Salt of Tartar
you put as much in weight of <hi>Sal
Armoniack,</hi> as there is of either of tho<U+017F>e
fixt Salts contain'd in the liquor;
you may, be<U+017F>ides a <U+017F>ubtil Urinous
Spirit that will ea<U+017F>ily come over in
the di<U+017F>tillation, obtain a dry <hi>Caput
mortuum,</hi> which is almo<U+017F>t totally a
compounded Salt, differing enough
from either of the ingredients, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Alcalizate, as well in Ta<U+017F>t
as in <U+017F>ome other Qualities: This Salt
(free'd from its <hi>faeces)</hi> being that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick
Salt, I <U+017F>everal years ago gave
quantities of, to <U+017F>ome Chymi<U+017F>ts and
Phy<U+017F>icians, from the mo<U+017F>t of whom
I received great thanks, accompanied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44036:83"/>
with the (more acceptable) accounts
of the very happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s they had
employed it with, though u<U+017F>ually but
in a <U+017F>mall Do<U+017F>e, as from <U+017F>ix, eight or
ten Grains to a Scruple. But this
being mentioned only upon the by,
I <U+017F>hall proceed to tell you, that, <U+017F>ince
I intimated to you already, that I
would mention Examples of <hi>Sounds</hi>
and <hi>Tasts</hi> only to illu<U+017F>trate what I
had been delivering; I <U+017F>hall now add
<U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tances by way of Proof, of
the Coalition and re<U+017F>ulting change
of Steams in the Air. 'Tis ea<U+017F>ily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervable
in <U+017F>ome No<U+017F>e-gays, where
the differing Flowers happen to be
conveniently mix'd, that in the <U+017F>mell
afforded by it, at a due di<U+017F>tance, the
Odours of the particular Flowers are
not perceiv'd, but the Organ is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by their joynt-action, which
makes on it a confu<U+017F>ed but delightful
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. And <U+017F>o, when in a Ball
of Pomander, or a perfum'd Skin,
Musk, and Amber, and Civet, and
other <U+017F>weets are skilfully mix'd, the
coalition of the di<U+017F>tinct <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44036:83"/>
ingredients, that a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate them<U+017F>elves
in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the Air, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in the Sen<U+017F>ory one grateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume,
re<U+017F>ulting from all tho<U+017F>e Odours.
But if you take Spirit of fermented
Urine and Spirit of Wine, both of
them Phelgmatick, and mix them
together, they will incorporate like
Wine and Water, or any other <U+017F>uch
liquors, without affording any dry
concretions. But if you expo<U+017F>e them
in a convenient Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el but to the
mild heat of a Bath or Lamp, the
a<U+017F>cending Particles will a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate
them<U+017F>elves, and adhere to the upper
part of the Gla<U+017F>s in the form of a
white but tender Sublimate, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both of Urinous and Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated into a mixture, which
differs from either of the liquors, not
only in Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, Ta<U+017F>t and Smell,
but in <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>iderable Operations
performable by this odd mixture;
which, this is not the place, to take
further notice of. And if Spirit of
Salt and Spirit of Nitre be, by Di<U+017F>til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
elevated in the form of Fumes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44036:84"/>
<U+017F>o order'd as to convene into one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in the Receiver, this liquor will
readily di<U+017F><U+017F>olve crude Gold, though
neither the Spirit of Nitre alone, nor
that of Salt would do <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>And that you may have an ocular
proof of the Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of the di<U+017F>tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent Commixture of
Steams in the Air; I <U+017F>hall now
add an Experiment, which I long
<U+017F>ince devis'd for that purpo<U+017F>e, and
which I <U+017F>oon after <U+017F>hew'd to many
curious per<U+017F>ons, mo<U+017F>t of whom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>urpriz'd at it.
The Experiment was; that I took
two <U+017F>mall Vials, the one fill'd with
Spirit of Salt, but not very <U+017F>trong,
the other with Spirit of fermented
Urine or of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> very well
rectified: The<U+017F>e Vials being plac'd
at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance, and not being <U+017F>top'd,
each liquor afforded its own <U+017F>mell,
at a pretty di<U+017F>tance, by the Steams it
emitted into the Air, but yet the<U+017F>e
Steams were invi<U+017F>ible. But when
the<U+017F>e Vials, (which <U+017F>hould be of the
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>ize) came to be approach'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44036:84"/>
very near to each other, though not
<U+017F>o, as to touch; <hi>as</hi> when the two
liquors are put together in the form
of liquors, they will notably act upon
one another; <hi><U+017F>o</hi> their re<U+017F>pective Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums
meeting in the Air, would,
an<U+017F>werably to the littlene<U+017F>s of their
bulk, do the like, and, by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
occur<U+017F>ions, become manife<U+017F>tly
vi<U+017F>ible, and appear moving in the
Air like a little portion of Smoak or
of a Mi<U+017F>t, which would quickly cea<U+017F>e,
if either of the Vials were remov'd
half a Foot or a Foot from the other.
And I remember, that, to add to
the oddne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made a drop of the Spirit of
Salt hang at the bottom of a little
<U+017F>tick of Gla<U+017F>s or <U+017F>ome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Body, and held this drop thus
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in the Orifice of a Vial
that had Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> in it,
and was furni<U+017F>h'd with a <U+017F>omewhat
long neck; for by this means it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
as I expected, that the a<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Urinous Particles, though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
before, invading plentifully the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:85"/>
Acid ones of the drop, produced a
notable Smoak, which, if the drop
were held a little above the neck of
the Gla<U+017F>s, would mo<U+017F>t commonly fly
upwards to the height of a Foot or
half a Yard: But if the drop were
held <U+017F>omewhat deep within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the neck, a good part of the
produced Smoak would oftentimes
fall into the Cavity of the Vial, which
was left in great part empty, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the form of drops, but u<U+017F>ually
in the form of a <U+017F>lender and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
winding <U+017F>tream of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that <U+017F>eem'd to flow down ju<U+017F>t
like a Liquor from the depending
drop, till it had reach'd the Spirit of
<hi>Sal Armoniack;</hi> upon who<U+017F>e <U+017F>urface
it would <U+017F>pread it <U+017F>elf like a Mi<U+017F>t.
But this only upon the by. As for
the main Experiment it <U+017F>elf, it may
be, as I have found, <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully try'd
with other Liquors than the<U+017F>e; but
'tis not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in this place to give
an account of <U+017F>uch Tryals; though
perhaps, if I had lei<U+017F>ure, it might be
worth while to con<U+017F>ider, whether
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:85"/>
the<U+017F>e Coalitions of differing <U+017F>orts of
Steams in the Air, and the Changes
re<U+017F>ulting thence of their particular
precedent Quantities, may not a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t

may be copiou<U+017F>ly impregnated by the

other Morbifick Corpu<U+017F>cles, and
<hi><U+017F>ometimes</hi> with others of a contrary
Nature, and <hi><U+017F>ometimes</hi> too perhaps,
neither the one <U+017F>ort of Steams, which
may be <U+017F>uppos'd to have imbued the
Air, is in it <U+017F>elf <hi>deleterious;</hi> nor the
other <hi><U+017F>alutary,</hi> but becomes <U+017F>o upon
their ca<U+017F>ual coalition in the Air. You

two <U+017F>orts of Particles, whereof one
was of a highly noxious nature, a

I hope what I have lately recited
about the Coalitions of the <hi>Effluvia</hi>
of Spirit of Salt and of Urine (Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
known to be highly contrary
to each other) is not already forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by you.</p>
                     <p>And the Experiment with which
I am to conclude this E<U+017F><U+017F>ay will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
make you think it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that
the Pe<U+017F>tiferous Steams that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pa<U+017F>s'd out of the Air, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,
but not too much vitiated, the
Bodies of Men, may have their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
much debilitated by the <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening
of the<U+017F>e Antidotal Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
For in that Experiment you
will find, that the Steams emitted
into the Air from the Liquor there
de<U+017F>cribed, though that were actually
cold, were able to reach, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>tly
to Operate, (and that probably
by way of Praecipitation,) upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
that were fenc'd from them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44036:89"/>
by the Interpo<U+017F>ition of other Bodies;
not more porous than tho<U+017F>e of living
Men. Whether the fume of Sulphur,
which by many is extoll'd to prevent
the Infection of the Air, do by its
acid or other Particles di<U+017F>arm, if
I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak, the Pe<U+017F>tilential ones,
I have not now time to inquire:
No more than whether in <hi>Ireland</hi>
and <U+017F>ome few other Countries, that
breed or brook no poy<U+017F>onous Animals,
that ho<U+017F>tility may proceed, at lea<U+017F>t
in great part, from the peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Soyl, which both from its
<U+017F>uperficial and deeper parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantly
<U+017F>upplies the Air with Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles
de<U+017F>tructive to venemous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
And <U+017F>ome other Particulars,
that may be pertinently enough con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
here, you may find treated on in
other Papers. And therefore at pre<U+017F>ent
I <U+017F>hall only intimate in a word, that
having purpo<U+017F>ely made a vi<U+017F>ible and
la<U+017F>ting Stain on a <U+017F>olid Body barely
by cold <hi>Effluvia,</hi> I did by the invi<U+017F>ible

make in two or three Minutes a

vi<U+017F>ible change in the colour of that
Stain.</p>
                     <p>And as for the other part of the
Conjecture, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Meteors
may <U+017F>ometimes be produc'd by the
Occur<U+017F>ions of Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
<U+017F>ome of them of one determinate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and <U+017F>ome of another, I think
I could, to countenance it, give you

of the Air at <U+017F>ome times,
and in <U+017F>ome places, with Steams of

I <U+017F>hall add, that having de<U+017F>ir'd an

a con<U+017F>iderable Employment to the
<hi>Ea<U+017F>t-Indies,</hi> to make <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for me in his Voyage; he <U+017F>ent
me among other things this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque:
That having <U+017F>ayl'd along
the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> (famous for Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-trees
and well-<U+017F>cented Gums,)
though they Coa<U+017F>ted it almo<U+017F>t a whole
day, the Wind, that then chanc'd
to blow from the <U+017F>hoar, brought them
a manife<U+017F>tly odoriferous Air from the
I<U+017F>land, though they kept off many
miles (perhaps twenty or twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five)
from the <U+017F>hoar. Nor <U+017F>hould this
be thought incredible, becau<U+017F>e the
diffu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>eems <U+017F>o di<U+017F>proportionate to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:91"/>
that of other Bodies di<U+017F><U+017F>olved by
Fluids; as, for in<U+017F>tance, though Salt
be an active Body and re<U+017F>oluble into
abundance of minute Particles, yet
one part of Salt will <U+017F>carce be ta<U+017F>table
in an hundred parts of Water. For
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to affect <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>s an Organ as
that of our Ta<U+017F>t, there is u<U+017F>ually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in <U+017F>apid Particles a bigne<U+017F>s far
exceeding that which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to
the making Bodies fit Objects for the
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Smelling, and, which is here
mainly to be con<U+017F>idered, there is a
great difference between the power
a Body has to impregnate <U+017F>o thin and
fine a Fluid as Air, who<U+017F>e parts are
<U+017F>o rare and lax, and that which it has
to impregnate Liquors, <U+017F>uch as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Wine, who<U+017F>e parts are <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tipated
as to make it not only vi<U+017F>ible
and tangible, but ponderous. On
which occa<U+017F>ion I remember that
having had a Curio<U+017F>ity to try how
far a <U+017F>apid Body could be diluted
without cea<U+017F>ing to be <U+017F>o, I found by
Tryal, that one drop of good Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
and, as Arti<U+017F>ts call it, E<U+017F><U+017F>ential
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44036:92"/>
Oyl of Cinnamon being duly mix'd
by the help of Sugar with Wine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the determinate ta<U+017F>t of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
though it were diffus'd into near
a quart of Wine. So that making
a moderate e<U+017F>timate, I concluded, that
upon the common <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which a drop is reckon'd
for a Grain, one part of Oyl had given
the <U+017F>pecifick Ta<U+017F>t of the Spice, it was
drawn from, to near fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
parts of Wine. By comparing
which Experiment with what I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about the proportion of Salt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite
to make Water ta<U+017F>t of it, you
will ea<U+017F>ily perceive; that there may
be a very great difference in point of
diffu<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s between the little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that make Bodies <U+017F>apid: Which

what I was lately <U+017F>aying to <U+017F>hew it

which both I, and others perceived
to be imbued with the di<U+017F>tinct <U+017F>cent
of Cinnamon, and which perhaps
the Liquor would have been found
able to have Aromatized for I know

on another occa<U+017F>ion, given
<U+017F>ome Examples. To which I <U+017F>hall

and <U+017F>ome of them <U+017F>trongly enough.
And the Learned <hi>Sennertus</hi> <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
affirms, that <U+017F>ome will be
purg'd by the very Odour of <hi>Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this.</hi>
And 'tis not to be pa<U+017F>s'd by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44036:96"/>
unregarded; that in the ca<U+017F>es I have
alledg'd, Exhalations, that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with Occult Qualities, (for
tho<U+017F>e of Cathartick Medicines are
reckon'd among <U+017F>uch) a<U+017F>cend into

I could give In<U+017F>tances, not only
of the <hi>Purgative,</hi> but the <hi>Emetick</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of <U+017F>ome Medicines exerted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

or injected with In<U+017F>truments.</p>
                     <p>There are al<U+017F>o other <U+017F>orts of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
than tho<U+017F>e hitherto mentioned,
that argue a Determinate Nature in
the Effluxions of <U+017F>ome Bodies emitted
into the Air. Approv'd Writers tell
us, that the Shadow of a Walnut-tree
with the Leaves on it is very hurtful
to the Head; and <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tances
they give us of great mi<U+017F>chief it has
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44036:97"/>
<U+017F>ometimes done. And though the
Shadow, as <U+017F>uch, is not likely to be
guilty of <U+017F>uch bad Effects; yet the
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the neighbouring Plant
may be noxious enough to the Head.
For I, that was not at all prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd
with an opinion that it was <U+017F>o, and
therefore without <U+017F>cruple re<U+017F>orted to
the Shade of Walnut trees in a hot
Countrey, was by experience forc'd
to think it might give others the
Head-ach, <U+017F>ince it did to me, who,
thanks be to God, both was, and am
<U+017F>till very little <U+017F>ubject to that di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
And this brings into my mind
an Ob<U+017F>ervation that I have met with
among <U+017F>ome ingenious Travellers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>We<U+017F>t-Indies,</hi> who ob<U+017F>erve in
general, and of late a Country-man
of our own affirms it in particular,
of the poy<U+017F>onous <hi>Manchinello-tree,</hi>
that Birds will not only forbear to
eat of the Fruit of venemous Plants,
but, as to <U+017F>ome of them, will not <U+017F>o
much as light on the Trees: Which
I therefore mention, becau<U+017F>e proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Nature in<U+017F>tructs them to avoid
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44036:97"/>
<U+017F>uch Trees by <U+017F>ome noxious Smell,
or other Emanation, that offends the
approaching Birds. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that <U+017F>ome of our Navigators give
it for a Rule to tho<U+017F>e that happen to
land in unknown I<U+017F>lands or Coa<U+017F>ts,
that they may venture to eat of tho<U+017F>e
parts of Fruits which they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the Birds, like kind Ta<U+017F>ters, to
have been pecking at before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolaus Florentinus</hi> (cited by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus)</hi>

that having in a Hou<U+017F>e, that he nam'd,
at <hi>Florence,</hi> burn'd a great black Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the flame of a Candle, <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily,
that he drew in the Steams
of it at his No<U+017F>trils, pre<U+017F>ently began
to be much di<U+017F>order'd and fell into
a fainting fit, and for the whole
night had his Heart much di<U+017F>affected,
his Pul<U+017F>e being <U+017F>o weak, that one
could <U+017F>carce perceive he had any;
though afterwards he was cured by
Treacle, Diamo<U+017F>e, and the powder
of Zedoary mixt together.</p>
                     <p>And I remember, that being <U+017F>ome
years ago in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I gather'd a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44036:98"/>
certain Plant (peculiar to <U+017F>ome parts
of that Countrey) which the Natives
call <hi>Maccu-buy,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>trange
Traditions that go about it; the chief
of which I found by tryal not to be
true: But yet being <U+017F>atisfied, that its
Operations were odd and violent
enough, I was willing to gratifie the
chief Phy<U+017F>ician of the Countrey, who
was de<U+017F>irous I <U+017F>hould propo<U+017F>e to him
<U+017F>ome wayes of correcting it; and
whil<U+017F>t I was <U+017F>peaking of one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the pounding of it, he told
me on that occa<U+017F>ion, that intending
to make an extract of it with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
he caus'd his man to beat it well
in a Mortar, which the man <U+017F>oon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
he had begun to do: And
the Doctor him<U+017F>elf, though at a pretty
di<U+017F>tance off, was <U+017F>o wrought upon
by the Corpu<U+017F>cles that i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out into
the Air, that his Head, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
his Face, <U+017F>well'd to an enormous
and disfiguring bulk, and continued
tumid for no incon<U+017F>iderable time

                     <p>I have not lei<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ubjoyn many
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44036:98"/>
more In<U+017F>tances to <U+017F>hew the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate

nor perhaps will it be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, if

of their whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, perfume
Skins, Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> <U+017F>o they will in
time perfume <U+017F>ome Bodies di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed
to admit their action, though kept
at a di<U+017F>tance from them. And the
<hi>other</hi> is, that in Pe<U+017F>tilential Feavers
and divers other Contagious <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
as the Plague, Small-pox, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els,
the <U+017F>ame determinate Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is
communicable to found per<U+017F>ons, not
only by the immediate contact of the
infected party; but without it, by
the Contagious Steams that exhale
from his Body into the Air. And
having <U+017F>aid this and de<U+017F>ir'd you to
reflect upon it, I <U+017F>hall conclude this

though with the written <U+017F>ide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ju<U+017F>t upon or over the orifice
of the Vial, though the contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
did not by <U+017F>ome Inches reach
<U+017F>o high, yet the latent Letters would
become not only legible but con<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in about a quarter of a Minute
of an Hour (mea<U+017F>ur'd by a good
Watch fit for the purpo<U+017F>e, as more
than one tryal a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me.) And as
it may be ob<U+017F>erv'd, that in <U+017F>ome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances
the <U+017F>moaking Liquor and
the Solution of Sublimate will make
an odd Precipitate almo<U+017F>t of a <U+017F>ilveri<U+017F>h
colour, <U+017F>o in one or two of our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
we found a like colour produc'd,
by the Steams of that Liquor, in <U+017F>ome
of the colourle<U+017F>s Ink. Nor is it <U+017F>o ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to employ a vi<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>moaking
Liquor for the denigrating of invi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ink at a di<U+017F>tance. For I have,
to that purpo<U+017F>e, with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s,
though not equal to that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
employ'd a couple of Liquors,
wherein there was neither Sulphur,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44036:100"/>
nor <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> nor Sublimate.
What other Tryals I made with our
Volatile Tincture of Sulphur, 'tis not
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary here to relate, only one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
which you will po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
think odd enough, I <U+017F>hall not omit;
becau<U+017F>e it will not only confirm the
precedent Tryals, but al<U+017F>o much of
the foregoing E<U+017F><U+017F>ay, by <U+017F>hewing the
great Subtilty and penetrating power
of Effluviums that <U+017F>eem rather to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue
out very faintly, than to be darted
out with any briskne<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>Cau<U+017F>ing then <U+017F>omething to be
written with di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd Sublimate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a piece of Paper, we folded the
Paper with the written <U+017F>ide inwards,
and then inclos'd this in the mid<U+017F>t of
<U+017F>ix <U+017F>heets of Paper, laid one upon
another, not plac'd one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and folded up in the form of
an ordinary Letter or packet to be
<U+017F>eal'd, that, the edges of the enclo<U+017F>ing
Paper being in<U+017F>erted one within the
other, the Fumes might not get into
this written Paper but by penetrating
through the Leaves them<U+017F>elves: This
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44036:101"/>
done, that <U+017F>ide of the Packet, on which
there was no commi<U+017F><U+017F>ure, and on
which, were it to be <U+017F>ent away, the
Super<U+017F>cription <U+017F>hould be written,
was laid upon the orifice of the Vial,
which (as was before intimated) was
<U+017F>ome Inches higher than the <U+017F>urface
of the Liquor, and left there about
ten Minutes; after which taking off
the folded Papers, and opening them,
we found, that the Steams had perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the Leaves, in which the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Paper had been enclos'd. For,
though the Leaves did not appear
<U+017F>tain'd or alter'd, yet the formerly
latent Characters appear'd con<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.
I have not time to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
whether and how far this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us to explain <U+017F>ome
odd Effects of Thunder, or of that
<U+017F>trange <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> (glanc'd at in the
foregoing Chapter,) which is <U+017F>aid to
have happen'd lately in the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples</hi> after the great Eruption of
<hi>Ve<U+017F>uvitus,</hi> which is <U+017F>aid to have been
follow'd by the appearing of the
Cro<U+017F><U+017F>es formerly mention'd, <U+017F>ome of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44036:101"/>
which have been found on the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
parts of Linnen, that had been
carefully folded up. But of the<U+017F>e and the
like things, I <U+017F>ay, I have now no time
to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, whether any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable
from our Experiment may be
pertinently apply'd to their Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For which rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hall add
no more than that afterwards for
further tryal we took a printed Book,
that chanc'd to be at hand, and which
we judg'd the fitte<U+017F>t for our purpo<U+017F>e,
becau<U+017F>e the leaves being broad they
might the better pre<U+017F>erve a <U+017F>mall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be plac'd in the mid'<U+017F>t of them
from being acce<U+017F><U+017F>ible to the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<U+017F>idewi<U+017F>e, and having put the
de<U+017F>ign'd Paper into this Book, and
held it to the orifice of the Vial,
though there were no le<U+017F>s than twelve
leaves between them; yet tho<U+017F>e Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that happen'd to be the mo<U+017F>t
rightly plac'd, were made inky in
the <U+017F>hort <U+017F>pace of three Minutes at
the utmo<U+017F>t; though this Liquor had
been <U+017F>o long kept and <U+017F>o often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>top'd
to try Conclu<U+017F>ions with it,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44036:102"/>
that it had probably lo<U+017F>t a good part

PREFACE;
SHEWING
The Motive, De<U+017F>ign, and Parts
of the en<U+017F>uing Tract.</head>
                  <p>THE Inducements which put me
upon the Attempt, expre<U+017F>s'd in
the Title of this <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay,</hi> were
chiefly the<U+017F>e:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> I con<U+017F>ider'd, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellar
part of the Univer<U+017F>e, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of
Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> or Fluids analogous to
one of them, is diaphanous; and that the
<hi>Aether</hi> is, as it were, a va<U+017F>t Ocean,
wherein the Luminous globes, that here
and there like Fi<U+017F>hes <hi><U+017F>wim</hi> by their own
motion, or like Bodies in Whirlpools are
<hi>carried about</hi> by the Ambient, are but
very thinly di<U+017F>pers'd, and con<U+017F>equently
that the proportion, that the Fixt Stars
<pb facs="tcp:44036:104"/>
and Planetary Bodies bear to the diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
part of the World, is exceeding <U+017F>mall
and <U+017F>carce con<U+017F>iderable; though we <U+017F>hould
admit the Sun and Fixt Stars to be Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
Bodies upon the account of their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
our <U+017F>ight: Which diffident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
I employ, becau<U+017F>e I have el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<U+017F>hewn by two or three Experiments,
purpo<U+017F>ely devi<U+017F>ed, that a Body may appear
<hi>opacous</hi> to our Eyes, and yet allow free
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the beams of Light.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>further</hi> con<U+017F>ider'd, that there being
<U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a di<U+017F>proportion between the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
part of the World and the Globes,
about which 'tis every way diffu<U+017F>ed, and
with which it is <U+017F>ometimes in great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mingled, as in the water, which
together with the Earth makes up the
Globe we inhabit; and the nature of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
Bodies being <U+017F>uch, that, when
the Sun or any other Luminous Body
illu<U+017F>trates them, that which we call Light
does <U+017F>o penetrate and mix it <U+017F>elf <hi>per
minima</hi> with them, that there is no
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible part of the tran<U+017F>parent Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inlightned;
I thought it worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
whether a thing, <U+017F>o va<U+017F>tly diffu<U+017F>ed
<pb facs="tcp:44036:104"/>
as Light is were <U+017F>ome thing Corporeal or
not? And whether, in ca<U+017F>e it be, it may
be <U+017F>ubjected to <U+017F>ome other of our Sen<U+017F>es
be<U+017F>ides our <hi>Sight,</hi> whereby we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
whether it hath any affinity with
other Corporeal beings, that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with here below?</p>
                  <p>I did not all this while forget, that
the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> make Light a meer
Quality, and that <hi>Carte<U+017F>ius</hi> ingeniou<U+017F>ly
endeavours to explicate it by a modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Motion in an Aetherial matter:
But I remember'd too, that the <hi>Atomi<U+017F>ts</hi>
of old, and of late the Learned <hi>Gaffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
and many other Philo<U+017F>ophers a<U+017F><U+017F>ert
Light to be Corporeal; and that <U+017F>ome Tears
<U+017F>ince, though I declined to pa<U+017F>s my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about the Question, yet I had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
Arguments, that appear'd plau<U+017F>ible
enough to <U+017F>hew, That 'twas not ab<U+017F>urd
to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that the Sun, which is the Fixt
Star mo<U+017F>t known to us, might be a Fiery
Body. And therefore doubting, whether
the Corporeity of Light would be in ha<U+017F>te
Determined by meer Ratiocinations, I
thought it very well worth the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to try whether I could do any
<pb facs="tcp:44036:105"/>
thing towards clearing the di<U+017F>pute of it
by Experiments; e<U+017F>pecially being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded,
that, though <U+017F>uch an attempt
<U+017F>hould be ineffectual, it would but leave
the controver<U+017F>ie in its former state,
without prejudicing either of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es;</hi> and yet, if it
<U+017F>hould prove <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful, the con<U+017F>equences
of it would be very great and u<U+017F>eful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the explicating of divers <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
in divers parts of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy,
as in Chymi<U+017F>try, <hi>Botanicks,</hi> and
(if there be any <U+017F>uch) the allowable part
of A<U+017F>trologie. (Nor perhaps would it
be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible by the help of <U+017F>light Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
alterations; to reconcile the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I de<U+017F>ign'd, to either of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es,</hi> and <U+017F>o as to the
Explication of Light, to one another.)</p>
                  <p>To compa<U+017F>s then, what I aim'd at,
I thought, 'twas fit in the fir<U+017F>t place to
try, what I could do by the Union of the
Sun-beams, they being on all hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s'd
to be Portions (as I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak)
of true and Cele<U+017F>tial <hi>Light:</hi> And then,
I thought fit to try, what could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from <hi>Flame;</hi> not only becau<U+017F>e
<pb facs="tcp:44036:105"/>
                     <hi>that</hi> is acknowledg'd to be a Luminary
but becau<U+017F>e I hoped, the difficulties, I
fore<U+017F>aw in the other Tryals, might be in
<U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure avoided in tho<U+017F>e made with
Flame; and if both <U+017F>orts of them <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>ucceed, the later and former would <U+017F>erve
to confirm each other. According to the
Method I propo<U+017F>ed of handling the<U+017F>e two
Subjects, I <U+017F>hould begin with <U+017F>ome account
of what I attempted to perform in the
Sun-beams: But the truth is, that
when I chanc'd to fall upon the Enquiry
that occa<U+017F>ion'd this Paper, be<U+017F>ides that
the time of the Year it <U+017F>elf was not
over-favourable, the weather proved <U+017F>o
extraordinary dark and un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable that
it was wonder'd at; <U+017F>o that, though I
was furni<U+017F>h'd with good Burning-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and did <U+017F>everal times begin to make tryals
upon divers Bodies, as Lead, Quick<U+017F>ilver,
Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
of Clouds and Mi<U+017F>ts did <U+017F>o di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour
my Attempts, that, however they
were not all alike defeated, yet I could
not pro<U+017F>ecute the greate<U+017F>t part of them
to my own <U+017F>atisfaction. And therefore
being unwilling to build on them as yet;
<pb facs="tcp:44036:106"/>
I <U+017F>hall re<U+017F>erve an account of them for
another opportunity; and now proceed to
the mention of that <U+017F>ort of Experiments
which depending le<U+017F>s on Ca<U+017F>ualities, 'twas
more in my power to bring to an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue.</p>
                  <p>I know I might have <U+017F>aved both you and
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome time and pains by omitting
<U+017F>everal of the<U+017F>e Tryals, and by a more
compendious way of delivering the re<U+017F>t.
But I rather cho<U+017F>e the cour<U+017F>e I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
<hi>partly</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Novelty and
Improbabilities of the Truth I deliver
<U+017F>eems to require, that it be made out
by a good number of Tryals; <hi>partly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I thought it might not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s to you and your Friends, to
<U+017F>ee upon what Inducements the <U+017F>everal
steps were made in this Inquiry; <hi>partly</hi>
becau<U+017F>e I was willing to contribute <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards the Hi<U+017F>tory that now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will be thought fit to be made of
the Increment or Decrement that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Bodies may receive by being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to the Fire; and <hi>partly</hi> (in fine)
becau<U+017F>e the Incongruity of the Doctrine
here a<U+017F><U+017F>erted to the Opinions of the

<pb facs="tcp:44036:106"/>
of Mankind, made me think it fit by
a con<U+017F>iderable Variety, as well as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
of Experiments to obviate, as far
as may be, the differing Objections and

<U+017F>hould have been able by Reduction,
<U+017F>pecifick Gravity, or any other of the
ways, which I had in my thoughts,
to make any di<U+017F>covery of the Nature

keeps me from pretending to know.

them to be put into a <U+017F>mall Retort

directions with the Laborant what
to do, becau<U+017F>e I was my <U+017F>elf call'd
abroad, at my return he brought me
together with the Gla<U+017F>s, this Account:
That he had kept it over and upon

then <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the danger of breaking

                        <p>One Experiment there is, which,
though it might have come in
more properly at another place, is
not to be omitted in this becau<U+017F>e it

in the foregoing Experiments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
tho<U+017F>e made on Lead and Tin
in <U+017F>eal'd Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, there may not be
more of the Fire adherent to or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with the Body expos'd
to it, than one would conclude
barely from the recited Increments
of their Weight. For having taken
very <U+017F>trong fre<U+017F>h Quick-lime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
on purpo<U+017F>e for choice Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and expos'd it, before the Air
had time to <U+017F>lake it, upon the Cupel,
to a <U+017F>trong fire where it was kept
for two hours; I found that it had
increas'd in weight even <U+017F>omewhat
beyond my expectation: For being
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably put into the Ballance, the
Lumps that weigh'd, when expos'd,
but two Drachms, amounted to two
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44036:133"/>
Drachms and twenty-nine Grains;
which makes this Experiment a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
one to our purpo<U+017F>e. For by
this it appears, that notwith<U+017F>tanding
a Body may for many hours, or
even for <U+017F>ome days, be expos'd to
a very violent Fire, yet it may be
<U+017F>till capable of admitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
fre<U+017F>h Corpu<U+017F>cles; <U+017F>o that,
though well made Lime be u<U+017F>ually
ob<U+017F>erv'd to be much lighter than the
Stones whereof 'tis made; yet this
lightne<U+017F>s does not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily prove,
that, becau<U+017F>e a burnt Lime-<U+017F>tone has
lo<U+017F>t much of its matter by the Fire,
it has therefore acquir'd no matter
<hi>from</hi> the Fire; but only inferrs, that
it has lo<U+017F>t far more than it has got.
And this may give ground to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect,
that in mo<U+017F>t of the foregoing tryals
the acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the fiery Particles
was greater (though in <U+017F>ome more,
in others le<U+017F>s <U+017F>o,) than the Ballance
di<U+017F>cover'd; <U+017F>ince, for ought we know,
divers of the le<U+017F>s fixt Particles of the
expos'd Body might be driven away
by the vehemence of the Heat; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:133"/>
con<U+017F>equently the Igneous Corpu<U+017F>cles
that fa<U+017F>tned them<U+017F>elves to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
matter might be numerous
enough, not only to bring the acce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of Weight that was found by
the Scales, but to make amends for
all the fugitive Particles, that had
been expell'd by the violence of the
Fire. And <U+017F>ince <U+017F>o fixt a Body as
Quick-lime is capable of being
wrought upon by the Igneous <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
<U+017F>o as that they come to be as
'twere incorporated with it, it may
perchance be worth con<U+017F>idering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in other calcin'd or incinerated
Bodies the remaining <hi>Calces</hi> or A<U+017F>hes

to me, forbidding me to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,)
near two hours before the
Metal melted; after which he kept
the Retort near an hour and half
more with the Metal melted in it.
Then bringing it me to look upon,
I perceived a pretty deal of darki<U+017F>h
<hi>Calx</hi> at the bottom, and partly too
upon the <U+017F>urface of the far greater
part of the Metal, which now lay in
one Lump. The part of the Retort
that had been <U+017F>eal'd being broken off,
we fir<U+017F>t took out the <hi>Calx,</hi> and then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44036:137"/>
the Lump, and putting them into
the Scales, they had been formerly
weigh'd in, found them to have made
a very manife<U+017F>t acqui<U+017F>t of weight,
which, if both the Laborant and I
be not mi<U+017F>taken, (for the paper, which
<U+017F>hould inform us, is now mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing)
amounted to four grains and a half,
gained by the recited Operation.
Afterwards, we being grown more
expert in making <U+017F>uch Tryals, the
experiment was repeated with the
<U+017F>ame quantity of filings of the <U+017F>ame
Metal: At the end of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which in all la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>omewhat
above three hours) having broken off
the <U+017F>eal'd neck of the Retort, we
found, that a good proportion of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd
<hi>Calx</hi> had been produc'd.
This being weighed with the uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd
part of the Metal, the two
ounces we fir<U+017F>t put in appear'd to
have acquir'd no le<U+017F>s than eleven
grains and a half (and <U+017F>omewhat
better.)</p>
                     <p>Such Super<U+017F>tructures, both for
number and weight, may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44036:137"/>
in time be built on this and the like
Experiments, that I <U+017F>hall venture to
obviate even <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>cruple as is like
to be judg'd too Sceptical. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that, con<U+017F>idering upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
of <U+017F>ome of the Experiments
formerly recited, that though it were
very improbable, yet it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the increment
of Weight, acquir'd by Bodies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in Gla<U+017F>s-ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to the Fire,
might proceed, not from the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles
of Fire, but from the Particles of
the Gla<U+017F>s it <U+017F>elf, loo<U+017F>ened by the power
of <U+017F>o inten<U+017F>e a Heat, and forcibly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the inclos'd Body; I was
content to take a couple of Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,
whereof one was <U+017F>hap'd into a little
Retort, and having weigh'd them,
and then having kept them for a
con<U+017F>iderable time upon kindled Coals,
and then weigh'd them again, I
could gather little of certainty from
the Experiment, (the Retort at one
time <U+017F>eeming to have acquir'd above
half a grain in the fire,) <U+017F>ave that
there was no likelihood at all, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44036:138"/>
<U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable an increa<U+017F>e of weight,
as we divers times obtain'd in clo<U+017F>e

                     <p>Becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eems evident enough,
that, whatever Chymi<U+017F>ts tell us of

enough, having in it <U+017F>ome parts of

which Lamp, though furni<U+017F>hed with

The<U+017F>e things being in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine<U+017F>s,

                     <p>I offer it al<U+017F>o to Con<U+017F>ideration,
Whether this perviou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of Gla<U+017F>s,
even to the minute particles that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
it, and their adhe<U+017F>ion to the

imply Pores <hi>constantly</hi> great enough
to tran<U+017F>mit <U+017F>uch Corpu<U+017F>cles? or,
Whether it may not be <U+017F>aid, <hi>that</hi>
Gla<U+017F>s is generally of a clo<U+017F>er Texture,
than when in our Experiments the
pores are open'd by the vehement
Heat of the flame that beats upon it,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44036:142"/>
and in that <U+017F>tate may let pa<U+017F>s Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
too big to permeate Gla<U+017F>s in
its ordinary <U+017F>tate; and <hi>that</hi> this
penetration is much a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the
vehement agitation of the Igneous
parts, which by the rapidne<U+017F>s of their
motion both force them<U+017F>elves a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
through the narrow pores of
the Gla<U+017F>s, and pierce deep enough
into tho<U+017F>e of the included Body to
<U+017F>tick fa<U+017F>t there; (as hail-<U+017F>hot thrown
with ones hand again<U+017F>t a board, will
pa<U+017F>s off from it, but being <U+017F>hot out
of a Gun will pierce it, and lodge
them<U+017F>elves in it?) And I know a
<hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> that does not work upon
a certain Metal whil<U+017F>t the liquor is
cold, or but faintly heated, and yet
by intending the Heat would be made
to turn it into a powder or <hi>Calx,</hi>
(for it does not properly di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it.)</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may not be ami<U+017F>s to
add on this occa<U+017F>ion, that though

I <U+017F>hall forbear <hi>both</hi> to determine,
whether the rectitude, that <U+017F>ome

from the foregoing Experiments,
that ponderable parts of Flame will
be able as well to pa<U+017F>s through the

at the rate of being <U+017F>o; I mean not
only by making a notable Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution

but by a Coalition of its own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
with tho<U+017F>e of the fretted Body,
and thereby <hi>permanently</hi> adding Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
and Weight to them. Nor is
it repugnant to Flames, being a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
that in our experiment the
Lead and Tin, expos'd to it, were
but reduc'd to powder, and not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
in the form of a Liquor, and
kept in that <U+017F>tate. For, be<U+017F>ides that
the interpos'd Gla<U+017F>s hinder'd the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
particles from getting through
in plenty enough; I con<U+017F>ider, that
'tis not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that all <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi>
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch Solvents, as the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es. For <hi>whether</hi> it be (as
I have <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected,) that
<hi>Men<U+017F>truums,</hi> that we think <U+017F>imple,
may be compounded of very differing

what is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved by the other; <hi>or</hi>
for <U+017F>ome other Cau<U+017F>e, I have not now
time to di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s. Certain it is, that
<U+017F>ome <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi> corrode Metals and
other Bodies without keeping di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
all, or perhaps any con<U+017F>iderable
part; as may be <U+017F>een, if you put Tin
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44036:144"/>
in a certain quantity of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
which will in a very <U+017F>hort time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it almo<U+017F>t totally to a very white

of Oyl of Vitriol, ab<U+017F>tracted
from Quick<U+017F>ilver by a <U+017F>trong fire, we
have divers times reduc'd the main

And <U+017F>uch a white <hi>Calx</hi> I have had
by the action of another fretting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
on a Body not Metalline.</p>
                     <p>And having thus clear'd our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
of the oppos'd Difficulty, my
ha<U+017F>te would immediately carry me on
to the next Corollary, were it not,
that there is one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this place that de<U+017F>erves to be
taken notice of. For, <hi>whether</hi> it be,
as <U+017F>eems probable, from the vehement
agitation of the permeating particles
of Flame, that violently tear a<U+017F>under
the Metalline Corpu<U+017F>cles, or from the
nature of the Igneous <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi>
(which being as 'twere percolated
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44036:144"/>
through Gla<U+017F>s it <U+017F>elf, mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>trangely
minute,) 'tis worth ob<U+017F>erving, how
<U+017F>mall a proportion, in point of weight,
of the additional adhering Body may
<U+017F>erve to corrode a Metal, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on
of the Quantity of vulgar <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums</hi>
that is requi<U+017F>ite for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.
For, whereas we are oblig'd to
imploy, to the making the <U+017F>olution
of crude Lead, <U+017F>everal times its weight
of Spirit of Vinegar, and (though not
<U+017F>o many times) even of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
'twas ob<U+017F>erv'd in our Experiment,
that, though the Lead was increas'd

                     <p>Another Con<U+017F>equence, deducible

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44036:145"/>
of Gla<U+017F>s to Flame, may be this; That
there is cau<U+017F>e to que<U+017F>tion the Truth
of what is generally taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about Calcination, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the notion, that not only
others, but Chymi<U+017F>ts them<U+017F>elves, have
entertain'd about the <hi>Calces</hi> of Metals
and Minerals. For, whereas 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<U+017F>uppos'd, that in Calcination
the greater part of the Body is driven
away, and only the Earth, to which
Chymi<U+017F>ts add the Fixt Salt, remains
behind; and whereas even Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Philo<U+017F>ophers, (for two or three
of Them have taken notice of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,)
are of opinion, that much
is driven away by the violence of the
fire; and the remaining parts by being
depriv'd of their more radical and fixt
moi<U+017F>ture are turn'd into dry and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
particles: Whereas the<U+017F>e Notions,
<hi>I <U+017F>ay,</hi> are entertain'd about Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it <U+017F>eems, that they are not well
fram'd, and do not univer<U+017F>ally hold;
<U+017F>ince, at lea<U+017F>t they are not applicable
to the Metals, our Experiments were
made on. For, it <hi>does not</hi> appear
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44036:145"/>
by our Tryals, that any proportion,
worth regarding, of moi<U+017F>t and fugitive
parts was expell'd in the Calcination;
but it <hi>does</hi> appear very plainly, that by
this Operation the Metals gain'd more
weight than they lo<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o that the
main body of the Metal remain'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and was far from being, <hi>either</hi>
as a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> would think, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Earth, <hi>or</hi> a compound of
Earth and Fixt Salt, as Chymi<U+017F>ts
commonly <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead
to be. From which very erroneous
<hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> they are wont to inferr the
<U+017F>weet Vitriol of Lead, which they call
<hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> to be but the <U+017F>weet
Salt of it <hi>extracted</hi> only by the Spirit
of Vinegar, which does <hi>indeed</hi> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
enough concurr to <hi>compo<U+017F>e</hi> it.
Whence I conclude, that the <hi>Calx</hi>
of a Metal even made (as they <U+017F>peak)
<hi>per <U+017F>e,</hi> that is, by fire without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament,
may be, at lea<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ome
ca<U+017F>es, not the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or <hi>Terra
damnata,</hi> but a Magi<U+017F>tery of it. For,
in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the mo<U+017F>t intelligible
of the Chymical Writers, that is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44036:146"/>
properly a Magi<U+017F>tery wherein the
Principles are not <U+017F>eparated, but the
bulk of the Body being pre<U+017F>erved, it
acquires a new and convenient form
by the addition of the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> or
Solvent imployed about the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And, not here to borrow any
Argument from my Notes about
particular Qualities, you may gue<U+017F>s,
how true it is, that the greate<U+017F>t part
of the Body, or all the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
is expell'd in Calcination, which
therefore turns the Metal into an
arid unfu<U+017F>ible powder; by this, That
I have <U+017F>everal times from <hi>Calx</hi> of
Lead reduc'd corporal Lead. And
I remember, that having taken what
I gue<U+017F>s'd to be but about a third or
fourth part of the <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the third Experiment; I
found by a tryal purpo<U+017F>ely devis'd,
that without any Flux-powder or any
additament, but meerly by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Flame of highly Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Spirit of Wine, there could in
a <U+017F>hort time be obtain'd a con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proportion of malleable Lead;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44036:146"/>
whereof the part I had the Curio<U+017F>ity
to examine, was true malleable Lead;
<U+017F>o little was the arid powder, whence
this was reduc'd, depriv'd by the
foregoing Calcination of the <U+017F>uppo'sd
radical moi<U+017F>ture requi<U+017F>ite to a Metal.
The Con<U+017F>ideration of what may be

belongs not to this place.</p>

Bodies are expos'd in clo<U+017F>e ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to
the fire, though the Igneous Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44036:147"/>
Bodies in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age upwards;
whereas others, e<U+017F>pecially favourers
of the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ian</hi> Doctrine, will not
allow the <hi>Atomi<U+017F>ts</hi> Igneous Corpu<U+017F>cles,

comprize <U+017F>omewhat more of the

it be not improbable, that the brisk
agitation communicated by the <U+017F>mall
parts of the Gla<U+017F>s to tho<U+017F>e of the Body
contain'd in it, may contribute much
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44036:147"/>
to the effect of the fire; and though,
by the <U+017F>mall increment of weight,
we found in our expos'd Metal, 'tis
very likely, that far the greater part
of the Flame was excluded by the
clo<U+017F>e Texture of the Gla<U+017F>s; yet on
the other <U+017F>ide 'tis plain, that Igneous
particles were trajected through the
Gla<U+017F>s, which agrees with the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans;</hi>
and they, on the other <U+017F>ide,

Intere<U+017F>t of the <hi>Reader,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially
<hi>Foreiners,</hi> to be adverti<U+017F>ed, That the<U+017F>e

and beginning al<U+017F>o to be printed in that
Language; which that it may duly be
done, both as to this and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's

the future, the greater care will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
here, becau<U+017F>e it hath been <U+017F>everal

that the Ver<U+017F>ions made of them abroad,
and not in the place, where in ca<U+017F>e of
any difficulty the Author may be con<U+017F>ulted

very defective, and not <U+017F>eldom injurious
to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e he hath deliver'd them in.
Which being con<U+017F>ider'd by tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ire
to know the genuine <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the Author,
'tis pre<U+017F>umed, they will rather choo<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e <hi>Ver<U+017F>ions,</hi> which are made by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons

<U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hall mis-inform them; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the pretence of a cheaper rate
of the Book.</p>
            <p>Which being thus adverti<U+017F>ed, the
<hi>Printer</hi> taketh this opportunity of farther
acquainting the <hi>Reader</hi> from the <hi>Latin
Interpreter,</hi> that the<U+017F>e E<U+017F><U+017F>ays, to his
knowledge, were ready and in the Pre<U+017F>s
