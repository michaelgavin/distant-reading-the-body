         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and what <U+017F>everal Sorts of <hi>Medicaments</hi> were thought upon by one Phy<U+017F>itian, which were all again di<U+017F>allowed of by another; and <U+017F>o by that means, to <U+017F>well up a Publick Narrative with little el<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ide an Account of their own Fewds and Janglings, and Paltry Di<U+017F>contents may <U+017F>eem to be an Enterprize of ju<U+017F>t as weighty a Concernment as the other was before, and undertaken to every whit as Wi<U+017F>e and U<U+017F>eful a Purpo<U+017F>e: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e if they do fall out or fall in, as the People are wholly unintere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the Quarrel, <U+017F>o are they likely to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much the better nor the wor<U+017F>e which Party <U+017F>oever gets the Victory.

Greate<U+017F>t Share of the Employment to their own Side? And is it not enough for the Spectators to be <U+017F>et a Laughing at them for their Foolery when they do <U+017F>o? But that Proclamation mu<U+017F>t be made for all others that would be apt to pa<U+017F>s by without taking the lea<U+017F>t No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what had happened, to be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come in and deride them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e two, as they lie the faire<U+017F>t in the Way, <U+017F>o are they the mo<U+017F>t Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of all other Objections be<U+017F>ide, that I can think of; and could we but get clear of them, I <U+017F>ee no great Rea<U+017F>on to the contrary, but that the whole of what has been Propounded, did it not fail in <U+017F>ome Points relating to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Performance, might be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Pa<U+017F><U+017F>able enough; but that is a Thing not at all to be either Di<U+017F>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Ju<U+017F>tified by us here in this Place;
<pb facs="tcp:107560:4"/>
but rather to be left to the more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Determination of <U+017F>uch, as <U+017F>hall be willing to be at the Trouble through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine it.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the former of the<U+017F>e, I have only this to plead on my own behalf, That notwith<U+017F>tanding the In<U+017F>tances put may indeed <U+017F>eem to have a Re<U+017F>pect, but to one or two particular Per<U+017F>ons at the mo<U+017F>t. Yet the Rea<U+017F>on of the thing is of a much larger Extent as comprehending under it no le<U+017F>s than a whole Community of Men; there being <U+017F>carce a Countrey Phy<U+017F>itian now living in <hi>England,</hi> but who either has been already, or el<U+017F>e at <U+017F>ome time or other in probability may come to be involved therein; and therefore what has been affirmed of one or two, may in a Sen<U+017F>e proper enough be applied to them all in General: And then the Benefit ari<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Memorandum's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107560:5"/>
given, can never be excepted again<U+017F>t as re<U+017F>trained unto a few.</p>
            <p>And albeit it be <U+017F>carcely to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined for any actually Re<U+017F>ident in the Country to be <U+017F>o invincibly Stupid, as not to be convinced before-hand, of the Truth of what they <U+017F>hall find a<U+017F><U+017F>ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either through their own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the Complaints of tho<U+017F>e they at <U+017F>ome times or other may happen to have had Communication withal. Yet ought it not however to be e<U+017F>teemed of as lo<U+017F>t Labour, to be confirmed in the Belief of what they knew to be <U+017F>o, by the concurrent Te<U+017F>timony of others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides them<U+017F>elves. The doing <U+017F>o friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Office may <U+017F>erve as an Additional Corollary to their Heap, and be u<U+017F>eful to them, if for no other purpo<U+017F>e, yet at lea<U+017F>twi<U+017F>e to excite their Care and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken their Diligence for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>uch Inconveniencies for time to

            <p>But as for <U+017F>uch young Gentlemen, who are in a manner unacquainted with the World, and who living <U+017F>till in the Univer<U+017F>ities, have both their way of Employment and Place of Re<U+017F>idency as yet wholly to choo<U+017F>e: Such an Allarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>s this may prove to be of much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Con<U+017F>equence to them; for they by making a due Improvement of <U+017F>o Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable an Adverti<U+017F>ement, may con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the better how to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of their own Affairs, and not be en<U+017F>nared in a Noo<U+017F>e all on the <U+017F>udden, they never <U+017F>o much as dreamt of, as thou<U+017F>ands others have been before them, to the utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing both of them<U+017F>elves and Families, as might be ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>hew how and which way; but that all is <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di<U+017F>covered in the Sequel of this

The more then the pity, that the<U+017F>e their good Parts <U+017F>hould be abu<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>o ill purpo<U+017F>es, by <U+017F>ome rotten and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members among<U+017F>t them; and <U+017F>o much the more need (one would think) there <U+017F>hould be to <U+017F>et <U+017F>ome Marks of di<U+017F>tinction to difference the one from the other. And if I out of a Fit of Zeal for the publick Good, rather than any great depth of Judgment, have been <U+017F>o little mindful of my own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t, as to <U+017F>et a helping hand to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting that which I conceived to be <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>t an Undertaking; I hope no good Man will <U+017F>ee any ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on wherefore to be offended with me for it.

            <p>It was, for ought I know, and, which is <U+017F>omewhat more, am apt to believe, and now and then when I think upon it <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly to plea<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf (I confe<U+017F>s) with the conceit thereof) prove an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>aving much u<U+017F>eful Blood and Spirits in the Bodies of a multitude of good people, who upon the reading over the Arguments contained in this little thing (though pro<U+017F>ecuted I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge with weakne<U+017F>s e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) <U+017F>hall not be altogether <U+017F>o for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to lend an ear to every plau<U+017F>ible preten<U+017F>ion, as otherwi<U+017F>e they would have been.</p>

            <p>And to <U+017F>peak the plain Truth of the matter, though I all along make my <U+017F>elf a party principally concerned; the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion that has been offered is admitting of no other way of management.

            <p>About the latter end of the Month of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> I was <U+017F>ent for to a Lady of good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem, aged upward of Sixty, of but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con<U+017F>titution of Body, and much addicted to the Scurvey and Gout; as the knottine<U+017F>s of her Joynts, pains in and about her Limbs, together with <U+017F>everal other Indications not at all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be here recounted, made <U+017F>ufficiently enough to appear. Her Urine was pale and clear, without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew of Sediment; and her Pul<U+017F>e but low. The rea<U+017F>on of her pre<U+017F>ent Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from walking abroad in a cold and damp Garden. 'Twas ever her Cu<U+017F>tom, and <U+017F>he owned it, when ill at any time, to con<U+017F>ult with <U+017F>everal Phy<U+017F>icians, to hear what each of them had to <U+017F>ay to her, but to follow the Directions of few, or none of them, when <U+017F>he had done. And if at any time <U+017F>ome one above the re<U+017F>t proved to be <U+017F>o happy as to prevail with her, to fancy ought of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>criptions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107560:34"/>
'twas at be<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erved after <U+017F>o lame and imperfect a manner, that by a kind of Synechdochical Interpretation, a part was to be taken for the whole: And let what would be debated, and re<U+017F>olved upon, and by whom<U+017F>oever, <U+017F>he would be <U+017F>ure to re<U+017F>erve the ca<U+017F>ting Vote to her <U+017F>elf; and in the clo<U+017F>e of all, determined the <U+017F>tate of the Controver<U+017F>ie that way which <U+017F>eemed the mo<U+017F>t agreeable to her own Opinion. I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be of this Temper, and <U+017F>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it <U+017F>hould be taken notice of, ought in rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s po<U+017F>itive in pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing any thing I perceived her ob<U+017F>tinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>et again<U+017F>t; but rather to endeavour to work her over by degrees to what I looked upon in my Con<U+017F>cience to be mo<U+017F>tly for her Good. There are <U+017F>ome Natures, may by a gentle complyance be brought to the doing of divers things, who will be compelled to ju<U+017F>t nothing at all.</p>
            <p>That which <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to complain of principally at this time, was a Pain in her Head and Side: As a Remedy again<U+017F>t which I propo<U+017F>ed Bleeding at the very beginning; but that was a thing <U+017F>he utterly di<U+017F>liked of, and de<U+017F>ired with <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionatene<U+017F>s of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that it might no further be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on.</p>
            <p>The day was too far <U+017F>pent to admit of a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107560:34"/>
purgative Potion, and which I at that time a little <U+017F>crupled at (I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s) had it been more early, for fear of calling in the Arthritick Humours towards her Stomack and Bowels. But the application I was more e<U+017F>pecially inclined to, and that which <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf be<U+017F>t liked of (who<U+017F>e Approbation was in no wi<U+017F>e to be left out) was a Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Cly<U+017F>ter, as con<U+017F>idering mo<U+017F>t Gouty Bodies to be generally oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine<U+017F>s; hers I knew to be <U+017F>o in an eminent manner, and therefore conceived <U+017F>o much the better hopes of drawing down <U+017F>uch Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulenties as might give annoyance to either Part above mentioned by way of Revul<U+017F>ion. Upon the admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Cly<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundance of Wind, re<U+017F>ted pretty well that night, and was in <U+017F>ome hopes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the next day; but the Pains in her Che<U+017F>t and Head, though <U+017F>omething remitted, yet continuing in part, and her Stomach but weak withal, I advi<U+017F>ed her farther to the keeping clo<U+017F>e to her Bed, and the drinking once in five hours time three or four Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of a good <U+017F>prightly Cordial, which I oft found by experience to be of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Nature, <U+017F>ome few drops <hi>S.

               <hi>Sage,</hi> and Shavings of <hi>Hartshorn</hi> had been throughly decocted; the intendment of which Pre<U+017F>cription was chiefly bottomed upon the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons following.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t of all, To <U+017F>ecure her Stomach from the influx of Noxious Humours, which upon the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>turbance might be apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated there, and keep them off at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther di<U+017F>tance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To dige<U+017F>t and expel tho<U+017F>e Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulenties that the Cly<U+017F>ter had as yet left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removed.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, Though I was not ignorant how indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed a Body <U+017F>he had for Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Yet I did believe it however an apt means to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which la<U+017F>t, though it be a Doctrine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood but by a few, yet is it of general u<U+017F>e; and by all <U+017F>uch as apprehend it as they ought, and ever will be looked upon in very many ca<U+017F>es as a Remedy ine<U+017F>timable; and I could heartily have wi<U+017F>hed that the Lady her <U+017F>elf had been one of that <U+017F>mall number, who had been able to have judged of that particular Intimation as of right it de<U+017F>erved, perchance it might have been ne're the wor<U+017F>e for her; or at lea<U+017F>twi<U+017F>e have been willing to have

<U+017F>ubmitted to it upon the Authority of tho<U+017F>e that did. But Phy<U+017F>icians are only to give forth the be<U+017F>t directions they can, and then to acquie<U+017F>ce in the Integrity of their own Con<U+017F>ciences. 'Tis a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to tran<U+017F>mit their Notions into the Heads of tho<U+017F>e who have not capacities to receive them.</p>
            <p>And then as for the <U+017F>o frequent repetition of the Decoction before recited, I, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood no better, dull Creature as I was! remained hugely well <U+017F>atisfied in my own thoughts with <U+017F>uch alike rea<U+017F>ons to the<U+017F>e. Fir<U+017F>t, I con<U+017F>idered, that notwith<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>he had never as yet from the time of her fir<U+017F>t illne<U+017F>s, had any the lea<U+017F>t Symptoms of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appearing upon her, as indeed <U+017F>he never had any till the Tue<U+017F>day before her death: Be<U+017F>ides, what was occa<U+017F>ioned by one <U+017F>ingle Fit of an Ague (which upon the u<U+017F>e of fitting Remedies, as <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>hewed in its proper place) never returned afterwards; Yet that was an evil however, both to be feared and armed again<U+017F>t, and that not only upon that one general Account, becau<U+017F>e few other Di<U+017F>tempers of what kind or nature <U+017F>oever, but what are oft times found to be the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers thereto; but al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e the acute pains in the Membranous Parts of her Body, and the Inflammation in and about her

            <p>Secondly, For that I had perceived her Stomack to be much infeebled, as was very clear, to <U+017F>et a<U+017F>ide many other Circum<U+017F>tances, from her exceeding pronene<U+017F>s to vomit upon every light occa<U+017F>ion. Whereupon thought I, what more inoffen<U+017F>ive Nouri<U+017F>hment and ea<U+017F>ie of dige<U+017F>tion could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible have been admini<U+017F>tred to her, than that was?</p>
            <p>It came to my mind likewi<U+017F>e, of how very thick and coagulated a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance the Blood of Scorbutick People is u<U+017F>ually found to be, and how de<U+017F>titute for the mo<U+017F>t part of that Serous Humour that <U+017F>hould render it more fluid, and be a means to help it forward in the performance of its Circulation<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I was brought to conclude without any great matter of <U+017F>cruple, that the mo<U+017F>t probable Expedient for the reducing it to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now, What thing is there in nature approaches nearer to an Identity with Blood, than Milk doth? ab<U+017F>tract but the Colour and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107560:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>

From whence it follows by the cleare<U+017F>t evidence of Demon<U+017F>tration, that the lo<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e u<U+017F>eful qualities whenever they happen to be wanting in the Blood, is be<U+017F>t of all repaired by the acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch others as are to be met withal in a Milky <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; and therefore the Decoction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by us cannot otherwi<U+017F>e choo<U+017F>e but be of <U+017F>ingular u<U+017F>e in the pre<U+017F>ent ca<U+017F>e we are now arguing about, as mu<U+017F>t needs appear to any one who has but a Stock of Rea<U+017F>on, competent enough to make a due compari<U+017F>on between <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Objects as <U+017F>hall be pre<U+017F>ented to his view.</p>
            <p>In Milk there are three parts de<U+017F>erving con<U+017F>ideration, two of which are of a more gro<U+017F>s <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance convertible into Chee<U+017F>e and Butter, and both of them are known to be great Supporters of humane Life; but the other remaining, is of a thin and <U+017F>ubtile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture re<U+017F>olvible into Whey only.

            <p>The Re<U+017F>ult I came to upon the pre<U+017F>ent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency, was This; that an intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was by no means to be tampered with all till the Paroxy<U+017F>m were over.

            <p>Adding withall, that the next Morning, when the pre<U+017F>ent commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and this I was the more inclinable to do, in regard I fore<U+017F>aw what inconvenience was like to befall one in her weak condition, in ca<U+017F>e any more <U+017F>uch acce<U+017F><U+017F>ions as that <U+017F>hould not have been <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably prevented.</p>

            <p>The Matter is as Tran<U+017F>parent as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tal, unle<U+017F>s it be to <U+017F>uch as are as precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in their Councells, as they are po<U+017F>t-ha<U+017F>t in all their Journeys they undertake.</p>
            <p>The only Rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> is <U+017F>o generally agree'd on on all hands: In the Ca<U+017F>e of Pleuri<U+017F>ies being no more in <U+017F>hort but this; becau<U+017F>e there neither is, nor can be any Pleuri<U+017F>ie in nature, but what uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ally implies a Feaver, as that again a Fermentation and Ebullition within the Bloud.

And for the <U+017F>ake of this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation alone it is, that Bleeding is held to be of <U+017F>uch indi<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ible nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity: for were but that away, there could be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence for Boud-letting at all; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o long as ever the Bloud continues in a Mediocrity of Temper, and <U+017F>o long it does; whil<U+017F>t there is nothing of Fermentation in it; it cannot but pa<U+017F>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <U+017F>moothly, and uniterruptedly within the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as waters when they are low move peaceably in their own Channels.

And now the Blood pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by way of Circulation in a full Channel through the Che<U+017F>t; and it being ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the pre<U+017F>ervation of humane Life, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual re<U+017F>piration <U+017F>hould be maintained and kept up there which being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be performed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e than by a frequent dilatation of the Lobes of the Lungs, it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that it meets u<U+017F>ual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with greater oppo<U+017F>ition in the Che<U+017F>t, than in any other part of the Body be<U+017F>ides; and this is the be<U+017F>t account I know of, that can be given of the <U+017F>o frequent falling out of Pleurities.

            <p>And whenever <U+017F>pitting up of Blood, and a pain in the <U+017F>ide proceeds from the Cau<U+017F>es before recited, that Phy<U+017F>itian, who is again<U+017F>t the letting his Patient blood (where <U+017F>trength permits) may very ju<U+017F>tly be looked upon in the e<U+017F>teem of all, as the De<U+017F>troyer of his Life; becau<U+017F>e he defers the u<U+017F>ing the Means, which in probability was the mo<U+017F>t likely to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Cure; according to the known Axiom, <hi>Qui vult Finem, vult etiam Media ad Finem.</hi>

            <p>There is doubtle<U+017F>s a Time and a Sea<U+017F>on to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved for all things under the Sun: The Wi<U+017F>e man
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107560:58"/>
hath long ago taught us that Le<U+017F><U+017F>on; and Common Rea<U+017F>on and Experience <U+017F>eems every day to inculcate it unto us. There is a Ri<U+017F>e, and a Stay, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e in both Per<U+017F>ons and Things, and every one of the<U+017F>e different Circum<U+017F>tances <U+017F>tands in need of a di<U+017F>tinct manner of con<U+017F>ideration; <U+017F>o as that; what is proper at one time, may be look'd upon as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unfit to be done at another. And if at the beginning of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, when the Blood, is rank and high, it may <U+017F>eem perchance to call for <U+017F>ome moderate Correction, it follows not from thence, that the <U+017F>ame Method is to be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted upon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Body has been weakned by long Sickne<U+017F>s. And albeit tho<U+017F>e who have Youth, and Strength, and Nature on their <U+017F>ides, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough depart with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uperfluous Humors, as the Ca<U+017F>e may be; yet <U+017F>uch as are pa<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Advantages, are not to be <U+017F>o dealt withal. An Aged per<U+017F>on is <U+017F>carcely to be let Blood upon any conditions; &amp; if at all, <U+017F>urely much rather at the coming on, than the declination of a Di<U+017F>temper. And therefore that Phy<U+017F>itian, who upon the Bleeding <U+017F>uch an one, <U+017F>hall perceive him to fall into an apparent <U+017F>inking condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet per<U+017F>evere in the repetition of the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>e again, di<U+017F>covers him<U+017F>elf to be a man of a mo<U+017F>t perver<U+017F>e and ob<U+017F>tinate Spirit; who, <U+017F>o he can but <U+017F>atisfie his own ambitious humour of being willing to be thought never to be in the wrong, cares not what Mi<U+017F>chief he does to poor innocent Creatures, who put their Lives into his hands, and re<U+017F>ign up them<U+017F>elves by an implicit Belief to the guidance of his Opinion. Methinks it <U+017F>hould be an Argument to ingenuous Natures to be the more tru<U+017F>ty, by how much the more they find them<U+017F>elves to be tru<U+017F>ted; and to be therefore the more <U+017F>crupulous of doing an Injury, by how much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107560:59"/>
the more they perceive it left to the Liberty of their wills, to do an Injury if they plea<U+017F>e: But there are <U+017F>ome in the world <U+017F>o highly conceited of their own dear <U+017F>elves, they had rather die the Death than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Fault; and therefore no wonder they had rather others <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o, than be reduced to the <U+017F>ame Inconvenience. And yet this being liable to Mi<U+017F>takes, is a Matter <U+017F>o very common, nay a property indeed <U+017F>o in<U+017F>eparable from humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he who<U+017F>e demeanor is <U+017F>uch, as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him<U+017F>elf exempted from that which is every ones lot, de<U+017F>erves, in my mind, rather to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his real folly, than envied at for that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preheminence he is apt to fancy to him<U+017F>elf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other men.</p>
            <p>And <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>o much controverted Point of Phlebotomy lights <U+017F>o directly in our way, it may not be ami<U+017F>s, before we take leave of it, to enquire into the Cau<U+017F>es, how it came to gain <U+017F>uch footing in the world, that was <U+017F>o rarely practi<U+017F>ed, and with <U+017F>o great caution and warine<U+017F>s in former times. Certain it is, that mens Bodies are for <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance now the very <U+017F>ame they were heretofore: And if we peru<U+017F>e ancient Authors, we <U+017F>hall find the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to be likewi<U+017F>e much the <U+017F>ame. As for the Climates we live in, they are as unalterable as the Heavenly Bodies which make them; and men were every whit as ingenious, and learned, and wi<U+017F>e then, as they are now; and yet to one that was let Blood among<U+017F>t the Ancients, we may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e Multitudes of our own experience; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>carce a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e incident to mans Body, for which Blood-letting is not pre<U+017F>cribed by <U+017F>ome or other as a principal Remedy: And tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions <U+017F>carcely agree in any one thing be<U+017F>ides, are

            <p>The force of all, which deductions before <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107560:71"/>
depends <U+017F>olely and intirely upon the making out of the<U+017F>e two following Propo<U+017F>itions. Fir<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that the depriving of the Body of any determinate quantity of bloud whatever, is a never-failing means of <U+017F>hortning mans life. And Secondly, that all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal Ages, into which mans life is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided, are either <U+017F>horter or longer in proportion to the time of his continuance here in this world.</p>
            <p>The latter of which is a <hi>Po<U+017F>tulatum,</hi> as rea<U+017F>onable to be granted; as that all the parts of the <U+017F>ame thing collectively taken, <U+017F>hould be neither greater nor le<U+017F><U+017F>er than the whole which ari<U+017F>eth out of them; and that whenever the whole comes to be <U+017F>hrunk into a le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Volumn than before, the parts <U+017F>hould be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abate of their demen<U+017F>ions in a ju<U+017F>t propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto. And that whatever it be that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions a contraction in the one, <U+017F>hould be deemed to have an influence in producing a like effect upon the other at the <U+017F>ame time, unto each of which a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ertions the more ready a<U+017F><U+017F>ent ought to be yielded, becau<U+017F>e that albeit the whole, and the parts may be called by <U+017F>everal Appellations; yet are they in truth and reality but one and the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame thing. To bring, all which, a little nearer home by a more full and thorough application, It may not be ami<U+017F>s to ca<U+017F>t our eyes backwards, and ob<U+017F>erve; that in tho<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t and primitive times, when Men lived longer upon the Earth, they had each of them their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons of Youth, middle age, and old age as well as we; but they were much more long and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive than now they are. And the parties who had their Lives mea<U+017F>ured by them, were nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated upon that account to make <U+017F>o much the longer pau<U+017F>e before ever they <U+017F>tepped over from one e<U+017F>tate to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Whereas upon the cutting <U+017F>hort of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life in general; The<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal Periods were
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107560:71"/>
reduced to a much narrower compa<U+017F>s: and men as they become <U+017F>ooner ripe, <U+017F>o were they the <U+017F>ooner rotten. And if we <U+017F>hall put all this together, 'twill be no <hi>Parodox</hi> to affirm, that whatever <U+017F>hall be the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tracting from the number of mens years, if derivable from their fir<U+017F>t Principles, ought to be looked upon as the forwarder of them in their whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age between the Cradle and the Grave; but if accidentally befalling them after their Conception, or Birth, then to be judged of, as having the <U+017F>ame efficacy upon their Lives for the remaining part, as then behind.</p>
            <p>But then as for the former, though it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true with this, yet is it not altogether <U+017F>o per<U+017F>picuous in every re<U+017F>pect, that may de<U+017F>erve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration for the Proof of that Particular. I <U+017F>ay in every re<U+017F>pect, there being two rea<U+017F>ons to be render'd above all others that may <U+017F>eem to infer a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity for the abbreviating Mens Lives upon the taking away of Bloud univer<U+017F>ally, and in all ca<U+017F>es. The one whereof, though it may haply lye plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the under<U+017F>tanding of every man; and that at the very fir<U+017F>t Propo<U+017F>al; yet the other does not, but requires <U+017F>omething more of deliberation, and heedful attendance thereto, to make it appear to be <U+017F>o.</p>
            <p>That which is <U+017F>o very plain and obvious, is taken from the enfeebling and impoveri<U+017F>hing the whole Ma<U+017F>s, which is ob<U+017F>erved to en<U+017F>ue upon the lo<U+017F>ing of Bloud in any wi<U+017F>e: it being held for a Rule, that the Bloud of <U+017F>uch Creatures as receive their growth and nouri<U+017F>hment thereby, ought to be accounted of as <U+017F>o much the more pure and <U+017F>prightly, by how much it <U+017F>tands placed nearer its Original; but to become, le<U+017F>s &amp; le<U+017F>s <U+017F>uch in a proportionable manner, according to its greater or le<U+017F>s departure therefrom.

Aged People are <U+017F>aid to be, <hi>exucci &amp; exangues,</hi> both Bloudle<U+017F>s &amp; Saple<U+017F>s: not ab<U+017F>olutely &amp; <U+017F>imply <U+017F>o, but <U+017F>uch if compared with others, or with them<U+017F>elves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the heat &amp; vigour of their Youth; and upon this Suppo<U+017F>ition alone, it is, that the Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came ever to take place among<U+017F>t us; &amp; one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to make room for another, as has been held forth to us by the compari<U+017F>on of Wine &amp; Water mixed together, &amp; <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>hewn more fully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the farther Pro<U+017F>ecution of an Argument <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>Analogous</hi> unto this.</p>
            <p>The other, from the interruption given thereby, to the act of nouri<U+017F>hing the Body, which in its regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and due <hi>Oeconomy</hi> ought always to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being the only po<U+017F><U+017F>ible means for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heat and moi<U+017F>ture thereof, which are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more liable to decay, and which according to the Principles of the Ancients, are held to be the two main Supporters of humane Life, as we likewi<U+017F>e have <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed; but the way and manner by which this comes to be brought about, being of a con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <U+017F>omewhat more remote, and likewi<U+017F>e more intricate to be conceived of. I <U+017F>hall for that rea<U+017F>on take the Liberty of <U+017F>teering <U+017F>o much the larger a compa<U+017F>s in order to the explication of it.</p>
            <p>As for example, if the Parents be both health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and their Bloud <U+017F>ound, then the mo<U+017F>t refined part thereof which is <U+017F>eparated from the re<U+017F>t, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited fir<U+017F>t of all in the Seminal Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Womb, for the Production of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Infant, cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly mi<U+017F>s of a mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite con<U+017F>titution when coming actually to be made that, which Originally it was de<U+017F>igned for; and if hapning to meet with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>upply of nouri<U+017F>hment as is every way convenient for it, fir<U+017F>t and la<U+017F>t; and a concurrence of <U+017F>uch other circum<U+017F>tances as are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107560:72"/>
required over and above thereunto, there is little doubt to be made but that it will have a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proportionable to the exactne<U+017F>s of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition, and the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfulne<U+017F>s it has been attended withal in and through its whole cour<U+017F>e; that is to <U+017F>ay, that that Party to whom <U+017F>uch a Body belongs, and <U+017F>uch other additional advantages have together fallen in with it, as have hitherto been <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>hall have a Life produced even to the extremity of old Age.</p>
            <p>Whereas let the Con<U+017F>titutive Principles be never <U+017F>o well prepared; if the nutriment the Body is to be fed withall, be defective, as to the doing its part; or be the Nutriment never <U+017F>o proper; if yet <U+017F>ome other conditions material to be performed, happen to be omitted, or circum<U+017F>tances mi<U+017F>applied, or any external violence to be offered to it; a failure in any one, or more of the<U+017F>e points, renders all hopes that might have been conceived upon any, or all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther former accounts taken together, utterly void on the other hand, <U+017F>hould all other de<U+017F>irable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have fallen out; and the Seed of the Parents barely to have been faulty, that one deficiency had been enough to have proved a hinderance to all the re<U+017F>t, and the <U+017F>ame Per<U+017F>on, who might otherwi<U+017F>e have lived long and happily, and enjoyed his health with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interruption for many years together; is for that only rea<U+017F>on put quite and clean be<U+017F>ide his Bia<U+017F>s; and either cut off <U+017F>uddenly, or ca<U+017F>t into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing condition (it may be) beyond all po<U+017F><U+017F>ibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recovery.

And as if this had not been, to have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf ridiculous enough, with the <U+017F>ame fal<U+017F>e confidence he returns home (and as I have been credibly informed) makes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit of the <U+017F>ame things, in one of the Courts
