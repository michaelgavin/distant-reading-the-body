         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE OF THE <hi>Tran<U+017F>lator.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Read in <hi>French</hi> this following Book o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age
<pb facs="tcp:34717:3"/>
from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and finding it to plea<U+017F>e me very well, I re<U+017F>olved to make an E<U+017F><U+017F>ay, to put it into <hi>Engli<U+017F>h.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to that, I found I had a great deal of lei<U+017F>ure time to do it; for not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <U+017F>peak <hi>Dutch,</hi> and being not very de<U+017F>irous to learn it, I <U+017F>at often alone in my
<pb facs="tcp:34717:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chamber, and in a few Days fini<U+017F>hed this little Novel.</p>
            <p>Which how well I have done it, let the <hi>Reader</hi> Judge. But let me put him in mind, that it is the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ay in this kind, or any other, that I have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> will <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething as to the Original, that <hi>I</hi> think it is as full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
<pb facs="tcp:34717:4"/>
and tho<U+017F>e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged as well, and the whole De<U+017F>igne carried on, as probably, as it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any thing of this Nature to be; and that the De<U+017F>ign is laid with great Art, and managed with as good a Wit.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Reader</hi> receive this Book favourably, <hi>I</hi> do promi<U+017F>e him, that <hi>I</hi> will in a little time
<pb facs="tcp:34717:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make him amends with <U+017F>omething of a more u<U+017F>efull Subject.</p>
            <p>Although I cannot but acknowledg, that I think it equall to any of <hi>Scaroons,</hi> or the more Famed D. <hi>Miquel de Cervantes,</hi> and hath been e<U+017F>teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>o abroad: For in this <U+017F>mall time <U+017F>ince it came forth, which is not four years <U+017F>ince the

fir<U+017F>t Printing of it here at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> I have <U+017F>een four other Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one of <hi>London,</hi> one of <hi>Paris,</hi> and another at <hi>Colen,</hi> and the la<U+017F>t at <hi>Bruxels;</hi> which is the mo<U+017F>t imperfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all.</p>
            <p>I think I have <U+017F>aid enough, and de<U+017F>ire the <hi>Reader</hi> to excu<U+017F>e me, and pardon all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

HATTIGE:
OR, THE <hi>KING of</hi> Tameran<hi>'s</hi> AMOURS.</head>
            <p>OF all places of the world, the <hi>Sea</hi> is fulle<U+017F>t of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but not tho<U+017F>e of Love; 'tis the Scene Fortune mo<U+017F>t delights to play her Pranks in; but that Element is too boy<U+017F>terous to agree with the tenderne<U+017F>s of the Sex: Yet Love derives his Original from the Sea, which gave birth to his Mother; and though Gallantry be a Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34717:7"/>
there, it cannot appear <U+017F>trange where <hi>Venus</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>A young Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> (which Character <U+017F>peaks him of Eminent Quality) full of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous emulation for the bravery of his Brethren of the Order, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd in pur<U+017F>uance of the Duty of his Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to follow their <U+017F>teps, in <U+017F>eeking Honour, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War again<U+017F>t the Infidels: He came to <hi>Malta</hi> in a Frigat of 30 Guns, excellently fitted, and the be<U+017F>t Sayler that had of a long time gone out of that Port.</p>
            <p>The Knight having performed his Land-<U+017F>ervices was grown a little acquainted with the Sea; but it was the fir<U+017F>t time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and very glad he was, at his coming to <hi>Malta,</hi> to find <hi>Gourdan</hi> there, and made him an offer of being his Partner for Honour and Arms. <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34717:7"/>
an Old <hi>Cor<U+017F>air,</hi> very loth to admit a <U+017F>harer in Profit or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and very rarely making u<U+017F>e of a Second in War, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding accept the Propo<U+017F>al made him by a young Man, the mo<U+017F>t hopeful of any that Order ever had. The Agreement was made, and the 15th of <hi>May</hi> they left <hi>Malta,</hi> and went to crui<U+017F>e on the Coa<U+017F>ts of <hi>Tunis,</hi> in hopes to meet with three Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which <hi>Gourdan</hi> was informed were bound with Pilgrims for <hi>Mecha.</hi> The Wind was favourable, and in three days they were in Sight of <hi>Tunis:</hi> On the Fourth <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>'s Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el drawing nearer the Coa<U+017F>t, di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>ome Sail, and di<U+017F>charg'd a Gun to warn in his Partner.</p>
            <p>The Sails he di<U+017F>covered were tho<U+017F>e of the three Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els they went in <U+017F>earch of, which made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34717:8"/>
up to <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and attacqued him very vigorou<U+017F>ly, and were glad to <U+017F>ee the Knight come up to <U+017F>econd him, making full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him as a Second Prize. But 'tis no <U+017F>light dealing with the Cor<U+017F>aires of <hi>Malta,</hi> who<U+017F>e Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom it is to fight to the la<U+017F>t, and dye before they yield: Tho<U+017F>e I am <U+017F>peaking of were <U+017F>trangers to fear, the one having long run an uninterrupted cour<U+017F>e of Victory in all his Engagements, and the other <U+017F>upplying his want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by incomparable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. I will not enlarge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: The Fight was <U+017F>harp and bloody, the <hi>Turks</hi> having four times as many Men as the Chri<U+017F>tians, and three Ships at lea<U+017F>t as good as the <hi>Malte<U+017F>es.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gourdan</hi> had kept aloof from the Enemy about a Musket <U+017F>hot, till the Knight came up, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34717:8"/>
no <U+017F>ooner joyn'd him, but <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> would let him <U+017F>ee at what rate he had purchas'd his Honour in the <hi>Levant.</hi> He fell in furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ply'd them <U+017F>o terribly with <U+017F>hot and Granadoes from both <U+017F>ides his Ship, that you would have thought him on Fire. The Knight, though he needed no Pre<U+017F>ident to teach him his Duty, yet glad to have a Man, Famous as <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> witne<U+017F>s of his Actions, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded him <U+017F>o bravely, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who till then made no doubt of the Victory, began to fear the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s: They cool'd in their Attaques, and fell off to more di<U+017F>tance, not daring to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the <hi>Chri<U+017F>tians.</hi> The Knight had no <U+017F>ooner ob<U+017F>erved it, but, to make u<U+017F>e of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which had vi<U+017F>ibly rais'd the Courage of his Souldiers, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34717:9"/>
commanded them pre<U+017F>ently to Board the Ship that lay next him, being the <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t of the three; he was readily obeyed, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ru<U+017F>hed a-Board the Enemy; a Company of Volunteers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed him, with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tout Souldiers, who, animated with his Example, did every one the Actions of Heroes. 'Twas wonderful to <U+017F>ee (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more true) all the Decks covered with the Bodies of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Barbarians,</hi> <U+017F>lain at the fir<U+017F>t A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ault by a handful of Men: The Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> appear'd more than Man, he <U+017F>eem'd to be in ten or twelve <U+017F>everal places at once; <U+017F>o ready was he, and nimble, to help where need.

No pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but that of extraordinary love, can fix a Womans heart; Ambition alone is too weak a gage for their Fidelity; it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, Princes owe their Amorous Conque<U+017F>ts more to their quality than merit; and accordingly they extend only to what is external and gro<U+017F>s, when Love and Inclination, fru<U+017F>trated of their expectations from them,

A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <U+017F>ubject to <U+017F>uch reflections as the<U+017F>e, is hardly kept within the bounds of her duty; my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s found it too hard a task not to tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s a little, and being in <U+017F>earch of one worthy her conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cention, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her Eyes upon <hi>Rajep,</hi> the Ma<U+017F>ter Gardiners Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.</p>

               <hi>Rajep</hi> was a hand<U+017F>ome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, young and vigorous, and

The Lady was more and more Love-<U+017F>ick, and by degrees her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion grew <U+017F>o upon her it altered her quite.

            <p>Such, Sir, is the fortune of Monarchs in love; when they are with their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lay a<U+017F>ide that Maje<U+017F>ty which dazles the Eyes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Hearts of Mankind; they go undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed into their Chambers, and make them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o familiar with their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es,

her Repentance had brought her to, being <U+017F>o pin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <U+017F>he was not likely to live an Hour.

And telling him, It did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a generous Prince, as he was, to repent of his Liberality, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially to Women. But if he de<U+017F>ign'd only to frighten her, (which he doubted not, was all he intended) it would <U+017F>uffice, as he conceiv'd, to <U+017F>end any one to her from his Maje<U+017F>ty, without doing her the Honour of a per<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vi<U+017F>it. The Coun<U+017F>el was good, but un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for a Lover, who was going in <U+017F>earch of what the other would have diverted him from.

The <hi>Aga</hi> by this judg'd all was lo<U+017F>t, and that the King would be engag'd deeper than ever.

            <p>Thus it is our Kings declare their Love: they never <U+017F>igh in vain. They need but <U+017F>ay, <hi>I love you,</hi> and <hi>I will,</hi> and the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is done. Our Women think it their duty to obey them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Love, as our Men in Affairs of State. <hi>Roukia,</hi> inclinable as the re<U+017F>t of our Countrey-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in things of that nature,

               <p>SIr, you are no le<U+017F>s Ma<U+017F>ter of our Hearts, than our Lives: You <U+017F>hall never find me other, than full of Re<U+017F>pect and Obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: Your Will is a Law.

The King receiv'd this Letter with the joy of a Lover, who was to be happy that day, which <U+017F>eem'd long to him; who was to <U+017F>tay till night, before he could go to the place of Rendezvous. He was <U+017F>o wholly taken up with his new Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and the plea<U+017F>ures he promis'd him<U+017F>elf from it, that he never thought of <U+017F>eeing <hi>Hattige,</hi> which he <U+017F>eldom fail'd to do. A Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion was pre<U+017F>ently made ready to <U+017F>end <hi>Meharen</hi> out of Town. Night being come, the King went alone, &amp; without noi<U+017F>e into the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where the Comedy was to be acted by him and <hi>Roukia,</hi> who at the hour appointed came in by a Ladder he had caus'd to be brought for the purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>This enterview was charming on either <U+017F>ide: The night was not <U+017F>o dark, but the King could
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34717:51"/>
di<U+017F>cern <hi>Roukia's</hi> excellent Shape; and judging the Features of her Face to be an<U+017F>werable, he made no doubt but <U+017F>he was beautiful, as <U+017F>he was reported: But what charm'd him mo<U+017F>t, was her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wit, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hew'd on all occa<U+017F>ions, to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for what the Night hid from his Eyes. The King was tran<U+017F>ported at it. And to tell you the truth, they <U+017F>pent not much time in Complement, but were quickly familiar, as if they had been acquainted many years. 'Tis a priviledge Kings have, to make more way in a day, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a Month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roukia,</hi> no le<U+017F>s proud of the Honour the King did her, and the Dignity likely to attend it, than <U+017F>he was of his love, did her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t endeavour to de<U+017F>erve it, &amp; with admirable <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; for <U+017F>he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34717:52"/>
gain'd his E<U+017F>teem no le<U+017F>s than his Affection. She <U+017F>aid a Thou<U+017F>and pretty things, which he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ht at, and made him (very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly for her) blame Love for having been <U+017F>o <U+017F>low in bringing him acquainted with her, who de<U+017F>erv'd be<U+017F>t of any his A fection, and his Care: They were got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Grotto,</hi> convenient enough for an Entertainment, almo<U+017F>t like that of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido;</hi> and were there for <U+017F>ome time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption. I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb them, (continues <hi>Razy,</hi> <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to give you an account what pa<U+017F>t there between them. You have been in Love, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and may gue<U+017F>s what di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e they had. The King it <U+017F>eems was well pleas'd with it, for he re<U+017F>olv'd to pa<U+017F>s the re<U+017F>t of the Night there.</p>
            <p>The Summer is the be<U+017F>t Sea<U+017F>on

for Rancounters of Love: but this being a Gallant us'd to Succe<U+017F>s, afforded le<U+017F>s matter of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e than one, who had been le<U+017F>s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate would have done; and at length he fell a<U+017F>leep with his Fair one. Love, who had more Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to do in the <U+017F>ame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, allow'd him but a <U+017F>hort time to re<U+017F>t. <hi>Roukia,</hi> hearing a Noi<U+017F>e, awak'd him to tell him of it. At fir<U+017F>t, he could hardly believe it, the place being inacce<U+017F><U+017F>ible to any but him<U+017F>elf, and <hi>Meharen,</hi> as Ma<U+017F>ter-Gardiner, whom he had <U+017F>ent abroad, and therefore had no apprehen<U+017F>ion of: He hearken'd more attentively, and could hear ones voice, and afterwards his <U+017F>teps: Before he would proceed farther, he was willing to know who were <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>h to enter that Place, which it was Death to do by Day, without his Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34717:53"/>
he was <U+017F>carce got up, but he <U+017F>ees them approach to come into the <hi>Grotto.</hi> It was a <U+017F>pacious Place made of purpo<U+017F>e for a Cooling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room in the Heats of Summer; and had in it <U+017F>everal Beds of Turf, very prettily made with Pots of Je<U+017F><U+017F>amin Flowers, and other Sweets, all about. In a word, it was a place pick't out for the Kings Plea<U+017F>ure. It appear'd, by the manner of the new Comers entry, they were no <U+017F>trangers to the Place. They cho<U+017F>e a Quarter not far from the King's. But it was <U+017F>o dark, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ee one another. He let them <U+017F>eat them<U+017F>elves at their ea<U+017F>e, and had ob<U+017F>erv'd they were two, but could not di<U+017F>cern whether Men or Women.

And nothing but a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, great as that I have for you, could have prevail'd with me to be fal<U+017F>e to him, as I am. Nothing but the extremity of your Beauty, who<U+017F>e charms are irri<U+017F>i<U+017F>table, could excu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a Crime. But let a man value him<U+017F>elfe never <U+017F>o much</hi>

'Tis but in je<U+017F>t,</hi> Meharen, (<U+017F>ays <hi>Hattige) that you rai<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e Scruples: I am fal<U+017F>e, as you are, but that's nothing with me. 'Tis a fine thing to be fal<U+017F>e, if you know how to do it hand<U+017F>omely. I have a Heart will be its own Ma<U+017F>ter, and love one to day, and another to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow.

               <hi>Our Sentiments are <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Change, as other things; and Love as well as Nature is not charming, but in Variety: For Example,</hi> Meharen, <hi>to day I am for You, but three or four days hence I will not undertake but I may be for another. And it would be Inju<U+017F>tice in you, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I <U+017F>hould be truer to You, than I am to the King.

You may believe,</hi> (<U+017F>ays She <hi>I glory not in the<U+017F>e Maximes before him, not for fear he <U+017F>hould follow them, but to avoid giving him Cau<U+017F>e to have an ill Opinion of Me: Were He of my Humour, I think I <U+017F>hould love him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and perhaps I hate him for</hi>

I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured hand<U+017F>omly to engage him to be fal<U+017F>e to me, in<U+017F>omuch that I told him one day, I dream'd I had <U+017F>een him in your Wife</hi> Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia's <hi>Arms, whom I knew to be a hand<U+017F>ome Woman, and hop'd he might have a mind to her, or the Curio<U+017F>ity at lea<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ee her; but my Addre<U+017F>s was lo<U+017F>t upon a Man ob<U+017F>tinately faithfull, and produc'd no other Eruit but nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eous A<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his Truth and Tenderne<U+017F>s for me. You did not much oblige me in that particular, Madam,</hi> (<U+017F>ays <hi>Meharen) and when you have occa<U+017F>ion again to dream, to be rid of one trouble<U+017F>ome to you, let me intreat you it may not be at your Friends co<U+017F>t. How,</hi> (replies <hi>Hattige) would you take it ill the King <U+017F>hould do as much for you, as you do for him? Yes without</hi>

            <p>This plea<U+017F>ant Dialogue had very different Effects on the two Auditors, who were ready <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to laugh, and <U+017F>ometimes to be angry: The King all the while had <hi>Roukia</hi> in his Arms, and <U+017F>queez'd her Hand when they <U+017F>poke of her. She did as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34717:56"/>
much to him upon the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion. True it is, he had <U+017F>mall Kindne<U+017F>s for <hi>Hattige</hi> after he had found her fal<U+017F>e, and le<U+017F>s a great deal after he fell in love with <hi>Roukia.</hi> But it cannot but vex one to <U+017F>ee a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s (though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aken) in the Arms of another, e<U+017F>pecially of one Inferiour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf: Setting a<U+017F>ide the Crown, yet <hi>Meharen</hi> was not comparable to the King for Vigor or good Meen: He was not very old, yet not <U+017F>o young as the King, and a hundred times harder favour'd.</p>
            <p>Plea<U+017F>ant as the King was, at dumb Raillery, with <hi>Roukia,</hi> and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her hand, yet he was mad to hear what was <U+017F>poken; and any one, but <hi>Meharen</hi> (of whom he took very plea<U+017F>ant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge) <U+017F>hould have felt terrible Effects of his Anger. <hi>Roukia,</hi> but for <hi>Hattige,</hi> had born her part of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34717:56"/>
the Sorrow: but finding by her, her Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with the King went on the better, and that <U+017F>he had paid her Husband in his own Coyn, <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he had all the Rea<U+017F>on in the world to rejoyce.</p>
            <p>But this new pair of Lovers had their De<U+017F>ign, and were not come into the <hi>Grotto</hi> only to talk: the Scene was going to alter. But the King was <U+017F>o little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ant, that he had not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to <U+017F>ee the be<U+017F>t Act of the Play; but ri<U+017F>ing up with a great noi<U+017F>e; <hi>Meharen,</hi> (<U+017F>ays he, with a voice would have made the mo<U+017F>t Confident quake) <hi>Is it thus you <U+017F>erve me?

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34717:57"/>
that he made <hi>Roukia</hi> draw near, who had not yet appear'd on the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meharen</hi> was one of tho<U+017F>e Husbands, who though they love their Wives well, cannot forbear hunting other Mens Game. He had been in love with <hi>Hattige</hi> when <U+017F>he was at the Janizaries. And the choice the King had made of her for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, had but increas'd <hi>Meharen's</hi> Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: So that he had <U+017F>everal times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Zara,</hi> whom he knew to be a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of that Trade, and found faithful on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occa<U+017F>ions: The Liberty he had to enter at plea<U+017F>ure the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> contributed much to the good Fortunes <hi>Zara</hi> procur'd him.

and how he got her out of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Our unfortunate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer was forc'd to obey him, and gave him an Account of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had had for her many years, and was renew'd after his Nephews Adventure, which let him <U+017F>ee <hi>Hattige</hi> was not in<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible: That <hi>Zara</hi> had been his Confident, and that very day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Interview, like a Man that leaves all for Love, he had not Power to execute his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: As to her coming out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> it was through a Window of her Apartment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Garden, and that <U+017F>he was let down in a great Wicker-Basket: The King had the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<U+017F>ity to go <U+017F>ee the <hi>Machine,</hi> and found it in a Po<U+017F>ture to help up the fair Lady, who had de<U+017F>erted it. But it was his Plea<U+017F>ure <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia</hi> <U+017F>hould go up in her Room, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34717:59"/>
that her worthy Spou<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould weigh her up in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Hattige,</hi> whom the King gave him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, though not to his Sati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. However it was the Kings Favour to him. It was his Maje<U+017F>ties Goodne<U+017F>s to do it: And I know not how he could have us'd him better.</p>
            <p>Thus got <hi>Roukia</hi> into Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only of the Kings Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and Care, but of <hi>Hattige's</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and all that belong'd to her, who had not remov'd or taken with her any of her mo<U+017F>t Precious things: yet <hi>Hattige</hi> was <U+017F>o far from being troubled at it, that <U+017F>he lov'd her Plea<U+017F>ure and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <U+017F>o well, <U+017F>he would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more than ever <U+017F>he was Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of, to be out of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But <hi>Meharen,</hi> grown wi<U+017F>er by <hi>Roukia's</hi> example, kept <hi>Hattige</hi> as clo<U+017F>e, as if <U+017F>he had continued in

the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> This quickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Di<U+017F>putes and Quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, till at la<U+017F>t they grew weary one of another. <hi>Hattige</hi> to be rid of him pretended a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Heaven, which the <hi>Turks</hi> are very <U+017F>ubject to, and told him <U+017F>he was requir'd to make a Voyage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e her Sins would never be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd: The Cau<U+017F>e was <U+017F>pecious enough to oblige <hi>Meharen</hi> to give her her Pa<U+017F>port, though he had not (as he had) a mind to be rid of her. He gave his Con<U+017F>ent to the Pilgrimage, and <U+017F>ent her to <hi>Tunis,</hi> recommending her to <hi>Mahomet Ba<U+017F>cabey,</hi> his intimate Friend, and praying him to fu<U+0307>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h the fair Pilgrim with a Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el to carry her to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, <U+017F>ays <hi>Razie,</hi> is the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. You <U+017F>ee I have not <U+017F>par'd her, that I might give
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34717:60"/>
you a true Account of all her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, which none knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I, who have been with her ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was taken into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but never approv'd her Conduct; therefore <U+017F>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd <U+017F>till to hide it from me, yet I knew all <U+017F>he did. Certain it is, had her Soul been Beautiful as her Body, there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more perfect under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. She would charm you, Sir, did you <U+017F>ee her, and 'tis pity a Man as the Captain of the other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>hould have her in his hands. She would be far better in yours. The Knight an<U+017F>wer'd, he had a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>erve her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, but not to make an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her. That he had been in <U+017F>earch of her on no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign: And if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, he would at the fir<U+017F>t Oppertuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <U+017F>et her at Liberty, and all tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34717:60"/>
of her Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. But it mu<U+017F>t be kept <U+017F>ecret, le<U+017F>t if his Friend any way <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected it, he might put a <U+017F>top to their good Fortune. <hi>Razie</hi> amaz'd at <U+017F>o great Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity in a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who ordinarily u<U+017F>e not too well tho<U+017F>e of her Nation, knew not what to think of it, but took it for a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. She thank'd the Knight for the Favour he gave her hopes of, and was carry'd back to her Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el, laden with Provi<U+017F>ions; which the other Women were the more <U+017F>urpriz'd at, having been ill us'd by the other Captain, whom they thought no more inhumane than this.</p>
            <p>That Night the Knight did but think of the Adventures of the Lady, and as bad as <U+017F>he had been repre<U+017F>ented, yet being young, he could not chu<U+017F>e but have a mind to <U+017F>ee her; but he was affraid, the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34717:61"/>
<U+017F>ight might co<U+017F>t him dear, <U+017F>ince he found by hearing the Story of her, he had more than an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Inclination for her. Few Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> of his Age, would have been <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous: Curio<U+017F>ity, if not Love, would have prevail'd over all other Con<U+017F>iderations. But this (who was Hone<U+017F>ty and Genero<U+017F>ity it <U+017F>elf) made it his Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve the Lady, without the lea<U+017F>t hope of Recompence. Yet he lov'd to do things civilly, and was willing before he went any further, to <U+017F>peak once more to <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and was preparing to go <U+017F>ee him, ju<U+017F>t as <hi>Gourdan</hi> came to him, a little more gay than ordinary. <hi>Well Sir,</hi> (<U+017F>ays He) <hi>how like you your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? I hope you will excu<U+017F>e me the ea<U+017F>ier for what Love made me do. I can ea<U+017F>ily excu<U+017F>e,</hi>(an<U+017F>wers the Knight) <hi>the Love one has for a fair</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34717:61"/>
               <hi>Lady; but cannot excu<U+017F>e a Man who u<U+017F>es them ill, as You do. I am more troubled at it,</hi> (<U+017F>ays the <hi>Cor<U+017F>air) than you think, who know not as I do, the Women of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: they are humour<U+017F>ome, and will never love a Man, but when they are forc'd to it by ill <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>age. That's a <U+017F>curvy piece of Policy,</hi> (replies the Knight) <hi>and becomes not a civil Per<U+017F>on. Believe it,</hi> (adds He) <hi>it would be more for your Honour, to <U+017F>end her back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, than do her the lea<U+017F>t Violence.</hi> He <U+017F>pake the<U+017F>e words in <U+017F>uch a manner, as made <hi> Gourdan</hi> redden, without an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word. The Knight proceeded to <U+017F>ay, <hi>I know You will not take my Advice, but I would do my Duty to mind you of it, and if you have any Value <U+017F>or me, you will leave the poor Slave at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at lea<U+017F>t, to love or not love</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:34717:62"/>
               <hi>you: for whatever you have to <U+017F>ay of the Cu<U+017F>toms of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this Country, you <U+017F>ee the ways you have us'd to win her, have not yet taken, but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite contrary to your wi<U+017F>hes. She is not an ordinary Woman, to be threatned, and ill us'd into Compliance. And could you have your will of her, pray tell me what Plea<U+017F>ure could you have of her, but would reflect with Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage on a Man of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem You are of in our Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This open'd <hi>Gourdan's</hi> Eyes; he imagin'd the Knight had been told of the Ladies Beauty, and was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in Love with her, which might be the rea<U+017F>on he <U+017F>poke in that manner, and hoped perhaps he would be <U+017F>uch a Sot to quit her to him: The<U+017F>e were <hi>Gourdan's</hi> thoughts, who turning to the Knight; <hi>All your Rhetorick, Sir,</hi>

<U+017F>ays he, <U+017F>miling) <hi>will not <U+017F>erve your turn, you are too young for me. And without makeing a fine Speech, as you have done, I will only tell you, I will keep my</hi> Turk; <hi>and let her love me, or not love me, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tir from Aboard me. But, Captain Gourdan,</hi> (an<U+017F>wers the Knight, <U+017F>omewhat more coldly) <hi>is this</hi> Turk <hi>yours, that you can di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her in this manner? and have you more Right to her than I? I do not intend to take her from you: I have already told you my mind as to that—I know not,</hi> (replies <hi>Gourdan,</hi>haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily) <hi>what your Thoughts or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are; but I will <U+017F>ooner part with my Life, than that Woman; and <U+017F>hall take him for my Enemy, who <U+017F>hall but think to make me quit her.</hi> The Knight, little valuing the words of a Man, who<U+017F>e Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie di<U+017F>turb'd the little Sen<U+017F>e he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34717:63"/>
had, would fain have per<U+017F>waded him by fair means. <hi>What I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> (<U+017F>ays he) <hi>is but rea<U+017F>onable and ju<U+017F>t, and if you are my Friend, as you have often a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, you will not deny my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t, or at lea<U+017F>t, you will not force me to u<U+017F>e the means to <U+017F>et this Woman at Liberty. You will find it a hard matter to do,</hi> (<U+017F>ays <hi>Gourdan</hi> furioufly) <hi>and with more Strength than you are Ma<U+017F>ter of:</hi> and <U+017F>o went his way. This was high Language enough, for a man as the Knight was, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board his own Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; but being as moderate as the other was bruti<U+017F>h, he cho<U+017F>e rather to let him go, than offer him any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.</p>
            <p>This was the la<U+017F>t Vi<U+017F>it they made one another; <hi>Gourdan</hi> was mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful of the Knight, and watch'd narrowly over his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34717:63"/>
Prey: But his Lieutenant gave the Knight an account of all, and offered him his Service: The Knight was <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, he de<U+017F>ir'd no other Service of him, but to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Billet he would cau<U+017F>e to be written to the fair Slave. The Lieutenant promis'd it. <hi>Razie</hi> was <U+017F>ent for, becau<U+017F>e the Knight, though he under<U+017F>tood and <U+017F>pake well the <hi>Moors</hi> Language, would not write it: when <hi>Razie</hi> was come, <U+017F>he wrote thus to her <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>MAdam, A Man Generous and Gallant, as he, who<U+017F>e Captive you are, is <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ncivil and Bruti<U+017F>h, is de<U+017F>irous to re<U+017F>tore You and <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>s our Liberty: Make ready for the fir<U+017F>t Wind that <U+017F>erves, and hang a Cord at your Window, that when the time comes, you may have Notice.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:34717:64"/>
The Billet was <U+017F>eal'd, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried privately to <hi>Gourdan's</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who pre<U+017F>ently convey'd it to the fair Slave, by the Eunuch who was his Friend. The poor Lady was over-joy'd at the News; but had been <U+017F>o accu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd to ill Fortune, <U+017F>he doubted very much to obtain a Happine<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o little rea<U+017F>on to expect: That Villain of a Pyrat, (for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he call'd <hi>Gourdan)</hi> had torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her that day wor<U+017F>e than ever; and <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olv'd, if he came again, to throw her <U+017F>elf into the Sea.
