         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE great Variety of weighty and important Affairs, in which your Lord<U+017F>hip is engaged; one would think, did <U+017F>o entirely engro<U+017F>s your Time, that you could not have a Minute left to be<U+017F>tow on the Mu<U+017F>es. Your unwearied and <U+017F>uccesful Application to
<pb facs="tcp:62473:4"/>
the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of the State, in the nice<U+017F>t Conjunctions, that perhaps <hi>England</hi> ever <U+017F>aw; as well as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expre<U+017F><U+017F>ible Labours in di<U+017F>tributing Ju<U+017F>tice, in your High Station; have been attended with <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>niver<U+017F>al Applau<U+017F>e; and have convinced all the World, how much the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Maje<U+017F>ty's Government, and the Happine<U+017F>s of his People, depend on the Capacity and Integrity of his Mini<U+017F>ters. You have not <U+017F>uffered, even nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>hments to interrupt your Con<U+017F>tant Cares for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. To <U+017F>erve your Country, you have defranded your <U+017F>elf both of Meat, and Rest; which, my Lord, is the only Act of Inju<U+017F>tice, that was ever charged upon you. Your immoderate Labours make daily Encroachments upon your Health; or at lea<U+017F>t 'tis the fear of every good Man, that they <U+017F>hould. And yet your Lord<U+017F>hip, notwith<U+017F>tanding all Di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions, per<U+017F>everes inflexible; as if, animated by the Noble Spirit of an Old Roman, you were re<U+017F>olved to Sacrifice your Life, for the Good of your Country.</p>
                  <p>And yet, my Lord, amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a multiplicity of the greatest Affairs, to which you pay a con<U+017F>tant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; you have not only found Time, to apply your Thoughts to all kinds of Literature, <U+017F>o as to become a great Ma<U+017F>ter in all; But you have likewi<U+017F>e extended your Care to the Intere<U+017F>ts of Learning, and to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of tho<U+017F>e, who <U+017F>tudy the Advancement of it. Among many other In<U+017F>tances, your Lord<U+017F>hip has lately conde<U+017F>cended, to Pre<U+017F>ide over the <hi>Royal Society</hi>;

that was in<U+017F>tituted, for the Improvement of Natural Experimental Philo<U+017F>ophy; and you have taken care, to Expre<U+017F>s your great Zeal and Readine<U+017F>s, to contribute every thing in your Power, to Protect their Intere<U+017F>ts, and Promote their Reputation. And under your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip's enlivening Influence, there is all the Rea<U+017F>on in the World to expect, that Learning will again flouri<U+017F>h there, as well as among other Orders of Men.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lord, has <U+017F>o embolden'd me, humbly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent this Performance to your Lord<U+017F>hip.

                  <p>'Tis a true Remark, which we cannot make without Admiration; That from Minerals, to Plants; from Plants, to Animals; and from Animals, to Men; the Tran<U+017F>ition is <U+017F>o gradual, that there appears a very great Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as well between the meane<U+017F>t Plant, and <U+017F>ome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; as between the lowe<U+017F>t Rank of Men, and the highe<U+017F>t kind of Animals.

                  <p>To render this <hi>Di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition</hi> more u<U+017F>eful, I have made a <hi>Comparative</hi> Survey of this <hi>Animal,</hi> with a <hi>Monkey,</hi> an <hi>Ape,</hi> and a <hi>Man.</hi> By viewing the <U+017F>ame Parts of all tho<U+017F>e together, we may the better ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Nature's Gradation</hi> in the Formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Animal</hi> Bodies, and the Tran<U+017F>itions made from one to another; than which, nothing can more conduce to the
<pb facs="tcp:62473:6"/>
Attainment of the true Knowledge, both of the <hi>Fabrick</hi> and <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>es of the Parts. By following <hi>Nature's</hi> Clew in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> we may be more ea<U+017F>ily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into her <hi>Secret Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> which Thread if we mi<U+017F>s, we mu<U+017F>t needs err and be bewilder'd.</p>
                  <p>In drawing up this <hi>Compari<U+017F>on,</hi> I have made u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> which is given of <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> by other Authors; and very frequently have quoted their own words, which has render'd my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e much longer: For not having the<U+017F>e <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals</hi> by me to di<U+017F><U+017F>ect and compare, I thought it but ju<U+017F>t to let the <hi>Reader</hi> <U+017F>ee, upon what Authorities I went. And though a <U+017F>hort Reference might be e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>ufficient, without this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and unfa<U+017F>hionable way of in<U+017F>erting the whole <hi>Text</hi>; yet if any one will give him<U+017F>elf the trouble of Examining the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences I have produced, I think I have dealt more kindly by him, in making him a Judge him<U+017F>elf; than in leaving him bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tru<U+017F>t to my Report. For there are none, who have been conver<U+017F>ant with Books, but mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, that they have been often impo<U+017F>ed upon, for want of this fair dealing, as I have my <U+017F>elf Experienced in this pre<U+017F>ent Enquiry. To avoid therefore this Error, my Caution it may be has lead me into another, which I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will pardon, if he judges it <U+017F>uch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> formerly di<U+017F><U+017F>ected <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys,</hi> and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Scholars the frequent <hi>Anatomizing</hi> them, as u<U+017F>eful for the attaining the Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Bodies. Had he met with our <hi>Animal,</hi> it had <U+017F>erved his turn much better: Nor had he been liable to <U+017F>ome Mi<U+017F>takes, which <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> charges him with, <U+017F>ince in <U+017F>o many Parts, the <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> imitates a <hi>Man,</hi> more than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> do. Not only <hi>Galen,</hi> but the greate<U+017F>t <hi>Anatomi<U+017F>ts</hi> we have had in this la<U+017F>t Age, have exerci<U+017F>ed their Pens about them; as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in the en<U+017F>uing Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>ufficiently ju<U+017F>tifies me for engaging in this Argument: I wi<U+017F>h I had <U+017F>o good an Apology for my Performance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62473:6"/>This great Agreement, which I ob<U+017F>erved between the <hi>Orang-Outang,</hi> and a <hi>Man,</hi> put me upon con<U+017F>idering, whether it might not afford the Occa<U+017F>ion to the Ancients, of inventing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Relations, which they have given us of <U+017F>everal <hi><U+017F>orts</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> which are no where to be met with but in their Writings. For I could not but think, there might be <U+017F>ome Real Foundation for their <hi>Mythology</hi>; which made me more <U+017F>trictly enquire into their Records; and examining them, I always found <U+017F>omething new, that in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly lead me on far beyond what at fir<U+017F>t I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: and if I do not deceive my <U+017F>elf, I have at la<U+017F>t gained a clearer Light in the<U+017F>e Matters, than any that has hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
                  <p>For what created the greate<U+017F>t difficulty, was their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them <hi>Men,</hi> but yet with an Epithet for di<U+017F>tinction <U+017F>ake; as the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
                     </gap>; <U+017F>o the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Wild Men,</hi> the <hi>Little Men,</hi> the <hi>Pygmaean Men,</hi> the <hi>Black Men,</hi> the <hi>Men</hi> with <hi>Dogs Faces,</hi> &amp;c. yet at the <U+017F>ame time I find that they made them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Wild Bea<U+017F>ts</hi>; and if <U+017F>o, no doubt but they were of the <hi>Quadru-manus</hi> kind; <hi>i. e.</hi> either <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Monkeys.</hi> And <U+017F>uch were likewi<U+017F>e the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> the <hi>Fauni, Pan, AEgipan, Sylvanus, Silenus,</hi> and the <hi>Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae,</hi> as al<U+017F>o the <hi>Sphinges</hi> of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>But <U+017F>o many <hi>Romances</hi> have been made about them, that not only <hi>Strabo</hi> formerly, but the mo<U+017F>t noted Men of Learning of late, have looked upon them as meer Fictions of the <hi>Poets,</hi> and have utterly denied them any real Being. <hi>Homer's Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachia</hi> therefore, or <hi>Fight</hi> of the <hi>Cranes</hi> and <hi>Pygmies</hi> I have rendered a probable Story. <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>'s a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion of the being of <hi>Pygmies,</hi> I have vindicated from the fal<U+017F>e Glo<U+017F><U+017F>es of others. The Conjectures of other Learned Men about them, I have examined: And by what I have <U+017F>aid in the following <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical E<U+017F><U+017F>ay,</hi> I think I have fully proved, that there were <U+017F>uch <hi>Animals</hi> as the Ancients called <hi>Pygmies, Cynocephali, Satyrs,</hi> and <hi>Sphinges</hi>; and that they were only <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62473:7"/>Had my Lei<U+017F>ure been greater, I had contracted the whole, and taken more care both in the <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</hi> But mo<U+017F>t of the vacant Hours from the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Attendance on the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of my Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, being taken up in Collecting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials; to grati<U+017F>ie the Importunity of my Friends, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantly urged the Publication, I <U+017F>ent my Papers Sheet by Sheet to the Pre<U+017F>s, as I had time to tran<U+017F>cribe them; <U+017F>o that I had not a view of them together, till they were printed.

                  <p>THAT the <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the Antients were a <U+017F>ort of <hi>Apes,</hi> and not of <hi>Humane Race,</hi> I <U+017F>hall endeavour to prove in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay.</hi> And if the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were only <hi>Apes,</hi> then in all probability our <hi>Ape</hi> may be a <hi>Pygmies</hi>; a <U+017F>ort of <hi>Animal</hi> <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>embling <hi>Man,</hi> that both the Antients and the Moderns have reputed it to be a <hi>Puny Race</hi> of Mankind, call'd to this day, <hi>Homo Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>tris,</hi> The <hi>Wild Man; Orang-Outang,</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Woods</hi>; by the <hi>Africans Quoias Morron</hi>; by others <hi>Baris,</hi> or <hi>Barris,</hi> and by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuge<U+017F>e,</hi> the <hi>Salvage.</hi> But ob<U+017F>erving that under the<U+017F>e Names, they de<U+017F>cribe different <hi>Animals</hi>; for Di<U+017F>tinction-<U+017F>ake, and to avoid Equivocation, I <U+017F>hall call the Subject, of which I am about to give the <hi>Anatomy,</hi> a <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from its Stature; which I find to be ju<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame with the Stature of the <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the Antients. <hi>Tulpius</hi> 'tis true, and <hi>Bontius,</hi> and <hi>Dapper</hi> do call it, <hi>Satyrus.</hi> And tho' I am of Opinion, that the <hi>Satyrs</hi> of the Antients were of the <hi>Ape,</hi> or rather <hi>Monkey</hi>-kind; yet for the Rea<U+017F>ons alledged in the following <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay,</hi> I cannot think our <hi>Animal</hi> a <hi>Satyr.</hi> The <hi>Baris</hi> or <hi>Barris,</hi> which they de<U+017F>cribe to be much taller than our <hi>Animal,</hi> probably may be what we call a <hi>Drill.</hi> But I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, there is <U+017F>o great Confu<U+017F>ion in the De<U+017F>cription of this <U+017F>ort of Creature, which I find is a very large Family (there being numerous <hi>Species</hi> of them) that in Tran<U+017F>cribing the Authors that have wrote about them, 'tis almo<U+017F>t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but to make mi<U+017F>takes; from the want of their well di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. I <U+017F>hall endeavour therefore in my Account of this, <U+017F>o to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62473:8"/>
di<U+017F>criminate it, that it may be ea<U+017F>ily known again, where-ever 'tis met with. Not that I think in a <U+017F>ingle Ob<U+017F>ervation I can be <U+017F>o exact, but that I may be liable to make Errors my <U+017F>elf, how careful <U+017F>oever I have been.</p>
                  <p>I will not urge any thing more here, why I call it a <hi>Pygmie</hi>: 'Tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to give it a Name; and if what I offer in the en<U+017F>uing <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay,</hi> does not <U+017F>ufficiently Account for the <hi>Denomination,</hi> I leave it to others to give it one more proper. What I <U+017F>hall mo<U+017F>t of all aim at in the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, will be to give as particular an Account as I can, of the formation and <U+017F>tructure of all the Parts of this wonderful <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>; and to make a <hi>Comparative</hi> Survey of them, with the <U+017F>ame Parts in a <hi>Humane Body,</hi> as likewi<U+017F>e in the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey</hi>-kind. For tho' I own it to be of the <hi>Ape</hi> kind, yet, as we <U+017F>hall ob<U+017F>erve, in the <hi>Organization</hi> of abundance of its Parts, it more approaches to the Structure of the <U+017F>ame in <hi>Men</hi>: But where it differs from a <hi>Man,</hi> there it re<U+017F>embles plainly the Common <hi>Ape,</hi> more than any other <hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' I may <U+017F>eem too tedious in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o long upon a <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>ubject, yet I have this to offer, that if we had an accurate and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory</hi> of any <hi>one Species</hi> of <hi>Animal,</hi> it might in a great mea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>erve for the <hi>whole kind.</hi> Wherein they differ, might ea<U+017F>ily be taken notice of, and there would be no need of repeating any thing, wherein they all agreed. So formerly di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting a Young <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>Cat</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time, I wondred to find <U+017F>o very great Re<U+017F>emblance of all the Parts, both in the one and the other; that the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the one might <U+017F>erve for the other, allowing for the Magnitude of the Parts, with very little other alteration: And not only for this, but for <U+017F>everal other <hi>Animals,</hi> that belong to the <U+017F>ame Family. I could have wi<U+017F>hed I had had the like Opportunity, when I was di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> of comparing the <U+017F>ame Parts with tho<U+017F>e of an <hi>Ape</hi> and a <hi>Monkey</hi>: For want of it, I have referred all along to the Accounts given us of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the<U+017F>e Creatures by other Authors; which, tho' it renders my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e more prolix, yet I thought it would not be unacceptable to the Curious. But I <U+017F>hall take care to draw up in a <U+017F>horter view, wherein our <hi>Pygmie</hi> more re<U+017F>embled a <hi>Man,</hi> than an <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey,</hi> and wherein it differ'd.</p>
                  <p>Now notwith<U+017F>tanding our <hi>Pygmie</hi> does <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>emble a <hi>Man</hi> in many of its Parts, more than any of the <hi>Ape-kind,</hi> or any other <hi>Animal</hi> in the World that I know of: Yet by no means do I look upon it as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>mixt</hi> Generation; 'tis a <hi>Brute-Animal <U+017F>ui generis,</hi> and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Ape.</hi> For when I was di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting it, <U+017F>ome Sea-Captains and Merchants who came to my Hou<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee it, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that they had <U+017F>een a great many of them in <hi>Borneo, Sumatra,</hi> and other Parts, tho' this was brought from <hi>Angola</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>; but was fir<U+017F>t taken a great deal higher up in the Country, and in Company with it there was a <hi>Female</hi> of the <U+017F>ame kind.</p>
                  <p>I <U+017F>hall have, hereafter occa<U+017F>ion to make my Remarks on <U+017F>everal Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, relating to it's way of Living, it's Sagacity, Actions, and the

                  <p>In the <hi>Palms</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> were remarkable tho<U+017F>e <hi>Lines</hi> which are u<U+017F>ually taken notice of in <hi>Palme<U+017F>try,</hi> and at the ends of the <hi>Fingers</hi> were tho<U+017F>e <hi>Spiral Lines,</hi> which are u<U+017F>ually in a <hi>Man's.</hi>

                  <p>

For in the <hi>Hand</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> the middle Finger is the longe<U+017F>t, but in the <hi>Foot,</hi> the middle Toe is not.

                  <p>All which is very agreeable to our <hi>Pygmie.</hi> But this <hi>Part,</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and it's Function too, being liker a <hi>Hand,</hi> than a <hi>Foot</hi>; for the di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing this <U+017F>ort of <hi>Animals</hi> from others, I have thought, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it might not be reckoned and call'd rather <hi>Quadru-manus</hi> than <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupes,</hi> i. e. a <hi>four-handed,</hi> than a <hi>four-footed Animal.</hi>

                  <p>From the head of the Thigh-Bone to the Heel, it mea<U+017F>ured Twelve Inches: From the Heel to the end of the Middle-Toe (which was the longe<U+017F>t) Five Inches three quarters. The Girth of the Thigh was Six Inches; of the Leg at the Calf, Four Inches and a quarter; of the Foot at the <U+017F>etting on of the Great Toe, near Five Inches.

The Sole of the Foot, about the <U+017F>etting on of the Great Toe (where 'twas broade<U+017F>t) was Two Inches over; but nearer the Heel, 'twas an Inch and half broad. The Girth of the Great Toe, where bigge<U+017F>t, an Inch and half, the other Toes were an Inch about. The<U+017F>e Mea<U+017F>ures were taken before the Skin was <U+017F>trip't off, in the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> or the Skin <U+017F>tuff'd, they may prove otherwi<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>And having now given the<U+017F>e <hi>Dimen<U+017F>ions</hi> of the whole, and of mo<U+017F>t of the External Parts; you will the better conceive the exact <U+017F>hape of this wonderful <hi>Animal</hi> by the <hi>Figures</hi> I have cau<U+017F>ed to be made of it. As the <hi>Fir<U+017F>t Figure</hi> repre<U+017F>ents our <hi>Pygmie</hi> erect, where you have a <hi>view</hi> of all the <hi>Fore-Parts.</hi> Being weak, the better to <U+017F>upport him, I have given him a Stick in his Right-Hand. But our <hi>Figure</hi> being made after he was dead, the <hi>Head</hi> <U+017F>eems too much fallen in between the Shoulders, as if it had a very <U+017F>hore or little or no <hi>Neck,</hi> which takes off from the Beauty of the <hi>Figure</hi>; but this is rectified and mended in the Figure of the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> where you will <U+017F>ee the <hi>Neck</hi> proportionate. The <hi>Head</hi> here is large and globous; the <hi>Ears</hi> <U+017F>tanding off, not lying clo<U+017F>e. The <hi>face</hi> looks like an Old wither'd Man's, which without doubt was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd much more <U+017F>o, by an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>lcer</hi> it had in one of it's <hi>Cheeks,</hi> occa<U+017F>ioned by a Fall it had on Ship-board upon a Cannon, which forced out one of it's Teeth; and the <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> afterwards proving carious, it might ha<U+017F>ten it's Death. The ri<U+017F>ing of the <hi>Cranium</hi> ju<U+017F>t under the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi> as I have ramark'd, is different from what is in a Man, and renders the <hi>Face</hi> harder; as does likewi<U+017F>e it's flat No<U+017F>e, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>pper Jaw</hi> being more prominent, and le<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>pread, than in a <hi>Man</hi>; and it's <hi>Chin</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder Jaw</hi> being <U+017F>horter. The <hi>Eyes</hi> were a little <U+017F>unk, the <hi>Mouth</hi> large, the <hi>Teeth</hi> perfectly Humane. The <hi>Face</hi> was without Hair, and the Colour a little <hi>tawny</hi>; the <hi>Skin</hi> on the re<U+017F>t of the Body was white.</p>

The <hi>Penis</hi> was different, as we <U+017F>hall hereafter <U+017F>hew. Here was no <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but the <hi>Te<U+017F>tes</hi> were contained in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Pubis</hi> under the Skin, which made it here more protuberant. The <hi>Thighs</hi> and <hi>Legs</hi> were <U+017F>omewhat divaricated or <U+017F>tradling, for want of <U+017F>trength, either from it's illne<U+017F>s, or being but young. We ob<U+017F>erved <hi>Calves</hi> in it's Legs; the <hi>Feet</hi> long, as likewi<U+017F>e the <hi>Toes,</hi> which were liker Fingers; and the <hi>Great Toe</hi> exactly like a <hi>Thumb,</hi> more than that on the <hi>Hand.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Second Figure</hi> repre<U+017F>ents the <hi>hinder Parts</hi> of this Creature, in an Erect Po<U+017F>ture likewi<U+017F>e.

At the <hi>Os Coxygis</hi> there is a little Protuberance, but nothing like a <hi>Tail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Figure</hi> I have repre<U+017F>ented him with the <hi>Fingers</hi> of one Hand <hi>bended,</hi> as if kneeling upon his Knuckles, to <U+017F>hew the Action, when he goes on all four: For the Palms of his Hands never touch the Ground, but when he <hi>malks</hi> as a <hi>Quadruped,</hi> 'tis only upon his <hi>Knuckles.</hi> The other Hand is holding a Rope, to <U+017F>hew his Climbing; for he will nimbly run up the Tackle of a Ship, or climb a Tree: And having this hold, he is the better <U+017F>upported, to <U+017F>hew the <hi>Sole</hi> of the left Foot, and the <hi>Heel</hi> there; on account of which Heel it may be thought a <hi>Foot</hi>: But the <hi>Great Toe</hi> being <U+017F>et off <U+017F>o far from the range of the others, and they all being <U+017F>o large and long, it more re<U+017F>embles a <hi>Hand,</hi> as has been ob<U+017F>erved.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Gula</hi> or <hi>Gullet</hi> is a <hi>Hollow Mu<U+017F>cle,</hi> and fitly enough compared to a <hi>Funnel</hi>; where the <hi>Mouth,</hi> which may be thought a Part belonging to it, being more capacious, fir<U+017F>t receives the <hi>Food,</hi> and prepares it, by chewing, and then forces it down into this Stem or <hi>Pipe,</hi> to convey it to the <hi>Ventricle.</hi> I did not ob<U+017F>erve, upon the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, any difference of this Part in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from that of a <hi>Man.</hi> For as in a Man, (and <U+017F>o conformable too in other Circum<U+017F>tances) it pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed under the <hi>lower Mu<U+017F>cle</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> which by that <U+017F>lant running of it's fle<U+017F>hy Fibres over it, may perform to it the Office of a <hi>Valve,</hi> and prevent the Regurgitation of the Food that way.

But for the better preventing this, I find here, that the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the <hi>Gula,</hi> a little above where it empties it <U+017F>elf into the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> was <U+017F>traiter, and

the inward Membrane here more rugous than in a Man; <U+017F>o that it <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>omewhat Analogous to a <hi>Valve. Drelincourt</hi> de<U+017F>cribes it, in the <hi>Female Ape</hi> he diffected, thus. <hi>Orificium ejus <U+017F>uperius, nullâ Valvulâ clau<U+017F>um; <U+017F>ed interceptum duplici portione Diaphragmatis carnosâ, ab ejus tendinibus oriundâ.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Ventricle</hi> or <hi>Stomach,</hi> as we <U+017F>hall call this Part, in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> as to it's Situation and Figure, exactly repre<U+017F>ented a <hi>Humane Stomach.</hi> When inflated, from the entrance of the <hi>Gula</hi> along the upper part to the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> it mea<U+017F>ured Two Inches and three quarters. Mea<U+017F>uring with a Thread from the <hi>Pylorus</hi> along under the <hi>Fundus,</hi> up again to the entrance of the <hi>Gula,</hi> I found it to be Fifteen Inches; in all, near Eighteen Inches. The length of the <hi>Stomach</hi> in a <U+017F>trait Line, was Six Inches and an half; and it's breadth in a <U+017F>trait Line, where broade<U+017F>t, near Four Inches. The Girth of the <hi>Stomach</hi> in the middle, was near Twelve Inches. So that I thought the <hi>Stomach</hi> large, in Proportion to the bulk of the Body. It had numerous <hi>Blood-Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> <U+017F>preading them<U+017F>elves all over, as in a <hi>Man's</hi>; and I could plainly perceive the Ino<U+017F>culations of large Trunks of the <hi>Coronary</hi> Branches, with tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>cended from the upper Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Pari<U+017F>ians <hi>ob<U+017F>erved in their</hi> Monkeys, That the Ventricle did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e differ from a Man's, it's inferiour Orifice being very large and low; for it was not elevated <U+017F>o high as the <U+017F>uperiour, as it is in a Man. <hi>I did not ob<U+017F>erve this in our</hi> Pygmie. <hi>So</hi> Drelincourt <hi>tells us in the</hi> Female Ape, Ventriculus rugis interiùs nullis gaudet; <hi>and <U+017F>ome other Particulars he takes notice of. But there was nothing in ours, that I ob<U+017F>erved, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from a</hi> Man's.</p>
                  <p>As to their <hi>Food,</hi> I find it very different in the <hi>Ape-kind</hi>; as in part appears by what I have already mentioned of the <hi>Ourang Outang,</hi> the <hi>Baris,</hi> the <hi>Pongo,</hi> &amp;c. So that I can't but think, (like a Man) that they are <hi>omnivorous.</hi> What chiefly our <hi>Pygmie</hi> affected, when <hi>Wild,</hi> I was not informed of; after it was taken, and made tame, it would readily eat any thing that was brought to the Table; and very orderly bring it's Plate thither, to receive what they would give him. Once it was made Drunk with <hi>Punch,</hi> (and they are fond enough of <U+017F>trong Liquors) But it was ob<U+017F>erved, that after that time, it would never drink above one Cup, and refu<U+017F>ed the offer of more than what he found agreed with him. Thus we <U+017F>ee <hi>In<U+017F>tinct</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> teaches Brutes <hi>Temperance</hi>; and <hi>Intemperance</hi> is a Crime not only again<U+017F>t the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Morality,</hi> but of <hi>Nature</hi> too.</p>

                  <p>This great length of the <hi>Inte<U+017F>tines</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was orderly colliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fa<U+017F>tened to the <hi>Me<U+017F>enterie,</hi> which kept them in a due <U+017F>ituation; and <U+017F>o, as to make in them, <U+017F>everal windings or convolutions; that hereby they might the better make a di<U+017F>tribution of the <hi>Chyle</hi>; and the whole was, as 'tis in a Man.

We will therefore here examine the <hi>Biliary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi>; nor do I find them any thing different from tho<U+017F>e in a <hi>Man</hi>; only the <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>Gall</hi> here in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> <U+017F>eemed longer, being four Inches in length.

half an inch broad; it had a great <hi>Ductus,</hi> which was immediately in<U+017F>erted underneath the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> This <hi>Ductus</hi> received three others, which in<U+017F>tead of that, which in Man is <U+017F>ingle, and which is called <hi>Hepaticus</hi>; the<U+017F>e three <hi>Ductus</hi>'s had their Branches di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed like Roots into all the Lobes of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <U+017F>o that the first had four roots, <hi>viz.</hi> one in each of the three right Lobes, and one in the first of the left; the <U+017F>econd and third <hi>Ductus</hi> had both their roots in the <U+017F>econd of the left Lobes, the<U+017F>e branches did not run under the Tunicle of the Liver, <U+017F>o that they were apparent, and not hid in the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma, as they generally are. <hi>But in our Subject the di<U+017F>tribution of the</hi> Ductus Hepaticus <hi>was altogether the <U+017F>ame as it is in</hi> Man. <hi>In the</hi> Male Ape, Drelincourt <hi>de<U+017F>cribing the</hi> Bladder <hi>of</hi> Gall, <hi><U+017F>aith,</hi> Ve<U+017F>icula fellea longa 22/3 pollicibus à fundo ad cervicem, ubi recurvitatem habet maximam, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatè haeret mer<U+017F>a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantiae Jecoris.</p>

                  <p>In the <hi>Spleen</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> I did not ob<U+017F>erve any thing extraordinary, or different from a <hi>Humane Spleen.</hi> It was of a lead Colour, and of the <U+017F>hape repre<U+017F>ented in our <hi>figure</hi>; 'twas fa<U+017F>tened by Membranes to the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum; and by the <hi>Omentum</hi> and <hi>Va<U+017F>a brevia</hi> to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> <U+017F>o that upon inflating the Stomach, the Spleen would be brought to lye clo<U+017F>e on the Stomach, as if it was fa<U+017F>tened immediately there. The <hi>Spleen</hi> here was two Inches and an half long; and one Inch and a quarter broad; and <U+017F>eated as u<U+017F>ually in the <hi>left Hypochondre</hi> under the <hi>Ba<U+017F>tard Ribs.</hi> The <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Splenicus</hi> was very remarkable, <U+017F>ending it's Trunk along the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> as in <hi>Man,</hi> and having numerous branches near the <hi>Spleen.</hi>

But by</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy <hi>I can't but think, they mu<U+017F>t be very like to tho<U+017F>e of a</hi> Woman, <hi><U+017F>ince they are <U+017F>o even in</hi> Monkeys <hi>and</hi> Apes <hi>in <U+017F>everal re<U+017F>pect; tho' in <U+017F>ome, they imitate the Structure of the<U+017F>e Parts in</hi> Brutes. <hi>Thus the</hi> Pari<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>ob<U+017F>erve,</hi> The generative Parts of the Female had al<U+017F>o a great many things which rendered them different from tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Bitches,</hi> herein re<U+017F>embling tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Women</hi>; there were <U+017F>ome of them likewi<U+017F>e which were as in <hi>Bitches,</hi> and after another manner than in <hi>Woman</hi>; for the exteriour Orifice was round and <U+017F>trait, as in <hi>Bitches,</hi> and the generality of other Brutes, and had neither <hi>Nymphae</hi> nor <hi>Carunculae.</hi> The Neck of the Bladder had it's hole otherwi<U+017F>e than in <hi>Woman,</hi> being very far in the Neck of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> viz. towards the middle, at the place where it's roughne<U+017F>s began, which were <U+017F>een only towards the extremity of the <hi>Ductus</hi> near the Internal Orifice. The Trunks of the <hi>Matrix</hi> were al<U+017F>o different from tho<U+017F>e of Women, and re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling tho<U+017F>e of Brutes in that they were proportionably longer, and more redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by various turnings. The <hi>Clitoris</hi> had <U+017F>omething more conformable to that which is <U+017F>een in other Brutes that have it, than in that of Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportionably greater, and more vi<U+017F>ible than it is in Women. It was compo<U+017F>ed of two Nervous and Spongious Ligaments, which proceeding from the lower part of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> and obliquely advancing to the <U+017F>ides of the<U+017F>e Bones, did unite to form a third Body, which was ten lines in length. It was formed by uniting of the two first, which a very <U+017F>trong Membrane joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, going from one of the Ligaments to the other, be<U+017F>ides a hard and nervous Membrane which inveloped them. They terminated at a Gland like to that of the <hi>Penis</hi> of the Male. The little Mu<U+017F>cles, which were fa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the<U+017F>e Ligaments, proceeded as u<U+017F>ual from the tubero<U+017F>ities of the <hi>I<U+017F>chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> The<U+017F>e Ligaments were of Sub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>o thin and <U+017F>pongious, that the wind penetrated, and made them ea<U+017F>ily to <U+017F>well, when blown into the Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, of the Veins and Arteries which is in this place. This Network was vi<U+017F>ible in this Subject, being compo<U+017F>ed of larger Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els than they proportionably are in Women. It was <U+017F>ituated as u<U+017F>ually under the <U+017F>econd pair of Mu<U+017F>cles of the <hi>Clitoris.</hi> It's figure was Pyramidal, ending from a very large <hi>Ba<U+017F>is</hi> in a point, which run along the third Ligament to it's extremity towards the Gland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62473:30"/>The rest of the Parts of Generation were like to tho<U+017F>e of Women. The Neck of the Bladder had it's Mu<U+017F>cles as in Women: For there were a great number of fle<U+017F>hy Fibres, which proceeding from the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> were fa<U+017F>tened to the <U+017F>ides of the Neck of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and other <U+017F>uch like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres which did come from the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder to in<U+017F>ert them <U+017F>elves at the <U+017F>ame place. The Body of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> it's Membranes, internal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it's Ligaments as well the round as broad, and all it's Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els had a conformation intirely like to that, which the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame Parts have in Women. The Te<U+017F>ticles, which were ten lines long, and two broad, were as in Women, compo<U+017F>ed of a great number of <U+017F>mall Bladders, and fa<U+017F>tned near the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes which are at the extremity of the <hi>Tubae,</hi> and which is called their Fringe.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Lungs <hi>in our</hi> Pygmie <hi>had three</hi> Lobes <hi>on one <U+017F>ide, and but two on the other; five in all.

                     <hi>Tho</hi> Galen <hi>be herein mi<U+017F>taken,</hi> Ve<U+017F>alius <hi>certainly is too <U+017F>evere in his Cen<U+017F>ure, in charging him, that he never di<U+017F><U+017F>ected any thing but</hi> Apes <hi>and</hi> Dogs; <hi>for the contrary evidently appears in abundance of In<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that might be produced.

                  <p>WE come now to the <hi>O<U+017F>teology,</hi> to give a <hi>De<U+017F>cription</hi> of the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> by comparing which, with that of a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Ape</hi> and a <hi>Monkey</hi> we may ob<U+017F>erve (as we have already of the other Parts) that here too, our <hi>Pygmie</hi> more re<U+017F>embles a <hi>Man</hi> than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkey's</hi> do; but where it differs, there 'tis like the <hi>Ape-kind. Galen</hi> (as I have already quoted him, <hi>vid. p.</hi> 15.) tells us that <hi>an Ape of all Creatures is the most like to a Man in the</hi> Vi<U+017F>cera, <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles, Arteries, Veins and Nerves, becau<U+017F>e 'tis <U+017F>o in the Structure of the Bones.</hi> But it may be que<U+017F>tioned, Whether even the Structure of the <hi>Bones</hi> them<U+017F>elves, does not depend upon that of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi>: <U+017F>ince in their fir<U+017F>t Formation, they are <hi><U+017F>oft</hi> and <hi>va<U+017F>cular</hi>; then <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> and in time at la<U+017F>t are hardened into <hi>Bones.</hi> In <hi>Ricketty Children</hi> too, we find, that even the <hi>Bones</hi> are rendered crooked, by the Contraction of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles,</hi> how much more, when they are tender and <U+017F>oft, might they be bended any way by them. But by under<U+017F>tanding exactly the Structure of the <hi>Bones,</hi> we <U+017F>hall the better apprehend the Ri<U+017F>e and In<U+017F>ertions of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles.</hi> And for the better attaining this, <hi>Galen</hi> in the <U+017F>ame Chaper <note n="(81)" place="bottom">Galen. de Anat. admini<U+017F>tr. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>p. m.</hi> 29, 30</note> recommends to his <hi>Students,</hi> when they cannot have an opportunity of Con<U+017F>ulting an <hi>Humane Sceleton,</hi> then to

(a) The <hi>Cranium</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was round and globous, and it <U+017F>eemed to be three times as big as the Head of a Common <hi>Monkey</hi>; for, that I might the better compare them, I procured the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> which I found was exactly the length or that of our <hi>Pygmie</hi>: though at the <U+017F>ame time we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, that in <U+017F>everal of the Parts, 'twas va<U+017F>tly different. For mea<U+017F>uring the Head of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> by a Line drawn round from the No<U+017F>e, over the <hi>Orbit</hi> of the Eyes, to the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Head, and <U+017F>o to the No<U+017F>e again, I ob<U+017F>erved 'twas Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches. The <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Monkey</hi> mea<U+017F>ured there only Nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and a quarter. The girth of the Head of the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tix</hi> round by the Ears to the <hi>Vertix</hi> again, was Eleven Inches and an half: in the <hi>Monkey</hi> 'twas only Seven Inches and an half. The longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was Four Inches, of the <hi>Monkey</hi> Two Inches and a quarter. The latitudinal <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was Three Inches and above a quarter; of the <hi>Monkey</hi> a little above Two Inches. The profundity of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from the <hi>Vertix</hi> to the <hi>Foramen</hi> where the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out, was about Three Inches and a quarter; in the <hi>Monkey</hi> Two Inches. So that in the largene<U+017F>s of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the <hi>Pygmie</hi> much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Monkey,</hi> as al<U+017F>o <hi>Apes,</hi> and more re<U+017F>embles a <hi>Man.</hi>

The <hi>Lambdoidal Suture,</hi> as extended from the <hi>Sagittal</hi> of each <U+017F>ide for about half an Inch, was <hi><U+017F>errated</hi>; then the <hi>Suture</hi> di<U+017F>appeared, and there was formed here a ri<U+017F>ing ridge of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which was continued to that <hi>Apophy<U+017F>is</hi> which makes the hinder part of the <hi>Os Zygomaticum.</hi> There was no <U+017F>uch bony ridge in the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie.</hi> In the <hi>Monkey</hi> too I <U+017F>aw the <hi>Squammous Sutures</hi> very plain, tho' <hi>Riolan</hi> denies them; which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was very apparent. Our <hi>Pygmie</hi> therefore in the Structure of the <hi>Sutures</hi> exactly re<U+017F>embled a <hi>Humane Cranium,</hi> and more than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> do: For in them the <hi>Coronary</hi> and <hi>Lambdoidal Sutures</hi> were only in part <hi><U+017F>errated</hi>; and they had no <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>a triquetra Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(c) In our <hi>Pygmie</hi> there was an <hi>Os Cribriforme,</hi> as in <hi>Man</hi>; 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Inch long, and a quarter of an Inch broad; in it I num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred about Thirty <hi>Foramina</hi>; here was likewi<U+017F>e that long ridge, (which is call'd <hi>Cri<U+017F>ta Galli</hi>) as in a <hi>Man,</hi> to which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> was fa<U+017F>tened.</p>

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62473:39"/>(d) In the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Monkey</hi> there was no <hi>Cri<U+017F>ta Galli</hi>; and where the <hi>Os Cribriforme</hi> <U+017F>hould have been, there was a hollow Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age which led towards the beginning of the No<U+017F>trils, at the end of which there might be a <U+017F>mall <hi>Os Cribriforme</hi> perforated with four or five holes. But this Part appeared very different from the Structure of a <hi>Humane Skull,</hi> as likewi<U+017F>e from our <hi>Pygmie</hi>; which was occa<U+017F>ioned chiefly by the great bunching in of the Bones of the Orbit of the Eye, tho' our <hi>Pygmie</hi> too had the<U+017F>e Bones more protruded in, than they are in a <hi>Humane Cranium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(e) This appeared more in the <hi>Cranium</hi> of a <hi>Monkey</hi> than in our <hi>Pygmie</hi>; tho' here too 'twas <U+017F>omewhat more than in a <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Skull.</hi>

                     <p>(f) The <hi>Sella Equina</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was exactly like a <hi>Man</hi>'s. In a <hi>Monkey</hi> I ob<U+017F>erved it more ri<U+017F>ing and higher. In the middle of the <hi>Sella Turcica <U+017F>eu Equina</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> I ob<U+017F>erved a <hi>Foramen</hi>; and the <U+017F>ame I found in a <hi>Humane Cranium</hi> I have by me.</p>
                     <p>(g) In our <hi>Pygmie</hi> I did not ob<U+017F>erve tho<U+017F>e two <hi>Cavities</hi> under the <hi>Sella Turcica</hi> which are to be met with in a <hi>Humane Skull.</hi> But the Bone here was very <U+017F>pungy and cavernous, and might an<U+017F>wer the <U+017F>ame end, tho' not formed perfectly alike.</p>
                     <p>(h) The<U+017F>e Cavities in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> were nothing <U+017F>o large as they are in a <hi>Monkey,</hi> but conformable to the Structure of this Part in an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Skull.</hi> And in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> too, I ob<U+017F>erved the <hi>Pterigoidal Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> as they are in <hi>Man,</hi> but I did not find them in the <hi>Monkey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(i) The <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>a Bragmatis</hi> and <hi>Temporum</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> were very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by an <hi>indented Suture.</hi> In the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Monkey</hi> the<U+017F>e Bones were divided by a <hi>lineal Suture</hi> call'd <hi>Harmonia.</hi>

a<U+017F>under; but otherwi<U+017F>e they are firmly knit together. This therefore is no rea<U+017F>on, why they <U+017F>hould not run fa<U+017F>t: and the contrary was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> that it did <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>The length of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> from it's <hi>Spine</hi> to it's Conjunction with the <hi>Os I<U+017F>chium,</hi> was three Inches; where 'twas broade<U+017F>t, 'twas an Inch and half; where narrowe<U+017F>t, but three quarters of an Inch. The <hi>Os l<U+017F>chium</hi> was an Inch and three quarters long; the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> was an Inch long.</p>
                     <p>(b) I did not ob<U+017F>erve any difference in the Structure of the <hi>Thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> from that in <hi>Man</hi>; nor was it's <hi>Articulation</hi> or In<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it's Head into the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> more oblique than in <hi>Man.</hi> So that from this <hi>Articulation,</hi> I <U+017F>aw no rea<U+017F>on why it <U+017F>hould not walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and <U+017F>it; our <hi>Pygmie</hi> did both: When I <U+017F>aw it, 'twas ju<U+017F>t a little before it's death; and tho' 'twas weak and feeble, it would <U+017F>tand, and go upright.</p>
                     <p>The length of the <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was five Inches: The girth of it in the middle an Inch and three quarters; where 'twas joined to the Bones of the <hi>Leg,</hi> 'twas an Inch and almo<U+017F>t an half broad.</p>
                     <p>(c) The Neck of the Head of the <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was not different in it's length, as I did ob<U+017F>erve, from that of a <hi>Man</hi>'s, but the <U+017F>ame proportionably; as were likewi<U+017F>e the two <hi>Apophy<U+017F>es,</hi> called <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanteres.</hi>

                     <p>(d) The <hi>Patella</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was not yet <hi>o<U+017F><U+017F>ified.</hi> As much as I could di<U+017F>cover of it's <U+017F>hape, it was the <U+017F>ame as in <hi>Man</hi>; round and not long; and but one Bone, and not two, as <hi>Riolan</hi> de<U+017F>cribes it in the <hi>Monkey.</hi> In the <hi>Sceletons</hi> of the <hi>Monkeys</hi> I u<U+017F>ed, the<U+017F>e Bones were lo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that I did not ob<U+017F>erve them.</p>
                     <p>(e) The two Bones in the <hi>Leg,</hi> the <hi>Tibia</hi> and the <hi>Fibula</hi> were ju<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame in the <hi>Pygmie</hi> as in <hi>Man</hi>; and their Articulations were alike: The <hi>Tibia</hi> was four Inches long; the <hi>Fibula</hi> was a little <U+017F>horter. The girth of the <hi>Tibia</hi> in the middle was about an Inch; of the <hi>Fibula,</hi> about half an Inch.</p>
                     <p>(f) What makes the <hi>foot</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> <U+017F>eem different from a <hi>Man</hi>'s, is chiefly the length of the <hi>Toes,</hi> and the Structure of the <hi>great Toe.</hi> In other re<U+017F>pects, it has a great re<U+017F>emblance with it. For the Bones of the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi> here, <U+017F>eemed proportionably as long as in <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Os Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Calcaneum</hi> or <hi>Heel-bone</hi> was not narrow, but broad; and forewards, where 'twas joined to the <hi>Os Cuboide</hi> or <hi>Cubiforme,</hi> not broader, nor lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than behind; where it juts out <U+017F>o far, as <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ecures it's

<U+017F>tanding or walking erect. The <hi>A<U+017F>tragalus</hi> I did not ob<U+017F>erve different from a Man's. The <hi>Scaphoides</hi> or <hi>Naviculare</hi> here was <hi>Cartilaginous.</hi> If one reckons three Joints in the <hi>great Toe,</hi> then there can be but four Bones in the <hi>Planta Pedis,</hi> or <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi>; which with <hi>Eu<U+017F>tachius</hi> I am more inclined to, becau<U+017F>e really this Part performs upon any occa<U+017F>ion the u<U+017F>e of an <hi>Hand</hi> too; and the <hi>great Toe,</hi> (like the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>) <U+017F>tands off from the range of the other Fingers. Be<U+017F>ides, I ob<U+017F>erved a difference in the Colour in the Bones of the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi> and the <hi>Toes</hi>: for the Colour of the <hi>Toes</hi> was white and opace; the Colour of the Bones of the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi> was like to that of the <hi>Cartilages,</hi> and more tran<U+017F>parent. Now all the three Bones in the <hi>great Toe</hi> were of the <U+017F>ame colour, white as were the other <hi>Toes.</hi> Therefore I <U+017F>hall make but four Bones in the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us,</hi> an<U+017F>werable to tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> and three Bones in the <hi>great Toe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(g) And as the <hi>Hand</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> in <U+017F>ome Parts re<U+017F>embled the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>; in others the <hi>Ape-kind</hi>: So the <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of the <hi>Foot</hi> too. For the <hi>Heel,</hi> the <hi>Tar<U+017F>us</hi> and <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi> were like to the <hi>Humane.</hi> But all the <hi>Toes</hi> were liker to the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey-kind</hi>: For the <hi>Toes</hi> here, if we may call them <hi>Toes,</hi> and not rather <hi>Fingers,</hi> were almo<U+017F>t as long as the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>; much longer proportionably than in Man, and not lying <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e together: But the <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> were larger and bigger than tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Toes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(h) The <hi>great Toe</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> was <U+017F>horter than the fir<U+017F>t of the other Toes; tho' in a <hi>Man</hi> 'tis altogether as long; and herein it re<U+017F>embles the <hi>Ape-kind.</hi> But whereas <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> (as I have remarked) mentions, that in <hi>Apes</hi> the <hi>middle Toe</hi> is the longe<U+017F>t, as is the <hi>middle Finger</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>; In the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> I did ob<U+017F>erve, that the <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> and <hi>middle Toe</hi> were both much of a length, each mea<U+017F>uring an Inch and three quarters: The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>little Toe</hi> were about an Inch and an half long; the <hi>little Toe</hi> being rather <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>horter than the <hi>third Toe.</hi> If in the <hi>great Toe</hi> you reckon three <hi>Articuli,</hi> as <hi>Eu<U+017F>tachius</hi> does, then from the <hi>Tar<U+017F>us</hi> to it's Extream, the <hi>great Toe</hi> mea<U+017F>ured two Inches and an half: but if with <hi>Coiter</hi> you make but two <hi>Articuli</hi> or <hi>Joints</hi> in the <hi>great Toe,</hi> and the other to be a Bone of the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi>; the<U+017F>e two were only an Inch and a quarter long: The four Bones of the <hi>Metatar<U+017F>us</hi> were much of a length, being about an Inch and a quarter long.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>great Toe</hi> (as has been already frequently remarked) being <U+017F>et off from the range of the others, more re<U+017F>embles a <hi>Thumb.</hi> This Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I ob<U+017F>erve in it's make, That the Bones that compo<U+017F>e it, are much bigger and larger, than any of the other <hi>Toes</hi>; and in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> va<U+017F>tly bigger. In the <hi>Sceletou</hi> of a <hi>Monkey</hi> I did not ob<U+017F>erve the Bones of the <hi>great Toe,</hi> to exceed tho<U+017F>e of the other. But as the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Foot</hi> is much bigger, than that in the <hi>Hand</hi>; <U+017F>o the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> are much larger than tho<U+017F>e in the <hi>Foot.</hi>

But of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And to proceed:</p>
                     <p>Since the <hi>Bones</hi> are the main Timber-work in this Fabrick of <hi>Animal</hi> Bodies, by which the whole is <U+017F>upported, and upon their Structure, in a good mea<U+017F>ure, does depend their manner of <hi>local motion,</hi> we will here more particularly enquire, which may be thought the mo<U+017F>t natural way of walking in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> either as a <hi>Quadruped</hi> or a <hi>Biped,</hi> for it did both upon occa<U+017F>ion; and we will <U+017F>ee whether by Nature 'twas equally provided for the doing both.</p>
                     <p>Now when I ob<U+017F>erved it to go upon all four, as a <hi>Quadruped</hi> (as has been already remark'd) it did not place the <hi>Palms</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> flat to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62473:48"/>
the Ground, but went upon it's Knuckles, or rather upon the fir<U+017F>t Joints of the Fingers of the Fore-hands, the <U+017F>econd and third Joints being bended or touching the Ground; which <U+017F>eem'd to me <U+017F>o unu<U+017F>ual a way of <hi>walking,</hi> as I have not ob<U+017F>erved the like before in any <hi>Animal.</hi> And I did expect it the le<U+017F>s here: becau<U+017F>e the Fore-limbs being <U+017F>o very long, it might be thought, that it had the le<U+017F>s need of thus rai<U+017F>ing the Body. And the whole weight of the Body thus lying upon the<U+017F>e Joints of the <hi>Fingers,</hi> one would think, that they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>oon tired in <U+017F>upporting it, and that <hi>Nature</hi> did not de<U+017F>ign it for a Con<U+017F>tancy, but only upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion, or a pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>hift: For if it was to be it's u<U+017F>ual way of walking, no doubt, for it's greater ea<U+017F>e, it would place the <hi>Palms</hi> flat to the Ground, as all other <hi>Animals</hi> do the <hi><U+017F>ole</hi> of the <hi>Foot,</hi> and hereby it would be rendered better able to bear this weight.</p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides, when it walks thus upon it's <hi>Fingers,</hi> the <hi>flexure</hi> at the Elbow will be inwards, towards the <U+017F>ides of the Body, which is different from all other <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> and in it's Progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion will be of no u<U+017F>e at all, nay, will be an hinderance to it; and it will require a great tention of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> to keep the<U+017F>e <hi>Fore-limbs</hi> <U+017F>trait; and if they are not kept <U+017F>o, they mu<U+017F>t halt, and can't move <U+017F>wiftly; which makes me diffident, that this can't be it's Natural Po<U+017F>ture in going; for Nature always contrives the ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t and be<U+017F>t ways of <hi>Motion.</hi> Now in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> the flection of the fore and hinder Limbs, is both the <U+017F>ame way: But in a <hi>Man</hi> and an <hi>Ape</hi> (as I have before remarked from <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>) 'tis contrary; or as <hi>Pliny</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>es it, <hi>Homini genua &amp; Cubita contraria, item <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>is &amp; Simia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum generi, ob id minimè pernicibus.</hi> But how <hi>Pliny</hi> comes to bring in the <hi>Bear</hi> here, I do not under<U+017F>tand: for if with the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi>

                     <p>I <U+017F>hall here further ob<U+017F>erve, that in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> the make of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> the <U+017F>etting on of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and the <hi>Articulation</hi> of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> or Shoulder-bone, are much different from what they are in <hi>Bipeds.</hi>: for <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> are narrow Che<U+017F>ted, and their <hi>Thorax</hi> not <U+017F>o round as in a <hi>Man,</hi> becau<U+017F>e in them the <hi>Scapulae</hi> are to be placed more forward upon the Ribs, and not <U+017F>o backwards as in <hi>Men.</hi> And the Articulation or the

I have in<U+017F>tanced in <hi>Cte<U+017F>ias</hi> and the <hi>Indian Hi<U+017F>torians,</hi> as the Authors and Inventors of the many Fables we have had concerning thém: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, I have Examined tho<U+017F>e Relations; where Speech or Language is attributed to them; and <U+017F>hewn, that there is no rea<U+017F>on to believe, that they ever <U+017F>pake any Language at all. But the<U+017F>e <hi>Indian Hi<U+017F>torians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving related <U+017F>o many extravagant Romances of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> as to render their whole Hi<U+017F>tory <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, nay to be utterly denied, that there were ever any <U+017F>uch Creatures as <hi>Pygmies</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> both by <hi>Strabo</hi> of old, and mo<U+017F>t of our Learned Men of late, I have endeavoured to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the Truth of their <hi>being,</hi> from a <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>; which being <U+017F>o po<U+017F>itive in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their Exi<U+017F>tence, creates a difficulty, that can no ways be got over by <U+017F>uch as are of the contrary Opinion. This <hi>Text</hi> I have vindicated from the fal<U+017F>e Interpretations and Glo<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>everal Great Men, who had their Minds <U+017F>o prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed and prejudiced with the Notion of <hi>Men Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that they often would quote it, and mi<U+017F>apply it, tho' it contain'd nothing that any ways favoured their Opinion; but the contrary rather, that they were <hi>Brutes,</hi> and not <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were really <hi>Brutes,</hi> I think I have plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Philo<U+017F>tratus,</hi> who reckon them among<U+017F>t the <hi>wild Bea<U+017F>ts</hi> that breed in tho<U+017F>e Countries: For tho' by <hi>Herodotus</hi> they are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Pau<U+017F>anias in Atticis, <hi>p. m.</hi> 21.</note> relates from <hi>Euphemus Car,</hi> who by contrary Winds was driven upon <U+017F>ome I<U+017F>lands, where he tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62473:85"/>
that they had Tails on their Rumps; and were very la<U+017F>civious toward the Women in the Ship. But of the<U+017F>e more, when we come to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Satyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may the le<U+017F>s wonder to find that they call <hi>Brutes Men,</hi> <U+017F>ince 'twas common for the<U+017F>e <hi>Hi<U+017F>torians</hi> to give the Title of <hi>Men,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Brutes,</hi> but they were grown <U+017F>o wanton in their Inventions, as to de<U+017F>cribe <U+017F>everal Nations of <hi>Mon<U+017F>trous Men,</hi> that had never any Being, but in their own Imagination, as I have in<U+017F>tanced in <U+017F>everal. I therefore excu<U+017F>e <hi>Strabo</hi> for denying the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> <U+017F>ince he could not but be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they could not be <U+017F>uch <hi>Men,</hi> as the<U+017F>e <hi>Hi<U+017F>torians</hi> have de<U+017F>cribed them. And the better to judge of the Rea<U+017F>ons that <U+017F>ome of the Moderns have given to prove the Being of <hi>Men Pygmies,</hi> I have laid down as <hi>Po<U+017F>tula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,</hi> that hereby we mu<U+017F>t not under<U+017F>tand <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> nor yet a Nation of <hi>Men,</hi> tho' <U+017F>omewhat of a le<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>ize and <U+017F>tature than ordinary; but we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve tho<U+017F>e two Characteri<U+017F>ticks that <hi>Homer</hi> gives of them, that they are <hi>Cubitales,</hi> and fight <hi>Cranes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having premi<U+017F>ed this, I have taken into con<U+017F>ideration <hi>Ca<U+017F>par Bartholine Senior</hi> his <hi>Opu<U+017F>culum de Pygmaeis,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Talentonius's</hi> Di<U+017F><U+017F>ertation about them; and upon examination do find, that neither the Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, nor Divine that they alledge, do any ways prove, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the Being of <hi>Men Pygmies.</hi> St. <hi>Au<U+017F>tin,</hi> who is likewi<U+017F>e quoted on their <U+017F>ide, is <U+017F>o far from favouring this Opinion, that he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <U+017F>uch Creatures exi<U+017F>t, and if they do, concludes them to be <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Monkeys</hi>; and cen<U+017F>ures tho<U+017F>e <hi>Indian Hi<U+017F>torians</hi> for impo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch Bea<U+017F>ts upon us, as di<U+017F>tinct Races of <hi>Men. Julius Cae<U+017F>ar Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>I<U+017F>aac Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aubon,</hi> and <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> utterly deny the Being of <hi>Pygmies,</hi> and look upon them as a Figment only of the Ancients, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch little Men as they de<U+017F>cribe them to be, are no where to be met with in all the World. The Learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> tho' he e<U+017F>teems the <hi>Geranomachia</hi> to be a Fable, and <U+017F>lights it, yet thinks that what might give the occa<U+017F>ion to the Story of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> might be the <hi>Nubae</hi> or <hi>Nobae,</hi> as <hi>I<U+017F>aac Vo<U+017F><U+017F>ius</hi> conjectures that it was tho<U+017F>e <hi>Dwarfs</hi> beyond the Fountains of the <hi>Nile,</hi> that <hi>Dapper</hi> calls the <hi>Mimos,</hi> and tells us, they kill <hi>Elephants</hi> for to make a Traffick with their Teeth. But <hi>Job Ludolphus</hi> alters the Scene, and in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Cranes,</hi> <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titutes his <hi>Condors,</hi> who do not fight the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> but fly away with them, and then devour them.</p>
                  <p>Now all the<U+017F>e Conjectures do no ways account for <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Pygmies</hi> and <hi>Cranes,</hi> they are too much forced and <U+017F>train'd. Truth is always ea<U+017F>ie and plain. In our pre<U+017F>ent Ca<U+017F>e therefore I think the <hi>Orang-Outang,</hi> or <hi>wild Man,</hi> may exactly <U+017F>upply the place of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> and without any violence or injury to the Story, <U+017F>ufficiently account for the whole Hi<U+017F>tory of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> but what is mo<U+017F>t apparently fabulous; for what has been the greate<U+017F>t difficulty to be <U+017F>olved or <U+017F>atisfied, was their being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62473:86"/>
                     <hi>Men</hi>; for as <hi>Ge<U+017F>ner</hi> remarks (as I have already quoted him) <hi>Sed vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nullus aliter de Pygmaeis <U+017F>crip<U+017F>it, quàm Homunciones e<U+017F><U+017F>e.</hi> And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns too, being bya<U+017F><U+017F>ed and mi<U+017F>guided by this Notion, have either wholly denied them, or contented them<U+017F>elves in offering their Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures what might give the fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e to the inventing this Fable. And tho' <hi>Albertus,</hi> as I find him frequently quoted, thought that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> might be only a <U+017F>ort of <hi>Apes,</hi> and he is placed in the Head of tho<U+017F>e that e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>ed this Opinion, yet he <U+017F>poils all, by his way of rea<U+017F>oning, and by making them <U+017F>peak; which was more than he needed to do.</p>
                  <p>I cannot <U+017F>ee therefore any thing that will <U+017F>o fairly <U+017F>olve this doubt, that will reconcile all, that will <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily and plainly make out this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as by making the <hi>Qrang-Outang</hi> to be the <hi>Pygmie</hi> of the Ancients; for 'tis the <U+017F>ame Name that Antiquity gave them.

They have Teeth larger than Dogs; and Nails like Dogs, but longer and rounder. They dwell up in the Mountains, as far as the River <hi>Indus</hi>; they are black and very ju<U+017F>t, as are the other <hi>Indians</hi> with whom they are mixt; and they under<U+017F>tand what is <U+017F>aid to them, tho' they cannot <U+017F>peak them<U+017F>elves. But by their <hi>Barking,</hi> and their Hands and Fingers, they <U+017F>ignifie their Minds, as Deaf and Dumb Men do. They are called by the Indians, <hi>Caly<U+017F>trij,</hi> which in <hi>Greek</hi> is <hi>Cynocephali.</hi> The whole Nation is an hundred and twenty Thou<U+017F>and in number.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e <hi>Cynocephali</hi> that inhabit the Mountains, do not work, but live upon Hunting; and when they kill any wild Bea<U+017F>t, they ro<U+017F>t it in the Sun. They breed a great many Sheep, Goats and A<U+017F><U+017F>es; and drink the Milk and Butter-milk of the Sheep. They eat likewi<U+017F>e the Fruit of the <hi>Sipachora</hi> Tree, from whence comes <hi>Ambar,</hi> the Fruit whereof is <U+017F>weet, which having dried, they put up in Baskets, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do <hi>Rai<U+017F>ins.</hi> The<U+017F>e <hi>Cynocephali</hi> having made a Boat, they load it with this Fruit, and with <hi>Purpura,</hi> the Flower being fir<U+017F>t picked, and with <hi>Ambar,</hi> to the quantity of Two hundred and <U+017F>ixty Talents, which they every Year <U+017F>hip off, and as much too of the Drug, with which the Dyers dye the Scarlet; and they carry every Year a Thou<U+017F>and Talents of <hi>Ambar</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and they take with them other Commodities, which they <U+017F>ell to the <hi>Indians</hi>; for which they receive Bread, and Meal, and Cotton Garments. And the <hi>Indians</hi> <U+017F>ell them likewi<U+017F>e Swords, which they u<U+017F>e in taking the wild Bea<U+017F>ts; and Bows and Darts, for they are very skilful Archers and Darters. They are invincible, becau<U+017F>e they inhabit very high, and inacce<U+017F><U+017F>ible Mountains. Every fifth year, the King be<U+017F>tows upon them Three hundred thou<U+017F>and Bows, and as many Darts: Al<U+017F>o an Hundred and twenty thou<U+017F>and Shields, and Fifty thou<U+017F>and Swords. They have no Hou<U+017F>es, but live in Caves. In hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wild Bea<U+017F>ts, they u<U+017F>e their Bows and Darts, and pur<U+017F>uing them, they take them; for they run very <U+017F>wift. The Women bathe only once a Month, when they have their <hi>Catamenia,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e not. The Men don't bathe, but only wa<U+017F>h their hands; but they anoint them<U+017F>elves three times in a Month with Oyl made of Milk, and rub them<U+017F>elves with Hides. The Cloaths both of the Men and Women are not hairy, but Skins macerated <U+017F>mooth, and made very thin. The riche<U+017F>t of them wear Linnen, but tho<U+017F>e are but few.
