            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Eloquence</hi> is equally fortunate in taming Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and in charming <U+017F>en<U+017F>es: <U+017F>he imitates Mu<U+017F>ick, and makes u<U+017F>e of the voice of Orators to enchant the Eares, with the cadence of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and the harmony of Accents; whil<U+017F>t the ge<U+017F>tures, apt motions, Natural Aire, and all tho<U+017F>e graces, which accompany exact Recitation, <U+017F>teal away the Heart by the eyes, and work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the will.

            <p>The rule of a <hi>Metaphor</hi> is, that it be not too bold nor too far fetch'd; And though all <hi>Metaphors</hi> go beyond the true <U+017F>ignification of things, yet are they requi<U+017F>ite to expre<U+017F>s the roving fancies of mens minds, which are not content to fix them<U+017F>elves upon one thing intended, but mu<U+017F>t wander to the confines; Like the eye that cannot chu<U+017F>e but view the whole knot, when it purpo<U+017F>ely beholds but one flower in the Garden; Or like an <hi>Archer,</hi> that knowing his <hi>Bow</hi> will overca<U+017F>t or carry too <U+017F>hort, takes an aim on this <U+017F>ide or beyond the mark.

               <hi>Poeticall Fiction</hi> differ thus.

A <hi>Fable</hi> is a <hi>Simile</hi> acted by Fictions in Bea<U+017F>ts; A <hi>Poets Tale,</hi> for the mo<U+017F>t part by Gods and Men.

            <p>METONIMIA is an exchange of a name, when one word comes in lieu of another, not for a <U+017F>imilitude, but for other naturall affinity and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence; As when the matter is u<U+017F>ed for that which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts thereof; As, <hi>I want <U+017F>ilver,</hi> for <hi>money.</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48341:13"/>The <U+017F>econd way of <hi>Amplification,</hi> is by Divi<U+017F>ion, which (as a modern Author <U+017F>ays) is to anatomize it into <U+017F>everall parts, and to examine it according to <U+017F>everall circum<U+017F>tances; Not unlike the <U+017F>hew that Pedlers make of their Packs when they di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play them, contrary to the German magnificence, that <U+017F>erves in all the good meat in one di<U+017F>h. But whereas the <U+017F>ame Author <U+017F>ays, that this Art of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying will betray it <U+017F>elf in method and order. I think it rather adorns it <U+017F>elf. For in <U+017F>tead of <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He put the whole Law to the Sword</hi>; let me rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon all ages and <U+017F>orts, and <U+017F>ay; <hi>He neither <U+017F>aved the young men, as pittying the unripe flower of their youth; nor aged men, as re<U+017F>pecting their gravity; nor children, as pardoning their weakne<U+017F>s; nor women, as having compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on their Sex; Souldier, Clergyman, Citizen; armed or unarmed, re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting or <U+017F>ubmitting, all within the Town were de<U+017F>troyed by the fury of that bloody Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Note that the divi<U+017F>ions here, are taken from age, profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ex, habit, or behaviour. It may likewi<U+017F>e be from all circum<U+017F>tances; <hi>All dance, the Heavens, Elements, mens mindes, Common-wealths, and <U+017F>o by part all dance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another example varied, <hi>He apparels him<U+017F>elfe with great di<U+017F>cretion</hi>; Thus amplifie for circum<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>For <U+017F>tuffs, His cloathes were more rich then glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: As to the fa<U+017F>hion, rather u<U+017F>uall for his <U+017F>ort, then fanta<U+017F>tical for his invention; for colour, more grave and uniform then wild and light. For fitne<U+017F>s, made as well for ea<U+017F>e of exerci<U+017F>e, as to <U+017F>et forth to the eye tho<U+017F>e parts which had in him any excellency.</hi> So, to <U+017F>ay, he would take an occa<U+017F>ion of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a young witty Lady, and would rai<U+017F>e it fir<U+017F>t from her <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</hi> If <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid nothing he would partly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with her <hi><U+017F>ilence</hi>; if <U+017F>he <hi><U+017F>miled,</hi> he would gather out of it <U+017F>ome interpretation of prai<U+017F>e of her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48341:14"/>
favour, and of his own joy and good fortune; if <U+017F>he <hi>frowned,</hi> he would both move her to mirth, and deny that <U+017F>he could be angry in earne<U+017F>t; if <U+017F>he were <U+017F>ad, he would conform his <U+017F>peech and action in that <U+017F>oberne<U+017F>s to her humor, as might beguile her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by way of fal<U+017F>e confederacy; if <U+017F>he walked or played, the <U+017F>ecret prai<U+017F>e of her face, her eyes, her hair, her voyce, her hands, her body, her gait, was the application of mo<U+017F>t conceipts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gave the ground of them; yet with <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embling art, as if forgetfulne<U+017F>s or love alluded in them, not cunning or want of variety.</p>
            <p>So you may divide by the forms of <U+017F>peech in general; as, <hi>he was never to <U+017F>eek how to propo<U+017F>e or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, rai<U+017F>e or maintain, reconcile and di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h any Arguments, Hi<U+017F>tories, Similitudes, Proverbs; Je<U+017F>ts attended him in great plenty, when he needed to imploy them: he would deliver <U+017F>trong Rea<U+017F>ons carele<U+017F>ly, and choyce words <U+017F>moothly and unaffectedly; he u<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>porting wi<U+017F>dom, an eloquent prating.

And note, that this <hi>Amplification</hi> hath in it both credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and in<U+017F>truction; for it makes in<U+017F>tances of that which being generally <U+017F>poken, would <U+017F>eem but a flouri<U+017F>h, and gives more <U+017F>pecial note of that kinde, which univer<U+017F>ally could not be conceived, without confu<U+017F>ion and dulne<U+017F>s. This kinde of <hi>Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is more taken up by <hi>Cicero</hi> then <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi>; for <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> never u<U+017F>es it, but as it falls in his way.</p>
            <p>The third way of <hi>Amplification,</hi> is <hi>Accumulation,</hi> which is a heaping up of many terms of prai<U+017F>e or accu<U+017F>ation, importing but the <U+017F>ame matter, without de<U+017F>cending into any part, and hath his due <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on after <U+017F>ome argument of proof. Otherwi<U+017F>e it is like a Schoolman foming out <hi>Synonima</hi>'s, or words of one meaning, and will <U+017F>ooner beget a cen<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>uperfluity of words, then of <U+017F>ufficiency, of matter. But let us give <U+017F>ome example to amplifie a <hi>Sedition; tumults, mutinies, uproars, de<U+017F>perate con<U+017F>piracies, wicked confederacies, furious commotions, trayterous rebellions, a<U+017F><U+017F>ociations in villany, di<U+017F>tractions from allegiance, bloody garboyles, inte<U+017F>tine Ma<U+017F><U+017F>acres of Citizens.</hi> But this example is <U+017F>omewhat too <U+017F>welling. Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribe a beautiful woman; you may <U+017F>ay, <hi>She hath a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48341:15"/>
mo<U+017F>t winning countenance, a mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant eye, a mo<U+017F>t amiable pre<U+017F>ence, a cheerful a<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>he is a mo<U+017F>t delicate object, &amp;c.</hi> The ta<U+017F>te of former times hath term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <U+017F>weet, to bring in three clau<U+017F>es together of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; as, <hi>Your beauty</hi> (<U+017F>weet Lady) <hi>hath conquered my rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ubdued my will, ma<U+017F>tered my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> How this will hold among<U+017F>t our curious <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ors in their time, I know not; he that looks on the wearing of it, will finde it bare, how full of <U+017F>tuff <U+017F>oever it appears. Fir<U+017F>t, it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth for parts of divi<U+017F>ion, when indeed it is but a variation of an Engli<U+017F>h. Yet notwith<U+017F>tanding the practi<U+017F>e will furni<U+017F>h you <U+017F>tore of phra<U+017F>es, without which you <U+017F>hal never have choyce, the Mother of perfection. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Orations u<U+017F>es it much; <U+017F>ome others follow it to four clau<U+017F>es, but he <U+017F>eldom exceeds three. It has this certain effect, that it will <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ecure your vein not to be dry and exhau<U+017F>ted. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort of <hi>Accumulation,</hi> and reduce it with this under one precept. I take the u<U+017F>e of this to be in anger, dete<U+017F>tation, commi<U+017F>eration, and <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as you, <U+017F>eeming throughly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with, would willingly <U+017F>tir up in others.</p>
            <p>The fourth way of <hi>Amplification</hi> is by <hi>Intimation,</hi> and leaves the collection of greatne<U+017F>s to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding, by expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome mark of it. It exceeds <U+017F>peech in <U+017F>ilence, and makes our meaning more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by a touch, then by direct treating; as he that <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, <hi>you mu<U+017F>t live very many years in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whom you <U+017F>hould account for your friend,</hi> <U+017F>ays well; but he that <U+017F>ays, <hi>you had need eat a bu<U+017F>hel of <U+017F>alt with him,</hi> <U+017F>aith more, and gives you to reckon more then many years in his company, whom you <U+017F>hould account for your friend.

            <p>For the <hi>Hand-writing,</hi> if you attain not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it ought at lea<U+017F>t to be legible, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fairly written, and truly pointed, with <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> (,) <hi>Colon</hi> (:) <hi>Semicolon</hi> (;) <hi>Period</hi> (.) <hi>Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es</hi> (<hi>Interrogation</hi> (?) and <hi>Admiration</hi> (!) points, as the matter requires.</p>

That di<U+017F>charges our devoirs, This guides all events (pro<U+017F>perous or adver<U+017F>e) to our eternal (if it cannot temporall) felicity.

yet could it not be too dear for him that hath it; Although of painfull birth; yet that your throwes brought forth a Saint, that your dolours were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon to enthrone a part of your <U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the Angels; the<U+017F>e dolours, the<U+017F>e throwes, happily <U+017F>uffered. Tho<U+017F>e whom God makes Parents, he makes but Nur<U+017F>es of his own children, he lends them to be brought up for heaven: and if hee hath <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>charged you of this obligation, tis not <U+017F>o much a cro<U+017F>s, as a ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing; Had it lived to mature age, perhaps he <U+017F>aw danger both to It and you: it might have been more cau<U+017F>e of grief to you, more lo<U+017F>s to it <U+017F>elf; it might have been unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in life, in death unhappy; 'Tis not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children of either good or great extract, that makes them alwayes either good or happy. And this perhaps God (that provident Parent of all) fore<U+017F>aw. Be it <U+017F>o, or not, certaine it is, the bodies but the <U+017F>ouls pri<U+017F>on, wherein 'tis no <U+017F>oner breathed from Heaven, but 'tis maculated by this corrupt Earth: and in this, as it longer <U+017F>ojournes, <U+017F>o is it not only debarred of its true happine<U+017F>s &amp; welfare, but al<U+017F>o offends its great Creator; and con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is mi<U+017F>erable. Therefore would God make the cradle of yours, its death bed, that he might ha<U+017F>ten its bli<U+017F><U+017F>e. As he breathed a pure <U+017F>oul into it, <U+017F>o would he again take it before defiled by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blemi<U+017F>hes of <U+017F>in. Had it liv'd, it could have afforded no comfort to your piety, but being in health, pro<U+017F>perity, and pious; and can it be more pious, then in heaven, more pro<U+017F>perous, then in heavens joyes, more healthfull then in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of immortality. O con<U+017F>ider, tis now pa<U+017F>t all danger, 'tis freed from all mi<U+017F>ery, 'tis ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed in ble<U+017F><U+017F>edne<U+017F>s, it prayes for you. And can there be any <U+017F>orrow <U+017F>o great that the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Nor doubt (dear <hi>Madam,</hi>) but hee that gave you this dear pledge of his love, will give you more, and, as he took this to his own joyes, <U+017F>o will he leave in its <U+017F>tead more to your comfort. This he took to give it as <U+017F>oon happine<U+017F>s as being, and therein to try your virtue and re<U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his will: this as I doubt not but he will find, <U+017F>o may you be confident he will bee bountifull: a <U+017F>ure rewarder, of your patience, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>perer of your <U+017F>oul, body, and its fruitfulne<U+017F>s.
