            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may po<U+017F>sibly in this Volume have expected the <hi>Appendix</hi> which the Author heretofore promi<U+017F>ed, and has intended <U+017F>hall contain <U+017F>ome additional Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to tho<U+017F>e which were formerly publi<U+017F>h'd, and are here now reprinted in this Second Edition. The<U+017F>e following An<U+017F>wers to <hi>Franci<U+017F>cus Linus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented in compen<U+017F>ation of the delay, and for your forbearance of that <hi>Appendix,</hi> which ere long you may expect in kind. For the Author having hinted the Promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>eems thereby to acknowledge the Debt, and to be content to continue the Obligation to <U+017F>ee it performed. And the<U+017F>e ought the rather to be his excu<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e the writing the<U+017F>e <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers,</hi> and publi<U+017F>hing the <hi>Sceptical Chymi<U+017F>t,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es, have been the principal hindrances to that Piece; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>o near a readine<U+017F>s, that part of it has lyen at the Pre<U+017F>s the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix Moneths: But yet it being not all perfected, the Stationer was loth to delay any longer the Publication of the<U+017F>e, for which he has been <U+017F>o frequently call'd upon. And they (though a <hi>Latine</hi> Edition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) appear now the rather in <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> that they may accompany the Second Edition of the Original Experiments, which were printed fir<U+017F>t in that Language in <hi>Octavo;</hi> and that in<U+017F>tead of the promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Appendix</hi> they may complete the bulk of the <hi>Quarto</hi> Volume.</p>
            <p>As for that part of this Piece that concerns Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> it might have been larger: but the information that the Author had that the
<pb facs="tcp:57681:3"/>
learned Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> was writing again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Dialogues</hi> (as well that <hi>concerning the Air</hi> as the re<U+017F>t) was the occa<U+017F>ion why his H. would make no animadver<U+017F>ion on <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein, and thought it not fit to enlarge upon others. And for the <hi>Errata</hi> of the Pre<U+017F>s I hope they will not be many: however the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as to the<U+017F>e is to be excu<U+017F>ed, who never (in regard to his Eyes and Impediments on other occa<U+017F>ions) gives him<U+017F>elf the trouble of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> and <hi>Revi<U+017F>es;</hi> neither could the Publi<U+017F>her much attend the Pre<U+017F>s, it being printed in a di<U+017F>tant place from his u<U+017F>ual abode. If, as I wi<U+017F>h, you <U+017F>hall find this jealou<U+017F>ie of mine to have been cau<U+017F>le<U+017F>s, you will have rea<U+017F>on to give the Piece that is <U+017F>o kindly offered, and leads you <U+017F>uch rare and untrodden paths in the be<U+017F>t way of Natural Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the fairer entertainment and acceptance.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that know how indi<U+017F>pos'd I naturally am to Contentiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, will, I pre<U+017F>ume, wonder to <U+017F>ee me publickly engaged in two Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ies at once. But that I am <U+017F>till as aver<U+017F>e as ever from entering into Di<U+017F>putes that may hand<U+017F>omly be declin'd, the way wherein I have managed the following Controver<U+017F>ies will, I hope, evince. And the Inducements I now have to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick are <U+017F>uch, that it would be hard for me to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the being prevail'd on by them.</p>
            <p>For, in the fir<U+017F>t place, I was (by Name, as it were) challenged by a per<U+017F>on, who undertook to di<U+017F>prove not one or two of my Conjectures, but as much of the whole Body of my Treati<U+017F>e as concern'd the Spring of the Air, which mo<U+017F>t of my Explications <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e. And this being done by a Learned Man, who writes very confidently of the goodne<U+017F>s of his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Book being <U+017F>oon after follow'd by another written by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> a man of Name in the World; there <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>ome danger that <U+017F>o early an Oppo<U+017F>ition might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s the Doctrine I had propos'd, before it was well under<U+017F>tood and duly ponder'd. Wherefore I fear'd I might be wanting to the Truth and my <U+017F>elf, if I <U+017F>hould at <U+017F>uch a time be altogether <U+017F>ilent; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince I might probably divert many who would otherwi<U+017F>e be forward to appear again<U+017F>t us, by letting them <U+017F>ee how defen<U+017F>ible our Doctrine is even again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch Adver<U+017F>aries as
<pb facs="tcp:57681:4"/>
ho<U+017F>e I have reply'd to. And this cour<U+017F>e I the rather cho<U+017F>e, that in ca<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould henceforward comply with tho<U+017F>e who would have me forbear to write any further of the<U+017F>e Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ies, it might not be pre<U+017F>ently inferr'd from my <U+017F>ilence, that a good Cau<U+017F>e cannot enable a Pen no better then mine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>
            <p>But I <U+017F>carce doubt but that intelligent Readers, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e that are imbued with the Principles of the Corpu<U+017F>cularian Philo<U+017F>ophy, will be much more apt to think that I had rea<U+017F>on to write the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, then to think that I had any to make them <U+017F>o prolix: And e<U+017F>pecially ingenious men, that are accu<U+017F>tomed to admit nothing that either is not intelligible, or is precarious, will think divers of the Objections I reply to needed no An<U+017F>wers, or at lea<U+017F>t no <U+017F>olemn ones. But to the<U+017F>e I have four things to repre<U+017F>ent.</p>
            <p>And Fir<U+017F>t, That which not a little <U+017F>wells the bulk of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treati<U+017F>es, is the in<U+017F>erting tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of my Adver<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that I examine in their own words: which being a Practice that I expect from any that <U+017F>hall think fit to animadvert upon any Opinion or Argument of mine; I thought it but equitable to do what I de<U+017F>ir'd to have done to me, though oftentimes I could not do it in a little room.</p>
            <p>Next, I was the more willing to pro<U+017F>ecute <U+017F>ome of <hi>Franci<U+017F>cus Linus</hi> his Objections, becau<U+017F>e the fear of being reduc'd to grant a <hi>Vacuum</hi> has <U+017F>o prevail'd with many eminent per<U+017F>ons bred up in the received Philo<U+017F>ophy of the Schools, that though they di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree both with him and among them<U+017F>elves about the particular manner of <U+017F>olving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet they agree in a<U+017F>cribing them to <U+017F>ome extremely-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refi'd <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance that fills up the <U+017F>pace de<U+017F>erted by the Quick<U+017F>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that this Opinion, as to the main, being approved by many eminent Schoalrs, e<U+017F>pecially of that mo<U+017F>t learned Order of the Je<U+017F>uites, (to whom perhaps its Congruity to <U+017F>ome Articles of their Religion chiefly recommends it) I was willing to pay them that re<U+017F>pect, as not to di<U+017F><U+017F>ent from per<U+017F>ons, divers of whom
<pb facs="tcp:57681:4"/>
for their eminence in Mathematicks and other Learning I much e<U+017F>teem, without <U+017F>hewing that I do it not but upon Con<U+017F>iderations that I think weighty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though the Examiners <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> have but few, and not very con<U+017F>iderable, Arguments to countenance it; yet his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections again<U+017F>t our Doctrine (the Reply to which takes up the fir<U+017F>t Part of the following Treati<U+017F>e) are <U+017F>uch, as though they may be <U+017F>olidly an<U+017F>wered by any that throughly under<U+017F>tands our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is,</hi> yet they may chance puzzle <U+017F>uch Readers as do not, and the<U+017F>e po<U+017F><U+017F>iblywill prove more then a few.</p>
            <p>And, La<U+017F>tly, becau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ometimes when the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment objected did not perhaps de<U+017F>erve to be much in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on, the Argument treated of de<U+017F>erv'd to be con<U+017F>idered; I thought it not ami<U+017F>s to make u<U+017F>e now and then of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch opportunities to illu<U+017F>trate the matter it <U+017F>elf under con<U+017F>ideration: Which I the rather did for the<U+017F>e two Rea<U+017F>ons;</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e I find that, except by <U+017F>ome able Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and very few other contemplative men, the Doctrine of the Spring of the Air, at lea<U+017F>t as I have propo<U+017F>ed it, is not yet <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently apprehended, (and therefore needs to be inclucated.) In<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that through a great part of <U+017F>ome late Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of men otherwi<U+017F>e eminently learned, (written again<U+017F>t other Elateri<U+017F>ts, not me) there <U+017F>eems to run <U+017F>o great and clear a mi<U+017F>take, perhaps for want of skill in the <hi>Hydro<U+017F>taticks,</hi> that I can <U+017F>carce impute it to any thing, but to their not throughly under<U+017F>tanding the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> they would confute.</p>
            <p>And, next, becau<U+017F>e I was willing to lay down in my An<U+017F>wer to the Objections I examin'd, the grounds of an<U+017F>wering <U+017F>uch other Arguments as may be built upon the <U+017F>ame or the like Principles. And perhaps I may truly enough <U+017F>ay, that in the following Treati<U+017F>e I have already in effect an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es, written <U+017F>ome before and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ince mine, by learned men, about the <hi>Torricellian</hi> and other new Experiments relating to a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> though I forbore to mention the names or words of the Authors, becau<U+017F>e I found not that my Writings or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:57681:5"/>
were as yet known to them. To the<U+017F>e things I may adde, that I thought the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>Linus</hi> the fitter to be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>eems to have more diligently then <U+017F>ome others, (who yet venture to di<U+017F>pute again<U+017F>t it) enquired into our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>cruple to <U+017F>ay thus much of an Adver<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (and one to whom I gave no provocation to be <U+017F>o) that though I dare not <U+017F>peak in general of tho<U+017F>e that have written ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Weight of the Air, or el<U+017F>e For or Again<U+017F>t a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> becau<U+017F>e (as I acknowledge in the fir<U+017F>t Chapter following) I cannot yet procure the Books of divers learned men, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of tho<U+017F>e great Per<U+017F>onages, <hi>Robervall, Balianus</hi> and <hi>Ca<U+017F>atus;</hi> yet among the Writers I have hitherto met with, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e to the <hi>Ari<U+017F>totelean</hi> Rarefaction and Conden<U+017F>ation in the Controver<U+017F>ies under debate, <U+017F>carce any <U+017F>eems to have contrived his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> better then our <hi>Linus.</hi> Not that I think his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is either true, or (at lea<U+017F>t to <U+017F>uch as I) intelligible; but that the <hi>Funiculus</hi> he a<U+017F><U+017F>umes being allow'd him, he may, for a Rea<U+017F>on to be touch'd a little below, make out, though not all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of my Experiments, yet many more of them then mo<U+017F>t other Pleni<U+017F>ts, that deny the Spring of the Air, can deduce from their <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es</hi> if granted. And in regard that, whereas we a<U+017F>cribe to the Air a Motion of Re<U+017F>titution outwards, he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to it the like Motion inwards, it cannot but happen that, though the Principles cannot both be true, yet many of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> may be explicable by which of them <U+017F>oever is granted: becau<U+017F>e of this, I <U+017F>ay, it is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie as many ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be apt to think, to draw pertinent Objections from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience again<U+017F>t the Adver<U+017F>ary I have to deal with. Which Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ent, le<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>ome may think I have employ'd more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then I needed, <U+017F>o others <U+017F>hould think I have omitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; as indeed I have omitted <U+017F>ome, that I might pertinently have employ'd.</p>
            <p>But there is another <U+017F>ort of Per<U+017F>ons be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e I mention'd at the beginning of this Preface, to whom I mu<U+017F>t addre<U+017F><U+017F>e the remaining part of it; namely, to tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>eem troubled,
<pb facs="tcp:57681:5"/>
that I <U+017F>uffer my <U+017F>elf to be diverted either by <hi>Linus</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> from perfecting tho<U+017F>e Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental <note place="margin">About the Hi<U+017F>tory of Flame, of Heat, of Colours, of the Origine of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Forms, &amp;c.</note> Treati<U+017F>es that are lying by me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t promis'd by the learned Publi<U+017F>her of the Latine Edition of my <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ays;</hi> and from pro<U+017F>ecuting tho<U+017F>e wayes of enquiry into the Nature of things, wherein they are pleas'd to think I may be more <U+017F>erviceable to reall Learning and the Lovers of it. And I confe<U+017F>s that the<U+017F>e Mens Rea<U+017F>ons and Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions have <U+017F>o far prevailed with me, that after what I have done in the two following Treati<U+017F>es, to Vindicate my Writings from the Objections made again<U+017F>t them by two Learned men of very differing <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es,</hi> and thereby to <U+017F>hew in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure that I am not altogether unacquainted with the way of defending oppos'd Truths, I have laid a<U+017F>ide the thoughts of writing any more di<U+017F>tinct or entire <hi>Polemicall</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>es about the Subjects already di<U+017F>puted of. And to this I am invited by <U+017F>everal other Rea<U+017F>ons (be<U+017F>ides what I have newly intimated.)</p>
            <p>For fir<U+017F>t, as I el<U+017F>ewhere declare, it was not my chief De<U+017F>ign to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h Theories and Principles, but to devi<U+017F>e Experiments, and to enrich the Hi<U+017F>tory of Nature with Ob<U+017F>ervations faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made and deliver'd; that by the<U+017F>e, and the like Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by others, men may in time be furni<U+017F>h'd with a <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <U+017F>tock of Experiments to ground <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Theorys</hi> on. And though in my <hi>Phy<U+017F>ico-Mechanicall</hi> Epi<U+017F>tle and my <hi>Specimens</hi> I have ventur'd <U+017F>ome Conjectures al<U+017F>o at the Cau<U+017F>es of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> I relate, le<U+017F>t the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould appear to inqui<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Readers too jejune; yet (as I formerly <U+017F>aid) I propos'd my Thoughts but as Conjectures de<U+017F>ign'd (though not only, yet chiefly) to excite the Curio<U+017F>ity of the Ingenious, and afford <U+017F>ome hints and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the Di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>itions of the Speculative. And accordingly I have not forborn to mention divers things, which judicious Readers may ea<U+017F>ily perceive I fore<U+017F>aw that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would think unfavourable to the Opinions I inclin'd to. So that for me to leave Experimental for Controver<U+017F>ial Studies,
<pb facs="tcp:57681:6"/>
were a cour<U+017F>e un<U+017F>uitable to the principal <U+017F>cope of my Writings.</p>
            <p>Next, though I have adventur'd to improve the Doctrine of the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> by <U+017F>ome Supplements where I found it deficient, and to recommend it by <U+017F>ome new Illu<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Arguments deduc'd from my Experiments: yet the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es</hi> them<U+017F>elves (for the main) being the Opinions al<U+017F>o of far learneder Men then I, it might be thought injurious both to them and to our common Cau<U+017F>e, if I <U+017F>hould needle<U+017F>ly go about to hinder them from the Honour of Vindicating the Truths we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in; e<U+017F>pecially, <U+017F>ome of them being Excellent <hi>Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and others Eminent <hi>Naturali<U+017F>ts,</hi> who<U+017F>e Concern to maintain the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es</hi> again<U+017F>t Objections, if any <U+017F>hall ari<U+017F>e, is equal to mine, and who<U+017F>e lei<U+017F>ure and abilities far exceed tho<U+017F>e of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on who both is <U+017F>ickly, and hath other employments enough, and who (if he were far better skil'd in <hi>Geometry</hi> then he pretends to be) hath <U+017F>uch a weakne<U+017F>s in his Eyes, as makes him both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and unfit to engage in any Study where the conver<U+017F>ing with Mathematical Schemes is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, nor do I <U+017F>ee much cau<U+017F>e to doubt that the things I have deliver'd will notwith<U+017F>tanding my <U+017F>ilence be left undefended: The forwardne<U+017F>s I have already ob<U+017F>erv'd in divers <hi>Virtuo<U+017F>i</hi> to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate tho<U+017F>e Writings, which they are pleas'd to <U+017F>ay have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd them, and to <U+017F>ave me the labour of penning the following Treati<U+017F>es, <U+017F>carce permitting me <U+017F>uch an Apprehen<U+017F>ion. E<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>ince there are <U+017F>ome things that will much facilitate their Task, if not keep men from putting them upon it. For though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Linus</hi> have examin'd my Writings upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherein they differ as much from each other as from me; yet neither have they <U+017F>een cau<U+017F>e to deny any thing that I deliver as Experiment, nor have their Objections been con<U+017F>iderable, whether as to Number or to Weight, again<U+017F>t the Applications I have made of my Principles to <U+017F>olve the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> So that u<U+017F>ually without objecting any Incongruity to my particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, they are fain to fall upon the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es</hi> them<U+017F>elves: in who<U+017F>e Defence I think I may with the more Rea<U+017F>on expect to
<pb facs="tcp:57681:6"/>
be <U+017F>econded, becau<U+017F>e not only I have endeavour'd, as I formerly noted, to lay the grounds of an<U+017F>wering <U+017F>uch Objections as I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aw might ari<U+017F>e; but I have al<U+017F>o, to prevent or ea<U+017F>e their labour, written the two fir<U+017F>t Parts of my Defence again<U+017F>t <hi>Linus,</hi> without being oblig'd to do <U+017F>o for the Vindicating of my Explications, which are particularly maintain'd in the third Part.</p>
            <p>I know not whether I may venture to adde on this Occa<U+017F>ion, That tho<U+017F>e who have taken notice of the u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to true Philo<U+017F>ophy, and have ob<U+017F>erv'd that neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e the Difficulty, Trouble, and Charge of making them is <U+017F>uch, that even in this Learned Age of ours there are very few <hi>Bacon's</hi> or <hi>Mer<U+017F>ennus's</hi> to be met with, and tho<U+017F>e who have either made them<U+017F>elves, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>een others make Experiments, even <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e I have publi<U+017F>h'd, with the care I am wont to think my <U+017F>elf oblig'd to employ on <U+017F>uch Occa<U+017F>ions; will perhaps not only believe that they co<U+017F>t me far more time and pains then they that have not made or <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch tryals are apt to imagine, but will po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly think it enough for a Per<U+017F>on that is not by Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion a Scholar, to make them carefully, and <U+017F>et them down faithfully, and will allow him to let others Vindicate the Truths he may have the good fortune to di<U+017F>cover, e<U+017F>pecially, when there are <U+017F>o many fitter for it then he, who have (as well as his Adver<U+017F>aries) more lei<U+017F>ure to write Di<U+017F>putations then opportunity to pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Experiments; the latter of which to be perform'd as it ought to be, doth in many ca<U+017F>es, be<U+017F>ides <U+017F>ome Dexterity <U+017F>carce to be gain'd but by Practice, require <U+017F>ometimes more Diligence, and oftentimes too more Co<U+017F>t, then mo<U+017F>t are willing, or then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are able, to be<U+017F>tow upon them.</p>
            <p>To be <U+017F>hort, though if any thing very worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by me be <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted again<U+017F>t any of my chief Opinions or Explications, I may either take an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omewhat to it el<U+017F>ewhere, or at lea<U+017F>t have an opportunity to con<U+017F>ider it in a Review, wherein I may alter, mend, <U+017F>upply, vindicate or retract divers Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of my other Writings: yet I would not have it expected that I <U+017F>hould exchange a Book with every one that is
<pb facs="tcp:57681:7"/>
at lei<U+017F>ure to write one again<U+017F>t a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or about the <hi>Air.</hi> Which Declaration I make, not that I think it will or ought to hinder any man from making u<U+017F>e of his liberty to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent, if he <U+017F>ees cau<U+017F>e; but for the<U+017F>e two Rea<U+017F>ons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>one,</hi> That my <U+017F>ilence might not injure either the Truth or my <U+017F>elf, by tempting men to think, that whatever I do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer, I cannot; but might give unbia<U+017F>s'd and judicious Readers a Caution to allow as little of Advantage to the Writings of my adver<U+017F>aries upon the account of their being unan<U+017F>wer'd by me, as if I were no longer in the World. And the <hi>other,</hi> That I may not hinder tho<U+017F>e who would reply to <U+017F>uch Adver<U+017F>aries, by leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them an apprehen<U+017F>ion that either I may prevent them, or they me. To conclude, I <U+017F>ee no cau<U+017F>e to de<U+017F>pair, that whether or no my Writings be protected, the Truths they hold forth will in time in <U+017F>pite of oppo<U+017F>ition e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h them<U+017F>elves in the Minds of men, as the Circulation of the Bloud, and other formerly much conte<U+017F>ted Truths have already done. My Humour has na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally made me too careful not to offend tho<U+017F>e I di<U+017F><U+017F>ent from, to make it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for any man to be my Adver<U+017F>ary upon the account of Per<U+017F>onal Injuries or Provocations. And as for any whom either Judgment or Envy may invite to contend, that the things I have communicated to the World de<U+017F>erved not <U+017F>o much Applau<U+017F>e as they have had the luck to be entertain'd with; that <U+017F>hall make no Quarrel betwixt us: For perhaps I am my <U+017F>elf as much of that mind as he; and however I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>cruple to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf one of tho<U+017F>e who is more de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>pend his time u<U+017F>efully, then to have the Glory of leaving nothing that was ever written again<U+017F>t him unan<U+017F>wer'd; and who is more <U+017F>ollicitous to pur<U+017F>ue the wayes of di<U+017F>covering Truth, then to have it thought that he never was <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ubject to Humane Frailties as to mi<U+017F>s it.</p>

As accordingly it will happen, till the Spring of the Air be <U+017F>o far debilitated by its Expan<U+017F>ion, that its pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure, together with the weight of the <hi>Mercury</hi> that remains <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended, will but counter-balance, not overcome, the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air upon the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury.</hi> And this Explication may be confirm'd by this trial that I have purpo<U+017F>ely made, namely, that if in <U+017F>tead of Quick<U+017F>ilver you employ Water, and leave as before in the Tube an Inch of Air, and then inverting it, open it under Water, you will perceive the included Inch of Air not to dilate it <U+017F>elfe any thing near (for I need not here define the Proportion) halfe <U+017F>o far as it did when the Tube was almo<U+017F>t fill'd with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Weight of <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water does but equal that of between an Inch and an Inch and an halfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Quick<U+017F>ilver, and con<U+017F>equently the inward Air is far le<U+017F>s

Now the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>olution we have given of our Examiners Objection, gives us al<U+017F>o an account why the Finger is <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly fa<U+017F>tned to the upper part of the Orifice of the Tube it <U+017F>tops; for the included Air being <U+017F>o far dilated that an Inch, for example, left at fir<U+017F>t in the upper Part of the Tube, reaches twice or thrice as far as it did before the de<U+017F>cent of the Quick-<U+017F>ilver, its <U+017F>pring mu<U+017F>t be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably weakned.

By which means the Pulp of the Finger will be thru<U+017F>t in (which our Author is pleas'd to call <U+017F>uckt in) as we <U+017F>hall ere long have occa<U+017F>ion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>in our An<U+017F>wer</hi> to his <U+017F>econd Argument.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57681:10"/>
they a<U+017F>cribe to the included Air, clearly imply as much; <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>ee not why he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay that they are <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e from granting the Air to take up more Place then before, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince he takes notice in the former Chapter, that we compare the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<U+017F>ion of the Air to that of compre<U+017F>s'd Wooll; and <U+017F>ince he here al<U+017F>o annexes that we explicate Rarefaction either by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles or Vacuities. But this later Clau<U+017F>e makes me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect his meaning to be, that the <hi>Elateri<U+017F>ts</hi> do not admit that the <U+017F>ame Air may <hi>adequately</hi> fil more of Place at one time then at another; which I believe to be as true as that the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame lock of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd Wooll has no more Hairs in it, nor does adequately fill more Place with them, when it is permitted to expand it <U+017F>elf, then while<U+017F>t it remain'd compre<U+017F>s'd.

                  <p>Thus far our Authors objection, in an<U+017F>wer whereunto I have divers things to repre<U+017F>ent, to <U+017F>hew, that a good account may be given of this Experiment in the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> of the <hi>Elaterists,</hi> which is <U+017F>ufficient to manife<U+017F>t how far the argument is from being <U+017F>o unan<U+017F>werable as the propo<U+017F>er of it would per<U+017F>wade his Reader.</p>
                  <p>I deny then that the Finger is drawn downward, or made by <U+017F>uction to adhere to the Tube; but I explicate that which he calls the <U+017F>uction of the Finger, as I lately did in an<U+017F>wer to his third Argument, as we <U+017F>hall more particularly <U+017F>ee anon.</p>
                  <p>He <U+017F>ayes indeed, that the Air which thru<U+017F>t up the Quick<U+017F>ilver cannot <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly draw down the Finger. As if the Air were not a fluid body, but a <U+017F>ingle and entire pillar of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But to <U+017F>horten our reply to his objections, the be<U+017F>t way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be briefly to explicate the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>When the Tube is fill'd with Quick<U+017F>ilver, the Finger that <U+017F>tops the upper Orifice is almo<U+017F>t equally pre<U+017F>s'd above and at the <U+017F>ides by the contiguous Air; but when the lower Finger is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, then the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which before gravitated upon the Finger, comes to gravitate upon the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and by its intervention to pre<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t the outward Air: <U+017F>o that again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e parts of the Finger that are contiguous to the Air there is all the wonted pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the outward Air; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as again<U+017F>t that pulp that is contiguous to the <hi>Mercury</hi> there is not <U+017F>o much pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure as again<U+017F>t the other parts of the Finger by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57681:12"/>
two thirds. I <U+017F>ay by two thirds, or thereabout, becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi> Cylinder in this Experiment is <U+017F>uppos'd to be twenty Inches high; and if it were but a little more then thirty Inches high, (which is a third more) then the weight of the Quick<U+017F>ilver would take off not two thirds onely, but the whole pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the outward Air, from the above-mentioned pulp of the Finger. For in that ca<U+017F>e the Quick<U+017F>ilver would quite de<U+017F>ert it, and <U+017F>ettle beneath it. Wherefore <U+017F>ince it has appeared by our An<U+017F>wer to the Examiners third Argument, That the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air is taken off from the body that remains in the upper part of the Tube, according to the weight of the liquor <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Tube; and <U+017F>ince in our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the outward Air is able to keep thirty Inches of Quick<U+017F>ilver, or two or three and thirty foot of Water, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in a Tube; it need be no great wonder, if a pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient Air, equal to the weight of a Cylinder of Water of near twenty two foot long, <U+017F>hould be able to thru<U+017F>t in the pulp of the Finger at the upper Orifice of the Tube, and make it <U+017F>tick clo<U+017F>ely enough to the lip of it.</p>
                  <p>I know the Examiner affirms, That no thru<U+017F>ting or pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure from without can ever effect <U+017F>uch an adhe<U+017F>ion of the Finger to the Tube. But this <U+017F>hould be as well prov'd as <U+017F>aid. But, fir<U+017F>t, though I am willing to think the Examiner would not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly relate any thing he is not per<U+017F>waded of; yet as far as I and another per<U+017F>on very well vers'd in the<U+017F>e Experiments have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely tryed, I could not find the Adhe<U+017F>ion of the Finger to the Tube to be near <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as our Author hath related. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you carefully endeavour by pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure and otherwi<U+017F>e to thru<U+017F>t the pulp of your Finger into the Orifice of the Tube, you may through the Gla<U+017F>s perceive it to be manife<U+017F>tly tumid in the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pipe. And if by pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing your Finger again<U+017F>t the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Tube, you <U+017F>hould not make the pulp adhere quite <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly to the Tube, nor <U+017F>well quite <U+017F>o much within it, as may happen in <U+017F>ome <hi>Mercurial</hi> Experiments; it is to be con<U+017F>ider'd, that the Air being a fluid as well as a heavy body, it does not (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57681:12"/>
gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Weights would) pre<U+017F>s only again<U+017F>t the upper part of the Finger, but pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing as much of the finger as is expos'd to it almo<U+017F>t every where, and almo<U+017F>t uniformly, as well as <U+017F>trongly, it does by its lateral pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure on every <U+017F>ide thru<U+017F>t in the Pulp of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the hole where there is not any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance at all, or at lea<U+017F>t near <U+017F>o much pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t the Pulp as that of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air again<U+017F>t the parts of the Finger contiguous to it.</p>
                  <p>By this it may appear that we need not borrow the Objection our Author offers to lend us; namely, that in the Experiment under con<U+017F>ideration the Quick<U+017F>ilver is pre<U+017F>s'd downward by the Spring of <U+017F>ome Air lurking betwixt it and the Finger. (Though I am prone to think that unle<U+017F>s the Experiment be made with a great deal of care, <U+017F>uch a thing may ea<U+017F>ily happen, and contribute to the <U+017F>tronger Adhe<U+017F>ion of the Finger to the Tube.) This I <U+017F>ay may appear notwith<U+017F>tanding what our Author Objects, that the Air expanding it <U+017F>elf wil thru<U+017F>t away the Finger upwards, <U+017F>ince the contrary of that pretence we have lately manife<U+017F>ted in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer to his Third Argument. And as for what he adds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Argumentation in the<U+017F>e Words, <hi>Quod vel inde confirmatur, Quia cum praponderans ille aër <U+017F>uccedat</hi>

So that although both the lower Finger do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed keep up the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube, and the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the outward Air would do <U+017F>o too; yet there is this difference, that the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere</hi> depending upon its Weight, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intended and weakned as we plea<U+017F>e, as can that of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermo<U+017F>t Finger.

So that as to the Examiners Experiment, we may well explicate it in our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> by <U+017F>aying, that agreeably to it it happens, that in a more forcible Re<U+017F>piration the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is rai<U+017F>ed higher then in a more languid; becau<U+017F>e, in the former Ca<U+017F>e, the Che<U+017F>t being more dilated, the included Air is al<U+017F>o more expanded; whereby its debilitated Spring cannot as before enable the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> to counterpoi<U+017F>e altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57681:14"/>
the Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient Air. And that the Rea<U+017F>on why the Quick<U+017F>ilver is not by Re<U+017F>piration rais'd as high as it is kept <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, is not, that the Pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of the outward Air is unable to rai<U+017F>e it <U+017F>o high, but becau<U+017F>e, as we have already declar'd, the free Dilatation of the <hi>Thorax</hi> is oppo<U+017F>ed by the Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient Air; which Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure being again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a Superficies, and being but imperfectly re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the debilitated Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Air within the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> will be ea<U+017F>ily imagined to be very con<U+017F>iderable by him who con<U+017F>iders that in our Engine, the Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the external Air again<U+017F>t the Sucker of le<U+017F>s then three Inches Diameter was, as we relate in the 33. Experiment, able to thru<U+017F>t up a Weight of above a hundred pound. And here we may ob<U+017F>erve upon the By in Confirmation of our former Doctrine, that when we <U+017F>trongly <U+017F>uck up Quick<U+017F>ilver in a Gla<U+017F>s Tube, though the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Quick<U+017F>ilver be according to our Author perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med likewi<U+017F>e by his <hi>Funiculus</hi> contracting it <U+017F>elfe every way, and though there be a Communication betwixt the internal Surface of the Lungs, and the Cavity of the Tube; yet we feel not in our Lungs any endeavour of the <U+017F>hrinking <hi>Funiculus</hi> to tear off that Membrane they are lin'd with.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have examin'd our Authors four Arguments, to prove that in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment the Quick<U+017F>ilver can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be kept <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended by the counterpoi<U+017F>e of the external Air: Again<U+017F>t which Opinion he tells us indeed, that other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments might be alledg'd, but as it is not probable that if he had thought them better then tho<U+017F>e he has <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> elected to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on, he would have omitted them; <U+017F>o 'tis not unlikely that An<U+017F>wers might be as well found for them as for the others; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince that which he <U+017F>ingles out for a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi> is, that from his Adver<U+017F>aries <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> it would follow, that the Quick<U+017F>ilver would de<U+017F>cend much more (I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e 'tis a mi<U+017F>take of the Pre<U+017F>s, for much le<U+017F>s) in cold Weather then in hot, becau<U+017F>e the Air is then thicker and heavier, and therefore ought to impel up the Quick<U+017F>ilver higher.

For the Corpu<U+017F>cles of Light that permeate that <U+017F>pace may be <U+017F>o numerous, as to leave no <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible part of it un-inlightned; and yet may have <U+017F>o many little empty Intervals betwixt them, that, if all that is corporeal in the <U+017F>pace we <U+017F>peak of were united into one lump, it would not perhaps adequately fill the one half (not to <U+017F>ay the tenth, or even the hundredth part) of the whole <U+017F>pace: According to what we have noted in the 17. Experiment, that a Room may appear full of the <U+017F>moke of a Perfume, though if all the Corpu<U+017F>cles that compo<U+017F>e that <U+017F>moke were re-united, they would again make up but a <U+017F>mall Pa<U+017F>til. To which purpo<U+017F>e I remember I have taken <hi>Camphire,</hi> of which a little will fill a Room with its odour, and having in well-clos'd di<U+017F>tillatory Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es caught the <U+017F>umes dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over by hear, I thereby reduc'd them to re conjoyn into true <hi>Camphire,</hi> who<U+017F>e bulk is very incon<U+017F>iderable in compari<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>pace it fills as to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, when the odorous Corpu<U+017F>cles are <U+017F>cattered through the free Air.</p>
                  <p>To which I might adde, that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment being made in a dark night, or in a Room perfectly darken'd, if it <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (as there is little cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect it will not) it may well be doubted whether our Authors Argument will there take place. For if he endeavour to prove that the place in que<U+017F>tion was full in the dark, becau<U+017F>e upon the letting in of the Day, or the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a Candle, the light appears within it; the Vacui<U+017F>ts may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57681:18"/>
reply according to their <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> That that light is a new one, flowing from the lucid body that darts its corporeal beams quite through the Gla<U+017F>s and Space we di<U+017F>pute about, which for want of <U+017F>uch Corpu<U+017F>cles were not ju<U+017F>t before vi<U+017F>ible.</p>
                  <p>And <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing light not to be made by a trajection of Atoms through Diaphanous bodies, but a propagation of the impul<U+017F>e of lucid bodies through them; yet it will not thence nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow, that the de<U+017F>erted part of the Tube mu<U+017F>t be full: As in our 27. Experiment (though many of tho<U+017F>e gro<U+017F>s Aerial Particles that appear'd nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to convey a languid <U+017F>ound were drawn out of our Receiver at the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd Ex<U+017F>uction; yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd <U+017F>o many of the like Corpu<U+017F>cles, that tho<U+017F>e that were wanting were not mi<U+017F>s'd by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, though afterwards, when a far greater number was drawn out, they were) <U+017F>o there may be matter enough remaining to tran<U+017F>mit the impul<U+017F>e of light; though betwixt the Particles of that matter there <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>tore of vacuities intercepted. Whereas our Author pretends to prove, not onely that there is no <hi>coacervate</hi> Vacuity in the <U+017F>pace <U+017F>o often mentioned, but ab<U+017F>olutely that there is <hi>none.</hi> For 'tis in this la<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, as well as the other, that the Schools and our Author, who defends their Opinion, deny a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwith<U+017F>tanding what we have now di<U+017F>cours'd, as in our 17. Experiment we declin'd determining whether there be a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> or no; <U+017F>o now what we have <U+017F>aid to the Examiners Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has not been to declare our whole <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ie, but onely to <U+017F>hew, that though his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> yet his Arguments do not <U+017F>ufficiently prove it: which may help to <U+017F>hew his Doctrine to be precarious; for otherwi<U+017F>e the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ians,</hi> though Pleni<U+017F>ts, may plau<U+017F>ibly enough (whether truly or no I now di<U+017F>pute not) decline the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of admitting a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the de<U+017F>erted <U+017F>pace of the Tube, by <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing it fill'd with their <U+017F>econd and fir<U+017F>t Element, who<U+017F>e Particles they imagine to be minute enough freely to pa<U+017F>s in and out through the Pores of Gla<U+017F>s. But then they mu<U+017F>t allow the pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of the outward Air to be the cau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ion of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57681:19"/>
Quick<U+017F>ilver: for though the <hi>materia coele<U+017F>tis</hi> may readily fill the <U+017F>paces the <hi>Mercury</hi> de<U+017F>erts; yet that within the Tube cannot binder <U+017F>o ponderous a liquor from <U+017F>ub<U+017F>iding as low as the re<U+017F>tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Mercury;</hi> <U+017F>ince all the parts of the Tube, as well the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermo<U+017F>t as the uppermo<U+017F>t, being pervious to that <U+017F>ubtile matter, it may with like facility <U+017F>ucceed in whatever part of the Tube <U+017F>hall be for <U+017F>aken by the Quick<U+017F>ilver.</p>
                  <p>The Examiners <U+017F>econd Argument in the <U+017F>ame place is, That <U+017F>ince the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is not <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd by the outward Air, it mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be, that it be kept <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended by his internal <U+017F>tring. But <U+017F>ince for the proof of this he is content to refer us to the third Chapter; our having already examin'd that, allows us to proceed to his third Argument, which is, That the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Cylinder,</hi> re<U+017F>ting in its wonted <U+017F>tation, does not gravitate: as may appear by applying the Finger to the immers'd or lower Orifice of the Tube.

And indeed if you dexterou<U+017F>ly apply your Finger to the open end of the Tube, when you have almo<U+017F>t, but not quite, lifted it out of the re<U+017F>tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Mercury,</hi> (which circum<U+017F>tance mu<U+017F>t not be neglected, though our Author have omitted it) that <U+017F>o you may <U+017F>hut up no more Quick<U+017F>ilver then the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is wont to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of, you will find the Experiment to <U+017F>ucceed well enough: (Which makes me <U+017F>omewhat wonder to find it affirm'd, that the learned <hi>Maignan</hi> denies it) not but that you will feel upon your Finger a gravitation or pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Gla<U+017F>s-Tube, and the contained <hi>Mercury,</hi> as of one body; but that you will not feel any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the <hi>Mercury</hi> apart, as if it endeavoured to thru<U+017F>t away your Finger from the Tube. But the rea<U+017F>on of this is not hard to give in our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is;</hi> for according to that, the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> and the Air counterpoi<U+017F>ing one another, the Finger <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tains not any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly-differing pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure from the ambient Air that pre<U+017F><U+017F>es again<U+017F>t the Nail and <U+017F>ides of it, and from the included Quick<U+017F>ilver that pre<U+017F><U+017F>es again<U+017F>t the Pulp. But if the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> <U+017F>hould exceed the u<U+017F>ual length, then the Finger would

The rea<U+017F>on of which (whether that inqui<U+017F>itive man have given it or no) is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in our pre<U+017F>ent Controver<U+017F>ie to be lookt after.</p>

'tis ea<U+017F>ie to give an account in our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> by two <U+017F>everal wayes; whereof the <hi>Fir<U+017F>t</hi> (which is proper chiefly when the Experiment is made in a clo<U+017F>e place, as our Receiver) is, That the Quick<U+017F>ilver by its <U+017F>udden de<U+017F>cent acquires an <hi>impetus</hi> <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure it has upon the <U+017F>core of its wonted gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; whereby it for a while falls below its <U+017F>tation, and thereby compre<U+017F><U+017F>es the Air that leans upon the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury.</hi> Which Air by its own Spring again forcibly dilating it <U+017F>elf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its former exten<U+017F>ion, and (as is u<U+017F>ual in Springs) ha<U+017F>tily fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, expands it <U+017F>elf beyond it, and thereby impells up the Quick<U+017F>ilver <U+017F>omewhat above its wonted <U+017F>tation, in its fall from whence it again acquires <U+017F>omewhat (though not <U+017F>o much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) of <hi>impetus</hi> or power, to force the Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Air to a Sub-ingre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and this reciprocation of pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure betwixt the Quick<U+017F>ilver and the outward Air decrea<U+017F>ing by degrees, does at length wholly cea<U+017F>e, when the <hi>Mercury</hi> has lo<U+017F>t that <U+017F>uperadded pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure, which it acquired by its falling from parts of the Tube higher then its due <U+017F>tation. But this <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> way of explicating the<U+017F>e Vibrations is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in the free Air: for if we con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ambient Air onely as a weight, and remember what we have newly <U+017F>aid of the <hi>impetus</hi> acquir'd by de<U+017F>cent; this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> may be ea<U+017F>ily enough explain'd, by taking notice of what happens in a Balance, when one of the equiponderant Scales chancing to be depre<U+017F>s'd, they do not till after many Vibrations <U+017F>ettle <hi>in aequilibrio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on this occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hall adde this Experiment: I took a Gla<U+017F>s Pipe, who<U+017F>e two legs (very unequal in length) were paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel enough, and both perpendicular to that part of the Pipe that connected them, (<U+017F>uch a <hi>Syphon</hi> is de<U+017F>crib'd in our 36.

                  <p>THirdly, But though our Examiner have not <U+017F>ufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> yet perhaps it may be in its own nature <U+017F>o like to be true, as to de<U+017F>erve to be imbrac'd as <U+017F>uch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will now take notice of <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e many things that to our apprehen<U+017F>ion render it very improbable.</p>
                  <p>And fir<U+017F>t, whereas our Author acknowledges that Quick<U+017F>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Water, Wine, and other liquors, will, as well one as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, de<U+017F>cend in Tubes exactly <U+017F>ealed at the top, in ca<U+017F>e the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of liquor exceed the weight of a Mercurial Cylinder of 29½. Inches; and will <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ide no longer then till it is come to equiponderate a Cylinder of Quick<U+017F>ilver of that height; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I <U+017F>ay, the Examiner is by the ingenious Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Pa<U+017F>chall</hi>'s, and other Experiments, induc'd to admit this; it cannot but <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange that, whatever the liquor be, there <U+017F>hould be ju<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame weight or <U+017F>trength to extend them into a <hi>Funiculus:</hi> though Water, for in<U+017F>tance, and Quick<U+017F>ilver be near fourteen times as heavy one as the other, and be otherwi<U+017F>e of very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant

natures; and though divers other liquors, as Oyle and Water, be likewi<U+017F>e of Textures very differing. And this may <U+017F>omewhat the more be wondred at, becau<U+017F>e our Author (in his Animadver<U+017F>ions upon our 31. Experiment) is plea<U+017F>ed to make <U+017F>o great a difference betwixt the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of bodies of various con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tences, as fluid and firm, to be extenuated into a <hi>Funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that he will not allow any humane force to be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one, by the divul<U+017F>ion of two flat Marbles, in ca<U+017F>e the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of their Surfaces were <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>ite as quite to exclude all Air; though in the <U+017F>ame place his Ratiocination plainly enough teaches (which Experience however does) that adhering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, though with extraordinary difficulty, may be forcibly <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and according to him the <U+017F>uperficial parts may be di<U+017F>tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> that prevents a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> of his Adver<U+017F>aries is not at all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with this difficulty. For the weight of the outward Air being that which keeps liquors <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in Tubes <U+017F>ealed at the top; it matters not of what nature or texture the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is, provided its weight be the <U+017F>ame with that of a Mercurial Cylinder equiponderant to the Aerial one: As if there be a pound of Lead in one Scale, it will not de<U+017F>troy the <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> whether what be put in the other be Gold, or Quick<U+017F>ilver, or Wooll, or Feathers, provided its weight be ju<U+017F>t a pound.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we may take notice, That the account our Examiner gives us of his <hi>Funiculus</hi> in the tenth Chapter, (where he takes upon him to explicate it) is much more <U+017F>trange then <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, and not made out by any <U+017F>uch parallel operations of Nature, as his Adver<U+017F>aries will not (and may not well do it) di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the truth of. Whereas the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of the Air may be inferr'd from <U+017F>uch unque<U+017F>tion'd Experiments as are not concern'd in our pre<U+017F>ent Controver<U+017F>ie. For the gravity of the Air may be manife<U+017F>ted by a pair of Scales, &amp; the Spring of it di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>es it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o clearly in wind-guns and other In<U+017F>truments, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ary (as we have already had occa<U+017F>ion to inculcate) does not deny it.

Though it be the onely Example whereby he endeavours to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<U+017F>trate the generation of his <hi>Funiculus,</hi> yet (I pre<U+017F>ume) he <U+017F>carce expects we <U+017F>hould think it an appo<U+017F>ite one. For, be<U+017F>ides that there here intervenes a con<U+017F>picuous and powerful Agent, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an actual Fire to <U+017F>ever and agitate the parts of the Candle; and be<U+017F>ides that there is a manife<U+017F>t wa<U+017F>ting of the Wax or Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low turn'd into flame; be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e things, I <U+017F>ay, we mu<U+017F>t not admit, that the Fuel when turn'd into a flame does really fill (I <U+017F>ay not, with our Author) more then a thou<U+017F>and times, but <U+017F>o much as twice more of genuine <U+017F>pace then the Wax 'twas made of. For it may be <U+017F>aid that the flame is little or nothing el<U+017F>e then an aggregate of tho<U+017F>e Corpu<U+017F>cles which before lay upon the upper <U+017F>uperficies of the Candle, and by the violent heat were divided into minuter particles, vehemently agitated and brought from lying as it were upon a flat to beat off one another, and make up about the Wiek <U+017F>uch a figure as is u<U+017F>ual in the flame of Candles burning in the free Air. Nor will it nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow, that the <U+017F>pace which the flame <U+017F>eems to take up <U+017F>hould contain neither Air nor <hi>Aether,</hi> nor any thing el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ave the parts of that flame, becau<U+017F>e the eye cannot di<U+017F>cern any other body there: For even the <U+017F>moke a<U+017F>cending from the <U+017F>nuff of a newly-extingui<U+017F>h'd Candle appears a dark pillar, which to the eye at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance <U+017F>eems to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of <U+017F>moke; whenas yet there are <U+017F>o many Aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and other invi<U+017F>ible Corpu<U+017F>cles mingled with it, as if all tho<U+017F>e parts of <U+017F>moke that make a great <U+017F>how in the Air were collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contiguous, they would not perhaps amount to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of a Pins head: as may appear by the great quantity of <U+017F>teams that in Chymical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are wont to go to the making up of one drop of Spirit. And therefore it does not ill fall out for our turn, that the Examiner, to inforce his former Example, alledges the turning of a particle of Quick<U+017F>ilver into vapour, by putting fire under it: for if <U+017F>uch be the Rarefaction of <hi>Mercury,</hi> 'tis not at all like to make <U+017F>uch a <hi>Funiculus</hi> as he talks of, <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e Mercurial Fumes appear by divers Experiments, to be <hi>Mercury</hi> divided and thrown abroad into minute parts, whereby

though the body obtain more of Surface then it had before, yet it really fills no more of true and genuine <U+017F>pace, <U+017F>ince if all the particular little <U+017F>paces fill'd by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>catter'd Corpu<U+017F>cles were reduc'd into one, (as the Corpu<U+017F>cles them<U+017F>elves often are in Chymical Operations) they would amount but to one total <U+017F>pace, equal to that of the whole <hi>Mercury</hi> before rarefaction. But the<U+017F>e Objections again<U+017F>t this Explication are not all that I have to <U+017F>ay again<U+017F>t our Adver<U+017F>aries <hi>Funiculus</hi> it <U+017F>elf.</p>
                  <p>For I farther demand how the <hi>Funiculus</hi> comes by <U+017F>uch hooks or graple-irons, or parts of the like <U+017F>hape, to take fa<U+017F>t hold of all contiguous bodies, and even the <U+017F>moothe<U+017F>t, <U+017F>uch as Gla<U+017F>s, and the calm <U+017F>urfaces of Quick<U+017F>ilver, Water, Oyle, and other fluids: And how the<U+017F>e <U+017F>lender and invi<U+017F>ible hooks cannot onely in the ter<U+017F>e<U+017F>t bodies find an innumerable company of ears or loops to take hold on, but hold <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly that they are able not alone to lift up a tall Cylinder of that very ponderous metall of Quick<U+017F>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but to draw inwards the <U+017F>ides of <U+017F>trong Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>o forcibly, as to break them all to pieces. And 'tis al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>trange, that Water and other fluid bodies (who<U+017F>e parts are wont to be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparable) <U+017F>hould, when the <hi>Funiculus</hi> once layes hold on the <U+017F>uperficial Corpu<U+017F>cles, pre<U+017F>ently emulate the nature of con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tent bodies, and be drawn up like Ma<U+017F><U+017F>es each of them of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire piece; though even in the exhau<U+017F>ted Receiver they appear by their undulation (when they are <U+017F>tir'd by Bubbles that pa<U+017F>s freely through them) and many other <U+017F>igns to continue fluid bodies.</p>
                  <p>It <U+017F>eems al<U+017F>o very difficult to conceive how this extenuated <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>hould acquire <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a <U+017F>pring inward as the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all along his book a<U+017F>cribes to it. Nor will it <U+017F>erve his turn to require of us in exchange an Explication of the Airs <U+017F>pring outward, <U+017F>ince he acknowledges, as well as we, that it has <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pring. I know, that by calling this extenuated <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus,</hi> he <U+017F>eems plainly to intimate that it has its <U+017F>pring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, upon the <U+017F>ame account that Lute-<U+017F>trings and Ropes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly <U+017F>tretch'd have theirs. But there is no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57681:24"/>
them: for whereas in <U+017F>trings there is requir'd either wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or <U+017F>ome peculiar and artificial texture of the component parts; a rarefaction of Air (were it granted) does not include or infer any <U+017F>uch contrivance of parts as is requi<U+017F>ite to make bodies Ela<U+017F>tical. And if the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ian</hi> Notion of the cau<U+017F>e of Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s be admitted, then our extenuated <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance having no Pores to be pervaded by the <hi>materia <U+017F>ubtilis</hi> (to which be<U+017F>ides our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor al<U+017F>o makes Gla<U+017F>s impervious) will be de<U+017F>titute of Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. And however, <U+017F>ince Lute-<U+017F>trings, Ropes, &amp;c. mu<U+017F>t, when they <U+017F>hrink inwards, either fill up or le<U+017F><U+017F>en their Pores, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e in thickne<U+017F>s as they dimini<U+017F>h in length; our Examiners <hi>Funiculus</hi> mu<U+017F>t differ very much from them, <U+017F>ince it has no Pores to receive the <U+017F>hrinking parts, and contracts it <U+017F>elf as to length, without increa<U+017F>ing its thickne<U+017F>s. Nor can it well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that this <U+017F>elf-contraction is done <hi>ob fugam vacui,</hi> <U+017F>ince though it <U+017F>hould not be made, a <hi>Vacuum</hi> would not en<U+017F>ue. And if it be <U+017F>aid that it is made that the preternaturally <U+017F>tretch'd body might re<U+017F>tore it <U+017F>elf to its natural dimen<U+017F>ions: I an<U+017F>wer, That I am not very forward to allow acting for ends to bodies inanimate, and con<U+017F>equently devoid of knowledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>hould gladly <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome unque<U+017F>tionable Examples produc'd of Operations of that nature. And however to me, who in Phy<U+017F>ical enquiries of this nature look for efficient rather then final cau<U+017F>es, 'tis not ea<U+017F>ie to conceive how Air by being expanded (in which ca<U+017F>e its force (like that of other rarify'd bodies) <U+017F>eems principally to tend outwards, as we <U+017F>ee in fired Gun-powder, in <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> in warm'd Weather-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, &amp;c.) <U+017F>hould acquire <U+017F>o prodigious a force of moving contiguous bodies inwards. Nor does it to me <U+017F>eem very probable, that, when for in<U+017F>tance part of a poli<U+017F>h'd Marble is extended into a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> that <hi>Funiculus</hi> does <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly a<U+017F>pire to turn into Marble again. I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>h our Author had more clearly explicated, how it comes to pa<U+017F>s (which he all along takes for granted) that the acce<U+017F>s of the outward Air does <U+017F>o much and <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly relax the ten<U+017F>ion of his <hi>Funiculus;</hi> <U+017F>ince that being (according to him) a real and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57681:24"/>
Porele<U+017F>s body, 'tis not <U+017F>o obvious how the pre<U+017F>ence of another can <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily and to <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a degree make it <U+017F>hrink. But I will rather ob<U+017F>erve, that 'tis very unlikely that the <U+017F>pace which our Adver<U+017F>ary would have repleni<U+017F>h'd with his <hi>Funicular</hi> <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, <U+017F>hould be full of little highly-<U+017F>tretcht <U+017F>trings, that lay fa<U+017F>t hold of the Surfaces of all contiguous bodies, and alwayes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently endeavour to pull them inwards. For we have related in our 26. Experiment, that a <hi>Pendulum</hi> being <U+017F>et a moving in our exhau<U+017F>ted Receiver, did <U+017F>wing to and fro as freely, and with the <U+017F>tring <U+017F>tretch'd as <U+017F>treight, as for ought we could perceive it would have done in the common Air. Nay, the Balance of a Watch did there move freely and nimbly to and fro; which 'tis hard to conceive tho<U+017F>e bodies could do, if they were to break through a <hi>medium</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of innumerable exceedingly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tretch'd <U+017F>trings. On which occa<U+017F>ion we might adde, that 'tis <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>trange that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trings, thus cut or broken by the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the<U+017F>e bodies through them, could <U+017F>o readily have their parts re-united, and without any more ado be made intire again. And we might al<U+017F>o take notice of this as another <U+017F>trange peculiarity in our Authors <hi>Funiculus,</hi> That in this ca<U+017F>e the two divided parts of each <U+017F>mall <U+017F>tring that is broken do not, like tho<U+017F>e of other broken <U+017F>trings, <U+017F>hrink and fly back from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but (as we ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>aid) immediately redintegrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves: Whereas, when in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment the Tube and contain'd <hi>Mercury</hi> is <U+017F>uddenly lifted up out of the re<U+017F>tagnant Quick<U+017F>ilver into the Air, the <hi>Funiculus</hi> does <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it <U+017F>elf, that it quite vani<U+017F>hes; in<U+017F>omuch that the a<U+017F>cending <hi>Mercury</hi> may ri<U+017F>e to the very top of the Tube.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The <hi>Ari<U+017F>totelean Rarefaction</hi> (propo<U+017F>ed by the Adver<U+017F>ary) examin'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt this is not all that renders the Examiners <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable:</hi> For, be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e already mentioned particulars, upon who<U+017F>e <U+017F>core it is very <hi>difficult</hi> to be <hi>under<U+017F>tood;</hi> it nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es <U+017F>uch a Rarefaction and Conden<U+017F>ation, as is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s, to me, as well as to many other con<U+017F>idering per<U+017F>ons, <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better di<U+017F>cernment of the force of this Objection we mu<U+017F>t briefly premi<U+017F>e, That a body is commonly <U+017F>aid to be rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd or dilated, (for I take the word in a larger <U+017F>en<U+017F>e then, I know, many others do, for a rea<U+017F>on that will quickly appear) when it acquires greater dimen<U+017F>ions then the <U+017F>ame body had before; and to be condens'd, when it is reduc'd into le<U+017F>s dimen<U+017F>ions, that is, into a le<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>pace then it contain'd before: (as when a dry Spunge being fir<U+017F>t dipp'd in water <U+017F>wells to a far greater bulk, and then being <U+017F>trongly <U+017F>queez'd and held compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, is not onely reduced into le<U+017F>s room then it had before it was <U+017F>queezed, but into le<U+017F>s then it had even before it was wetted.) And I mu<U+017F>t further premi<U+017F>e, That Rarefaction (as al<U+017F>o Conden<U+017F>ation) being among<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t obvious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, there are three (and for ought we know but three) wayes of explicating it: For, either we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay with the Atomi<U+017F>ts and Vacui<U+017F>ts, that the Corpu<U+017F>cles whereof the rarefied body con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts do <U+017F>o depart from each other, that no other <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance comes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to fill up the de<U+017F>erted <U+017F>paces that come to be left betwixt the incontiguous Corpu<U+017F>cles; or el<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay with divers of the ancient Philo<U+017F>ophers, and many of the moderns, e<U+017F>pecially the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ians,</hi> that the<U+017F>e new Intervals produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Particles of the rarefied body are but dilated Pores, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleni<U+017F>hed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57681:25"/>
in like manner as tho<U+017F>e of the tumid Spunge are by the imbibed water, by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubtile Aethereal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, that in<U+017F>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it <U+017F>elf betwixt the disjoyned Particles: or, la<U+017F>tly, we mu<U+017F>t imagine with <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of his followers, that the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame body does not onely <hi>obtain</hi> a greater <U+017F>pace in Rarefaction, and a le<U+017F><U+017F>er in Conden<U+017F>ation, but adequately and exactly <hi>fill it,</hi> and <U+017F>o when rarefied acquires larger dimen<U+017F>ions without either lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any vacuities betwixt its component Corpu<U+017F>cles, or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between them any new or extraneous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance what<U+017F>oever.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis to this la<U+017F>t (and, as <U+017F>ome call it, <hi>rigorous)</hi> way of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction that our Adver<U+017F>ary has recour<U+017F>e in his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is:</hi> Though this, I confe<U+017F>s, appear to me <U+017F>o difficult to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that I make a doubt whether any <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> can be <hi>explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by it; <U+017F>ince to <hi>explain</hi> a thing is to deduce it from <U+017F>omething or other in Nature more known then it <U+017F>elf.</p>
                  <p>He that would meet with full Di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this <hi>Ari<U+017F>totelean</hi> Rarefaction, may re<U+017F>ort to the learned writings of <hi>Ga<U+017F><U+017F>endus, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ius</hi> and <hi>Maignan,</hi> who have accu<U+017F>ed it of divers great ab<U+017F>urdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But for my part, I <U+017F>hall at pre<U+017F>ent content my <U+017F>elf to make u<U+017F>e to my purpo<U+017F>e of two or three pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages that I meet with (though not together) in our Author him<U+017F>elf.</p>

Nor do I <U+017F>ee, if one portion of Air may <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily be brought exactly to fill up a <U+017F>pace two thou<U+017F>and times as big as that which it did <hi>but</hi> fill before without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any new <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; I <U+017F>ee not (I <U+017F>ay) why the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every of the<U+017F>e two thou<U+017F>and parts of <U+017F>pace may not be further brought to fill two thou<U+017F>and more, and <U+017F>o onwards, <U+017F>ince each of the<U+017F>e newly-replen <U+017F>hed <U+017F>paces is pre<U+017F>umed to be exactly filled with Body, and no <U+017F>pace, nor con<U+017F>equently that which the unrarefied Air repleni<U+017F>hed, can be more then adequately full. And <U+017F>ince, according to our Adver<U+017F>ary, not onely fluid bodies, as Air and Quick<U+017F>ilver, but even <U+017F>olid and hard ones, as Marble, are capable of <U+017F>uch a Di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion as we <U+017F>peak of, why may not the World be made I know not how many thou<U+017F>and times bigger
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57681:26"/>
then it is, without either admitting any thing of Vacuity betwixt its parts, or being increa<U+017F>ed with the addition of one Atome of new matter? Which to me is <U+017F>o difficult to conceive, that I have <U+017F>ometimes doubted, whether in ca<U+017F>e it could be proved, that in the exhau<U+017F>ted Globe we <U+017F>peak of there were no Vacuities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor any <U+017F>ubtile matter permitted to enter from without, it were not more intelligible to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that God had created a new matter to joyn with the Air in filling up the Cavity, then that the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame Air <U+017F>hould adequately fill two thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>paces, whereof one was exactly commen<U+017F>urate to it even when it was uncompre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. For divers eminent Naturali<U+017F>ts, both ancient and modern, believing upon a Phy<U+017F>ical account the Souls of men to be created and infu<U+017F>ed, will admit it as intelligible that God does frequently create <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances on certain emergent occa<U+017F>ions. But I know that many of them will not likewi<U+017F>e think it concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that without his immediate interpo<U+017F>ition an acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of new, real Dimen<U+017F>ions <U+017F>hould be had without either vacuities or acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of matter.</p>
                  <p>And indeed when I con<U+017F>idered the<U+017F>e difficulties and others, that attend the Rarefaction our Examiner throughout his whole book <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es, and when I found that ever and anon he remits us to what he teaches concerning Rarefaction; I could not but with <U+017F>ome greedine<U+017F>s re<U+017F>ort to the Chapters he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me to. But when I had peru<U+017F>ed them, I found the Difficulties remained <hi><U+017F>uch</hi> <U+017F>till, and that 'twas very hard even for a witty man to make more of a <U+017F>ubject then the nature of it does bear. Which I <U+017F>ay, that by profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elf un<U+017F>atisfied with what he writes, I may not be thought to find fault with a man for not doing what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not to be done, and for not making <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>tru<U+017F>e Notions <hi>plain,</hi> as are <U+017F>carcely (if at all) <U+017F>o much as <hi>intelligible.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as he has handled this <U+017F>ubject mode<U+017F>tly enough, <U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome places his Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions are to me <U+017F>omewhat dark; which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to impute it as a Crime in him, that he wrote in a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and doubtful <U+017F>train of <U+017F>o difficult a matter, but to excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf if I have not alwayes gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed aright at his meaning.</p>

The things he alledges in favour of the Rarefaction he would per<U+017F>wade are two: The one, That the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction <hi>cannot</hi> be explicated either by Vacuities or the <U+017F>ubingre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of an Aethereal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; and the other, That there are two wayes of explicating the rigorous Rarefaction he contends for.</p>
                  <p>His Objections again<U+017F>t the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Carte<U+017F>ian</hi> wayes of making out Rarefaction are <U+017F>ome of them more plau<U+017F>ible then mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e that are wont to be urged again<U+017F>t them; yet not <U+017F>uch as are not capable enough of An<U+017F>wers. But while<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages appeared ea<U+017F>ie to be replyed to by the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> they oppo<U+017F>e, before I had fully examined the re<U+017F>t, chancing to mention the<U+017F>e Chapters to an ingenious Man, hereafter to be further mentioned in this Treati<U+017F>e; he told me he had <U+017F>o far con<U+017F>idered them more then the re<U+017F>t of the book, that he had thought upon <U+017F>ome <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es,</hi> whereby the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction might be made out either according to the Vacui<U+017F>ts, or according to the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ians,</hi> adding, that he had al<U+017F>o examined the In<U+017F>tance our Adver<U+017F>ary pretends to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him of his Rarefaction by what happens in the <hi>Rota Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelica.</hi> Wherefore being <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by Avocations of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts, and being willing to re<U+017F>erve the Declaration of my own thoughts concerning the manner of Rarefaction and Conden<U+017F>ation for another Treati<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall refer the Reader to the ingenious Conjectures about this <U+017F>ubject, which the writer of them intends to annex to the pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and onely adde in general, That whereas the Examiners Argument on this occa<U+017F>ion is, That his way of Rarefaction mu<U+017F>t be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e neither of the other two can be well made out, his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aries may with the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on argue that one of theirs is to be allowed, <U+017F>ince his is incumbred with <U+017F>uch manife<U+017F>t difficulties. And they may enforce what they <U+017F>ay by repre<U+017F>enting, that the inconveniences that attend his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> about Rarefaction are in<U+017F>uperable, ari<U+017F>ing from the unintelligible nature of the thing it<U+017F>elf; whereas tho<U+017F>e to which the other wayes are obnoxious, may <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>pring but from mens not having yet di<U+017F>covered

                  <p>After our Authors Objections again<U+017F>t the two wayes of Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction propo<U+017F>ed, the one by the <hi>Vacui<U+017F>ts,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ians</hi> and others, that admit the <U+017F>olide<U+017F>t bodies, and even Gla<U+017F>s it<U+017F>elf, to be pervious to an Aethereal or <U+017F>ubtile matter; he attempts to explicate the <hi>manner</hi> by which that rigorous Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction he teaches is perform'd: and having premi<U+017F>ed, that the Explication of the way how each part of the rarefy'd body becomes extended, depends upon the quality of the parts into which the body is ultimately re<U+017F>olv'd; and having truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd, that they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be either really indivi<U+017F>ible, or <U+017F>till endle<U+017F>ly divi<U+017F>ible; he endeavours to explicate the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telean</hi> Rarefaction according to tho<U+017F>e two <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>es.</hi> But, though he thus propo<U+017F>e two wayes of making out his Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet be<U+017F>ides that they are irreconcilable, he <U+017F>peaks of them <U+017F>o darkly and doubtfully, that it <U+017F>eems le<U+017F>s ea<U+017F>ie to di<U+017F>cern which of the two he would be content to <U+017F>tick to, then that he him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>carce acquie<U+017F>ces in either of them.</p>
                  <p>And, fir<U+017F>t, having told us how Rarefaction may be explain'd, in ca<U+017F>e we admit bodies to be divi<U+017F>ible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> he does him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf make <U+017F>uch an Objection again<U+017F>t the infinity of parts in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum,</hi> as he is fain to give <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure an An<U+017F>wer to, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s I do not under<U+017F>tand it; and pre<U+017F>ume, that not onely the mo<U+017F>t part of unprejudiced Readers will as little acquie<U+017F>ce in the An<U+017F>wer as I do; but even the Author him<U+017F>elf will not marvel at my confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ince in the <U+017F>ame place he acknowledges the An<U+017F>wer to be <U+017F>omewhat <hi>ob<U+017F>cure,</hi> and endeavours to excu<U+017F>e its being <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e in that <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> it can <U+017F>carce be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I <U+017F>hall onely adde on this occa<U+017F>ion, that 'tis not clear to me, that even <U+017F>uch a divi<U+017F>ibility of a <hi>continuum</hi> as is here <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed would make out the Rarefaction he contends for.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57681:28"/>
infinite in number, yet <U+017F>till each part, being a corporeal <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ome Particle of <U+017F>pace commen<U+017F>urate to it; and if the whole body be rarefied, for in<U+017F>tance, to twice its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bigne<U+017F>s, then will each part be likewi<U+017F>e extended to double its former dimen<U+017F>ions, and fill both the place it took up before, and another equal to it, and <U+017F>o two places.</p>
                  <p>The <U+017F>econd Argument alledged to recommend the hitherto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned way of explicating Rarefaction is, That many learned men, among<U+017F>t whom he names two, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> have taught that the <U+017F>ame corporeal thing may naturally be, and <hi>de facto</hi> often is, in the <U+017F>ouls of Brutes really indivi<U+017F>ible and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally extended. But, though I pay tho<U+017F>e two Authors a ju<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect for their great skill in Schola<U+017F>tical and Metaphy<U+017F>ical lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet the Examiner cannot ignore, that I could make a long Catalogue of Writers, both ancient and modern, at lea<U+017F>t as well vers'd in natural Philo<U+017F>ophy as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> who have <hi><U+017F>ome</hi> of them in expre<U+017F>s words denyed this to be naturally po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and <hi>others</hi> have declared them<U+017F>elves of the <U+017F>ame judgment by e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing principles, with which this Conceit of the virtual exten<U+017F>ion of the indivi<U+017F>ible Corpu<U+017F>cles is ab<U+017F>olutely incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent. And though no Author had hitherto oppo<U+017F>ed it, yet I, that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not what <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man thought, but what 'tis rational to think, <U+017F>hould neverthele<U+017F>s not <U+017F>cruple to reject it now; and <U+017F>hould not doubt to find <U+017F>tore of the be<U+017F>t Naturali<U+017F>ts of the <U+017F>ame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me, and perhaps among them the Examiner him<U+017F>elf, who (however this acknowledgment may agree with the three following Chapters of his book) tells us, <hi>(pag.</hi> 160.) that <hi>Juxia probabiliorem <U+017F>ententiam huju<U+017F>modi virtualis exten<U+017F>io rei corporea concedenda non e<U+017F>t, ut pote <U+017F>oli rei <U+017F>pirituali propria.</hi>

                  <p>But to conclude at length this tedious Enquiry into the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totelean</hi> way of Rarefaction, (which is of <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure a nature that it can <U+017F>carce be either propo<U+017F>ed or examined in few words) I will not take upon me re<U+017F>olutely to affirm which of the two wayes of explicating it (by Atomes or by Parts infinitely divi<U+017F>ible) our Author declares him<U+017F>elf for.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57681:29"/>
the indivi<U+017F>ibility of the<U+017F>e Corpu<U+017F>cles will qualifie them to make out <U+017F>uch a Rarefaction as the Author imagines. For what does their being indivi<U+017F>ible do in this ca<U+017F>e, but make it the le<U+017F>s intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible how they can fill above a hundred parts of <U+017F>pace? 'Tis ea<U+017F>ie to fore-<U+017F>ee he will an<U+017F>wer, That they are virtually extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But not here to que<U+017F>tion how their indivi<U+017F>ibility makes them capable of being <U+017F>o; I demand, whether by an Atoms being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually extended, its corporeal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance do really (I mean ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately) fill more <U+017F>pace then it did before, or whether it do not: (for one of the two is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary.) If it do, then 'tis a true and real, and not barely a virtual exten<U+017F>ion. And that <U+017F>uch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>ion will not <U+017F>erve the turn, what we have formerly argued again<U+017F>t the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Rarefaction will evince; and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary <U+017F>eems to confe<U+017F>s as much, by devi<U+017F>ing this virtual exten<U+017F>ion to avoid the inconveniences to which he <U+017F>aw his Doctrine of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction would otherwi<U+017F>e plainly appear expos'd. But if it be <U+017F>aid, That when an Atome is virtually extended, its corporeal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance fills no more <U+017F>pace then before: This is but a Verbal <U+017F>hift, that may perhaps amu<U+017F>e an unwary Reader, but it will <U+017F>carce <U+017F>atisfie a con<U+017F>idering one. For I demand how that which is not a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance can fill place; and how this improper and but Metaphorical Exten<U+017F>ion will <U+017F>alve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as how the half Inch of Air at the top of the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Globe <U+017F>hall without a corporeal exten<U+017F>ion fill the whole Globe of two thou<U+017F>and times its bigne<U+017F>s when the water is <U+017F>uck'd out of it, and act at the lower part of the Globe. Which la<U+017F>t Clau<U+017F>e I therefore adde, becau<U+017F>e not onely our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor teaches <hi>(pag.</hi> 91. &amp; 92.) that the whole Globe was filled with a certain thin <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which by its contraction violently <U+017F>natch'd up the water into which the neck of the Gla<U+017F>s was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd; but in a parallel ca<U+017F>e he makes it his grand Argument to prove, that there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the de<U+017F>erted part of the Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, That the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Finger cannot be performed but by <U+017F>ome <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> real body. Wherefore till the Examiner do intelligibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57681:29"/>
how a virtual Exten<U+017F>ion, as it is oppo<U+017F>ed to a corporeal, can make an Atome fill twice, nay, two thou<U+017F>and times more <U+017F>pace then it did before; I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e this device of virtual Exten<U+017F>ion will appear to unbia<U+017F>s'd Naturali<U+017F>ts but a very un<U+017F>atisfactory eva<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>Two Arguments indeed there are which our Adver<U+017F>ary offers as proofs of what he teaches. The fir<U+017F>t is, That they commonly teach in the Schools, that at lea<U+017F>t <hi>divinitus</hi> (as he <U+017F>peakes) <U+017F>uch a thing as is pleaded for may be done, and that con<U+017F>equently it is not repugnant to the nature of a body. But, though they that either know me, or have read what I have written about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Theological, will, I hope, readily believe, that none is more willing to <hi>acknowledge</hi> and <hi>venerate</hi> Divine Omnipotence; yet in <U+017F>ome famous Schools they teach, that it is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. And that men who think <U+017F>o, and con<U+017F>equently look not upon it as an object of Divine Omnipotence, may (whatever he here <U+017F>ay) without <hi>impiety</hi> be of a differing mind from him about the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of <U+017F>uch a Rarefaction as he would here have, our Author may perchance think fit to grant, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ayes a few Pages after, <hi>Cum tempus <U+017F>it Ens e<U+017F><U+017F>entialiter <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sivum, it a ut ne divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

For though <hi>God</hi> can both create and annihilate, yet <hi>Nature</hi> can do neither: and in the judgment of true Philo<U+017F>ophers I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> would need no other advantage to make it be preferred before our Adver<U+017F>aries, then that in ours things are explicated by the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of Nature, whereas in the other recour<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be had to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p>But though our Authors way of explicating <hi>Rarefaction</hi> be thus improbable, yet I mu<U+017F>t not here omit to take notice, that his <hi>Funiculus</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es a <hi>Conden<U+017F>ation</hi> that to me appears incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57681:30"/>
with no le<U+017F>s manife<U+017F>t difficulties. For, <U+017F>ince he teaches that a body may be condens'd without either having any vacuities for the compre<U+017F>t parts to retire into, or having Pores filled with any <U+017F>ubtile and yielding matter that may be <U+017F>queez'd out of them; it will follow, that the parts of the body to be condens'd do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately touch each other: which <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, I demand how bodies that are already contiguous can be brought to farther Approximations without penetrating each other, at lea<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ome of their parts.

For that 'tis annihilated I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he is too rational a man to pretend, (nor, if he <U+017F>hould, would it be at all believ'd) and to <U+017F>ay, that a thou<U+017F>and and <U+017F>o many hundred parts of Matter <U+017F>hould be retir'd into that one part of <U+017F>pace that contains the one half Inch of Air, is little le<U+017F>s incredible: For that <U+017F>pace was <U+017F>uppos'd perfectly full of body before, and how a thing can be more then perfectly full, who can conceive? To di<U+017F>patch: According to our Authors way of Conden<U+017F>ation, two, or perhaps two thou<U+017F>and, bodles may be crouded into a <U+017F>pace that is adequately fill'd by one of them apart. And if this be not Penetration of Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, I de<U+017F>ire to be informed what is <U+017F>o; and till then I <U+017F>hall leave it to any unprepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd Naturali<U+017F>t to judge, whether an <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> that needs <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a thing <U+017F>o generally concluded to be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to Nature, be <hi>probable</hi> or not; and whether to tell us that the very <U+017F>ame parcel of Air, that is now without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence contain'd in half an Inch of <U+017F>pace, <U+017F>hall by and by fill two thou<U+017F>and times as much room, and pre<U+017F>ently after <U+017F>hrink again into the two thou<U+017F>andth part of the <U+017F>pace it hewly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd, be not to turn a Body into a Spirit, and, confounding their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, attribute to the former the di<U+017F>criminating and lea<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily conceivable properties of the later.

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Con<U+017F>ideration (pertinent to the pre<U+017F>ent Controver<U+017F>ie) of what happens in trying the <hi>Torricellian</hi> and other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the tops and feet of Hills.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere remain then yet a couple of Con<U+017F>iderations to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd again<U+017F>t the Examiners <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> which, though the pa<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e may make them be look'd upon as needle<U+017F>s, we mu<U+017F>t not pretermit, becau<U+017F>e they contain <U+017F>uch Arguments as may not onely be imployed again<U+017F>t our Adver<U+017F>aries Doctrine, but will very much tend to the confirmation of ours.</p>
                  <p>I con<U+017F>ider then further, that the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> I am oppo<U+017F>ing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a kind of Inver<U+017F>ion of ours, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>pring or motion of Re<U+017F>titution in the Air to tend inwards, as according to us it tends outwards; it cannot be, that if the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition it <U+017F>elf were (what I think I have prov'd it is not) true, many of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> would be plau<U+017F>ibly enough explicable by it: the <U+017F>ame motions in an intermediate body being in many ca<U+017F>es producible alike, whether we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it to be thru<U+017F>t or drawn; provided both the endeavours tend the <U+017F>ame way. But then we may be <U+017F>atisfied whether the effect be to be a<U+017F>cribed to Pul<U+017F>ion or to Traction, (as they commonly <U+017F>peak, though indeed the later <U+017F>eems reducible to the former) if we can find out an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein there is rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>uch an effect <U+017F>hould follow, in ca<U+017F>e Pul<U+017F>ion be the cau<U+017F>e inquired after, and not in ca<U+017F>e it be Tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And <U+017F>uch an <hi>Experimentum Crucis</hi> (to <U+017F>peak with our <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trious Verulam)</hi> is afforded us by that noble Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur Pa<U+017F>chall,</hi> mentioned by the famous <hi>Pecquet,</hi> and out of him by our Author: namely, that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> Experiment being made at the foot and in divers places of a very high Mountain, (of the altitude of five hundred fathom or three thou<U+017F>and foot) he found, that after he had a<U+017F>cended a hundred
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57681:31"/>
and fifty Fathom, the Quick<U+017F>ilver was fallen two Inches and a quarter below its <U+017F>tation at the Mountains foot; and that at the very top of the Hill it had de<U+017F>cended above three Inches below the <U+017F>ame wonted <U+017F>tation. Whence it appears that the Quick<U+017F>ilver being carried up towards the top of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere,</hi> falls down the lower, the higher the place is wherin the ob<U+017F>ervation is made: of which the rea<U+017F>on is plain in our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> namely, that the nearer we come to the top of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere,</hi> the <U+017F>horter and lighter is the Cylinder of Air incumbent upon the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury;</hi> and con<U+017F>equently the le<U+017F>s weight of Cylindrical <hi>Mercury</hi> will that Air be able to counter-poi<U+017F>e and keep <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And <U+017F>ince this notable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> does thus clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon ours, and not upon our Adver<U+017F>aries <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is;</hi> this Experiment <U+017F>eems to determine the Controver<U+017F>ie betwixt them: becau<U+017F>e in this ca<U+017F>e the Examiner cannot pretend, as he does in the <U+017F>eventeenth and divers other of our Experiments, that the De<U+017F>cent of the Quick<U+017F>ilver in the Tube is caus'd, not by the Diminution of the external Airs pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure, but from the preternatural Rarefaction or Di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion of that external Air (in the Receiver) when by <U+017F>eeking to re<U+017F>tore it <U+017F>elf, it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to draw up the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury:</hi> For in our pre<U+017F>ent ca<U+017F>e there appears no <U+017F>uch forcible Dilatation of that Air, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Engine he is pleas'd to imagine.</p>
                  <p>It need therefore be no great wonder, if his Adver<U+017F>aries do, as he ob<U+017F>erves, make a great account of this Experiment, to prove that the <hi>Mercury</hi> is kept up in the Tube by the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the external Aire. Nor do I think his An<U+017F>wers to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from hence will keep them from thinking it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For to an Objection upon which he takes notice that they lay <U+017F>o much <U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he replyes but two things; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>ingly nor together will near amount to a <U+017F>atisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> he que<U+017F>tions the truth of the Ob<U+017F>ervation it <U+017F>elf; becau<U+017F>e having made tryal in a low Hill, the event did no wayes an<U+017F>wer his Expectation. But though, in <U+017F>tead of di<U+017F>approving,

I am willing to commend his Curio<U+017F>ity, to make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him<U+017F>elf, and e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince 'twas both new and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and though al<U+017F>o I like his Mode<U+017F>ty, in rather <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>take in the manner of the Ob<U+017F>ervation, then that the Experimenters did not <U+017F>incerely deliver it: yet, <U+017F>ince there mu<U+017F>t be an Error <U+017F>omewhere, I mu<U+017F>t rather charge it upon the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners ob<U+017F>ervation (I <U+017F>ay his Ob<U+017F>ervation, not his want of <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity) then upon <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Pa<U+017F>chals.</hi> For be<U+017F>ides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations that the <hi>learned Ga<U+017F><U+017F>endus,</hi> who relates the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives to that ingenious Gentleman <hi>(Mon<U+017F>ieur Pa<U+017F>chal)</hi> by who<U+017F>e direction he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es it to have been try'd: the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ga<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>endus</hi> relates, that the like Ob<U+017F>ervation was five times repeated, <hi>partim intra <U+017F>acellum, partim aëre libero, &amp;</hi>

To all this I <U+017F>hall adde two things that will very much confirm our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is.

Tube, before the mouth of it was open'd under the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell'd <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> and taking notice how low <U+017F>uch a quantity of that Air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, they likewi<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erv'd, that at the Mountains foot the included Air was not able to depre<U+017F>s the Quick<U+017F>ilver <U+017F>o much. Whence we inferre, that the Cylinder of Air at the top of the Hill being <U+017F>horter and lighter, did not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly pre<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t the included Air, as did the ambient Air at the bottom of the Hill, where the <hi>Aereal</hi> Cylinder was longer and heavier.</p>
                  <p>But becau<U+017F>e that though Experiments made in very elevated places are noble ones, and of great importance in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ies about the Air, yet there are but very few of tho<U+017F>e that are qualified to make Experiments of that Nature, who have the opportunity of making them upon high Mountains; we did with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of an ingenious man attempt a Tryal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we hoped to find a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly-differing Weight of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pere,</hi> in a far le<U+017F>s height then that of an ordinary Hill. But in <U+017F>tead of a common Tube we made u<U+017F>e of a kind of Weather-gla<U+017F>s, that the included Air might help to make the event notable, for a rea<U+017F>on to be mentioned ere long; and in <U+017F>tead of Quick<U+017F>ilver we employ'd common Water in the Pipe belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Weather-gla<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>mall changes in the Weight or re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere</hi> in oppo<U+017F>it on of the included Air might be the more di<U+017F>cernable. The In<U+017F>trument we made u<U+017F>e of con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted only of a Gla<U+017F>s with a broad Foot and a narrow Neck (A B) and a <U+017F>lender Gla<U+017F>s-Pipe (C D) open at both ends: which Pipe was <U+017F>o placed, that the bottom of it did almo<U+017F>t, but not quite, reach to the bottom of the bigger Gla<U+017F>s (A B) within who<U+017F>e Neck (A) it was fa<U+017F>tned with a clo<U+017F>e cement, that both kept the Pipe in its place, and hindred all communication betwixt the inward (I I) and outward (K K) Air, <U+017F>ave by the cavity of the Pipe (C D). Now we cho<U+017F>e this Gla<U+017F>s (A B) more then ordinarily capacious, that the effect of the dilatation of the included Air (I I) might be the more con<U+017F>picuous. Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a convenient quantity of Water (H H) into this Gla<U+017F>s,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57681:34"/>
we carried it to the Leads of the lofty Abby-Church at <hi>We<U+017F>tmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter,</hi> and there blew in a little Air to rai<U+017F>e the Water to the upper part of the Pipe, that being above the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el (A B) we might more preci<U+017F>ely mark the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>tations of the Water then otherwi<U+017F>e we could. Afterward having <U+017F>uffered the Gla<U+017F>s to re<U+017F>t a pretty while upon the Lead, that the Air (I I) within might be reduc'd to the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate, both as to coldne<U+017F>s and as to pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure, with (K K) that without, having marked the <U+017F>tation of the Water (F), we gently let down the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el by a long <U+017F>tring to the foot of the Wall, where one attended to receive it; who having <U+017F>uffer'd it to re<U+017F>t upon the ground, cry'd to us that it was <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ided about an Inch below the mark (F) we had put: whereupon having order'd him to put a mark at this <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it (E), we drew up the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el again; and <U+017F>uffering it to re<U+017F>t a while, we ob<U+017F>erv'd the Water to be re-a<U+017F>cended to or near the fir<U+017F>t mark (F), which was indeed about an Inch above (E) the other. And this we did that Evening a <U+017F>econd time with almo<U+017F>t a like <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s: though two or three dayes after, the wind blowing <U+017F>trongly upon the Leads, we found not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to <U+017F>ucceed quite <U+017F>o regularly as before; yet the Water alwayes manife<U+017F>tly fell lower at the foot of the Wall then it was at the top: which I <U+017F>ee no cau<U+017F>e to a<U+017F>cribe barely to the differing temperature of the Air above and below, as to Heat and Cold, <U+017F>ince according to the general e<U+017F>timate, the more elevated Region of the Air is, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> colder then that below, which would rather check the greater expan<U+017F>ion of the included Air at the top of the Leads then promote it. But the better to avoid mi<U+017F>takes and prevent Objections, we thought fit to try the Experiment within the Church, and got into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the <U+017F>ame height with the Leads: but the upper part of the Pipe being ca<U+017F>ually broken off, we thought fit to order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>o, that the <U+017F>urface (G) of the remaining Water in the Pipe <U+017F>hould be about an Inch higher then the <U+017F>urface of the Water in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. And then my above-mentioned Corre<U+017F>pondent letting down the Gla<U+017F>s, almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as it was <U+017F>etled upon the

pavement, kneeling down to <U+017F>ee how far it was <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ided, I found that not only it was fallen as low as the other Water, but that the outward Air depre<U+017F>t it <U+017F>o far, as while<U+017F>t I was looking on, to break in beneath the bottom of the Pipe, and a<U+017F>cend through the Water in bubbles: after which the Gla<U+017F>s being drawn up again, my Corre<U+017F>pondent affirm'd, that the Water was very manife<U+017F>tly re-a<U+017F>cended. But becau<U+017F>e by the unlucky breaking of a Gla<U+017F>s, we were hindred to ob<U+017F>erve, as we de<U+017F>igned, what would happen as well in a Weather-gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o contriv'd that the weight or pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere</hi> <U+017F>hould make no change in it, as in another who<U+017F>e included Air was at the top, (whereas in that we imploy'd the included Air was in the lower part,) and becau<U+017F>e there happened in our Tryals a Circum<U+017F>tance or two that <U+017F>eem'd not <U+017F>o devoid of difficulties, but that we think it may require further examination, we de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>et down a more particular account of this Experiment, (as how it <U+017F>ucceeds with Quick<U+017F>ilver in<U+017F>tead of Water, together with the capacity of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el (A B) and the bore of the Pipe (C D) with <U+017F>ome other variety of Circum<U+017F>tances) together with the event of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>ity we had (which <U+017F>eemed very <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful) to try the <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiment upon the above-mentioned Leads, and then let down the Tube together with the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> to the ground, to ob<U+017F>erve the increa<U+017F>ing altitude of the Quick<U+017F>ilver, in the formerly-mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Epi<U+017F>tle we have been defending. And it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice us in the mean time that the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als already mentioned <U+017F>eem to make it evident enough that the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere</hi> gravitates more, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> neer the <U+017F>urface of the Earth, then in the more elevated parts of the Air. For the Leads on which we made our Tryals were found by mea<U+017F>ure to be in perpendicular height but three<U+017F>core and fifteen Foot from the ground. To which we <U+017F>hall only add this at pre<U+017F>ent, that once being de<U+017F>irous to ob<U+017F>erve what we could touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idence of the Water to the height of its <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <U+017F>tations from the ground, purpo<U+017F>ely carrying down the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>o as not con<U+017F>iderably to heat it, from the Leads down

                  <p>The other Particular I <U+017F>hall mention for confirmation of our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> is that Experiment (which, though it be needle<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eems yet more cogent and proper to prevent Eva<U+017F>ions) made by the <U+017F>ame <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Pa<U+017F>chal,</hi> of carrying a weakly-blown Foot-ball from the bottom to the top of an high Mountain. For that Foot-ball <U+017F>well'd more and more, the higher it was carried, <U+017F>o that it appeared as if it were full blown at the top of the Mountain, and gradually growing lank again, as it was carried; downwards; <U+017F>o that at the foot of the Hill it was flaccid as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This, I <U+017F>ay, having thus happened, we have here an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to prove our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> wherein recour<U+017F>e cannot be had to any forcibly and preternaturally di<U+017F>tended Body, <U+017F>uch as that is pretended to be which remaines in the de<U+017F>erted <U+017F>pace of the Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment.</p>
                  <p>The other thing which the Examiner alledges again<U+017F>t our Argument from <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Pa<U+017F>chals</hi> Tryals, is, that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it to be true, yet it cannot thence be inferr'd, that the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idence of the <hi>Mercury</hi> at the top of the Hill proceeded from the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>pherical</hi> Cylinder's being there lighter and le<U+017F>s able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Quick<U+017F>ilver. <hi>Sed dici pote<U+017F>t</hi> (<U+017F>ayes he) <hi>ideo <U+017F>ic in vertice Montis magis de<U+017F>cendi<U+017F><U+017F>e, quod ibidem e<U+017F><U+017F>et</hi>

Tube, and <U+017F>o draw up the <hi>Mercury</hi> higher, as our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf teaches us, that 'tis from the <U+017F>hrinking of the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus</hi> occa<U+017F>ion'd by the cold that the Water in <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 50.</note> a<U+017F>cends in cold weather. And whereas the only proof he adds of <U+017F>o improbable an Explication is taken from our eighteenth Experiment, wherein we relate, that <U+017F>ometimes the Quick<U+017F>ilver did <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly fall lower in colder then in far le<U+017F>s cold weather: I an<U+017F>wer, that this eighteenth Experiment will <U+017F>carce make more for him then again<U+017F>t him: For, as I there take notice that the Quick<U+017F>ilver de<U+017F>cended in cold weather, <U+017F>o it <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times de<U+017F>cended likewi<U+017F>e in hot weather, and ro<U+017F>e in cold. And 'tis very <U+017F>trange, that in all the Ob<U+017F>ervations made, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Countries and at differing times, it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till <U+017F>o happen that the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>horter near the top of the <hi>Atmo<U+017F>phere</hi> then further from it; if the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the outward Air have nothing to do with the keeping it <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended. And 'tis yet more <U+017F>trange, that the Foot-ball <U+017F>hould in like manner grow turgid and flaccid, according as it is carried into places where it has a <U+017F>horter or longer Pillar of Air incumbent on it.</p>
                  <p>I was going to proceed to what remains of this Second Part of our Treati<U+017F>e, but that <U+017F>ince I begun this Chapter ca<U+017F>ually meeting with an Experiment lately <U+017F>ent in a Letter to a very Ingenious <note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Croon</hi> one of the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of <hi>Gre<U+017F>ham</hi> Colledge.</note> Acquaintance of his and mine by a very Indu<U+017F>trious Phy<U+017F>ician <note n="*" place="margin">

And the rather, that as the Mountains have by the Trials made on them of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, afforded us a noble proof of the weight of the Air; <U+017F>o they may afford us one of its Spring: wherein I hope the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Waters de<U+017F>cent will not be a<U+017F>cribed

We took then a long Gla<U+017F>s-Tube, which by a dexterous hand and the help of Lamp was in <U+017F>uch a manner crooked at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that the part turned up was almo<U+017F>t parallel to the re<U+017F>t of the Tube, and the Orifice of this <U+017F>horter leg of the Siphon (if I may <U+017F>o call the whole In<U+017F>trument) being Hermetically <U+017F>eal'd, the length of it was divided into Inches, (each of which was <U+017F>ubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into eight parts) by a <U+017F>traight li<U+017F>t of paper, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho<U+017F>e Divi<U+017F>ions was carefully pa<U+017F>ted all along it: then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in as much Quick<U+017F>ilver as <U+017F>erved to fill the Arch or bended part of the Siphon, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> <U+017F>tanding in a level might reach in the one leg to the bottom of the divided paper, and ju<U+017F>t to the <U+017F>ame height or Horizontal line in the other; we took care, by frequently inclining the Tube, <U+017F>o that the Air might freely pa<U+017F>sfrom one leg into the other by the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> (we took (I <U+017F>ay) care) that the Air at la<U+017F>t included in the <U+017F>hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Cylinder <U+017F>hould be of the <U+017F>ame laxity with the re<U+017F>t of the Air about it. This done, we began to pour Quick<U+017F>ilver into the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leg of the Siphon, which by its weight pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing up that in the <U+017F>horter leg, did by degrees <U+017F>treighten the included Air: and continuing this pouring in of Quick<U+017F>ilver till the Air in the <U+017F>hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leg was by conden<U+017F>ation reduced to take up but half the <U+017F>pace it po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd (I <U+017F>ay, <hi>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd,</hi> not <hi>fill'd)</hi> before; we ca<U+017F>t our eyes upon the longer leg of the Gla<U+017F>s, on which was likewi<U+017F>e pa<U+017F>ted a li<U+017F>t of Paper carefully divided into Inches and parts, and we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, not without delight and <U+017F>atisfaction, that the Quick<U+017F>ilver in that longer part of the Tube was 29.

Now that this Ob<U+017F>ervation does both very well agree with and confirm our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> will be ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cerned by him that takes notice that we teach, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Pa<U+017F>chall</hi> and our <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> friends Experiments prove, that the greater the weight is that leans upon the Air, the more forcible is its endeavour of Dilatation, and con<U+017F>equently its power of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, (as other Springs are <U+017F>tronger when bent by greater weights.) For this being con<U+017F>idered, it wil appear to agree rarely-well with the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe<U+017F>is,</hi> that as according to it the Air in that degree of den<U+017F>ity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57681:37"/>
and corre<U+017F>pondent mea<U+017F>ure of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to which the weight of the incumbent Atmo<U+017F>phere had brought it, was able to counter-balance and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of a Mercurial Cylinder of about 29. Inches, as we are taught by the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment; <U+017F>o here the <U+017F>ame Air being brought to a degree of den<U+017F>ity about twice as great as that it had before, obtains a Spring twice as <U+017F>trong as formerly. As may appear by its being able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain or re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a Cylinder of 29. Inches in the longer Tube, together with the weight of the Atmo<U+017F>pherical Cylinder, that lean'd upon tho<U+017F>e 29. Inches of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and, as we ju<U+017F>t now inferr'd from the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, was equivalent to them.</p>
                  <p>We were hindered from pro<U+017F>ecuting the tryal at that time by the ca<U+017F>ual breaking of the Tube. But becau<U+017F>e an accurate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this nature would be of great importance to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Spring of the Air, and has not yet been made (that I know) by any man; and becau<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o it is more unea<U+017F>ie to be made then one would think, in regard of the difficulty as well of procuring crooked Tubes fit for the purpo<U+017F>e, as of making a ju<U+017F>t e<U+017F>timate of the true place of the Protuberant <hi>Mercury</hi>'s <U+017F>urface; I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it will not be unwelcome to the Reader, to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that after <U+017F>ome other tryals, one of which we made in a Tube who<U+017F>e longer leg was perpendicular, and the other, that contained the Air, parallel to the Horizon, we at la<U+017F>t procured a Tube of the Figure expre<U+017F>t in the Scheme; which Tube, though of a pretty bigne<U+017F>s, was <U+017F>o long, that the <note place="margin">See the 5.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their quarters, and the longer leg admitted another li<U+017F>t of Paper of divers foot in length, and divided after the <U+017F>ame manner: then Quick<U+017F>ilver being poured in to fill up the bended part of the Gla<U+017F>s, that the <U+017F>urface of it in either leg might re<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame Horizontal line, as we lately taught, there was more and more Quick<U+017F>ilver poured into the longer Tube; and notice being watchfully taken how far the <hi>Mercury</hi> was ri<U+017F>en in that longer Tube, when it appeared to have a<U+017F>cended to any of the

                  <p>For the better under<U+017F>tanding of this Experiment it may not be ami<U+017F>s to take notice of the following particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Tube being <U+017F>o tall that we could not convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make u<U+017F>e of it in a Chamber, we were fain to u<U+017F>e it on a pair of Stairs, which yet were very light<U+017F>om, the Tube being for pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57681:38"/>
<U+017F>ake by <U+017F>trings <U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended, that it did <U+017F>carce touch the Box pre<U+017F>ently to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The lower and crooked part of the Pipe was placed in a <U+017F>quare wooden Box, of a good largne<U+017F>s and depth, to prevent the lo<U+017F>s of the Quick<U+017F>ilver that might fall a<U+017F>ide in the transfu<U+017F>ion from the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el into the Pipe, and to receive the whole Quick<U+017F>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ca<U+017F>e the Tube <U+017F>hould break.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we were two to make the ob<U+017F>ervation together, the one to take notice at the bottom how the Quick<U+017F>ilver ro<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>horter Cylinder, and the other to pour in at the top of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it being very hard and trouble<U+017F>ome for one man alone to do both accurately.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Quick<U+017F>ilver was poured in but by little and little, according to the direction of him that ob<U+017F>erved below, it being far ea<U+017F>ier to pour in more, then to take out any in ca<U+017F>e too much at once had been poured in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That at the beginning of the Operation, that we might the more truly di<U+017F>cern where the Quick<U+017F>ilver re<U+017F>ted from time to time, we made u<U+017F>e of a <U+017F>mall Looking-gla<U+017F>s, held in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent po<U+017F>ture to reflect to the eye what we de<U+017F>ired to di<U+017F>cern.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That when the Air was <U+017F>o compre<U+017F>s'd, as to be crouded into le<U+017F>s then a quarter of the <U+017F>pace it po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd before, we tryed whether the cold of a Linen Cloth dipp'd in water would then conden<U+017F>e it. And it <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>eemed a little to <U+017F>hrink, but not <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>tly as that we dare build any thing upon it. We then tryed likewi<U+017F>e whether heat would notwith<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>o forcible a compre<U+017F><U+017F>ure dilate it, and approching the flame of a Candle to that part where the Air was pent up, the heat had a more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible operation then the cold had before; <U+017F>o that we <U+017F>carce doubted but that the expan<U+017F>ion of the Air would notwith<U+017F>tanding the weight that oppre<U+017F>t it have been made con<U+017F>picuous, if the fear of un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably breaking the Gla<U+017F>s had not kept us from increa<U+017F>ing the heat.</p>

                     <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> might perchance invite the Reader to expect; yet the Variations are not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, but that they may probably enough be a<U+017F>cribed to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch want of exactne<U+017F>s as in <U+017F>uch nice Experiments is <U+017F>carce avoidable. But for all that, till further tryal hath more clearly informed me, I <U+017F>hall not venture to determine whether or no the intimated Theory will hold univer<U+017F>ally and preci<U+017F>ely, either in Conden<U+017F>ation of Air, or Rarefaction: all that I <U+017F>hall now urge being, That however, the tryal already made <U+017F>ufficiently proves the main thing for which I here alledge it; <U+017F>ince by it 'tis evident, that as common Air when reduc'd to half its wonted extent, obtained near about twice as forcible a Spring as it had before; <U+017F>o this thus-compre<U+017F>t Air being further thru<U+017F>t into half this narrow room, obtained thereby a Spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as <U+017F>trong again as that it la<U+017F>t had, and con<U+017F>equently four times as <U+017F>trong as that of the common Air. And there is no cau<U+017F>e to doubt, that if we had been here furni<U+017F>ht with a greater quantity of Quick<U+017F>ilver and a very <U+017F>trong Tube, we might by a further compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the included Air have made it counter-balance the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of a far taller and heavier Cylinder of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi> For no man perhaps yet knows how near to an infinite compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion the Air may be capable of, if the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing force be competently increa<U+017F>t. So that here our Adver<U+017F>ary may plainly <U+017F>ee that the Spring of the Air, which he makes <U+017F>o light of, may not onely be able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the weight of 29. Inches, but in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es of above an hundred Inches of Quick<U+017F>ilver, and that without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his <hi>Funiculus,</hi> which in our pre<U+017F>ent ca<U+017F>e has nothing to do. And to let you <U+017F>ee that we did not (a little above) incon<U+017F>iderately mention the weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Atmo<U+017F>pherical Cylinder as a part of the weight re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the impri<U+017F>oned Air, we will here annex, that we took care, when the Mercurial Cylinder in the longer leg of the Pipe was about an hundred Inches high, to cau<U+017F>e one to <U+017F>uck at the open Orifice; whereupon (as we expected) the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube did notably a<U+017F>cend. Which con<U+017F>iderable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> cannot be a<U+017F>cribed to our Examiners <hi>Funiculus,</hi> <U+017F>ince by his own confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57681:39"/>
that cannot pull up the <hi>Mercury,</hi> if the Mercurial Cylinder be above 29. or 30. Inches of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And therefore we <U+017F>hall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this rea<U+017F>on of it, That the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the incumbent Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in part taken off by its expanding it <U+017F>elf into the Suckers dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted che<U+017F>t; the impri<U+017F>on'd Air was thereby enabled to dilate it <U+017F>elf manife<U+017F>tly, and repel the <hi>Mercury</hi> that compre<U+017F>t it, till there was an equality of force betwixt the <U+017F>trong Spring of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>t Air on the one part, and the tall Mercurial Cylinder, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the contiguous dilated Air, on the other part.</p>
                  <p>Now, if to what we have thus delivered concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Air we adde <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>ervations concerning its <U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Expan<U+017F>ion, it will the better appear how much the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of the<U+017F>e Mercurial Experiments depend upon the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mea<U+017F>ures of <U+017F>trength to be met with in the Airs Spring, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its various degrees of Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and Laxity. But, before I enter upon this <U+017F>ubject, I <U+017F>hall readily acknowledge that I had not reduc'd the tryals I had made about mea<U+017F>uring the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<U+017F>ion of the Air to any certain <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> when that ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Richard Townely</hi> was plea<U+017F>ed to inform me, that having by the peru<U+017F>al of my <hi>Phy<U+017F>ico-Mechanical</hi> Experiments been <U+017F>atisfied that the Spring of the Air was the cau<U+017F>e of it, he had endeavoured (and I wi<U+017F>h in <U+017F>uch attempts other ingenious men would follow his example) to <U+017F>upply what I had omitted concerning the reducing to a preci<U+017F>e e<U+017F>timate how much Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of it <U+017F>elf lo<U+017F>es of its Ela<U+017F>tical force, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures of its Dilatation. He added, that he had begun to <U+017F>et down what occurred to him to this purpo<U+017F>e in a <U+017F>hort Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, whereof he afterwards did me the favour to <U+017F>hew me the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which gives me a ju<U+017F>t Curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee it perfected.

To make the Experiment of the debilitated force of expanded Air the plainer, 'twill not be ami<U+017F>s to note <U+017F>ome particulars, e<U+017F>pecially touching the manner of making the Tryal; which (for the rea<U+017F>ons lately mention'd) we made on a light<U+017F>ome pair of <U+017F>tairs, and with a Box al<U+017F>o lin'd with Paper to receive the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> that might be <U+017F>pilt. And in regard it would require a va<U+017F>t and in few places procurable quantity of Quick<U+017F>ilver, to employ ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of <U+017F>uch kind as are ordinary in the <hi>Torriccllian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we made u<U+017F>e of a Gla<U+017F>s-Tube of about <U+017F>ix foot long, for that being Hermetically <U+017F>ealed at one end, <U+017F>erv'd our turn as well as if we could have made the Experiment in a <hi>Tub</hi> or <hi>Pond</hi> of <U+017F>eventy Inches deep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We al<U+017F>o provided a <U+017F>lender Gla<U+017F>s-Pipe of about the bigne<U+017F>s of a Swans Quill, and open at both ends: all along which was pa<U+017F>ted a narrow li<U+017F>t of Paper divided into Inches and half quarters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This <U+017F>lender Pipe being thru<U+017F>t down into the greater Tube almo<U+017F>t fill'd with Quick<U+017F>ilver, the Gla<U+017F>s helpt to make it <U+017F>well to the top of the Tube, and the Quick<U+017F>ilver getting in at the lower orifice of the Pipe, fill'd it up till the <hi>Mercury</hi> included in that was near about a level with the <U+017F>urface of the <U+017F>urrounding <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There being, as near as we could gue<U+017F>s, little more then an Inch of the <U+017F>lender Pipe left above the <U+017F>urface of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and con<U+017F>equently unfill'd therewith, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent orifice was carefully clos'd with <U+017F>ealing Wax melted; after which the Pipe was let alone for a while, that the Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a little by the heat of the Wax, might upon refrigeration be reduc'd to its wonted den<U+017F>ity. And then we ob<U+017F>erv'd by the help of the above-mentioned li<U+017F>t of Paper, whether we had not included <U+017F>omewhat more or <U+017F>omewhat le<U+017F>s then an Inch of Air, and in either ca<U+017F>e we were fain to rectifie the error by a <U+017F>mall hole made (with an heated Pin) in the Wax, and afterwards clos'd up again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Having thus included a ju<U+017F>t Inch of Air, we li<U+017F>ted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57681:41"/>
up the <U+017F>lender Pipe by degrees, till the Air was dilated to an Inch, an Inch and an half, two Inches, &amp;c. and ob<U+017F>erved in Inches and Eighths, the length of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, which at each degree of the Airs expan<U+017F>ion was impell'd above the <U+017F>urface of the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Ob<U+017F>ervations being ended, we pre<U+017F>ently made the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment with the above-mention'd great Tube of <U+017F>ix foot long, that we might know the height of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, for that particular day and hour; which height we found to be 29 ¾ Inches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Our Ob<U+017F>ervations made after this manner furni<U+017F>h'd us with the preceding Table, in which there would not probably have been found the difference here <U+017F>et down betwixt the force of the Air when expanded to double its former dimen<U+017F>ions, and what that force <U+017F>hould have been preci<U+017F>ely according to the Theory, but that the included Inch of Air receiv'd <U+017F>ome little acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion during the Tryal; which this newly-mention'd diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence making us <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, we found by replunging the Pipe into the Quick<U+017F>ilver, that the included Air had gain'd about half an eighth, which we gue<U+017F>t to have come from <U+017F>ome little aerial bubbles in the Quick<U+017F>ilver, contain'd in the Pipe (<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie is it in <U+017F>uch nice Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to mi<U+017F>s of exactne<U+017F>s.)

                  <p>But, I do confe<U+017F>s, I do for all this think our Explication more true, then well con<U+017F>idered by our Author. For the putting of water into the Vial that was broken, was done (as is clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the beginning of our Narrative) upon a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign (as indeed we tryed divers other things with our Engine, not <U+017F>o much with immediate reference to the Spring of the Air, as to make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch Tryals in <U+017F>ome other of our Writings.) And accordingly in the <U+017F>econd Tryal mentioned in the <U+017F>ame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment the water was omitted. But, notwith<U+017F>tanding this water, the <U+017F>ides of the Gla<U+017F>s being expo<U+017F>ed to the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Atmo<U+017F>phere, had that whole pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t them before the exhau<U+017F>tion of the Receiver; <U+017F>o that there needed no <U+017F>uch blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Air afre<U+017F>h as our Author imagines, to effect the breaking of the Vial, it being <U+017F>ufficient for that purpo<U+017F>e, that the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t the convex <hi><U+017F>uperficies</hi> of it was taken off by the exhau<U+017F>tion of the Receiver, the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t the concave <hi><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> remaining as great as ever. And therefore we need not altogether deny what the Examiner <U+017F>ayes, that <hi>Licet clau<U+017F>us <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perne fui<U+017F><U+017F>et tubulus ille, codem tamen modo fracta <U+017F>ine dubio, fui<U+017F><U+017F>et

phiala.</hi> For, <U+017F>ince in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es the Air (as we have often taught) is <U+017F>hut up with the whole pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Atmo<U+017F>phere upon it, it may almo<U+017F>t as ea<U+017F>ily break the Gla<U+017F>s as if it were un<U+017F>topt. And accordingly we mention in the 36. Experiment the breaking of a thin Gla<U+017F>s Hermetically <U+017F>eal'd upon the rece<U+017F>s of the ambient Air. But, how confidently <U+017F>oever our Author <U+017F>peaks, I thought fit to adde the word <hi>almo<U+017F>t,</hi> becau<U+017F>e we ob<U+017F>erved in the 39. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that <U+017F>uch thin Vials (and thick ones will not break) are <U+017F>ubject upon the withdrawing of the ambient Air to retch a little, whereby the Spring of the Air within the Vial might in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es (I <U+017F>ay, in <U+017F>ome) be <U+017F>o far weakned as not to be able to break it, unle<U+017F>s a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Atmo<U+017F>phere wherewith it communicates, and which leans upon it. And when the Vial does actually begin to break, then the pur<U+017F>uing pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the outward Air upon the yielding Air within the Vial may help to throw the parts of the Gla<U+017F>s more forcibly a<U+017F>under.</p>

It will not be <U+017F>aid that 'tis by its weight; for as much <hi>Mercury</hi> as may be thus impell'd up above the u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>tation will weigh a great many times more then the Air forc'd into the Receiver. And therefore it remains that the additional Air counterpoi<U+017F>es the additional <hi>Mercury</hi> by its Spring.

                  <p>Our Examiner in his Animadver<U+017F>ion upon the 18. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having recited my Conjecture at the cau<U+017F>e why a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> did in Winter ri<U+017F>e and fall in the Tube, <U+017F>ometimes as Water is wont to do in a Weather-gla<U+017F>s, according to the laws of heat and cold, and <U+017F>ometimes quite contrary thereunto; adds, that this Experiment does <U+017F>trongly enough overthrow our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is</hi> of the Atmo<U+017F>pherical Cylinder, and clearly <U+017F>hew that the

Quick<U+017F>ilver is not <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained by it: <hi>Nam</hi> (<U+017F>ayes he) <hi><U+017F>i hic ab eo <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tentatum fui<U+017F><U+017F>et, debui<U+017F><U+017F>et potius frigidiore tempore a<U+017F>cendere quam de<U+017F>cendere, eo quod aër tunc multo den<U+017F>ior e<U+017F><U+017F>et &amp; gravior. Ita<expan>

But in his Animadver<U+017F>ions upon this Experiment he <U+017F>eems to have been too forward to reprehend; for he neither well confutes my Conjecture, nor <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titutes <U+017F>o much as a plau<U+017F>ible one in the <U+017F>tead of it. And as to his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I an<U+017F>wer,</p>
                  <p>Fir<U+017F>t, That it doth not conclude: becau<U+017F>e that as <U+017F>ometimes the Quick<U+017F>ilver in the Tube did ri<U+017F>e in warmer, and fall in colder, weather; <U+017F>o at other times it did rather emulate the a<U+017F>cent and de<U+017F>cent of water in a Weather-gla<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though it be true, that Cold is wont to conden<U+017F>e this or that parcel of Air, and that a parcel of Air may be made heavier by Conden<U+017F>ation; yet that is in regard of the ambient Air that retains its wonted laxity, in which the conden<U+017F>ed Air is weighed. But our Author has not yet proved, that in ca<U+017F>e the cold of the Winter <U+017F>hould conden<U+017F>e the whole incumbent Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>phere, it would then gravitate <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly more upon the re<U+017F>tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Quick<U+017F>ilver then before. As a Pound of Wooll will not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly vary its weight, though the hairs whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed be made to lye <U+017F>ometimes in a loo<U+017F>er, <U+017F>ometimes in a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er, order.</p>
                  <p>And, thirdly, this Objection does as little agree with his Doctrine as with my Conjecture: For in the 50. page, where he gives us an account according to his principles of the ri<U+017F>ing and falling of water in a Weather-gla<U+017F>s, and compares it with the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ion of Quick<U+017F>ilver, he tells us, <hi>Hinc fit quod, contracto hoc funiculo per frigus, aqua illa tempore frigido a<U+017F>cendat, de<U+017F>cendat au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tempore calido, eo quod per calorem funiculus ille dilatetur.</hi> So that, according to the Examiner him<U+017F>elf, the Quick<U+017F>ilver ought to have a<U+017F>cended in colder, and de<U+017F>cended in warmer, weather. Now, although I propo<U+017F>ed my thoughts of the difficult <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57681:48"/>
under con<U+017F>ideration but as a Conjecture, and therefore <U+017F>hall be ready to alter them, either upon further di<U+017F>covery, or better information; yet I <U+017F>ee not why it <U+017F>hould be po<U+017F>t-po<U+017F>ed to the Examiner's, who, though he rejects our Explication, <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes no other then what may be gathered from the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Ego certe non dubito quin dentur huju<U+017F>modi occultae cau<U+017F>ae, quibus funiculus ille <U+017F>ubtilis, quo in tubo <U+017F>u<U+017F>penditur argentum (ut dictum e<U+017F>t capite decimo) modo producatur, modo abbrevietur, &amp;c. <U+017F>ic<expan>

                  <head>The 31. Experiment.</head>
                  <p>Upon this our Author having recited our Conjecture at the cau<U+017F>e why two very flat and <U+017F>mooth Marbles <U+017F>tick <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that by lifting up the uppermo<U+017F>t you may take up al<U+017F>o the lowermo<U+017F>t, approves my way of examining that Conjecture. But whereas I <U+017F>ay that the rea<U+017F>on why, though the Marbles were kept together by the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient Air, yet they did not fall a<U+017F>under in our exhau<U+017F>ted Receiver, no not though a weight of 4. Ounces were hung at the lower <U+017F>tone, might be, that by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall leak in the Receiver the Air could not be <U+017F>ufficiently drawn out: yet he tells us with his wonted confidence, <hi>Certum e<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ententiam illam vel hoc <U+017F>olo Experimento <U+017F>atis refelli.</hi> But po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he would have <U+017F>poken le<U+017F>s re<U+017F>olutely, if he had made all the tryals about the adhe<U+017F>ion of Marbles that we relate our <U+017F>elves to have made in the <U+017F>hort Hi<U+017F>tory we have publi<U+017F>h'd of <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity and Firmne<U+017F>s.</hi> For our Examiner <U+017F>peaks as if all that we a<U+017F>cribe to the Air in <U+017F>uch Experiments were to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the lower Marble with the weight perhaps of a few Ounces: Whereas in ca<U+017F>e the Air be kept from getting in at all between the <U+017F>tones, it may (according to our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is)</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain a Weight either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or well-nigh equal to that of a pillar of Air as broad as the Ba<U+017F>is of the lower Marble, and as long as the Atmo<U+017F>phere is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57681:50"/>
high, or to the weight of a pillar of Quick<U+017F>ilver of the <U+017F>ame thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and about 30. Inches long; the<U+017F>e two pillars appearing by the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment to counterpoi<U+017F>e each other. And therefore <U+017F>ince in the <U+017F>eventeenth Experiment, when we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hau<U+017F>ted our Receiver as far as we could, there remain'd Air enough to keep up in the Tube a Cylinder of about an Inch long of Quick<U+017F>ilver; and <U+017F>ince the broader the contiguous Marbles are, the greater weight fa<U+017F>tned to the lowermo<U+017F>t may be <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd by the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Air, (as is obvious to him that con<U+017F>iders the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> and as we have proved by Experiment in the forementioned Tract) it need be no wonder that the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Receiver <U+017F>hould be able to <U+017F>upport the lowermo<U+017F>t Marble, who<U+017F>e Diameter was near two Inches, and a weight of four Ounces, tho<U+017F>e two Weights being inferior to that of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder of that Diameter and an Inch in length. And though it were not, yet we are not <U+017F>ure that the Receiver was as well emptied when we made the 31. Experiment, as when we made the 17. And (if my Memory does not much mi<U+017F>-informe me) 'twas with the <U+017F>ame pair of Marbles that in the pre<U+017F>ence of an illu<U+017F>trious A<U+017F><U+017F>embly of <hi>Virtuo<U+017F>i</hi> (who were Spectators of the Experiment) the uppermo<U+017F>t Marble drew up the lowermo<U+017F>t, though that were clog'd with a weight of above 430.

                  <p>As for the account the Examiner <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titutes of our <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> I know not whether many Readers will acquie<U+017F>ce in it: For, not to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon the Objection which him<U+017F>elf takes notice of, that according to him the di<U+017F>tended Air in the Receiver <U+017F>hould draw a<U+017F>under the adhering Marbles; his Explication <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es that there cannot naturally be a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> whence he infers that, <hi>Nece<U+017F><U+017F>e er at ut lapis ille non aliter de<U+017F>cenderet, quàm relinquendo po<U+017F>t <U+017F>e tenuem huju<U+017F>modi <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantiam, qualis ab argento vivo aut aquâ <U+017F>ic de<U+017F>cendentibus relinqui <U+017F>olet.</hi> But whereas he adds, that the cau<U+017F>e of the ob<U+017F>tinate adhe<U+017F>ion we meet with in our ca<U+017F>e is, that <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is far more difficult to be <U+017F>eparated from Marble then from Quick<U+017F>ilver or any other kind of body; that A<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is precarious. And though I have tryed Experiments of

this nature with <U+017F>tones of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>izes, perhaps an hundred times, yet I never could find that by their cohe<U+017F>ion they would <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain a weight greater then that of a Pillar of the Atmo<U+017F>phere that pre<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t the lowermo<U+017F>t: Which is a con<U+017F>iderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tance, that much better agrees with our Explication then our Adver<U+017F>aries.

                     </note> of a Spunge; he told me, that at fir<U+017F>t he could hold out about two or three Minutes at a time: Which made me think that Divers become able to continue under water <U+017F>o long, either by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly-convenient Con<U+017F>titution of body, or by a gradual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e.

For, having purpo<U+017F>ely made tryal upon a couple of Moles that were brought me together alive, one of them included in a <U+017F>mall, though not very <U+017F>mall, Receiver was between two and three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in killing; whereas the other being immediately after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under water did not there continue full a Minute and a quarter, before it finally ceas'd from giving any <U+017F>ign at all of life.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57681:55"/>
by its revolution a Sphere of the <U+017F>ame Diameter with its own in the Air. By this Circular motion the parts of the <hi>laminae</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to recede from the Centre or Axis of their motion, acquire a Springine<U+017F>s outward like that of a Watch-Spring, and would naturally flye abroad untill they were <U+017F>tretch'd out at length, but that being incompa<U+017F>t with the like on every <U+017F>ide, they cannot do it without the removal of them, as not having room <U+017F>ufficient for <U+017F>uch a motion. And the fa<U+017F>ter this circular motion is, the more do the parts endeavour to recede from the Axis, and con<U+017F>equently the <U+017F>tronger is their Spring or endeavour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

And, fir<U+017F>t, for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Expan<U+017F>ion, it will very naturally be explained by it: As let us <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e for in<U+017F>tance the Diameter of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall coyled Particles of the Air (which being next the Earth are pre<U+017F>s'd upon by all tho<U+017F>e nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous incumbent Particles that make up the Atmo<U+017F>phere, and are thereby <U+017F>o crouded that they can but very little untwi<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves; let us <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>ay, the Diameter of the<U+017F>e Particles) to be 1/1000000000000 of an Inch; and then to be much of the form of tho<U+017F>e repre<U+017F>ented in the 4. Figure by <hi>A B C D:</hi> and that the<U+017F>e Particles, when a con<U+017F>iderable quantity of the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient parts is taken away, will flye abroad into a Coyle or Zone ten times as big in Diameter as before; that is, they will now be 10/1000000000000 of an Inch in Diameter, and appear in the form of tho<U+017F>e in the Figure expre<U+017F>t by <hi>E F G H:</hi> the<U+017F>e Zones whirl'd round as the former will de<U+017F>cribe a Sphere a 1000. times as big in bulk, and thereby fence that <U+017F>pace from being entred by any of the like Zones: this it would do, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e Spheres did immediately alwayes touch each other; but becau<U+017F>e of their circular motion, whenever they meet they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be beaten, and flye off from one another, and <U+017F>o require a yet greater <U+017F>pace to perform their motion in. This <U+017F>uppos'd, there are no <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction (which is enough at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent to an<U+017F>wer what he objects) but may be naturally and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly

made out. As fir<U+017F>t, for that of the <U+017F>welling of a Carps Bladder, if we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall parcels of the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>t <hi>laminae</hi> to lye latitant within the folds of it, and being much coyled up together <U+017F>carce to take any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible room, this Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Air will appear to contain very little or nothing within it; whereas when the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Air is taken off in good part from the out<U+017F>ides of it, then tho<U+017F>e formerly latitant Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves by flying open into much bigger Zones, <U+017F>o as perhaps to be able to defend a thou<U+017F>and times bigger <U+017F>pace from being entred into by their like or any other gro<U+017F>s Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e of the Bladder. Now becau<U+017F>e the Pores of a Bladder are <U+017F>uch as are not ea<U+017F>ily permeable by the Particles of Air, therefore the<U+017F>e lurking Particles <U+017F>o expanding them<U+017F>elves mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily plump out the <U+017F>ides of the Bladder, and <U+017F>o keep them turgid untill the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Air that at fir<U+017F>t coyled them be re-admitted to do the <U+017F>ame thing for them again.</p>
               <p>Next, as for Rarefaction by heat, that will as naturally follow as the former from this <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is.</hi> For the Atoms of fire flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in in great numbers, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through with a very rapid motion, mu<U+017F>t needs accelerate the motion of the<U+017F>e Particles, from which acceleration their Spring or endeavour outward will be augmented, that is, tho<U+017F>e Zones will have a <U+017F>trong nitency to flye wider open, (for we know that the <U+017F>wifter any body is moved circularly, the more do the parts of it endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the Centre of that motion) from whence if it has room will follow a Rarefaction. As for the conveyance of Light, that being according to <hi>Epicurus</hi> performed by the local motion of peculiar Atoms, their motions to and fro through this <hi>medium</hi> will be le<U+017F>s impeded by the rarefi'd Air then by the condens'd; as indeed upon Experiment we <U+017F>hall really find them.</p>
               <p>As for his third Objection drawn from his <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed attractive virtue of the thus rarefi'd Air, that is quickly an<U+017F>wered, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to have any power at all of attraction; and by <U+017F>hewing (which is already done) that what effects he would have to be performed by the attraction of the included, is really done by the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the ambient, Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57681:56"/>
And, la<U+017F>tly, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of my Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Experiment are <U+017F>ufficiently obvious and ea<U+017F>ie to be deduc'd.</p>
               <p>So then, by granting <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Principles, that the Atoms or Particles of bodies have an innate motion; and granting our Suppo<U+017F>ition of the determinate motion and figure of the Aerial Particles, all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction and Conden<U+017F>ation, of Light, Sound, Heat, &amp;c. will naturally and nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow: and the Authors Objections again<U+017F>t this fir<U+017F>t way of Rarefaction will <U+017F>ignifie very little.</p>
               <p>As to the <U+017F>econd way of Rarefaction, by the intru<U+017F>ion or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubtil matter of <hi>Aether</hi> into the <U+017F>paces de<U+017F>erted by the rare<U+017F>ying Particles, which is that propos'd by the A<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of a <hi>Plenum,</hi> this al<U+017F>o is by the Author condemned, and branded with Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility. And why? Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e 'tis (he <U+017F>ayes) impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the above-mentioned <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Carps Bladder can be explained by it. Secondly, becau<U+017F>e 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to give a rea<U+017F>on from it of the impetuous a<U+017F>cent of Water admitted into an exhau<U+017F>ted Receiver. And, Thirdly, becau<U+017F>e 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to explicate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

               <p>And the way that I <U+017F>hall take, <U+017F>hall be that of the mo<U+017F>t acute Modern Philo<U+017F>opher <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Des Cartes,</hi> publi<U+017F>hed in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophical Works: Which is this, That the Air is a Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of long, <U+017F>lender, flexible particles, agitated or whirl'd round by the rapid motion of the <hi>Globuli Coele<U+017F>tes,</hi> and the <U+017F>ubtile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his fir<U+017F>t Element, whereby they are each of them enabled to drive or force out of their Vortice all <U+017F>uch other agitated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Now the <U+017F>wifter the<U+017F>e Bodies are whirl'd round, the more do their flexible parts fly a<U+017F>under and <U+017F>tretch them<U+017F>elves out; and the more forcibly do they re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the ingre<U+017F><U+017F>e of any other <U+017F>o
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57681:57"/>
agitated particles into their Vortice, and con<U+017F>equently the <U+017F>lower their motion is, the le<U+017F>s will be their re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. And becau<U+017F>e there is a va<U+017F>t number of the<U+017F>e whirled particles lying one above another, and each particle having its peculiar gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it will nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow that the undermo<U+017F>t (which to maintain their Vortice mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure) mu<U+017F>t very much be hindred from expanding them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o far as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e they would, were there none of tho<U+017F>e incompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Particles that lay in their way: and that tho<U+017F>e being by any means removed, or they them<U+017F>elves by a more rapid motion of the Particles of their Vehicles, the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd Element, (which is according to that <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> an effect of Heat) more <U+017F>wiftly and <U+017F>trongly whirled round, they pre<U+017F>ently begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand them<U+017F>elves, and maintain a bigger Vortice then before. Now to perform what I ju<U+017F>t now promi<U+017F>ed, I <U+017F>hall endeavour to give a po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, if not a probable, cau<U+017F>e of the objected <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</hi> And, Fir<U+017F>t, for that of the Carps Bladder, where the Air is rarefi'd (<U+017F>ayes the Author) 1000. times, it will ea<U+017F>ily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the few Particles of the Air, which (while<U+017F>t they <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of all the incumbent Atmo<U+017F>phere) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>picuou<U+017F>ly luck within the Bladder, (each of them being able to maintain but a very <U+017F>mall Vortice) to be by the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>iding <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment freed from the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Air, and their motion continuing the <U+017F>ame (by rea<U+017F>on that the Tran<U+017F>cur<U+017F>ion of their Vehicles is not at all or very little hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either by the Gla<U+017F>s or Bladder) their parts having room to expand them<U+017F>elves, will flye abroad to <U+017F>uch Exten<U+017F>ions as may perhaps make a Vortice 1000. times as big in bulk as what they were not able ju<U+017F>t before to exceed. Hence the Particles of the Air (being <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>s as not ea<U+017F>ily to pervade the Pores of the Bladder) mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily drive out the fides of the Bladder to its utmo<U+017F>t extent, and <U+017F>erve to fill the Receiver in the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgick</hi> Experiment. Now, whereas the<U+017F>e Particles will by the <U+017F>ame pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Air be reduc'd to the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate they were in at fir<U+017F>t, that is, to be thronged into a very little room, and

thereby be able to maintain a very <U+017F>mall Vortice; the Air let in in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment reduces the Air in the Bladder to its former incon<U+017F>picuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s; as the admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Water in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment does that Receiver full of rarefi'd Air into the bigne<U+017F>s of a Hazel Nut. Now the Water in this la<U+017F>t-mention'd Experiment enters with a great impetuo<U+017F>ity, becau<U+017F>e driven on with the whole pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Atmo<U+017F>phere, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted onely by the <U+017F>mall force of the <U+017F>o-far-rarefi'd Air.</p>
               <p>As for the Authors Objection again<U+017F>t this way of Rarefaction drawn from the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Gun powder, I <U+017F>hall endeavour to an<U+017F>wer it by <U+017F>hewing them po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly explicable by a <hi>Carte<U+017F>ian Hypothe<U+017F>is.</hi> For <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e Terre<U+017F>trial parts of the Gun pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be fir<U+017F>t at re<U+017F>t, and afterwards agitated by the rapid moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his fir<U+017F>t Element, there will be <U+017F>ufficient difference of the former and later condition in re<U+017F>pect of Exten<U+017F>ion; and <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing the particular con<U+017F>titution of Gun-powder (ari<U+017F>ing partly from the Specifick forms of the Particles of its ingredients; Nitre, Sulphure and Char-coal, and partly from their proportionate commi<U+017F>tion) to be <U+017F>uch as will readily yield to the motion of his <hi>Materia <U+017F>ubtilis,</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as an ingre<U+017F>s is admitted to it by the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any particular parcel of it, the Expan<U+017F>ion will be <U+017F>peedy enough.</p>
               <p>So then let us <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a Barrel of Gun-powder placed in <U+017F>ome clo<U+017F>e room, to <U+017F>ome grains of which we will <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome actual fire to be applied, by which actual fire (the Texture of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being <U+017F>uch) tho<U+017F>e grains are <U+017F>uddenly fired, that is, many Millions of parts, which before lay <U+017F>till and at re<U+017F>t, are by the action of the burning Coals <U+017F>hatter'd, as it were, and put into a po<U+017F>ture ready to be agitated by the rapid motion of the <hi>Materia <U+017F>ubtilis:</hi> into which po<U+017F>ture they are no <U+017F>ooner put, then agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and whirled <U+017F>ufficiently by it; whence follows a va<U+017F>t Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of that part of Gun-powder <U+017F>o fired. For each of its parts being thus whirl'd and hurried round, expell and beat off with great violence all the contiguous Particles, <U+017F>o as that each Particle takes up now 1000. times as much Elbow-room (if I

His Third therefore is, That by how much more <hi>rare</hi> a body is, by <U+017F>o much the more are its Indivi<U+017F>ibles virtually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Hence his Fourth is, That though the<U+017F>e Indivi<U+017F>ibles be really indivi<U+017F>ible, yet they are virtually <hi>in quotvis partes divi<U+017F>ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Whence he deduces his Fifth Principle, That <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e Indivi<U+017F>ibles are really indivi<U+017F>ible and virtually extended, they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be moved after the <U+017F>ame manner that other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ible and virtually-extended things are. His In<U+017F>tances are in the motions of an Angel and an indivi<U+017F>ible piece of wood, which, he <U+017F>ayes, are both of the <U+017F>ame kind. As for that of Angels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no immediate Revelation, and a Spirit and its actions not falling under <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and not having any third way by which to be inform'd, I <U+017F>hall leave him there to enjoy his fancies. But as for that of his piece of wood, we <U+017F>hall find it <U+017F>ufficiently full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urdities and contradictions. And fir<U+017F>t, he calls it indivi<U+017F>ible, but why I know not, for 'tis neither really nor yet mentally <U+017F>o: not mentally <U+017F>o by his fourth Principle, where he <U+017F>ayes that 'tis

Nor, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, is it really <U+017F>o: for then (according to the main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of his Book, as may be gathered from the fir<U+017F>t words of his Title-Page, <hi>Tractatus de Corporum In<U+017F>eparabilitate)</hi> it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that any thing in the world <U+017F>hould be divi<U+017F>ible; for he making an in<U+017F>eparable continuity, and that bodies will rather be (I can't tell how) <U+017F>tretcht beyond their own dimen<U+017F>ion <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi> then part from one another; a body may as <U+017F>oon pa<U+017F>s through the dimen<U+017F>ions of any one Indivi<U+017F>ible, as pa<U+017F>s between two. Next, he grants in the <U+017F>trange <U+017F>tretching or rarefaction of the<U+017F>e Indivi<U+017F>ibles a temporary motion of the condens'd Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion; whence there will follow that there mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F>tinct places or <hi>Ubi</hi>'s, it mu<U+017F>t be <hi>terminus à quo, terminus ad quem, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> And next, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to divide a line into two parts, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of an unequal number of Indivi<U+017F>ibles; as if 101. Indivi<U+017F>ibles of exceedingly-rarefi'd Air <U+017F>hould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in length an Inch, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to divide that Inch into two equal parts. I might run over many more, but it would be too tedious to be here recited. As for his indivi<U+017F>ible parts of Time, tho<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be <hi>in quotvis partes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ibiles;</hi> for el<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame body or Indivi<U+017F>ible mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be in divers places at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant. But becau<U+017F>e he can <U+017F>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nay confidently affirm, this and many other <U+017F>uch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and ab<U+017F>urdities, I am not willing to mention them; and I think it would have made more for the Authors reputation if he had done <U+017F>o too. As for his la<U+017F>t Chapter, where he applies the<U+017F>e Principles to the Explication of the <hi>Rota Ari<U+017F>totelica,</hi> I have not here time to <U+017F>et down all the ab<U+017F>urdities that any one that has but a <U+017F>mattering in the Mathematicks may ob<U+017F>erve: as, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times half an indivi<U+017F>ible part of a Circumference may touch an indivi<U+017F>ible of a Line; <U+017F>ometimes one may touch half, a quarter, a hundredth part, a whole one, two, ten, a hundred, &amp;c. at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant; nay, an indivi<U+017F>ible of a Circle may be all of it in a thou<U+017F>and places together, and the like. And this he brings as a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57681:60"/>
great Argument to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h his <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> of Rarefaction, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to compri<U+017F>e many <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s and very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereas the thing is very plain and ea<U+017F>ie, and contains no <U+017F>uch ob<U+017F>curities. For if, for example, we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a Wheel <hi>ABCD</hi> to be moved in a direct motion from <hi>AIC</hi> to <hi>KLM,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of it retaining the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ition to that line that they had at the beginning of their motion, each of the points <hi>AEIGC</hi> will on a Plain, or in the <hi>Medium</hi> it pervades, pa<U+017F>s through or de<U+017F>cribe a line equal to the line <hi>IL,</hi> and not onely all the points lying in the line <hi>AIC,</hi> but all and every point of the whole <hi>Area</hi> of the Circle; this mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily happen if the Diameter <hi>AIC</hi> be moved parallel to it <U+017F>elf: But if while<U+017F>t it be thus moved with an equal progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, it be likewi<U+017F>e moved with an equal circulation, the ca<U+017F>e will be altered. For then, fir<U+017F>t, each point will by this compound motion de<U+017F>cribe on the Plain or <hi>Medium</hi> either a perfect Cyclorid, as when the Wheel makes one perfect revolution, while<U+017F>t the whole is progre<U+017F><U+017F>ively moved from <hi>I</hi> to <hi>L;</hi> or <U+017F>ome Piece, as when the Wheel has not perfected its revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or more then a whole one, as when the Circle has made more then one whole revolution while<U+017F>t it is moved in its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate length. I <U+017F>hall here onely con<U+017F>ider the fir<U+017F>t, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more e<U+017F>pecially to my pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, and in regard the two later on occa<U+017F>ion may be ea<U+017F>ily explicated by it. Next, each point of this Circle acquires from its compounded motion vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees of Celerity as to its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious po<U+017F>ition to a point which is alwayes found in <U+017F>ome part of the line drawn through the Centre of the circular motion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive. And it is found thus, as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the <hi>Radius,</hi> <U+017F>o is the line of the progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the di<U+017F>tance of the point from the Centre. And this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens becau<U+017F>e the line of Progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion is equal to the Circle de<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on that di<U+017F>tance as <hi>Radius;</hi> each point therefore of this <U+017F>maller Circle, when it comes to touch the Perpendicular, mu<U+017F>t, as to its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive motion, <U+017F>tand <U+017F>till: This point therefore will be the Centre of this compounded motion. Now becau<U+017F>e for

the explication of the <hi>Rota Ari<U+017F>totelica</hi> we need not con<U+017F>ider any other then tho<U+017F>e Points which are tran<U+017F>ient through or cro<U+017F>s the Perpendicular line, we <U+017F>hall onely examine them. Let then in our Example <hi>A</hi> be the Centre or immoveable point, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference therefore <hi>ABCD</hi> will be equal to <hi>IL</hi> or <hi>AK</hi> by our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is.</hi> Now becau<U+017F>e the point <hi>I,</hi> which is the Centre of the Rotation, has onely one motion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Lation, its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity will be equal to the <U+017F>ingle celerity of the Lation; we will therefore put it to have one degree. <hi>C,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it is moved with two motions, both tending the <U+017F>ame way, and each equal to the velocity of <hi>I,</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs have two degrees of velocity. The point <hi>F,</hi> becau<U+017F>e moved with two motions, both tending the <U+017F>ame way, the one <hi>(viz.</hi> its Lation) being equal to that of <hi>I,</hi> and the other (becau<U+017F>e it is but half as far di<U+017F>tant from the Centre of Rotation as <hi>C,</hi> and therefore is moved but with half the celerity of <hi>C,</hi> which was equal to that of <hi>I)</hi> but half as quick, we will put to have one degree and an half. By the like method we might find the velocity of all the points in the Perpendicular, <hi>viz.</hi> <U+017F>uch as we have there marked <U+017F>ome of them; but it would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, we needing not to con<U+017F>ider more then the two points <hi>A</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> The point at <hi>E</hi> being moved forward by its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion with the <U+017F>ame velocity that <hi>I,</hi> but by its rotation (which is but half as <U+017F>wift as that of the Circle <hi>ABCD,</hi> that is double the Circle <hi>EFGH)</hi> being moved the contrary way or backwards with half the velocity, lo<U+017F>eth half of its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion forwards. The point in <hi>A</hi> being by its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion moved forwards equally <U+017F>wift with <hi>I,</hi> and by its rotation (the Circle <hi>ABCD</hi> being equal to the line <hi>IL)</hi> being carried backwards with equal velocity, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>tand <U+017F>till as to its progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion.

            <p>Ibid. <hi>Nam <U+017F>i Tubus, &amp;c.</hi> For if a Tube but twenty Inches long (<U+017F>uch as we u<U+017F>ed in our fir<U+017F>t Argument) be not quite filled with Quick<U+017F>ilver, as before, but a little <U+017F>pace be left betwixt the <hi>Mercury</hi> and the Finger on the top of the Tube, in which Air onely may abide: We <U+017F>hall find that the Finger below being removed, the Finger on the top will not onely be drawn downwards, as before, but the Quick<U+017F>ilver <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>cend al<U+017F>o, and that notably, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a parcel of Air can be extended by <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>cending weight. So that if in<U+017F>tead of Air, Water or any other Liquor which is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily extended be put in its place, there will be no de<U+017F>cent at all.</p>
            <p>Hence, I <U+017F>ay, again<U+017F>t this Opinion an Argument is framed: For if the external Air cannot keep up tho<U+017F>e twenty Inches of Quick<U+017F>ilver from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cending, as we have proved; how <U+017F>hall it keep up twenty nine Inches and an half? A<U+017F><U+017F>uredly the<U+017F>e can no way be reconciled.</p>
            <p>p. 5. <hi>Dices fortè, &amp;c.</hi> You will perchance <U+017F>ay, that the Quick<U+017F>ilver therefore doth in the alledged ca<U+017F>e de<U+017F>cend, becau<U+017F>e it is thru<U+017F>t down by that parcel of Air which dilates it <U+017F>elf by its own Spring.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Sic deberet, &amp;c.</hi> So <U+017F>hould the Finger be rather thru<U+017F>t from the top of the Tube, then thereby fa<U+017F>tned to it; becau<U+017F>e this Dilatation mu<U+017F>t be made as well upwards as downwards.</p>
            <p>p. 6. <hi>Concipi, &amp;c.</hi> It cannot be conceived how that Air <U+017F>hould dilate it <U+017F>elf, or thru<U+017F>t down the <hi>Mercury,</hi> unle<U+017F>s by taking up a greater place; which thing the<U+017F>e Authors are much again<U+017F>t, a<U+017F><U+017F>erting that Rarefaction can be made no other wayes then by Corpu<U+017F>cles or Vacuities.</p>
            <p>Chap. 3. p. 7. <hi>Si, &amp;c.</hi> If you take a Tube open at both ends of a good length, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e forty Inches long, and fill it with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and place your Finger on the top as before, taking away your lower Finger you will find the <hi>Mercury</hi> to de<U+017F>cend even to its wonted <U+017F>tation, and your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the top to be <U+017F>trongly drawn within the Tube, and to <U+017F>tick clo<U+017F>e
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57681:63"/>
unto it. Whence again it is evidently concluded that the <hi>Mercury</hi> placed in its own <U+017F>tation is not there upheld by the external Air, but <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended by a certain internal <hi>Cord,</hi> who<U+017F>e upper end being fa<U+017F>tned to the Finger draws and fa<U+017F>tens it after this manner into the Tube.</p>
            <p>Chap. 4. p. 8, 9. <hi>Sumatur, &amp;c.</hi> Take a Tube <U+017F>horter then twenty nine Inches and an half, for in<U+017F>tance of twenty Digits, not <U+017F>hut, as hitherto, at one end, but with both ends open: let this Tube, its Orifice being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and one Finger being plac'd underneath, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> to be poured in run not through, be filled with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> and then another Finger be applied to its Orifice, to clo<U+017F>e it well: Which being done, if you draw away your lower Finger, the upper will be found to be <U+017F>trongly drawn and <U+017F>uck'd into the Tube, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>tifly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it, (or rather to the Quick<U+017F>ilver, as I <U+017F>hall hereafter <U+017F>hew) that it will elevate the Tube it <U+017F>elf with all the Quick<U+017F>ilver, and make it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to hang pendulous in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el.</p>
            <p>From which Experiment this Opinion is mo<U+017F>t clearly refuted: For, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to it the Quick<U+017F>ilver in <U+017F>uch a Tube but twenty Inches long mu<U+017F>t be thru<U+017F>t upwards by the preponderating Air; it will never by it be explained how this Finger is <U+017F>o drawn downwards, and made <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly to <U+017F>tick to the Tube. For it cannot by the Air thru<U+017F>ting upwards be thus drawn downwards.</p>
            <p>p. 11. <hi>Quod vel, &amp;c.</hi> Which is thence confirmed, Becau<U+017F>e if that preponderating Air <U+017F>ucceeds, as is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted, in the place of the lower Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which was withdrawn, that is, if it uphold the Quick<U+017F>ilver after the <U+017F>ame manner which it was upheld by the lower Finger applied under it; it is manife<U+017F>t, according to this Opinion, that the Finger on the top ought not to be more drawn downwards after the lower Finger is removed then before. Seeing then that Experience teacheth the contrary, it is manife<U+017F>t that Opinion mu<U+017F>t be fal<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Chap. 5. p. 12. <hi>Quarto, &amp;c.</hi> In the fourth place it is impugn'd, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e thence it would follow that Quick<U+017F>ilver through a like Tube might be <U+017F>uck'd with the <U+017F>ame ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s out of a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el that Water is <U+017F>uck'd out of the <U+017F>ame. Which not with<U+017F>tanding is contrary to Experience, by which we are taught that Water is ea<U+017F>ily drawn into the mouth of him that <U+017F>ucks, whereas Quick<U+017F>ilver cannot be drawn thither by his utmo<U+017F>t endeavour, nay, <U+017F>carce unto the middle of the Tube.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>equel I thus manife<U+017F>t: Becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>eeing, according to this Opinion, that the Liquor underneath, whether it be Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> may <U+017F>o a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, no more is requir'd but that the Air <U+017F>hut in the Tube may be drawn upwards by <U+017F>ucking; which being drawn up, the Liquor underneath will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57681:63"/>
immediately a<U+017F>cend, being thru<U+017F>t thither by the external Air now prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating, (as <hi>Pecquet</hi> declares in his Anatomical Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>p.</hi> 63.) It is manife<U+017F>t that the <hi>Mercury</hi> may be <U+017F>uck'd out with the <U+017F>ame ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s that Water is <U+017F>uck'd out with. Which being <U+017F>o evidently again<U+017F>t Experience, the Opinion from whence it is deduced mu<U+017F>t needs be fal<U+017F>e.</p>

                  </expan>, &amp;c.</hi> And even this Experiment doth very well agree with our Principles: For <U+017F>eeing by this depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Sucker, the Air <U+017F>hut up in the cavity of the Cylinder is <U+017F>eparated from the Cylinder, and doth de<U+017F>cend together with the Sucker, (as we have, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. ob<U+017F>erved of water de<U+017F>cending together with Quick<U+017F>ilver) it comes to pa<U+017F>s that in that whole depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion new <U+017F>urfaces are taken from that de<U+017F>cending Air, and <U+017F>tretched out, as we have there explained it in the ca<U+017F>e of de<U+017F>cending water. Since therefore <U+017F>uch Sufaces are as ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>lipt off and extended in the end of the depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion as in the beginning; it is no wonder that there is found the <U+017F>ame difficulty of depre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it at both times.</p>
            <p>p. 72. <hi>Eo magis, &amp;c.</hi> That the Air is <U+017F>o much the more extended and rarefied, by how much the more is thence exhau<U+017F>ted, and <U+017F>o doth acquire a greater force of contracting it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>p. 74. <hi>At profecto, &amp;c.</hi> But truly it <U+017F>eems not credible that this mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oft Air <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o vehemently compre<U+017F>s a Gla<U+017F>s on all <U+017F>ides (e<U+017F>pecially one of that thickne<U+017F>s there mention'd) as to break it.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Verius, &amp;c.</hi> It is therefore more truly an<U+017F>wered, that the Gla<U+017F>s is therefore <U+017F>o broken, becau<U+017F>e by that ex<U+017F>uction its <U+017F>ides are more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn inwards then (by rea<U+017F>on of the figure unfit for re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency) they were able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. For <U+017F>eeing the included Air doth mo<U+017F>t firmly <U+017F>tick to the <U+017F>ides of the Gla<U+017F>s, to draw out the Air will be nothing el<U+017F>e but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bend the <U+017F>ides of the Gla<U+017F>s inwards.</p>
            <p>p. 75. <hi>Sed profecto, &amp;c.</hi> But truly this <U+017F>eems too far remov'd from Truth, and may be by this alone <U+017F>ufficiently refuted. Becau<U+017F>e if the pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of the Air which de<U+017F>cends by that Tube into the Vial be <U+017F>o great as to break the Vial it <U+017F>elf, it ought certainly, before the breaking of the Vial, very much to move the water in which the Tube is immers'd, and to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57681:65"/>
excite bubbles in it, &amp;c. as appears, if any one blowing through that Tube doth make but an ordinary pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure upon the water. But it is <U+017F>ure that the water before the Vial is broken doth not move at all: as the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter will find.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Licet, &amp;c.</hi> Though the Tube had been <U+017F>hut at the top, the Vial had doubtle<U+017F>s been broken after the <U+017F>ame manner.</p>
            <p>p. 77. <hi>Sed rectius, &amp;c.</hi> But it is more rightly thence inferr'd, that that Cylinder did nothing there before.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Dico, &amp;c.</hi> I <U+017F>ay then that the Quick<U+017F>ilver doth by that exhau<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>o de<U+017F>cend in the Tube, becau<U+017F>e it is drawn downwards by the Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon the re<U+017F>tagnant Quick<U+017F>ilver. For that incumbent Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its exhau<U+017F>tion greatly rarefied and extended, vehemently contracts it <U+017F>elf, and by this contraction doth endeavour to lift the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> out of its Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that (the re<U+017F>tagnant <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> now le<U+017F>s gravitating upon the bottom of its Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el) the Quick<U+017F>ilver in the Tube mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cend, as is manife<U+017F>t in it <U+017F>elf: So that it is no wonder that, the external Air afterwards entring, the Quick<U+017F>ilver again a<U+017F>cends, <U+017F>eeing by that ingre<U+017F>s the force which elevates the re<U+017F>tagnant Quick<U+017F>ilver is weakned.</p>

Inches and an half. For as by the extraction of the Air the Quick<U+017F>ilver is depre<U+017F>t below its <U+017F>tation, <U+017F>o by the intru<U+017F>ion of new Air it is elevated above it.</p>
            <p>p. 80. <hi>Nam <U+017F>i, &amp;c.</hi> For if it were kept up by that, it ought rather to a<U+017F>cend then de<U+017F>cend in colder weather, becau<U+017F>e the Air then would be more den<U+017F>e and heavy. Therefore the Quick<U+017F>ilver is not upheld by the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of Air, as is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Hinc fit, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that this <hi>Funicle</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the cold, the water doth a<U+017F>cend in cold weather; but doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cend in hot, becau<U+017F>e by heat the <hi>Funicle</hi> is dilated.</p>

            <p>Ibid. <hi>In decimo nono, &amp;c.</hi> In the 19. he <U+017F>hews that water doth in the <U+017F>ame manner de<U+017F>cend upon the exhau<U+017F>ting the Receiver, as he had <U+017F>hewn Quick<U+017F>ilver in the foregoing Chapter to de<U+017F>cend. Of both which <U+017F>eeing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57681:66"/>
there is the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e, there is no rea<U+017F>on we <U+017F>hould any longer in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on this.</p>
            <p>p. 82. <hi>Nam <U+017F>i, &amp;c.</hi> For if it were done <U+017F>o, the<U+017F>e bubbles ought not <U+017F>o to have a<U+017F>cended from the bottom of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, (as it is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted they did, both in this and the following Experiments that treat of bubbles) but from the upper part of the water, where they are le<U+017F>s compre<U+017F>t; as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manife<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>p. 83. <hi>Re<U+017F>pondeo, &amp;c.</hi> I an<U+017F>wer that the water, upon that exhau<U+017F>tion of the Air, doth not <U+017F>o a<U+017F>cend of its own accord, but is violently drawn or lifted upwards by that rarefied Air contracting it <U+017F>elf. For as water doth <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>ome compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion (as appears by experience) <U+017F>o here al<U+017F>o it <U+017F>uffers <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion. And hence it is clearly manife<U+017F>t why the<U+017F>e bubbles <U+017F>hould ari<U+017F>e rather from the bottom of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, then from the upper part of the water. For when that vehement <U+017F>uction doth endeavour to elevate the water from the bottom of the Vial, there ari<U+017F>es there a certain <U+017F>ubtil matter, which being turned into bubbles doth <U+017F>o a<U+017F>cend as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 15.
