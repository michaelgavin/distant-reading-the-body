         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Solicited her to con<U+017F>ent,
that he might again convey
her out of his ingro<U+017F><U+017F>ing
hands; and She indeed loved the Author of
this Advice with too much Flame to be
backward to comply with him in any thing
that was hone<U+017F>t and that admitted a plau<U+017F>ible
excu<U+017F>e: but when She came <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
the Quality and Con<U+017F>equence of this
Second Rape, She could finde no Praetext
that was Tolerable with which to favour it.
The Rea<U+017F>ons which moved Her to di<U+017F>allow
his Demands, and with which She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to <U+017F>ilence them, were, that She had
no more any cau<U+017F>e to complain of <hi>Certafilan,</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60972:5"/>

Him without makeing the King and Her
Si<U+017F>ter Her Enemies, without indeed work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ruine of her Honor and Comfort,
and that She hoped they <U+017F>hould in time

running away from Him, con<U+017F>idering that
He kept Her not Company <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely as He

Nothing could have come more
<U+017F>trange to the Lovers Mind than did the<U+017F>e
arguings of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; He took them
not only for a flat Denial of what He had
begged, but al<U+017F>o for an unque<U+017F>tionable
A<U+017F><U+017F>urance that She no longer Loved Him:
and hurried away with this Opinion, all in a
rage he flung from her without vouch<U+017F>afeing
her any Reply. This his Indignation
was as wounding to Her, as Her rea<U+017F>oning
had been offen<U+017F>ive to Him; it <U+017F>truck deep
into her Heart, and moved it from the

taken notice off, She therefore made u<U+017F>e

<hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> derived from the <U+017F>ight of him
was both real and great, it was far more
Evident than that he could make any doubt

a Swoon in her Husband's Arms; at which
Accident it was Legibly enough written in
<hi>Alcidor's</hi> Looks that his heart was not in

But the Remedies that were u<U+017F>ed

            <p>The Lover was indeed from this time,
putting all things into the Ballance together,
<U+017F>o Ill <U+017F>atisfied with the Husbands humour,
that to give it no more Umbrage he re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not only to go no more to his Hou<U+017F>e,
but al<U+017F>o to deface out of his Soul all tho<U+017F>e
Draughts which the Beauty of his Wife
had Ingraved there. In Favour of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
he <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf on work to <U+017F>urvey the
more lovely Faces of <hi>Paquin,</hi> that <U+017F>o by
their Variety or by the Prevalency of <U+017F>ome
one of them he might be brought to forget
that which he had a while adicted him<U+017F>elf
to, but which now he wholly quitted to its
Uncommunicative Proprietary: and of all,
which in that his Copious Pro<U+017F>pect came
under his Con<U+017F>ideration, he was not long
before he concluded <hi>Carmelia</hi> the mo<U+017F>t wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60972:8"/>
of his Vows. That therefore he might
have Liberty of Vi<U+017F>iting her without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he tyed him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>o <U+017F>traight a friend<U+017F>hip
with her Husband <hi>Clidantus</hi> that there was
hardly in all the Court to be <U+017F>een its Parallel.
By which means he and that Fair having a
Frequent Conver<U+017F>e, if his glowing heats
for her <U+017F>oon grew to a burning Fever of
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, She al<U+017F>o quickly began to langui<U+017F>h
with a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which made her as much
need him for her Phy<U+017F>ician as he did her
for his.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e new Loves knocking at <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia's</hi>
Eares, She was <U+017F>o far from Frowning upon
them, that She with Smiles and from her
heart bad them Welcom. Her Sentiments
were indeed <U+017F>ince her Sickne<U+017F>s turned <U+017F>o
contrary to what they had before been, that
in the place of Amorous Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion She had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
any longer for <hi>Alcidor</hi> but an Amicable
care of his good. When the Forces of
his Merit at any time A<U+017F><U+017F>aulted her, She
by the Rules and helps of Prudent Vertue <U+017F>o
Re<U+017F>olutely and Dextrou<U+017F>ly defended her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
again<U+017F>t them that they could gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon her more than to make her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in the Creature the Creators Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.
When She thought of what had

<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elf, that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
would throw Dirt upon my Name, but
that I am <U+017F>trongly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that he hath more
both of Wi<U+017F>dom and Genero<U+017F>ity then to
Defame a Woman who hath by more than
Ordinary Re<U+017F>pects Obliged him to her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
what Credit would he get in leading
a Triumph over my Weakne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>etting
up Trophies of an Advantage which my

Write to him to let him <U+017F>ee that I, from

And indeed, adjoyned <hi>Carmelia,</hi> what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ignorant or over Critical People may
<U+017F>ay, I am altogether of the Mind that a

<hi>Alcidor,</hi> than it could be imagined his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was capable of; and during eight
dayes after their comming he carried it out
well: But he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick the ninth that his
Phy<U+017F>icians began to de<U+017F>piar of his recovery,
and he afterwards for many dayes laboured
under pains which rendred his life a burthen

<hi>Felisbea</hi> took a ju<U+017F>t and a kind Si<U+017F>ter's

which <U+017F>he had alwayes for him
would have prompted her to have taken, had
her mind been at liberty; but it was called
off from <U+017F>ympathizing with <hi>Clidantus</hi>
by being continually taken up in admireing
<hi>Alcidor.</hi> After <U+017F>he had admired him a while
<U+017F>he grew big with Love of him, and then
re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>ly <U+017F>olicitous that he <U+017F>hould have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>werable

carrying his heart with too rappid a current
to <hi>Carmelia,</hi> to <U+017F>uffer him to think of <hi>Felisbea</hi>
as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, he de<U+017F><U+017F>embled his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding

<U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed (as <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal) to
make him know her mind, and conform to
it, he carried him<U+017F>elf as if he was wholly
ignorant of their meaning. This added
very much to her anxiety and he who
was the occa<U+017F>ion of it, was enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that he was <U+017F>o, but made <U+017F>hew
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60972:16"/>
of believeing that it was all upon the account
of her Brother. When therefore <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>ufficiently wearied her <U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ighing for
him, who would not rightly intere<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf

without any thing of di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, to lay
her heart open before him, and <U+017F>he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently

Interpreter of it to him, had not that great
portion which <U+017F>he had of honor and Sagene<U+017F>s

you to pardon the untuly violence of

have too lightly and fooli<U+017F>hly permitted you
familiarities which have made you hope as

But undeceive your <U+017F>elf, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> and know
that I <U+017F>hould much more cheerfully love to
dye than con<U+017F>ent (as you immagine I might
be induced to do) to the ruine of my honor.
I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> that
my crime, though it have love for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
is of a very deep and ugly <U+017F>tain, but
any repentance, if any repentance can be <U+017F>o,
is an<U+017F>werable to it. I again therfore beg by
all that you hold good and dear to pardon
me, and I beg you not to do it, but upon
condition, that if ever I fall back into the

that you are really troubled for the offence
that you have given me, forbear trobling your

I lay an indi<U+017F>pen<U+017F>able charge upon you,
that you no more go again<U+017F>t the law which
I have by the Obligation of Vertue nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
pre<U+017F>cribed you. I confe<U+017F>s I love you
entirely, but if you imagine you <U+017F>hall be
ever able to draw from me more than what I
have told you I will allow you; know I <U+017F>hall
run to my grave rather than bring a blot upon
the integrity of my life. As for our wonted

Proofs which he gave of his qualities made
all other the brighte<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>onages appear to

keep him<U+017F>elf from being in love with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He <U+017F>aw <U+017F>hine a beauty, which (when

This young Widow who was i<U+017F><U+017F>ued

he without any <U+017F>cruple <U+017F>acrificed to her his

whole heart, and that with a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
from what he had formerly paid at
Femal <U+017F>hrines. It <U+017F>eemed altogether unju<U+017F>t

and for all his life, or in loveing her not to
build upon Vertue, not to aim at Marriage,
not to breath after better things than Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

as was that which he had in his wi<U+017F>hes, and

that he by any <U+017F>uites or declarations to her

found in her Wit, Humour, Fa<U+017F>hion, Form,
<U+017F>ome new occa<U+017F>ion of admiring her and of

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60972:25"/>
to her a <U+017F>ervant of love, people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
argued a probabilty of it, his competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

could not mea<U+017F>ure De<U+017F>erts with him. He

But <U+017F>eeing them all for<U+017F>ake the li<U+017F>ts

What wayes one may invent, cryed <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>

In earne<U+017F>t, Sir, replied <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently,
you have a very ingenious art, and you are
very indu<U+017F>trious in u<U+017F>ing it to make your <U+017F>elf
<U+017F>port with tho<U+017F>e ab<U+017F>ents and with me; and
you would per<U+017F>wade me into a <U+017F>trange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<U+017F>hould I give up my <U+017F>elf to hearken to
you: but as little di<U+017F>cretion as I have, I
have <U+017F>o much as to under<U+017F>tand your flatteries
and to know what ear and credit I am to
give them. If <hi>Alcidor</hi> loves, it is not <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
that he loves, he a<U+017F>pires to things more
exalted, and Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, not <U+017F>uch as I, are
the objects of his Vows. I wi<U+017F>h no more,
Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, than that my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60972:26"/>
<U+017F>atisfaction depended upon the truth of this,
that I think there is nothing humane to
which I can a<U+017F>pire more exalted than your
<U+017F>elf; and that is my next Religion under
what I ow to Heaven to vow and pay to
you all that Man can Vow and pay to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
For Heaven knows that, though I
have <U+017F>tayed till now to tell you <U+017F>o, from the
fir<U+017F>t minute that I <U+017F>aw you, my brea<U+017F>t hath
been nothing el<U+017F>e but a region of fires which
your beauties kindled, and which burn to
you with as fervent and clear a devotion as
ever did tho<U+017F>e upon the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Altars to the
bright Eye of the World. It is too probable
that you account it criminal in me to be a
Candidate of tho<U+017F>e Felicities which <hi>Cli<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
while he lived enjoyed; but make what
judgment of me and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al you think good,
I <U+017F>hall never the more cea<U+017F>e to pay homage
to you and neverthele<U+017F>s endeavour to make
good the quality of your <U+017F>ervant.</p>
            <p>Having many arguments to believe that
the<U+017F>e words had nothing of cozening paint
or artifice in them but were the genuine
dictates of his heart wholly given up to her,
<hi>Dorame</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till a while plea<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf
with the acqui<U+017F>ition that <U+017F>he had made, Then
if it be true, Sir, returned <U+017F>he that you
have that kindne<U+017F>s for me that you pretend,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60972:26"/>
it it al<U+017F>o true that I reap a mo<U+017F>t plentiful ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and advantage by it, and that I <U+017F>hould be
both very ungratful and very unwi<U+017F>e together
<U+017F>hould I deny it an agreeable reception: and
you have for my encouragement the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and the e<U+017F>timation of a more generous
Man, than to de<U+017F>ign the abu<U+017F>ing a Widow
who reckons nothing more recommendable
than your vertue or more worthy of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
than your accompli<U+017F>hments, and who
therefore accounts it a mo<U+017F>t weighty <U+017F>ubject
of glory to her to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>toop to con<U+017F>ider
her otherwi<U+017F>e than <U+017F>he can by any title of her

your <U+017F>elf, Madam, replyed he, in di<U+017F>claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preten<U+017F>ions which by the graces of

me more victoriou<U+017F>ly, that which
you would have me believe. There needs
no art of words, returned <hi>Alcidor,</hi> to declare
a truth <U+017F>o plain as is that of your overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
worth, its rayes will break through
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60972:27"/>
the thicke<U+017F>t veil. I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible indeed that
the more perfection you have and know you
have, the le<U+017F>s hope I can have that you <U+017F>hould
give to one <U+017F>o defective as I am, that place
in your heart that I dye for; but yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay that if you will con<U+017F>ult the
World about your qualities, I am willing
you <U+017F>hould name me Impo<U+017F>tor, and treat
me as <U+017F>uch a one if all that know you do not
avow you one of the chiefe<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e pieces
which are matter of Admiration to them.
I very well know, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorame,</hi> that
only to hear you <U+017F>peak is enough to take
away from the eyes and <U+017F>pirit of tho<U+017F>e that
hear you, the faculty of judging things as
they appear: I will therefore conte<U+017F>t no
longer with you, as being certain of the
conque<U+017F>t which you have a mind to win. I
yield you that which you at pre<U+017F>ent contend
for; let us now di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e.
What can I di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of to you, reparted
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>o much to my mind as of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which you have in your <U+017F>elf, and of
the affections which I have for you? But to
obey you I will at pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ay no more of
either of them, provided that you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
me to believe what I have already <U+017F>aid
of both. To give you a <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Dorame</hi> to him, I agree to what you ask, <U+017F>o
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60972:27"/>
far as my Con<U+017F>cience of my <U+017F>elf will allow
me, and I <U+017F>hall doubt le<U+017F>s of your love than
of my own merit, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>o great
a de<U+017F>ire to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of the former, and I
have <U+017F>o little rea<U+017F>on to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf of the

it really is, and as I have a de<U+017F>ire to give you
te<U+017F>timonies that it is; but it will be with hopes
that you will retaliate it to me, which if I mi<U+017F>s

threw him<U+017F>elf upon his knees before her in

She <U+017F>tooping to rai<U+017F>e him up, her

with the opportunity he could not forbear
touching it with his lips, which (perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

not <U+017F>hewing her <U+017F>elf di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with, accend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

reverence not much different from that of
Religion made <U+017F>ome clo<U+017F>er impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his

without being reproved by her for it, but
that with a <U+017F>weet and <U+017F>oft mildne<U+017F>s which
<U+017F>hewed <U+017F>he could not be much offended with
that which was only to be attributed to the
exce<U+017F>s of his love, and which encouraged
him to doe the like, again rather than deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him from it.</p>
            <p>He having after a few days by the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
engageing powers of his Merit and
court<U+017F>hip prevailed with her plainly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his <U+017F>ervice, their conver<U+017F>ation had
<U+017F>o much vertuous amoenity and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s
in it, that it was a great deal of pitty it <U+017F>hould
have been interrupted; but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to go to accord a quarrel of which
he was made Arbiter, and the law of his
charity did them the ill office of <U+017F>eparating
them, that which they would have account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Two days after his departure <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in her Chamber by <hi>Rolimon, Melian</hi>

they had not at pre<U+017F>ent made a Journey to

did his endeavour to remove from her this

advantage of his friend; but he after all
found that it was but labor in vain to go
about to replace him in her favour. He
cea<U+017F>ing therefore to alledge any thing more
in his behalf, <U+017F>he changed her action and
language, and <U+017F>uccinctly told them all that
had pa<U+017F>t between her and <hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>o hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omely
repre<U+017F>enting to them the Love which

a high delight in hearing it, and earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conn<U+017F>elled her to think of no other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Rolimon,</hi> be<U+017F>ides that

it as well as gained it, having done as
eminent things as ever Man of his age and

gained him for her Husband, but that <U+017F>he
could not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her own will, nor could

boyling with a generous heat of
Soul, he took for a Mark of contempt, and
was toucht with it to the quick: from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
he proceeded to a con<U+017F>ideration of
con<U+017F>cience, and repre<U+017F>enting to him<U+017F>elf
that the Party of the League was of the true
Religion and undertook its defence again<U+017F>t
the other, he grew to an opinion that to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60972:35"/>
him, that perfect Courtier by the inevitable
<U+017F>pels with which he laid hold upon him
brought him with fervour to embrace his
<U+017F>ide again<U+017F>t that of his Sovereign. Which
done, to keep him his, as he made him, and
withal to take the benefit of his being <U+017F>o, he
gave him Moneys and Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to rai<U+017F>e
five hundred Hor<U+017F>e, and he in execution of
the tru<U+017F>t was on a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>een at the head of
many <U+017F>ilent Men, attempting and atchieving
things which, called, not only the vulgar but
the brave<U+017F>t of the Nation to take notice of
him with admiration, and which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
purcha<U+017F>ed him the good will of <hi>Li<U+017F>antus</hi>

               <p>The heads of the League, to give it good

very <U+017F>pecious principles as motives of it,
and had conjured the Princes, Nobles and

again<U+017F>t the Novel, which they <U+017F>aid the King
favoured again<U+017F>t them, by that Lure decoying
into them multitudes of credulous People.
To impede this the King put abroad a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in which he cleared him<U+017F>elf from the
<U+017F>everal blots wherewith they a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed him
and particularly te<U+017F>tified that he bore a
<U+017F>incere and con<U+017F>tant love to the <U+017F>ettled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

great number of People and <U+017F>ome of them
very con<U+017F>iderable; but not <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who

venture, and if need required, to <U+017F>pend his
Life in its quarrel, that nothing but death
<U+017F>eemed of power to di<U+017F>cover him from it.
In proportion to his affection did his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Prudence labour for its advantage,
but notwith<U+017F>tanding all the endeavors both
of him and others to hold it up, they <U+017F>aw
it in a <U+017F>hort time <U+017F>o enfeebled and bent to
fall that they were con<U+017F>trained to incline to
peace, and to return it, not for always, yet
at lea<U+017F>t for a time to the obedience of their
King.</p>
               <p>It was indeed no long time before they
who had been <U+017F>o forced to lay down their
Arms had taken them up again; which <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi>
<U+017F>eeing put him<U+017F>elf in the Field with a

carried of the <U+017F>aid relicks of the

But the Commanders proved too timerou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the Soldiers more eager of <U+017F>ecuring, than

               <p>The revolt was thus <U+017F>et at Bay; but the

and committed ravages altogether unworthy

leave <hi>Paquin</hi> to go <U+017F>eek a <U+017F>helter again<U+017F>t the

his denial very much perplext both the

the King's Subjects in a perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The King having granted what he
demanded, and opened that great Court
with a <U+017F>peech, of which the Eloquence and
Conduct made him admired for one of the
wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t excellent heads that wore a
Crown, he, who had braved his authority
confidently, pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf before him,

but not long after by the advi<U+017F>e of his
Coun<U+017F>el di<U+017F>patcht him out of the World.
Upon notice of which Execution the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Paquin</hi> broke out into extremeties
which trampled all their allegiance under
foot, and in revenge of it <hi>Lucimon</hi> rai<U+017F>ed
them that were exa<U+017F>perated in plain rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and after their example <U+017F>everal of their
chief Towns of <hi>China,</hi> and having gained
a formidable <U+017F>trength advanced towards
<hi>Florimen</hi> with a confidence of making him
his Pri<U+017F>oner. But upon intiligence of his
enterprize <hi>Polianis</hi> reconciled him<U+017F>elf
with the King, employed his Arms in his
<U+017F>uccor and forc't the Enemy to fly. In this
occa<U+017F>ion was <hi>Alcidor</hi> engaged on the <U+017F>ide
of <hi>Lucimon</hi> and performed all the parts of
a Man of courage but was con<U+017F>trained to

                  <hi>Tyrenas</hi> was taken Pri<U+017F>oner and kept at <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanfu</hi>
he contrived and effected the conveiy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a Letter to him, wherein he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured
him that he would, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>uddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his liberty, either by Money, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or <U+017F>ome other means; and what he
promi<U+017F>ed he faithfully endeavored by Offers
of tearmes, but altogether unprofitably.</p>
               <p>He therefore wove a project of <U+017F>urprizing
the place, which he communicated to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>antus,</hi>
and which he highly approving they
cau<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>ilent number of Souldiers to be

habits, and <U+017F>ent them with in<U+017F>tructions under
<U+017F>hew of going to Market to <U+017F>eize one of the

were di<U+017F>covered and the body of the guard
alarrumed. They, notwith<U+017F>tanding that,
after a hot a<U+017F><U+017F>ault and vigorous re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance

               <p>In this part of the relation <hi>Dorame,</hi> could

him that all the actions of <hi>Alcidor</hi> had
<U+017F>o much Beauty in them that <U+017F>he let none

men who will hazard their lives for them

in this age, in which fal<U+017F>hood and di<U+017F><U+017F>imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
raign far more powerfully than either

               <p>A Few days after the <U+017F>urpi<U+017F>al of <hi>Chinanfu,</hi>
went he on, <hi>Alcidor</hi> had information brought
him that the Governour whom he and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>antus</hi>

to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e it to the <U+017F>ervice of the King;
with which he having acquainted <hi>Li<U+017F>antus,</hi>
they only with two Men put them<U+017F>elves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, <U+017F>ecretly called together <U+017F>ome
of the principal Per<U+017F>ons of it, and by the
Oratory that they u<U+017F>ed moulded them into
the form that they de<U+017F>ired. That done
they a<U+017F><U+017F>embled the chief of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's
Party and with the Poniard at their
throat made them promi<U+017F>e to <U+017F>erve the
League; they turned out the old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and <U+017F>ettled one of approved Integrity
in his room, they took an Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of all the People, and made the Garri<U+017F>on
mo<U+017F>t firmly theirs.</p>
               <p>No <U+017F>ooner had they with a great deal of

with enough of danger enterprized, but
<hi>Lucimon</hi> informed of <hi>Florimens</hi> advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Paquin</hi> conjured <hi>Alcidor</hi> with all
<U+017F>peed to put him<U+017F>elf into it, to defend it.
But with this part of his life, I am not

the love, which they <U+017F>ay, he and the Prince<U+017F>s

and which I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf is none of the
meane<U+017F>t imbelli<U+017F>hments of that life that you

a great deal of rea<U+017F>on to blame my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
re<U+017F>umed <hi>Rolimon,</hi> for not re-calling
that my Nephew was during all the Siege
<U+017F>hut up in <hi>Paquin</hi> with <hi>Alcidor;</hi> <U+017F>o that
there is no body who <U+017F>o well as he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve

a witne<U+017F>s of the Atchievements of War
which <hi>Alcidor</hi> performed in that Siege, but
I was al<U+017F>o no <U+017F>tranger to the intrickes of love
which pa<U+017F>t then between him and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
<hi>Flori<U+017F>a.</hi> I was for that time his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in Arms, and he made few enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>es
upon our Enemyes in which I was
not his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant. One de<U+017F>igne had engaged
us to the League, and reckoning to act
vigorou<U+017F>ly for our con<U+017F>cience and glory, we
upon all occa<U+017F>ions put our <U+017F>elvs upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for a party which we have <U+017F>ince found
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60972:40"/>
unju<U+017F>t and too late abandoned. But, not
to wa<U+017F>t time in that which is nothing to our
pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall give you all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that I can of that which you de<U+017F>ire to
know.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Vindorix</hi> was opening his mouth to
begin what he had to <U+017F>ay, word was brought
to <hi>Dorame</hi> that there were two Gentlemen
alighted who de<U+017F>ired to pay her their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects.
Having <U+017F>ent back him who brought
the word to conduct them in, and ri<U+017F>ing up
to go and receive them, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw enter her
Chamber two near Kin<U+017F>men of <hi>Cloria<U+017F>tes</hi>
who a little before would have Duelled
<hi>Cartagenes</hi> as his rival in her love. <hi>Rolimon,
Orlian</hi> and <hi>Vindorix,</hi> being well acquainted
with them, quickly learnt what it was that
had brought them thither. Which being
to <U+017F>olicite <hi>Dorame</hi> to accept their kin<U+017F>man
for her Husband, <hi>Rolimon</hi> made <U+017F>uch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear<U+017F>al
to them of the refu<U+017F>al which <U+017F>he had
given him and his companions <U+017F>uing for
<hi>Cartagenes,</hi> that they lookt upon it as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable
for them to imagine that they could
obtain of her for their friend what her Uncle
and Cou<U+017F>ins could not for theirs. They
were made yet farther to de<U+017F>pair of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her by <hi>Vindorix</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them that
there had pa<U+017F>t mutual profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60972:40"/>
between her and <hi>Alcidor.</hi> In the la<U+017F>t
place <hi>Dorame</hi> her<U+017F>elf deprived them of all
hope, <U+017F>peaking to them of <hi>Alcidor</hi> as of
one whom <U+017F>he had rea<U+017F>on to love, and
whom therefore <U+017F>he really did love above
all tho<U+017F>e who had made <U+017F>uite to her. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
therefore to di<U+017F>approve the choice that
<U+017F>he had made and unwilling to travel their
<U+017F>pirits to make Marble <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, they <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eded
from their negotiation and pa<U+017F>t to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
to her the affections of him, of

contrary to the intentions which <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>

and all agreed to give the la<U+017F>t a higher form

               <hi>Dorame</hi> was deeply <U+017F>truck with the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
and witne<U+017F><U+017F>ed by plenty of tears the
lively <U+017F>en<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he had of it, together
with the good e<U+017F>teem in which <U+017F>he had the
unhappy lover. Oh the <U+017F>trange effects of
Love, cryed <hi>Rolimon! Cartagenes</hi> ingaged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60972:43"/>
us to <U+017F>eek <hi>Dorame</hi> in Marriage for him, and
in his <U+017F>oul thought of dying. Pardon me,
Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Limonides</hi> to him, my Ma<U+017F>ter
thought of nothing le<U+017F>s than fighting when
he gave you the pains of comming hither,
he had at that time nothing in his mind but
his Love; but there afterwards evened o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which begot in him an intention
of fighting, that <U+017F>o he might confer and
vindicate his honour. But whence, <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorame,</hi> <U+017F>prung his quarrell
with <hi>Alcidor?</hi> That you <U+017F>hould know it,
Madam, replied <hi>Limonides,</hi> was part of
his will before he dyed, of which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
me his Executor. In<U+017F>tantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that my Lords who are here, Your
Uncle and Cou<U+017F>ins were gone from his
Hou<U+017F>e, came in <hi>Almidon</hi> to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me told him <U+017F>o many things to provoke
him, that unle<U+017F>s he had been altogether <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
or a coward he would by no means have
remained without an angry re<U+017F>entment.
Among other things he told him, that
<hi>Alcidor</hi> having with little paines acquired
your favour <U+017F>o as to be declared your
<U+017F>ervant and owned by you for <U+017F>uch, had
to your <U+017F>elf in the pre<U+017F>ence of many
per<U+017F>ons of quallity <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o di<U+017F>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageou<U+017F>ly
and contemptuo<U+017F>ly of him that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60972:43"/>
he could not believe him<U+017F>elf his friend, did
he not give him notice of it, and farther
wirh all his power a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him to recover <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the injury. <hi>Cartagenes</hi> having
with impatience enough heard what he <U+017F>aid,
If you did not a<U+017F><U+017F>ert it, <hi>Alcidor</hi> <U+017F>aid he, I
<U+017F>hould have a great deal of difficulty to
believe that <hi>Alcidor</hi> who is e<U+017F>teemed one of
the mo<U+017F>t generous of men would di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
of me to her whom I adore; or indeed to
any Body otherwi<U+017F>e than he in equity
and Candor ought. Hath he be<U+017F>ides ever
known me tamely pocket up an affront that
he <U+017F>hould take the confidence to give me <U+017F>o
cruel a one? But I have a way to arre<U+017F>t his
in<U+017F>olency, and if there be nothing be<U+017F>ides the
Beauty of <hi>Dorame,</hi> that is enough to make
me Valiant, if not invincible. At the<U+017F>e words
<hi>Almidon</hi> <U+017F>aying that it belonged to him to
<U+017F>erve him in revenge of the injury who had
informed him of it, <hi>Cartagenes</hi> drew him
a<U+017F>ide and for <U+017F>ome time held a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with him, of which I confe<U+017F>s I had more than
ordinary apprehen<U+017F>ions. I knew <hi>Almidon</hi>
to be a turbulent and unlucky intermedler,
I knew al<U+017F>o that he had a de<U+017F>ign of drawing
my Ma<U+017F>ter to the <U+017F>earch of his Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Lidia;</hi>
I therefore ea<U+017F>ily believed that he had upon
that account brewed this quarrel for him.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60972:44"/>
               <hi>Almidon</hi> gone, <hi>Cartagenes</hi> pa<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of
the day in Melancholy. At night when he
was going to Bed remembring that I had
heard the greate<U+017F>t part of what <hi>Almidon</hi> and
he had <U+017F>aid to one another, could you have
ever thought, <U+017F>aid he to me, that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
would have thus abu<U+017F>ed me? I cannot be
induced, Sir, returned I to him, to give
any credit to what hath been told you, and
I wi<U+017F>h for your quiet you would not at all
regard it. To this he replied nothing but
bid me put him to bed, which I did and
gave him the good-night. Next morning at
point of day he called me to dre<U+017F>s him,
which done, he took hor<U+017F>e (and I with
him) to go to <U+017F>ee one of his friends. By the
way (I know not what ill fortune would
have it <U+017F>o) he about the middle of the day
took a path which he was never, that I know
of, wont to follow. Having followed it
<U+017F>ome Miles he happened to meet <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
whom acco<U+017F>ting with a bold roughne<U+017F>s, he
angrily enough demanded of him the rea<U+017F>on
why he had <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o unhand<U+017F>omly of him
to <hi>Dorame,</hi> To that, you <U+017F>hould learn to
know me better, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I am of a humor to offend any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
without rea<U+017F>on; and the injury that you

               </gap>o me in taking up that ill opinion of me is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60972:44"/>
greater than that which it <U+017F>eems you take
for granted I have done you. But be<U+017F>ides
this, the Lovely <hi>Dorame</hi> de<U+017F>erves that we
<U+017F>hould make one thru<U+017F>t with our Swords, as
I <U+017F>ee you have a mind we <U+017F>hould; and I
take mine in my hand, continued he, to let
you know that I will have the glory of <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her alone, engaged both by what he
had <U+017F>aid him<U+017F>elf, and by <hi>Alcidors</hi> words
and action my Ma<U+017F>ter drew together with
him, but wholly to his misfortune. For
though he was well mounted and (as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
known) very <U+017F>tout, he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
two wounds, one of which being
in his belly gave him only lea<U+017F>ure to get to
a little hou<U+017F>e hard by where they fought, to
write the Letter that I have brought you,
and ju<U+017F>t as he expired to command me to
give you, together with that, an account of
his di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. But I mu<U+017F>t not forget, added
<hi>Limonides,</hi> the generou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who,
when he <U+017F>aw his adver<U+017F>ary tumble to the
ground at the <U+017F>econd thru<U+017F>t that he gave him,
jumpt from his Hor<U+017F>e to his <U+017F>uccor. Which
he who was fallen <U+017F>eeing, and getting up
of him<U+017F>elf, trouble not your <U+017F>elf, brave
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, to help me; I am mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded, and though with your
Sword <hi>Almidon</hi> is the cau<U+017F>e of it. That

ba<U+017F>e man <U+017F>hall dye, returned <hi>Aclidor</hi> to him,
or I will my <U+017F>elf peri<U+017F>h by that kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are skilful to make more quarrels
than they are able to appea<U+017F>e. Believe me,
I never <U+017F>pake a word of you that could give
you a di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t. I am too certain of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
replied <hi>Cartagenes</hi> to him, to make
any further que<U+017F>tion of it, and let you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<U+017F>hall give you an account of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
which he ye<U+017F>terday held to me, in the mean
time that we binde up my wounds and I
recover <U+017F>trength to carry me to <U+017F>ome place
where I may dye more conveniently than
here. Accordingly while <hi>Alcidor</hi> <U+017F>erved
my Ma<U+017F>ter for Chyrurgion, I <U+017F>erved <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
for intilligencer. Which done we had
only time to conveigh my Ma<U+017F>ter to the
neare<U+017F>t comodious place that we could find,
and there as <U+017F>oon as he had written to you
he dyed. An adventure Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Vindorix</hi>

began thus.</p>
            <p>Alcidor having receaved the de<U+017F>ires of
<hi>Lucimon</hi> and <hi>Li<U+017F>antus</hi> to put him<U+017F>elf into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,
the friend<U+017F>hip which he and I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<U+017F>uffered us not to part, and, though
I was alltogether unworthy of that re<U+017F>pect,
he would not enter the citty without my
company. The day of our entrance the five
hundred hor<U+017F>e which he brought with him,
and his pre<U+017F>ence together ray<U+017F>ing and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

apprehen<U+017F>ions of puni<U+017F>hment, we were
wellcomed with <U+017F>o much honour, he for his
part that <hi>Lucimon</hi> and <hi>Li<U+017F>antus</hi> could not
have receaved more, and I, for my part, that
I never the like. The Magi<U+017F>trates and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
giving him this reception in the palace
of <hi>Flori<U+017F>a,</hi> whom her Uncle <hi>Lucimon</hi> had

<hi>Ora<U+017F>tes,</hi> the remarkes which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed of

with me, many others that were there
tooke notice that <U+017F>he was never accu<U+017F>tomed
to afford the like to any. He againe applyed
him<U+017F>elfe to her in <U+017F>uch a fa<U+017F>hion, that the

he <U+017F>pake to her of me <U+017F>o much to my
advantage that <U+017F>he <U+017F>pent complements upon
me which I very well knew I had nothing
that encouraged me to owne as my due, and
with which I found my<U+017F>elfe more put to a
<U+017F>tand than ever in my life be<U+017F>ides.</p>
            <p>The Governour and other Officers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
intru<U+017F>ted us with the cheife commands
of the Towne, wee without any <U+017F>upinene<U+017F><U+017F>e
u<U+017F>ed them to the utmo<U+017F>t of our power in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary orders for defending it, and
that late enough; for within foure dayes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60972:48"/>
after the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages were all <U+017F>eized by the King,
the out workes attaqued and the <U+017F>eige for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
We lay not <U+017F>till in this occa<U+017F>ion,
<hi>Alcidor</hi> had more gallantry and his Troopes
more ambition of fighting, we made a <U+017F>alley,
and in that fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ay of our armes brought
backe advantages over our be<U+017F>eigers which
cau<U+017F>ed fires of joy to be lighted through all
the City. Not <U+017F>atisfied with the triumph
unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him who had procured it,
<hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>ent for <hi>Alcidor</hi> to come to her, and
it was then that going along with him to her
I percieved by her eyes, words and whole
carriage not onely that his valour kept her
from <U+017F>haking under the feares which <U+017F>he had
of falling into the hands of her fathers ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
but al<U+017F>o that his per<U+017F>on was a great
deal more than indifferent to her. When
wee were going from her, you have not onely
Paquin to pre<U+017F>erve, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,
you have al<U+017F>o an unfortunate prince<U+017F><U+017F>e under
your guard, take heed therefore how you
hazard your life <U+017F>ince it is my <U+017F>upport. In
reply to this, I therefore make E<U+017F>teem of
Paquin, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it
holds <U+017F>o rich a trea<U+017F>ure as the prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>a.</hi>
Knowing indeed whence and what you
are I <U+017F>hould goe again<U+017F>t my Con<U+017F>cience,
<U+017F>hould I not <U+017F>et an higher value upon you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60972:49"/>
than upon what I hold deare<U+017F>t to me in the
world. What<U+017F>oever con<U+017F>iderations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can have, the ambition which I have of
<U+017F>erving you will be <U+017F>ure to <U+017F>urmount them
all, &amp; it will I hope not onely <U+017F>upply me with
boldne<U+017F>s of heart but with prudence al<U+017F>o to
manage it. This reply mooving <U+017F>o violently
her inmo<U+017F>t veines, that there ro<U+017F>e a <U+017F>udden
crim<U+017F>on from them and <U+017F>pred it <U+017F>elfe over
her face; <U+017F>he left us with out <U+017F>aying any more
but that <U+017F>he would have us <U+017F>ee her often.
And in this wee obeyed her command; for
what<U+017F>oever imployments we had to remedy
the di<U+017F>turbances which the enemy procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
we forbore not to vi<U+017F>it her twice every
day, and after a while whither <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd him
<U+017F>o to doe or that it came of his owne motion
<hi>Alcidor</hi> tooke up a cu<U+017F>tome of going fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to her without me. But on the other
<U+017F>ide what<U+017F>oever intreaties <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed to him,
and <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed, be<U+017F>ides that mentioned before,
very many and earne<U+017F>t ones not to throw
him<U+017F>elfe into danger, he forbore not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to ingage him<U+017F>elfe in the mid<U+017F>t of
the enemy, doing things which made every
body have him in their mouths for a kinde of
miracle.</p>
            <p>If we were active, our be<U+017F>eigers were not
idle, making atempts which for <U+017F>ome time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60972:49"/>
kept us day and night at worke. From which
having one afternoone a little relea<U+017F>e I made

into his chamber, where finding a booke

or el<U+017F>e might bee wholly lo<U+017F>t I carried with

di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to me was of <hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the vi<U+017F>it which he came from making
to her, and in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es he could not

often changed colour, and di<U+017F>covered by
many te<U+017F>timonyes that another God be<U+017F>ides
<hi>Mars</hi> had made him his votary; but yet he
tooke not any notice to me of the prince<U+017F><U+017F>e's

another <U+017F>ubject, which was that of warre, but

When a little after we were entered taking

I knew that <U+017F>he tooke a more than a common

other interpretation than that could be made
of tho<U+017F>e words which <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed to you at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
you have not onely Paquin to pre<U+017F>erve

            <p>After this, went he on, I many times vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her without your knowledge, and as
many times received te<U+017F>timonies of her
kinde inclinations towards me. One time
among the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed in plaine
tearmes to tell me that my per<U+017F>on and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
were very agreeable to her, and that
<U+017F>he made more account of me than of all
men in the world together; and I let not the
opportunity <U+017F>lip by without improoving it,
but tooke courage from what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to her in the mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>pectfull phra<U+017F>e
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60972:53"/>
that I could invent, that I had dedicated me
<U+017F>elfe entirely to her as to the mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>olute
peice of divinity among mortalls. In an<U+017F>wer
to which, you doe not at all di<U+017F>oblige me,
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, in letting me know that you
have an affection for me: Love me as much
as you are deare to me, and I aske no more to
be the mo<U+017F>t contented woman that lives.
Impregnated with joy to heare her <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o,
The Goodne<U+017F>s, Madam, replyed I to her,
which you are plea<U+017F>ed to te<U+017F>tifie towards

my gratitude, and leaves me nothing

to be all my life in the quality of your <U+017F>lave,
paying as much as I can of what I owe to
your birth merite and bounty. Her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
coming in, as I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, I held my
tongue and laid a re<U+017F>traint upon my carriage;
<U+017F>eeing which, have no re<U+017F>erve, <hi>Alcidor,</hi>

knowes all my <U+017F>ecrecies; from the moment
that I loved your vertue, I made her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, and <U+017F>he in<U+017F>tead of di<U+017F><U+017F>ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me from it, repre<U+017F>ented many things
to me on your <U+017F>ide, which <U+017F>erved to make me
more highly e<U+017F>teeme you. Hearing this, I
mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>tupified, Madame, returned I to
her, not to thinke that I have an obligation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60972:53"/>
to her which is not ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>charged, and I
<U+017F>hould de<U+017F>erve nothing but ill offices from
her in<U+017F>tead of good ones, <U+017F>hould I not <U+017F>eek
occa<U+017F>ion of thanking her. With wich words
pulling a diamond from my finger I intreated
her to wear it as pledge that I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of the favours which <U+017F>he had done me, and
<U+017F>he by the prince<U+017F><U+017F>e's command accepted it.
After this, Love, in<U+017F>tead of aba<U+017F>ing my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

which we the day before had made.
While we were talking about which, her

but no higher than was fitting, they
were ready to melt away my <U+017F>oule with
delight, when a <U+017F>top was put to them by
the coming in of the Governor of the
Town. Hee held di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es to her about
her Uncle <hi>Lucimon,</hi> and they were of <U+017F>uch
concernement as required her to write to
him. Which being done, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
gone, <U+017F>he told me <U+017F>he would ri<U+017F>e. I
withdrew therefore into the antichamber,
where meeting with her Gentleman, I, while
<U+017F>he was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, entertained my<U+017F>elfe with
him, and learnt a great many things of him;
particularly what<U+017F>oever craft he u<U+017F>ed to hide

whether or no the Prince<U+017F>s loved

me, and that <U+017F>he had allwayes my name
and actions in her mouth. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>werd,
that it was proper to tho<U+017F>e that were
great to <U+017F>peake well of tho<U+017F>e that were

to them who de<U+017F>erve them, and that if
<U+017F>he at all con<U+017F>iderd me I well knew it was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60972:55"/>
only becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o good as to thinke
that I might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly bee helpfull to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the City. <hi>Placidas</hi> not finding my
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>uitable to his expectation, turned
his tongue to other <U+017F>ubjects; but I in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
grew upon him and at la<U+017F>t brought him to
adverti<U+017F>e me that <hi>Lucimon</hi> had by a letter
which he had lately written to him, given
him charge watchfully to ob<U+017F>erve all the
actions of his neice, and withall to <U+017F>hew
me the letter; reading which I <U+017F>aw that the
vi<U+017F>its which I made to <hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> were knowne
to that prince and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected by him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus learnt of him what it was, very
conducible to my advantage to know, I with
the be<U+017F>t arguments that I could u<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be faithfull to his prince<U+017F>s and
to informe her of what<U+017F>oever he <U+017F>hould
know was practi<U+017F>ed to her detriment: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I advi<U+017F>ed him to give her notice
pre<U+017F>ently of that which her Uncle had
wrote to him, but without <U+017F>ignifying to
her that I knew any thing of it, adding that
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o well manage the tenure of my
cariage for the future that <hi>Lucimon</hi> <U+017F>hould
finde nothing in it to cen<U+017F>ure.</p>
            <p>According to my advi<U+017F>e as <U+017F>oone as <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
knew that he might enter the prince<U+017F><U+017F>e's
Chamber he went to her and gave her the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60972:56"/>
<U+017F>ame intelligence that he had given me.
Upon which <U+017F>ending him immediately for
me, <U+017F>carce was I within her Chamber
dore but <U+017F>he told me before him what he
had told her, not without di<U+017F>covering an
extreame di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ure, and <U+017F>aying all that
could bee <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t a man, again<U+017F>t <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
After <U+017F>he had by words and teares
di<U+017F>harged <U+017F>ome of her vexation, I, with the
re<U+017F>pect that was due to her and with the be<U+017F>t
motives that I could thinke of, intreated her
not to be troubled at the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, adjoining
that rather than <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould by occa<U+017F>ion of me
receive any thing of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, if my
being deprived of her <U+017F>ight would remedye

to me than I knew how to live under,
I would without di<U+017F>puting it bani<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elfe
from her pre<U+017F>ence. Hearing me <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, I
am <U+017F>o far, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> reparted <U+017F>he to me,
from having a minde that you <U+017F>hould ab<U+017F>ent

I would have you doe me the kindne<U+017F>s of

being <U+017F>o ill treated by an uncle I may amid<U+017F>t
my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e have the con<U+017F>olation of
being <U+017F>uccoured by one who hath no tie upon
him to doe it. Could it not <U+017F>uffice him to
have <U+017F>hut me up in this mi<U+017F>erable City
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60972:56"/>
which two potent Princes have for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their indignation, and which could
not keep it <U+017F>elfe from falling under their
power, if your valour and conduct forbad it
not, without going about to double my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment
by re<U+017F>training me from <U+017F>eeing
tho<U+017F>e who can give my <U+017F>pirit <U+017F>ome relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
what <U+017F>trange Barbarou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s is this
and how little u<U+017F>ed by an Uncle to a neice?
Does he feare that I have a minde to take
from him the preten<U+017F>ions which he makes to
the kingdom and to place the crowne upon
<hi>Alcidor's</hi> head, that he would not have him
come neare me? He is indeed abundantly
worthy of a <U+017F>cepter, but both his intentions
and mine are ju<U+017F>ter and more moderate than
to a<U+017F>pire to any <U+017F>uch thing, was it, as it is
not, in our power to attaine it. No, No
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> added <U+017F>he to me, you mu<U+017F>t not
for<U+017F>ake me, it would be too much cruelty
in you to abandon a Prince<U+017F>s that breathes
not, but by your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and expects not
her deliverance but by your meanes. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pon<U+017F>e
to this I <U+017F>aid all to her that love and
duty could <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t to me, to demon<U+017F>trate to
her my zeale of living and dying for her. All
which, both what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid and I, <hi>Placidas</hi>
hearing, and not being able to hear without
being certaine that there was a more than
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60972:57"/>
ordinary kindene<U+017F>s between us, he humbly
offered her to <U+017F>erve her to the utmo<U+017F>t of his
capacity again<U+017F>t her Uncle; and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
commanded by her to e<U+017F>teem me as
one to whom <U+017F>he had great obligations, he
intreated me to beleive that I was Ma<U+017F>ter of
his heart and that he would never have any
other inclinations than to doe me all the
good offices that he could. After which he
and <hi>Leonora</hi> leaving us together, we confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a while about <hi>Lucimon,</hi> thence we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to te<U+017F>tifie our affections to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I with the be<U+017F>t language that I could
put together, and <U+017F>he with as many favours
as her vertue and mode<U+017F>ty would allow her
to be<U+017F>tow upon me. She withall enjoined
me not to <U+017F>peak a <U+017F>yllable of our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pondencies
to any body; no, not to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorix,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for he is too much affected
with glory to like that you <U+017F>hould ingage
your <U+017F>elfe in love at a time <U+017F>o proper for
Armes. This is the <U+017F>ole rea<U+017F>on why I have
till now concealed from you my love and
the good fortune that I have had in it; You
therefore ought not to take it ill from me,
e<U+017F>pecially con<U+017F>idering that <hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> hath no
<U+017F>ooner given me liberty of acquainting you
with the <U+017F>ecret (for it was but this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60972:57"/>
u<U+017F>e of it to let you <U+017F>ee that I have nothing of
concerne which I am willing to re<U+017F>erve from

I lookt upon the injunction which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
had laid upon him, not as an effect of
her ill will to me, but as a fruite of her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which obliged her to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t all the
world in an affaire of <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>equence,

            <p>I having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince that time, went

without any body having cogni<U+017F>ance of it
but <hi>Placidas</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and I was never
with her but <U+017F>he gave me demon<U+017F>trations
of her affection towards me, which as
they bred in me a rich delight, were
enough al<U+017F>o to have begot in me a mo<U+017F>t fond
vaine-glory, if by a <U+017F>ober reflection upon
my <U+017F>elfe I had not been throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with my unworthine<U+017F>s of them. That
you may <U+017F>ee, how far I am in her e<U+017F>teeme,
added he, <U+017F>tepping to a little boxe of pearl
taking a paper out of it and bringing it to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60972:58"/>
me, read the<U+017F>e few lines. Doing as he
de<U+017F>ired me, I found they held <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>e
as this.</p>
            <p>Though po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly there bee few preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
of marriage <U+017F>o exalted, which my
birth would not authorize me to make, the
worth which continually repre<U+017F>ents it <U+017F>elfe

influence upon me that my heart cannot
keep it <U+017F>elfe from being drawne and tied

of my freene<U+017F><U+017F>e, for my virtue is no
otherwi<U+017F>e intere<U+017F>ted by my affection than it
ought to be, and as it is mo<U+017F>t true that I
love you, <U+017F>o is it al<U+017F>o that I love you in
<U+017F>uch a manner as cha<U+017F>tity and <U+017F>agene<U+017F>s allow,
and that I looke you <U+017F>hould continue in the

            <p>When I had done reading the<U+017F>e words,
not to detaine you any longer with this

is able to bring me to, and, if I may <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60972:58"/>
without imputation of arrogance, I have
rea<U+017F>on to thinke that I may be to morrow
the husband of <hi>Flori<U+017F>a,</hi> if I will. She every

I upon a manifold con<U+017F>ideration beleive that
I <U+017F>hall never have her for my wife I have
promi<U+017F>ed to make her <U+017F>o as <U+017F>oon as the
<U+017F>eige is rai<U+017F>ed, and in the meane time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my <U+017F>elfe for it by gaining as large a
<U+017F>tock of honour as I can.</p>
            <p>He thus concluding his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to me, I
told him that he had certainly done very
well in <U+017F>atisfying the prince<U+017F>s with tho<U+017F>e
a<U+017F><U+017F>urances that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, and that I made
no great que<U+017F>tion but the terme which he
had taken for marrying her would produce
<U+017F>uch a revolution of affaires as would <U+017F>et
him at liberty to doe in that affaire accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee cau<U+017F>e. Then, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it fitting to coun<U+017F>ell a man whom his
di<U+017F>cretion made him act well in every thing,
I onely let him know how deeply I accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my <U+017F>elfe in his debt, for communicating
to me the particularities of his affections,
and pre<U+017F>ently we parted.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>uch within our walls as practi<U+017F>ed
for <hi>Polianis</hi> and carried on con<U+017F>piracies of

us if we had not happily <U+017F>melt them out and
provided again<U+017F>t them, we were eight dayes
in remedying this de<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which done we
made our be<U+017F>eigers <U+017F>ee that wee had not lay
<U+017F>till but to take breath that we might fall
upon them with the more life, cutting our
way up to their trenches, putting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great di<U+017F>order and bringing backe a
great number of pri<U+017F>oners.</p>
            <p>There was againe nothing worth mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
attempted on our <U+017F>ide till one day <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
without me, whither I was otherwi<U+017F>e
bu<U+017F>ied or that he had <U+017F>ome other rea<U+017F>on not

the Town accompanied onely with ten vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers
that put them<U+017F>elves under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
They were pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>et upon by twice
as many and were at length con<U+017F>trained to
give way to their <U+017F>trength and retire. But
before <hi>Alcidor</hi> made his owne retreat, he
by amuzing the enemy gave his party lea<U+017F>ure
to make theirs. Upon which occa<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>taying a little too long behind, after he
had maintained fight as long as he was able,
to put him<U+017F>elfe out of the danger that he was
in, he leaped his hor<U+017F>e over a great ditch;
Thereupon one of tho<U+017F>e whom he had to
deale with vainely enough u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>braided him
that he had the advantage of making him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60972:59"/>
fly. To him, the advantage is, returned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor,</hi>
that you are <U+017F>o many, were you a
little fewer you <U+017F>hould quickly <U+017F>ee me come
backe to you. It <U+017F>hall be your fault if you
come not, <U+017F>aid the other againe, for I
promi<U+017F>e you, you <U+017F>hall have to doe with

<U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee I will attend you as it in honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>Li<U+017F>imax.</hi> Hearing him <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, <hi>Alcidor</hi>
was about to jumpe backe to him, but he at
the in<U+017F>tant perceived about halfe a <U+017F>core
hor<U+017F>emen galloping to intercept his way;
he therefore <U+017F>et <U+017F>purs to his hor<U+017F>e and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
            <p>Got into the Town he came and recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me what had befallen him: he told
me withall that <hi>Li<U+017F>imax</hi> being the favourite
of <hi>Florimen</hi> and of an applauded name, and
there, therefore being a great mea<U+017F>ure of
glory to be gotten by a <U+017F>ingle combate with
him, he re<U+017F>olved to demand it of him. The
rea<U+017F>ons which he alleadged for his re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inducing me to approve it, after I had
intreated him to let me be his <U+017F>econd but
could not obtaine it of him, we concluded
that it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for him to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
of the Prince<U+017F>s and of the Coun<U+017F>ell of
warr in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; and we went fir<U+017F>t to
the Prince<U+017F>s, to whom he declaring that his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60972:60"/>
honour put him upon a duell with <hi>Li<U+017F>imax,</hi>
<U+017F>he before me could not forbear having
her <U+017F>elfe extremely troubled at it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
all that <U+017F>he was able to turne him
from it. But when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he could not
pervail with him, Goe then, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
him, and fight this Giant, and heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
for you the victory. From her we went
to the Governour, at who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e the
cheif officers being convened, <hi>Alcidor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them what he de<U+017F>ired and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty procured their leave to doe
as he thought good. From them I waited
upon him home; by the way whither, The
King, <U+017F>aid he to me, beleives <hi>Li<U+017F>imax</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
and <U+017F>o doe others al<U+017F>o; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I overcome him I <U+017F>hall acquire a glory
which will not quickly dye: but if my ill
fortune on the other <U+017F>ide will have him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over me, this <U+017F>atisfaction I may
pretend to, that I am vanqui<U+017F>ht by one of the
brave<U+017F>t Cavaleirs of our age. It is almo<U+017F>t
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that you <U+017F>hould not conquer him,
replyed I to him, <U+017F>o much advantaged as
you are. Was there indeed nothing but the
favour of <hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> that is enough to make you
irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table, and I make no doubt but the
prayers which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ends up for you will be
heared and draw down upon you the ble<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing

We were in the<U+017F>e tearms when we
came to his lodgings; where he making me
<U+017F>tay and <U+017F>up with him, during <U+017F>upper I
againe <U+017F>et upon him with the be<U+017F>t rhetorike
that I had to per<U+017F>uade him to make me of
his party, but all to no effect. Ri<U+017F>en from

me a book to reade, I had not peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed

<U+017F>ee the combate and be able by her regards to
animate <hi>Alcidor.</hi> All things in <U+017F>hort were
ready, and pre<U+017F>ently appeared the two
competitors of honour. Before they came
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60972:62"/>
to their <U+017F>tations the King gave <hi>Li<U+017F>imax</hi> his
<U+017F>word and repre<U+017F>ented to him that he had
an enemy who was both excellently skilfull

<U+017F>end him <U+017F>ecretly by <hi>Placidas</hi> a bracelet of
her hair. After this, and that I had put my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in the head of the cavalry of which
<hi>Alcidor</hi> was commander, with re<U+017F>olution
either to dye or vanqui<U+017F>h in ca<U+017F>e there <U+017F>hould
be any treachery (though this as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appeared needed not, there being
nothing attempted again<U+017F>t the publike faith)
<hi>Li<U+017F>imax</hi> and <hi>Alcidor</hi> cho<U+017F>e their judges,
took their places and the trumpets <U+017F>oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ran again<U+017F>t one another with a <U+017F>wift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
like that of a furious wind. Their <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s
was very different; for <hi>Alcidor</hi> receiving
the lance of <hi>Li<U+017F>imax</hi> in the bow of his
<U+017F>addle <U+017F>o that it flew in peices, he with his
owne lance peirced his hor<U+017F>es <U+017F>houlder
and belly, with his <U+017F>word cut in pieces his
bridle, and di<U+017F>armed him. Having thus
almo<U+017F>t in a minute di<U+017F>patched the fight, not
without all the feilds and City ringing with
the <U+017F>houts of our army and people that
were upon the walls, he <U+017F>ent the <U+017F>word which
he took from his adver<U+017F>ary to the King
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60972:62"/>
who had given it him, and pre<U+017F>ently both
the armyes retired, theirs to their ordinary
po<U+017F>ts, and ours into the Towne. Never
man of <hi>Alcidors</hi> condition received more
honour in a day than he did in this, by the
order of the magi<U+017F>trates bonfires for <U+017F>ome
hours together lightened, and Canons
thundred in all parts of the City; no peice
of triumph was omitted that u<U+017F>es to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
famous victories; the Grandees gave
him complements, and all <U+017F>orts of people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
which declared them mo<U+017F>t pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
tran<U+017F>ported with what he had
done, and the replyes which he made to
them augmented their tran<U+017F>ports with their
elegancy and Genero<U+017F>ity. But all the re<U+017F>t
was cheap to the price of tho<U+017F>e congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which he received from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s;
they were as expre<U+017F><U+017F>ive of joy in her
<U+017F>elfe and of honour to him as her exuberant
ingeny prompted with her vehement affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could dictate to her; and he in an<U+017F>wer
to them attributed all his happine<U+017F>s to the

This action of <hi>Alcidor</hi> coming to the

the courage of tho<U+017F>e that were with

them in two <U+017F>quadrons and having orderd
them to follow him <U+017F>lowly and when he
gave the <U+017F>ignall to come up and charge, one
the one company and the other the other,
rode a little on before them. The enemy

he was, come <U+017F>traight up to them upon a

to him; and in return to it he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
were in an in<U+017F>tant upon them, gave
them a volley of <U+017F>hot with which many of
them tumbled, and falling in amid<U+017F>t the
confu<U+017F>ion with an impetuo<U+017F>ity which is not
to be expre<U+017F>t, quickly laid a great number

the re<U+017F>t, to yeild them<U+017F>elves pri<U+017F>oners part

endeavoured to concile his people to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement

For the better defence of it <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
would have had <hi>Alcidor</hi> put him<U+017F>elf

kept in the feild, where making continuall

they came, when he <U+017F>aw his time charged
the Cavalry with a fury which they were

upon the account of ill health. To them he
re<U+017F>tored their liberty and cau<U+017F>ed all their
equipage al<U+017F>o to be returned, for which
they have ever <U+017F>ince been of the number of
the be<U+017F>t friends that he hath had in the

more perfect re<U+017F>emblance of Mars taking

his men the King was very much troubled,
but being of a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition that carried him to
commend brave actions he highly extolled
this of <hi>Alcidor</hi> and named him one of the

grand, officers urged by the mutinous and
mournfull cryes of all <U+017F>orts of people and by
their own nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities, were treating with
him about a <U+017F>peedy <U+017F>urrender when they
were incouraged <U+017F>o <U+017F>tand out a while longer
by intelligence which they had brought them
that <hi>O<U+017F>travius</hi> was coming apace with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
army to releive them; And they were
not di<U+017F>appointed, for within a few dayes
the King drew of all his forces to go offer
that famed Captaine battel; but he would
not be drawn to venture <U+017F>uch a dangerous
ca<U+017F>t, thinking it enough to <U+017F>uccour the cheif
Town, and take <U+017F>ome others and retire;
Nor was <hi>Polianis</hi> able either to force him to
doe the on, or to hinder him from doing
the other. Seeing which he fell to work
with <U+017F>everall <U+017F>mall Towns and took them,
and <U+017F>ome of great con<U+017F>equence: he made

            <p>A while after the King, being infinitely

very happily for a foundation of that
obedience which many of his <U+017F>ubjects that
were in arms again<U+017F>t him were preparing
for him in their minds. It particularly put
<hi>Li<U+017F>antus</hi> and <hi>Alcidor</hi> upon con<U+017F>idering and
weighing of things which they had before
very little or not at all thought of. But
being the principall <U+017F>prings by which the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60972:70"/>
Union moved, they thought it not noble to
leave in the lurch tho<U+017F>e that depended upon
them, and who could not long <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t but

This will not all retard his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

You tell me what will be enough to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment

nothing in the world more true, Madam,
returned <hi>Limonides</hi> to her, than that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it. I <U+017F>hal make no more que<U+017F>tion of

you know of his fighting with <hi>Almidon.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conducted, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Limonides,</hi>
by <hi>Alcidors</hi> lacquey to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Meoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
(a freind of his) which is not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant
from that, which was my Ma<U+017F>ters
while he lived, nor from that al<U+017F>o of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midon,</hi>
I there found him and delivered to
him your Letter; which when he had read
he told me there was no cure that I could
have brought him like that for the greif
with which he re<U+017F>ented my Ma<U+017F>ters death.
Saying little el<U+017F>e but that little, enough to
make me perceive that he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
which he was in ha<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>patch with
<U+017F>omebody, he jumpt on hor<U+017F>eback and
galloped away. To <U+017F>ee whither he went I
followed him with as much <U+017F>peed as I
could without being perceived by him;
but I was not able for <U+017F>ome time to <U+017F>et eye
upon him. At length I di<U+017F>cerned him
above a hundred paces from me with his
<U+017F>word in his hand again<U+017F>t a man whom at
that di<U+017F>tance I know not. Riding as hard as
I could to the place I had <U+017F>carce di<U+017F>coverd

his adver<U+017F>ary to be <hi>Almidon,</hi> but I <U+017F>aw him
run into the body by him and fall. When
<hi>Alcidor</hi> <U+017F>aw me by them, confe<U+017F>s before
<hi>Limonides, Almidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, the wrong
that you have don me in reporting to his
Ma<U+017F>ter tho<U+017F>e things that were the occa<U+017F>ion
of his death. I can by no meanes excu<U+017F>e,
returned <hi>Almidon</hi> to him, what you charge
me with, and therefore if I may <U+017F>ay that I
forgive what is ju<U+017F>t, I forgive you the
wound which you have given me, and which
is apace letting out my <U+017F>oule. At the<U+017F>e

his misfortune as he had don upon my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,

<U+017F>et him upon his hor<U+017F>e and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed

came. There we <U+017F>aid, as <hi>Almidon</hi> de<U+017F>ired
us to <U+017F>ay, and <U+017F>aid him<U+017F>elfe that an enemy
who had met him by chance had given him
his hurt, and the Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to inform him<U+017F>elf of the name
of that enemy he would never tell him, but
de<U+017F>ired him to content him<U+017F>elf with this
that he was a gallant man who had ju<U+017F>t oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
to <U+017F>et upon him, and that he died
<U+017F>atisfied with him, not knowing how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of his action which he was free and

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60972:75"/>
in the armes of <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who, his eyes

            <p>
               <hi>Limonides</hi> having <U+017F>aid thus and holding

the part of hone<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons that come to be

in regard that two men, and one of them a
man of true gallantry, have in a privat
quarrell lo<U+017F>t their lifes by his hand. But
we <U+017F>hall have the le<U+017F>s rea<U+017F>on to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
provided <hi>Cloria<U+017F>tes</hi> increa<U+017F>es not the

rea<U+017F>on to hope that he will not, becau<U+017F>e at

but it is to <hi>Alcidor</hi> that it hath happened
and that hinders it from being a wonder. A

<U+017F>urely<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> is becau<U+017F>e he drew not his

deny but he had right on his <U+017F>ide in both
the<U+017F>e duells, in the one as being a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted,
in the other as being outraged. No man,
Cozen, <U+017F>aid <hi>Rolimon</hi> to her, can with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice
condemn him for what he hath don
and if any man <U+017F>hould have either <U+017F>o much
malice or <U+017F>o little judgment as to <U+017F>peak ill of
him for it, he would finde enough ready to
revenge it upon him. But let us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
hence to wait for him in the hou<U+017F>e,

u<U+017F>e my <U+017F>word again<U+017F>t a man who forced me

certainely no quarreller, much le<U+017F>s am I of
a humor to fall foul upon tho<U+017F>e whom I
do not beleeve to have a de<U+017F>ign of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

I can by no meanes bring my<U+017F>elf to endure.
You gave <U+017F>ufficient demon<U+017F>tration of this to
<hi>Li<U+017F>imax,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorame</hi> to him, and thereby
acquired a far more triumphing reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

much le<U+017F>s can it bring me into e<U+017F>teem with
you to whom tho<U+017F>e things are common

him, <hi>Vindorix</hi> and I to divert my neice have

to the time that you was taken pri<U+017F>oner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
what became of <hi>Flori<U+017F>a</hi> and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercour<U+017F>e

Uncle removed her from <hi>Paquin.</hi> I am <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

my weaker <U+017F>exe, reparted <hi>Darame,</hi>
I am not of <U+017F>o weake a temper, as to be
frighted with the bruite of things; on the

and tho<U+017F>e of your amorous intelligences
whith the prince<U+017F>s <hi>Flori<U+017F>a.</hi> In the remainder
of which latter I be<U+017F>eech you to in<U+017F>truct me,
after you have recounted to us, that which
I al<U+017F>o begge of you, how things went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and <hi>Almidon.</hi> But yet before
you doe this I will <U+017F>hew you what <hi>Cartage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
wrot to me dying. With tho<U+017F>e words
<U+017F>he took out of her pocket and pre<U+017F>ented to

for me as I have honor and obedience
for you, you would only <U+017F>ay, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> it

<U+017F>hould you treat me <U+017F>o. You have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<U+017F>urely to complain, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he to

            <p>After I was informed by <hi>Cartagenes</hi> and
<hi>Limonides,</hi> how <hi>Almidon</hi> had calumniated
me to the former, and by <U+017F>o doing been the
author of his misfortune (over which I
could not choo<U+017F>e but weep) I had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any thing be<U+017F>ides my love of your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o
bu<U+017F>y in my minde as revenge; but I was a

<U+017F>erve my<U+017F>elf in pro<U+017F>ecution of it; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I thought of acting one way, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another: I was indeed mo<U+017F>t inclined
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60972:78"/>
to go find him my<U+017F>elf in his hou<U+017F>e, and
draw him into the feild, there to demand
an account of him for what he had done;
but I was withall mi<U+017F>erably agitated with
fears of incurring your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure by <U+017F>o
doing, and of acquiring the tittle of a gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
more than of your <U+017F>ervant. I had
agreed tho<U+017F>e upon who<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ion I went
hence with the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s that I de<U+017F>ired, and
there was nothing but my love that <U+017F>tood in
the way of my anger. But when I con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that you was of a more generous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
than to take it ill that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eek
<U+017F>atisfaction for the wrong that was done to
me and for the mi<U+017F>cheife that was done to
<hi>Cartagenes,</hi> I wavered no longer but leaving
that dying man in the armes and to the care
of <hi>Limonides,</hi> I betook my<U+017F>elf to the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>Meonimus</hi> from which that of <hi>Almidon</hi>
was not far di<U+017F>tant. Where having <U+017F>taid
<U+017F>ome hours to repo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe and write
that letter to you which you was plea<U+017F>ed
mo<U+017F>t obligingly to an<U+017F>wer, I got again on
hor<U+017F>ebacke, and leaving behinde me my
freind's hou<U+017F>e was quickly at that of my
enemie. I found him at home, was recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him better than I de<U+017F>ired, and <U+017F>oon
under<U+017F>tood from him that he knew nothing
of the death of <hi>Cartagenes</hi> (for I reckoned
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60972:78"/>
him to be by that time no more among the
living) and that he beleived I knew nothing
of the reports which he had made to him
concerning me. Hiding therefore my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entments
from him, after I had <U+017F>taid with
him neer an houre, and refu<U+017F>ed the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of eating which he very civilly pre<U+017F>t
me with, I acted <U+017F>o that I engaged him to
ride out with me. When we were come
far enough from his hou<U+017F>e, in the mid<U+017F>t of

of a great roade to bring us, taking
him by the hand and obliging him to make a

know not where to find a place more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

you accu<U+017F>e me of having done you, and for
which you thus <U+017F>et upon me. Do you not
remember, replied I to him, or can you
deny that you not long <U+017F>ince <U+017F>poke of me to
<hi>Cartagenes</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e than was true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t?
who, an<U+017F>wered he, hath told you that
I did? <hi>Cartagenes</hi> him<U+017F>elf, reparted I. He
hath indeed allwayes told me, returned he,
that he would ingage me in a quarrell with
<U+017F>omebody, and I have now too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it to que<U+017F>tion that he was in earne<U+017F>t.
But I will maintain to him that he lyes and
that I never <U+017F>poke of you but as I ought. At
tho<U+017F>e words provokt with his ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
what I was <U+017F>ure he was guilty of, and
laying the blame upon one of who<U+017F>e inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
I had <U+017F>ufficient proofe, I took my
<U+017F>word in my hand again<U+017F>t him; but he made
no offer of putting him<U+017F>elf in a po<U+017F>ture of
defence. Seeing which, are you <U+017F>o great a
coward, cried I to him, as not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ay
what you have broached, but al<U+017F>o to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>e
fighting with one who defies you to it
and will kill you if you do not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him?
But the<U+017F>e reproaches <U+017F>tirred him not and I
was unwilling to <U+017F>trike a man who would
not defend him<U+017F>elf. To try therefore if I

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60972:79"/>
the words which he had <U+017F>aid to <hi>Cartagenes.</hi>
Struck with which and his owne con<U+017F>cience

his artifice and ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s, and that I am no

I to him, this <U+017F>word which I hold in my hand
to puni<U+017F>h you hath forced him to make a
voyage into another world for having too
lightly given credit to your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es. That
unhappy Cavaleir was as valiant to attacque
me as you are heartle<U+017F>s to defend your<U+017F>elf;
but the equity of my cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>urmounted the

if I can make you, run the <U+017F>ame adventure,
expiating your crime with your blood. Take
your <U+017F>word therefore in your hand or I will
run you through. But the<U+017F>e words warned
him no more than the former, and could he
have fled I dare confidently <U+017F>ay he would
not have <U+017F>taied long in the place. In <U+017F>ine,
when after I had with a great deal of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

to his ignominy unle<U+017F>s he would <U+017F>tand
upon his guard, he told me that his <U+017F>word
was not equall to mine, as indeed it was
not, being as bad a one as I have commonly
<U+017F>een, and that if I would <U+017F>tay till the next
morning he would render him<U+017F>elf where I
<U+017F>hould appoint to give me the <U+017F>atisfaction
that I de<U+017F>ired. As commonly they who have
an ill payma<U+017F>ter their debtor are content to
be paid with <U+017F>uch money as they can receive,
I con<U+017F>ented to his procra<U+017F>tination and we
concluded upon a place and hour where
and when to meet the following day. Which

he inquired for <hi>Meonimus,</hi> whom I had <U+017F>ent
from home in the morning upon other bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,

my<U+017F>elf of the truth of it, and know
what this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e meant, I took the lacquey
by the collar, and <U+017F>hewing my <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
angry threatned him to make him

hang if he would not quickly tell me why he
was metamorpho<U+017F>t, and for what rea<U+017F>on he
came into the hou<U+017F>e covertly and like a

his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es frozen with feare confe<U+017F>t to me

Duel which he was to perform with me,
and to feigne that it was his owne proper

nothing any more but to make ha<U+017F>te to him.
But <hi>Limonides</hi> arrived at the in<U+017F>tant with

u<U+017F>ed it <U+017F>o ill that I with little difficulty gave
him a wound which let out the be<U+017F>t part of

He having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, the action of the

<U+017F>peak with <hi>Doliban</hi> the Captaine that guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of a de<U+017F>ign that was on foot of taking
away the Prince<U+017F>s, had <U+017F>ent me to impede

for certain, he received me with a great

he had and what order he ob<U+017F>erved for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving
his fair charge and de<U+017F>ired me to
do what I judged in the pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ion
fitting. Accordingly to confirm him in his

<U+017F>entinells to be <U+017F>et at all the avenues of the
place, and concerned my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee that and
<U+017F>everall other things done with as much
zeal as if I had really been affraid of the
rape that I pretended, and with as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
as if I expected it would have been
pre<U+017F>ently attempted. All this while I di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd
nothing to him of the de<U+017F>ire that I had

<U+017F>ettled things for her <U+017F>afety, he of his own

took the offer and went along with him like
one <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>intere<U+017F>ted, and <U+017F>he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me as coldly. When <hi>Doliban</hi> indeed
with longer eulogies of me than either <U+017F>he or
I at that time cared for, told her what rank I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60972:83"/>
held with <hi>Li<U+017F>antus</hi> and upon what errand
I was come from him, <U+017F>he payd me tho<U+017F>e
re<U+017F>pects which in common manners were
due, but yet <U+017F>he in every thing acted her
part <U+017F>o <U+017F>agely that one would have firmely
beleived <U+017F>he had not had the lea<U+017F>t acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

being after a while called away, we quickly
changed the fa<U+017F>hion of your conver<U+017F>e. We

and how <U+017F>weet our pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>toln inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view

of keeping <hi>Doliban</hi> blind and of <U+017F>eeing one
another for the future; we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>t of all
that we could think of pa<U+017F>t, pre<U+017F>ent and to
come that concerned either our good or our
ill, we determined that for prevention of
di<U+017F>covery and to keep of <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion it was
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that as I had come after the <U+017F>un

the mo<U+017F>t emphaticall that her vertue and my

us not from being <U+017F>o wary that when <hi>Doli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
returned to me, he found me exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whither all things were in good order at

from <hi>Lucimon</hi> for fear it <U+017F>hould alarum
him <U+017F>o as to di<U+017F>turb him in the great affairs

not only informed me in what I askt, but

that I <U+017F>taid at <hi>Suchieu</hi> as much liberty with

But the mo<U+017F>t remarkable of the truths

               <p>ALcidor being returned to <hi>Paquin</hi> from
<hi>Canton</hi> where he had <U+017F>ubdued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
of the confederacy, now that the
fires of the civill War were wellnigh all
quenched, had a fire kindled in his brea<U+017F>t
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60972:90"/>
by the beauties of <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> which was of too
much force ea<U+017F>ily to be put out: And yet he
had at fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>idering her known integrity
to her husband no in couragement to hope
that it would <U+017F>ucceed to his <U+017F>atisfaction. But
on a <U+017F>udden as if <U+017F>ome fatality had laboured
to cleere his way, <hi>Certafilan</hi> with his nice and
di<U+017F>temperd palate began to di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>t the vi<U+017F>its
which the more gallant Courtiers made to
his Lady. This folly prevailing with more
and more unruline<U+017F>s in his <U+017F>pirit he at length
never <U+017F>aw any body near her but he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it was to corrupt her ca<U+017F>tity; Nor
though to obey and plea<U+017F>e him (<U+017F>eeing

all the Company which <U+017F>he thought he
might <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, grew he ever the more <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but <U+017F>o interpreted all her actions to his
fan<U+017F>ie that there was not the lea<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>potle<U+017F>s of them with which he found not

he retrenched the u<U+017F>age of tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>pects
which he had been wont to pay her and mo<U+017F>t
unworthily loaded her with abu<U+017F>es which it
was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her long to bear. She
notwith<U+017F>tanding practi<U+017F>ed all the <U+017F>weet
meanes that her di<U+017F>cretion was able to <U+017F>ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t
to her to put him in a better mind; but
in<U+017F>tead of being thereby brought back to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60972:91"/>
rea<U+017F>on he was exa<U+017F>perated higher and grew
more and more in<U+017F>upportable. Her teares
which one would have thought able to melt
cruelty it <U+017F>elf rather increa<U+017F>t than allaied
his rage and her ju<U+017F>t complaints <U+017F>erved to no
better effect than to make him vomit a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
contumelies again<U+017F>t her honor. Nor
were her own indeavors to appea<U+017F>e him
fruitle<U+017F>s only but the Kings al<U+017F>o, who having
knowledge of his madne<U+017F>s u<U+017F>ed what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
he judged requi<U+017F>ite for his cure, but
without effecting it. During this ferall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecution
of <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia, Alcidor</hi> went every day
to <U+017F>ee her without her per<U+017F>ecutor being able
to hinder it, it being in the lodgings of <hi>Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
and in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Polianis</hi> that he
vi<U+017F>ited her; and as often as he <U+017F>aw her he
made her <U+017F>ee that he was as deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in her <U+017F>ufferings as <U+017F>he was her<U+017F>elf.
She again every day drunke in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e

rendred this latter le<U+017F>s and le<U+017F>s and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

proceded to manage time and his actions
<U+017F>o advantageou<U+017F>ly to his purpo<U+017F>e that <U+017F>he no
longer regarded him but as one regards tho<U+017F>e

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60972:91"/>

felt emotions and attempts which <U+017F>he had
never felt before; by which di<U+017F>cerning that
Love was <U+017F>urprizing her heart <U+017F>he imploied
all her <U+017F>trength to defend it, but he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
all made him<U+017F>elf Ma<U+017F>ter of it.
Perceiving her<U+017F>elf conquered, <U+017F>ince thou

Who can with common charity blame thee,

is mo<U+017F>t likely to protect and releeve thee?
who indeed if not <hi>Alcidor</hi> is able to bring
<hi>Certafilan</hi> into order. But, alas, by what
meanes <U+017F>hould he do it? for him to <U+017F>peak
to him in my defence what is it but to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

renders the like to all Ladies, and had he a

               <p>While <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> was di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing thus with

time re<U+017F>olving with him<U+017F>elft to declare to
her his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and con<U+017F>idering that he had
not liberty to do it by word of mouth by
rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Certafilan</hi> had eyes and eares
every where to watch her, he concluded to
make a letter his proxie. Accordingly he
without any farther demurre drew his
thoughts on paper, <U+017F>ealed it up and made
him<U+017F>elf his me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to carry it to her. He
found her in her Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Feonice's</hi> Chamber,
<U+017F>he being newly come in to it, out of her
clo<U+017F>et where <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>ome while <U+017F>hut

up bemoaning her <U+017F>elf, but <hi>Certafilan</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
him in at the heels, and when they
could have wi<U+017F>ht him in the remote<U+017F>t part of
the world debarred them by his Company
from having any particular <U+017F>ociety. He kept
his eyes <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trict <U+017F>entinells upon them both
that they could hardly <U+017F>teal a few glances
one of another, much le<U+017F>s could they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one another as they de<U+017F>ired. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while as if on purpo<U+017F>e to dre<U+017F>s a party
again<U+017F>t him, <hi>Feonice</hi> <U+017F>et upon him with <U+017F>o

Si<U+017F>ter, that he could intend nothing but how
to defend him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t her. Ob<U+017F>erving
which opportunity <hi>Alcidor</hi> offerd his letter
to the hand of <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia,</hi> and <U+017F>he civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it <U+017F>lipt it into her pocket. <hi>Feonice</hi>
<U+017F>till held <hi>Certafilan</hi> to task with her remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trances
of his fault, and <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>t
in them and thought them <U+017F>o equitable that,
though <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> made frequent <U+017F>ignes to her to
de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he would not be taken off till the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
having <U+017F>pent all the weak excu<U+017F>es
which he could forge, <U+017F>aid nothing more but
what made her hope he intended to be better
for the future, though as it afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
he at the <U+017F>ame time re<U+017F>olved to be
wor<U+017F>e, with a very <U+017F>killfull di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation
laying a con<U+017F>traint upon his humor to hide
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60972:93"/>
his de<U+017F>ign. Hardly had <hi>Feonice</hi> <U+017F>at down from
her action but <hi>Polianis</hi> came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
whereupon <hi>Certafilan</hi> fearing a <U+017F>evere
reprehen<U+017F>ion from him al<U+017F>o made ha<U+017F>t away,
nor was he <U+017F>topt by the King who had at that
time other thoughts in his mind. <hi>Certafilan</hi>
gone, his Lady pretending her<U+017F>elf not well
withdrew into her Chamber; <hi>Alcidor</hi> offerd
to lead her, but <U+017F>he civilly refu<U+017F>ed it, and he
pre<U+017F>t it not gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>he went to read what
he had given her. And he gue<U+017F>t right; for

in a gaine<U+017F>s of temper which gave

he <U+017F>hewed to <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> as kind regards as

If you are certaine of <hi>Alcidors</hi> affection,
replied <hi>Feonice,</hi> you need not be affraid of
<hi>Certafilans</hi> cruelty: but what evidences have
you of it and <U+017F>ince when was it born? <U+017F>ee
the te<U+017F>timonies, returned <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia,</hi> giving

as to your love of him a woman barbarou<U+017F>ly
handled as you have been by one bound to
u<U+017F>e you with all imaginable <U+017F>weetene<U+017F>s as is
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> cannot be blamed for <U+017F>eeking are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge

though it be a mo<U+017F>t reproacheable bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to deceive a good husband, it is, if an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
a very pardonable one, to free ones

You are come, Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Feonice</hi> to him,

is there requi<U+017F>ite to be done, Madam,
for this Lady whom I <U+017F>ee wholly <U+017F>eized
with the apprehen<U+017F>ion which <U+017F>he hath of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

<hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, bound to <U+017F>uccor tho<U+017F>e whom
we know not, as we without que<U+017F>tion are,
it is a farr greater tye which I have upon me
to do all that lies in my power for you who
are the <U+017F>oul of my <U+017F>oul, and if I think not
too fondly of my<U+017F>elf, that zeal which I have
for your <U+017F>ecurity will, when you have told
me what you judge <U+017F>itting to be done for it,
impower me to do it <U+017F>o happyly that I make

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60972:100"/>
arts of War, who hath been u<U+017F>ed to break
<U+017F>quadrons and force Towns, who found out
plenty of <U+017F>tratagems to <U+017F>upport the league,
cannot <U+017F>urely want an expedient to deliver
<hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> from <hi>Certafilan.</hi> I depended upon
your contrivance as well as execution. Say
therefore what cour<U+017F>e you judge in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
convenient to be<U+017F>teered. Only fir<U+017F>t,
adjoined <U+017F>he, giving him the letter of <hi>Floras,</hi>
reade the information which hath been <U+017F>ent
me of my condition. <hi>Alcidor</hi> having read the
letter a con<U+017F>ulation was held, of which the
re<U+017F>ult was that <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi> <U+017F>hould put her<U+017F>elf in a
pages habit that <U+017F>o, as <hi>Alcidor</hi> told her, <U+017F>he
who was worthy to command the greate<U+017F>t
Kings of the earth might in that garbe of <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
avoide the danger of being known,
and under that di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, the covert of the
night and <hi>Alcidors</hi> conduct retire to a
freinds hou<U+017F>e, there to lye hid till the
King having notice of what was intended
again<U+017F>t her <U+017F>hould, as they made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion
but he would, take order for her <U+017F>afety.
Accordingly <hi>Alcidor</hi> pre<U+017F>enting to her a
page's habit which he had for the purpo<U+017F>e
brought with him, <U+017F>he dre<U+017F>t her<U+017F>elf in it, and
in this dre<U+017F>s her beauty was <U+017F>o far from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
any of its power that love who perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the cheif part in this act took advantage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60972:100"/>
by it to <U+017F>trike the Cavaleir anew, and he
<U+017F>trucke him with <U+017F>o much force that he <U+017F>tood
gazing upon her without being able to <U+017F>peak
a word. <hi>Feonice</hi> taking notice of it, if he from
whom you are to defend my Si<U+017F>ter meets
you, Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, and you turn
as voide of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e then as you appear now<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I
may lay any wager that <U+017F>he is lo<U+017F>t and am
<U+017F>ure to winne. But a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h your <U+017F>elf no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <U+017F>ee her unhappine<U+017F>s compell her thus
to habit her <U+017F>elf. If you was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking,
Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to her
that which Love makes me take notice of in
this faire Queene of his Empire you would
have your <U+017F>peech and judgment left you
as little it may be as I have had. <hi>Certafilan</hi>
him<U+017F>elf could not with all the hard and
feirce thoughts that he hath for her con<U+017F>ider
her in this po<U+017F>ture but he would have <U+017F>ome
mild and tender ones mixt with them. This
is but to trifle and make <U+017F>port with my mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ery,
and we have at pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e

<hi>Alcidor</hi> to take them of from that <U+017F>ad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e
obliged them to bid one another fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,

<hi>Alcidor</hi> al<U+017F>o made much of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

<hi>Floras,</hi> requires no more of me than what
truth, common equity and my own credit
render my duty, and what I am therefore

pre<U+017F>ent was by your order to carry away, to
make her mi<U+017F>erable all her life. I would

<hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid the King, in what you <U+017F>ay:
It is indeed nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary both that he <U+017F>hould
undergo pennance for what he hath done,
and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>atisfaction for
what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ufferd. He <U+017F>hall not therefore
come near her till he hath appea<U+017F>ed her. But
that he may have no occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>peaking or
thinking ill of her ab<U+017F>ence and that all Kings
may go according to decency, I would have
her leave the place where <U+017F>he is, and put
her<U+017F>elf with the Religious of whom your
Kin<U+017F>woman is the <U+017F>uperiour.</p>
               <p>The King, who though he had a <U+017F>harp
ingeny to peirce into the my<U+017F>teries of love
perceived nothing of <hi>Alcidor</hi>'s towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia,</hi>
having thus concluded with him about
the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing of her as if he had had a mind
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60972:107"/>
to furni<U+017F>h him with meanes of <U+017F>eeing her
without exception. Her husband coming to
him, your Maje<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>aid he, I hope que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions
not my re<U+017F>olution of relap<U+017F>ing no more
into my old di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; permit me therefore I
be<U+017F>eech you to have before my eyes her
whom I have mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>tly tormented but
without whom I cannot now live but in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
my<U+017F>elf. Con<U+017F>idering the animo<U+017F>ities
which you have rai<U+017F>ed in her, returned the
King to him, and the condition into which
you have driven her, it would be plain
folly to imagin that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be ea<U+017F>ily
bent and retrived to your will. She is not
retired from the world to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o <U+017F>oon again with men, e<U+017F>pecially
with him who hath given her <U+017F>uch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting him as you have done.
My Coun<U+017F>ell therefore to you is that <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her to live with her regret for a time
among that vertuous troop whither <U+017F>he
hath withdrawn her<U+017F>elf you let her know
your repentance by letters, and by promi<U+017F>ing
her a u<U+017F>age to come as kind as what is pa<U+017F>t
hath been har<U+017F>h, you endeavor to make her
lo<U+017F>e that grudge with which her <U+017F>tomach
boiles again<U+017F>t you. This I beleive to be the
be<U+017F>t expedient that you can u<U+017F>e to re<U+017F>tore
you with her, and I will withall de<U+017F>ire <hi>Feonice</hi>

as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he returnes to advance your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation

I mu<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ently have her company, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> is an infelicity which I
know not how to undergo; but I <U+017F>hall, all
that I am able, inforce my<U+017F>elf to be patient
under it, knowing my<U+017F>elf to be the cau<U+017F>e
of it, and I will draw from my afflicted
heart the mo<U+017F>t moving and effectuall lines
that I can to procure my peace with her. I
would have no other but <hi>Floras</hi> deliver them
to her, <U+017F>aid the King, for the <U+017F>ight of him
will I beleive be very acceptable to her,
<U+017F>ince it was by his means that <U+017F>he knew and

ab<U+017F>olutely convinced him that for her to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent

more than what <U+017F>he owed to her innocence

had driven her away from him to force her
to returne to him before <U+017F>he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,

there is nothing in the world be<U+017F>ides your

he that I was born and that I am to live:
my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for you is not of the number of

her with what <U+017F>he had been entertaining

The Lovers endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

out of all danger from the Law. At this

that <hi>Polianis</hi> had a better opinion of him
than to be quickly imprinted with a bad one
or indeed to deny him any thing that he <U+017F>hould
ask, but <hi>Dorame</hi> was very much troubled, and
choo<U+017F>ing rather to deprive her<U+017F>elf of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in his company for a time than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with her when his <U+017F>tay might be
di<U+017F>advantageous to him, conjured him with
all <U+017F>peed to make a journey to <hi>Paquin</hi> to the

to the world, where al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o <U+017F>traightly
guarded that nobody can have her Company
but the Prince whom I now <U+017F>pake of. I am
not ignorant of the Love which <U+017F>he hath had
for you, her brother having recounted to me
that which he knew of it by their Uncle, who
hath many times had purpo<U+017F>es of <U+017F>ending you
out of the world upon that occa<U+017F>ion. But
<U+017F>he now gives hopes that <U+017F>he will entertain
that new Lover, and not only <hi>Dorilas</hi> wi<U+017F>hes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60972:114"/>
you as well as you can de<U+017F>ire, but <hi>Lucimon</hi>
al<U+017F>o is di<U+017F>armed of the choler which he hath
had again<U+017F>t you, knowing that the offence
which he beleived you to have committed
proceeded not from you but from his neice.
The<U+017F>e two Princes I have made your freinds,
and I would have you as <U+017F>oon as you can
joine myrtles to your laurells <U+017F>o that <hi>Hymen</hi>
as well as <hi>Mars</hi> may render your life glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
The many powerfull rea<U+017F>ons, Sir,
replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> which I had to hold <hi>A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia</hi>
in e<U+017F>teem while he lived render it impo<U+017F>ible
for me not be troubled for her death. If <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>a</hi>
is loved by <hi>Eridan</hi> and acknowledges
the merit of that Prince of your blood, the
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s will be far more advantageous to
her than if <U+017F>he had nouri<U+017F>ht an affection for
one <U+017F>o unworthy of her as my<U+017F>elf. For <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia</hi>
I reckon that <U+017F>he could not have beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her<U+017F>elf to an abode more convenient to
regret the lo<U+017F>s of her deare <hi>Clidantus</hi> than
that which <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>o <U+017F>agely cho<U+017F>en. And
for my own particular I have abundant obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to your Maje<U+017F>ty for the acts of Grace
which your Clemency hath granted me,
without that by an exce<U+017F>s of favor you <U+017F>hould
procure me the good will of two Princes
who<U+017F>e ill will I have allwayes been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ive

the means of provoking. If the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>a</hi>
hath done me the honor of te<U+017F>tifying
<U+017F>ome kindne<U+017F>s to me, I never have abu<U+017F>ed

to things contrary to rea<U+017F>on and my duty:
and if for having before them quitted the

the <U+017F>ame obedience that made me acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>ubject them<U+017F>elves to the
Laws of your Maje<U+017F>ty as well as to tho<U+017F>e of

and with the <U+017F>ervices that you have done me
<U+017F>ince you have re<U+017F>tored your <U+017F>elf to your

is dead, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> pur<U+017F>ued he, and my
regret for his death <U+017F>ufficiently declares
what e<U+017F>teem I have for men of courage. At

               </gap>ot hinder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
from letting fall <U+017F>ome teares, nor could
the King forbear having <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tand in his
eyes, and farther was the memory of the
lo<U+017F>s of that great captain about to carry
them into melancholy, when <hi>Lucimon</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60972:115"/>
               <hi>Dorilas</hi> came in to them and di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>t it. See
the generous <hi>Alcidor,</hi> my Cozens, <U+017F>aid the
King to them pre<U+017F>ently, love him for the
<U+017F>ake of his valor, and for love of me; there
are few of his fa<U+017F>hion to be found in the
world: we were ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>peaking of you.
The King thus acco<U+017F>ting them and <hi>Alcidor</hi>
very civilly addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to them, they
both imbraced him and acknowledging his

            <p>Come thither he wrot to <hi>Dorame</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

and <hi>Carmelia.</hi> The conclu<U+017F>ion of his
Letter was an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of the King's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of their marriage and of his own

            <p>About three dayes after <hi>Alcidor</hi> being
with the King newes was brought him
that the forces of <hi>Atalantus</hi> had taken <hi>Thiau</hi>
by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault and <hi>Senoy</hi> by compo<U+017F>ition, and
made very ill work in the province of <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
Hereupon he with all <U+017F>peed called an

a<U+017F><U+017F>embly in forme of the e<U+017F>tates and cau<U+017F>ed
to be levied a potent army with which to
put a <U+017F>top to the progre<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But while preparations were in hand
again<U+017F>t them, what by the imprudent will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullne<U+017F>s
of the inhabitants who would not
receive any <U+017F>ouldiers in garri<U+017F>on, and what

                  </gap>io</hi> in open day. Thither for the
recovery of it the King determining within
two or three dayes to march, he told <hi>Alcidor</hi>
that notwith<U+017F>tanding his affairs of love he
mu<U+017F>t go along with him his Feild-Mar<U+017F>hall;
but withall that he might go fir<U+017F>t and wait
upon his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s for a few houres. Which
liberty he u<U+017F>ed with a diligence which carried
him quickly to her, if the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of him
in<U+017F>pired her with joy, he quickly changed it
into affliction, by telling her what a <U+017F>hort
limit of time he had to <U+017F>tay with her, and
what imployment the King had ingaged him
in which renderd it <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort. Hearing this, to
go to this <U+017F>eige, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with a face full of
trouble, is to go to be killed rather than to
fight; I cannot therefore, added <U+017F>he, but
be very much di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with your going.
But <U+017F>etting before her eyes the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and the forfeiture which he <U+017F>hould
make of his favor by not obeying it, then the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60972:116"/>
glory of the imployment and the irreparable
damage which he <U+017F>hould contract to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
by refu<U+017F>ing it, per<U+017F>wading her al<U+017F>o that
there was not <U+017F>o much danger in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as <U+017F>he imagined and that in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
he <U+017F>hould not be long before he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he in a good mea<U+017F>ure le<U+017F><U+017F>ened her di<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
What remained after this of
the three houres which he told her he had to
<U+017F>pend with her they made much of in prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting
to one another inviolable affections,
and in giving and receiving care<U+017F><U+017F>es of which
the harmle<U+017F>s fervor and <U+017F>weeten<U+017F>s made it
pitty they <U+017F>hould be quickly broken of: But

            <p>No <U+017F>ooner was <hi>Alcidor</hi> returned to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
but he parted from it, the King the next

not indeed <U+017F>trength enough to keep his men
from being at length beaten back; but he
quickly returned with them to a <U+017F>econd

            <p>They thus wearing out the year of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood,
<hi>Alcidor</hi> the next day took hor<U+017F>e

of a <U+017F>uperbe Court with the vi<U+017F>its which
per<U+017F>ons of Grandeur made him, and with the
noble receptions which he gave them. He
had here indeed abundantly enough of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
<U+017F>hewd him, and good company enough
came in to him and was likely to do <U+017F>o, to
have tempted him to <U+017F>tay longer, but love
called him away, and he took the road to
<hi>Dorame,</hi> having fir<U+017F>t intreated her and his
friends to be the eighth day after at her hou<U+017F>e
to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t at their hymenean rites.</p>
            <p>The day come and tho<U+017F>e that were invited

pair of Lovers were joined together with
ceremonies of exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>tate; there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing of the day which did not make

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60972:118"/>
faire<U+017F>t thing of all was the delivering up of
<hi>Dorame</hi> into the hands of <hi>Alcidor</hi> by Ladies
who<U+017F>e beauty de<U+017F>erved, they <U+017F>hould have
been lookt upon as <U+017F>o many Suns, but that
it was ob<U+017F>cured by that of the Bride.</p>
            <p>What pa<U+017F>t in the night between this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
couple is a my<U+017F>tery, which to divulge
would be to profane; but they appeared
the next morning like <U+017F>uch who had been
drinking to and pledging one another in
tho<U+017F>e delights which are the prize, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
the food of love. Their humor had
nothing in it, but <U+017F>erenity; the Company
therefore had nothing in it, but mirth; and to
nouri<U+017F>h it to the highe<U+017F>t, improvement
was made of all the recreations of body and
<U+017F>pirit that were gentile and opportune. This
continued eight dayes together, after which
(there being a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that <U+017F>uch fe<U+017F>tivities
<U+017F>hould have an end, as well as a beginning)
the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly di<U+017F><U+017F>olved and left <hi>Alcidor</hi>
and <hi>Dorame</hi> to enjoy them<U+017F>elves by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>But it was not long before <hi>Alcidor</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Dorame</hi> to his principall Hou<U+017F>e and there
in<U+017F>talling her ab<U+017F>olute Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his e<U+017F>tare,
as he had done before of his heart they kept
a kind of <U+017F>econd wedding: Company flowed
in from all the neigbourhood to wi<U+017F>h them
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60972:119"/>
joy and pay them honor, and all the time
of their <U+017F>tay was <U+017F>pent in little el<U+017F>e but in
Fea<U+017F>ts, Balls, and receiving and making
Vi<U+017F>its.</p>
            <p>There now wanted nothign to complete
<hi>Alcidor</hi>'s ovation, but that his Sun <U+017F>hould
di<U+017F>play her beams in the horizon of the
Court. Thither therefore they went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an equipage which made all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
admire it's <U+017F>plendor, as much occu<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as it was, to <U+017F>ee great things. <hi>Dorame</hi>
was <U+017F>o radiant and her retinue <U+017F>o bright,
that hardly could there have been imagined a
train perfectly a<U+017F><U+017F>orted to hers, had not
<hi>Alcidor</hi> marched with the <U+017F>ame air. He
indeed in this notable occa<U+017F>ion omitted none
of tho<U+017F>e brave things which had been born
with him, and which he had all his life pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed.</p>
            <p>Pre<U+017F>enting them<U+017F>elves to the King, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
them with demon<U+017F>trations of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
favor and contentment in <U+017F>eeing
them: Staying about half an houre in his
pre<U+017F>ence, the mo<U+017F>t gallant of the Court were
all the while gazing upon them with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
admirations: Going away, <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
who at the in<U+017F>tant came in detained
them a while with an acco<U+017F>tage made up of
civility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60972:119"/>
               <hi>Dorame</hi> indeed while her husband <hi>Cli<U+017F>idas</hi>
lived was e<U+017F>teemed one of the faire<U+017F>t and
mo<U+017F>t charming Ladies of the Court; but
they who knew her then, and con<U+017F>iderd her
now, and compared what <U+017F>he was then, with
what <U+017F>he was now, proclaimed her beauty &amp;
attractions doubled. In augmentation of
this glory <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered it not to make her
vainly conceited, but the more <U+017F>he was
extolled, the more humbly <U+017F>he demean'd
her<U+017F>elf: Every wayes were both <U+017F>he and
<hi>Alcidor</hi> of <U+017F>uch a frame as made them happy
in one another. Never was corre<U+017F>pondence
more perfect, than theirs, never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<U+017F>weeter; but this latter la<U+017F>ted not
long. <hi>Dorame</hi> after <U+017F>ix moons growing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
with Child had by that means <U+017F>o much
indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>eldome to be <U+017F>een
out of her bed, and <hi>Alcidor</hi> had <U+017F>o deep a
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e of it that he was <U+017F>eldome to be <U+017F>een
out of a dark humor: her illne<U+017F><U+017F>es increa<U+017F>t
and therewith his greifs <U+017F>welled high. And
yet amid<U+017F>t his <U+017F>wollen greifs he would have
reckoned him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort happy; if he
might <U+017F>till have injoyed her; but to make
him the mo<U+017F>t afflicted man in the world <U+017F>he
was by the ravenous hand of death taken
away from him; <U+017F>he died in Child-bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with her Child of which <U+017F>he could
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60972:120"/>
not be delivered. Before <U+017F>he expired, I <U+017F>ee,
my <hi>Alcidor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, I mu<U+017F>t go from
you; it is the will of fate, and that is not to
be oppo<U+017F>ed by our wills. I know the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
that you have for me, will render my
death bitter to you; but let it be with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
that you afflict your<U+017F>elf for it. I have
done, my dear <hi>Alcidor,</hi> added <U+017F>he, I leave
you, Adieu. Saying <U+017F>o and imbracing him
<U+017F>he breathed out her <U+017F>oul upon his lips. At
the in<U+017F>tant he grew as void of motion, as if he
had been as much without <U+017F>entiment, as the
dead body, he <U+017F>ent not a <U+017F>igh after her, he
made no kind of complaint, he was indeed
wholly <U+017F>tupefied with extremity of greif:
But after a while coming to him<U+017F>elf, he by all
the great kinds of lamentation characterized
him<U+017F>elf a mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>t man, there is nothing
of <U+017F>erious and ma<U+017F>culine <U+017F>orrow which was
not to be <U+017F>een in him, and he wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him<U+017F>elf to be governed by it. Oh
Heavens, cried he, what a trea<U+017F>ury of beauty
and virtue you have de<U+017F>poiled me of! why
did you make her <U+017F>o fair, <U+017F>o good, to take her
<U+017F>o overha<U+017F>tily away? why did you make me
a little while happy in injoyning her, to
render me altogether mi<U+017F>erable in being
without her for the re<U+017F>t of my dayes?
Oh the forces of adver<U+017F>ity which I have
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60972:120"/>
to conflict with but know not how to <U+017F>tand
again<U+017F>t!</p>
            <p>If the nuptialls of <hi>Dorame</hi> were eximiou<U+017F>ly
remarkable with their refulgent and joyous,
<U+017F>o were her funeralls with their <U+017F>able and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubrious
pomp; the King contributed to it
his part, all the Court a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted at it, there
was nothing mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing in it, which might <U+017F>erve,
either for the honor of the dead, who<U+017F>e qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

or for a te<U+017F>timony of the di<U+017F>con<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Widower's love and greif which were
both extreme. He had indeed <U+017F>o much love
for her, that he had none for life; Now that
<U+017F>he was no longer living, he would gladly
have been laid in the grave with her: he
had al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o much greif for the lo<U+017F>s of her
that all mention of comfort was a new way
of afflicting him, that all vi<U+017F>its were
trouble<U+017F>ome to him, and that all endeavors
to appea<U+017F>e his <U+017F>orrow proved ineffectuall,
tho<U+017F>e of his other freinds who practi<U+017F>ed all

            <p>While <hi>Alcidor</hi> was <U+017F>pending dayes and

he could have no heirs to his Crown

<U+017F>he was one of the highe<U+017F>t born Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es of
<hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> and her beauty and ingeny ran parallell

re<U+017F>olution, than what di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed her to con<U+017F>ent
to it. This notable <U+017F>eparation was no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

they all <U+017F>ought that <hi>Augu<U+017F>t</hi> mans alliance;

<U+017F>o much as that of the Prince<U+017F>s Partenice, and
with her he tran<U+017F>lated and accompli<U+017F>ht a

and of mo<U+017F>t benigne influence making

taking the opportunity improved it to cleer

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60972:122"/>
which he had given extraordinary remarkes
of his valour, <U+017F>hould remain allwayes a
widower; after he had been a good time <U+017F>o,
he <U+017F>aw at a ball a Lady from falling in love
with whom he was not able with all his
<U+017F>trength to defend him<U+017F>elf. Her habit told
him <U+017F>he was a Widow and upon enquiry
he learnt that <U+017F>he was Widow to <hi>Palemon</hi>
who took Prince <hi>Meander</hi> pri<U+017F>oner in battle,
that <U+017F>he was i<U+017F><U+017F>ued of one of the mo<U+017F>t an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
hou<U+017F>es of the Kingdome and that <U+017F>he
was Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of a mo<U+017F>t plentiful fortune.
This he liked very well, but that which
captivated him and made his heart hers was
that her face exactly re<U+017F>embled <hi>Dorame</hi>'s,
that the eyes, the <U+017F>hape, the features, the
aire of the one, were the eyes, the <U+017F>hape,
the features, the aire of the other. His pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
for her ri<U+017F>ing from this <U+017F>pring grew to a
large, deep, and rapid <U+017F>tream, when by
getting acquaintance with her, he found <U+017F>he
was like <hi>Dorame</hi> not in body only, but in
mind al<U+017F>o, that the wit and virtues of the
one, were the wit and vertues of the other.
Thinking therefore that as often as he <U+017F>aw
<hi>Florinda</hi> he <U+017F>aw <hi>Dorame</hi> and beleiving that
after <hi>Dorame,</hi> he could not find <U+017F>o meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<U+017F>taied not long before he addre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf to

her in the quality of a lover, and what with
the King's Favouring of his Suite, what with
her friends and particularly the di<U+017F>creet <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida</hi>
her Si<U+017F>ter telling her, that to make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
happy <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t take him for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
what with the affectionate ob<U+017F>ervances
which he u<U+017F>ed towards her, what with the
unmatchable accompli<U+017F>hments which <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw in him, <U+017F>he was wonne to admit him in
that quality, after <U+017F>he had driven to de<U+017F>pair
with her coldne<U+017F>s many gallant per<U+017F>ons who
ambitioned the title of her <U+017F>ervant, and not
only <U+017F>o, but to love him al<U+017F>o as much as
ever did <hi>Flori<U+017F>a; A<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ia, Carmelia</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame.</hi>
Cupid indeed had no rea<U+017F>on to be
le<U+017F>s favourable to him, than <hi>Mars,</hi> for he
had <U+017F>acrificed upon the Altars of the one, as
well as of the other, and that with equal
devotion.</p>
            <p>During the tran<U+017F>action of the<U+017F>e amours as
<hi>Alcidor</hi> was one day returning from the

his Second in a combate which was that
hour a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him, telling him who he was
(and he was <hi>Periander</hi>) and who were of
the other part, and what was the ground of
the Quarrel that he without any farther ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
went along with him. Fighting they

they contented them<U+017F>elves with the elogies
that were given them under the <U+017F>afe names
of Incognitoes without being <U+017F>o imprudently
vain, as to chalenge the intere<U+017F>t which they
had in them. But <hi>Lo<U+017F>ivel</hi> whom they left
for dead upon the Feild, being enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their per<U+017F>ons, as well as too
much, with their valours, before he died
made report of both. Herewith all the
Court pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ounded, and it was not
long before it came to <hi>Florinda.</hi> So <U+017F>he gave
her lover to under<U+017F>tand by the <U+017F>evere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
with which he entertained him the
next time that he <U+017F>aw him: but the excu<U+017F>es
which he made for what he had done, and

to which the King led his forces.</p>
            <p>About this time as <hi>Alcidor</hi> was coming
all alone from a covent of Religious, whither
he would have no body accompany him in
regard he had bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ecrecy as well as
importance with one of the Covent, there
met him two Gentlemen of the Regiment
of the Kings Guards, who acco<U+017F>ted him
with complaints of an injury which they
had received and which they could not poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
up, and he very civilly asking them what
was the name of him, who had offended
him and what the offence, it is your<U+017F>elf,
Sir, <U+017F>aid one of them, letting him <U+017F>ee that he
knew him, who have abu<U+017F>ed us, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
up of <hi>Ancheou,</hi> when we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your order have gone into the Town,
<U+017F>trikeing us with the flat of your Sword.
Would you then, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> have <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for this? Though, added he, I
might u<U+017F>e my eminent charge in armes for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60972:130"/>
my di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation, I am neverthele<U+017F>s ready to
give it you, only let the one off you draw of
while I have to do with the other. With
tho<U+017F>e words taking to task the forwarde<U+017F>t
of them he in a minute had wounded him in
the thigh and di<U+017F>armed him. After which
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the next way to the other, he found
him ready in <U+017F>tead of fighting to aske pardon
and he freely gave it him. The King after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
coming to know the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Souldiers to be puni<U+017F>ht; he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly
procured both their pardons of him.
But he withall incurred him<U+017F>elf the cen<U+017F>ure
of the other Field-Mar<U+017F>halls who told him,
that they would not follow his example in
<U+017F>atisfying every one that took things ill from
them: To which, you may do as you <U+017F>ee
good, replied he, but it is a humor which I
by narure have, and which I know not how
to leave off, never to refu<U+017F>e the combate
when it is demanded of me. Not that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
my<U+017F>elf from being reproveable for it,
or that I <U+017F>hall not endeavor to moderate it
by the directions of rea<U+017F>on. Acting <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Arpa<U+017F>ax</hi> to him, and not hazarding your life,
which is of con<U+017F>equence and ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care of, upon occa<U+017F>ions of frivolous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you will be <U+017F>o far from impairing your
glory that you will increa<U+017F>e it. If you mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60972:130"/>
die by the Sword, it ought to be at the head
of an army and in the <U+017F>ervice of your King
who values you more than all his Captains
be<U+017F>ides. I <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>ent to what you <U+017F>ay,
returned <hi>Alcidor</hi> to him, was I owner of
your fortitude and other worths; but <U+017F>ince
I well know to what degree I am to be con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
pardon me, if I tell you that I place
your Elogy of me in the range of flattery.
Truth de<U+017F>erves not to be <U+017F>o <U+017F>tiled, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>ax</hi>
again, and you would very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
your judgment <U+017F>hould you not own the
difference between the one and the other.
But to make you acknowledge for true that
which I have <U+017F>aid concerning the account
in which his Maje<U+017F>ty holds you, I need only
put you in mind of the choice which he hath
made of you, ab<U+017F>olutely and in quality of
Generall to command his armyes, and of
the many meritorious and inclitous actions
which you have atchieved in War, as in
your element. You handle me with too
much quickne<U+017F>s, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to him,
and I <U+017F>hall choo<U+017F>e rather not to deny what

the arms of the be<U+017F>iegers, and greater by
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s and famine, <U+017F>o that the Town made
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60972:137"/>
ha<U+017F>t to be de<U+017F>ert of inhabitants, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>itated
to beg the Kings mercy, and
what they nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily begged, he freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.
Having ma<U+017F>tered this City, which
three Kings his predece<U+017F><U+017F>ours could not do,
and re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>ht there the old Religion of
<hi>China,</hi> he returned in triumph to <hi>Paquin;</hi> and
thither <hi>Alcidor</hi> waited upon him, and then
applied him<U+017F>elf to perform the <U+017F>upreme
honours to <hi>Florinda.</hi> When he came to <U+017F>ee
her body in the Coffin, he was wholly po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>t
with greif, and his <U+017F>entiments were
more equitable, than to be blamed: but his
rea<U+017F>on after a while making good its empire
and tempering his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, his Cheif care
was taken up about her funerals, and he laid
her in the grave with a State in which
Mourning was renderd full of Maje<U+017F>ty.</p>
            <p>While the King continued at <hi>Paquin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
was always about him, and new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions
calling him abroad, he and his Sons
attended him. They were of his Cheife a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tants
when he forced his way through the
barricades and other ob<U+017F>tacles that <U+017F>hut it
up, and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated tho<U+017F>e that oppo<U+017F>ed it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
<hi>Baiador</hi> that was <U+017F>traightly be<U+017F>eiged
upon the Prince <hi>Nime<U+017F>is,</hi> and con<U+017F>trained <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus</hi>
who had cau<U+017F>ed this trouble to <U+017F>ue to
him for peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:60972:137"/>
Affairs being quieted on that <U+017F>ide, <hi>Ari<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
left <hi>Clomedon</hi> there with <U+017F>ufficient forces
to maintain the quiet, and pa<U+017F>t into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Quiechen</hi> in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Fili<U+017F>tin</hi> who
with great numbers of men ravaged the
Countrey; but though this Prince was the
grand Cheife of the di<U+017F>obedient party, and
had the boldne<U+017F>s to counter-act the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he dur<U+017F>t no where appear before
him. In this expedition <hi>Tocichu</hi> was begirt by
the King, taken by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault and put all in
blood. At this <U+017F>eige <hi>Dolompus</hi> was wounded
with a Mu<U+017F>quet-<U+017F>hot in the head together
with other little hurts, while his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had better fortune, though he continually
engaged him<U+017F>elf in mo<U+017F>t hazardous <U+017F>ervices.</p>
            <p>Taking warning by <hi>Tocichu, Hilani</hi> opened
its gates to the King: <hi>Hilani</hi> leading the
way <U+017F>everal other Townes returned to their
allegiance, <hi>Fili<U+017F>tin</hi> giving them the <U+017F>alutary
coun<U+017F>el to do <U+017F>o, who him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o recounted
his di<U+017F>loialty and obtained pardon of the
King both for him<U+017F>elf, and all the party of
which he had been head and protector.
Things being brought to this i<U+017F><U+017F>ue, the King
returned to <hi>Paquin,</hi> leaving the great Ore<U+017F>tes
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> to receive the Townes to the
obedience that they owed him and to cau<U+017F>e
their fortifications to be razed: and they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60972:138"/>
were not long before they were again with
him with an account of their negotiation
which perfectly <U+017F>atisfied him.</p>
            <p>Envious of the Univer<U+017F>al peace which
<hi>China</hi> now enjoyed, and re<U+017F>olved as it
<U+017F>eems to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf, what he was reputed
to be, the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>tant Prince in the
World <hi>Alcippus</hi> performed nothing of what
he had promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> when he made
peace with him, but by fre<U+017F>h and tho<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ufferable
provocations obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commence
War. <hi>Ore<U+017F>tes</hi> pa<U+017F>t the mountains
with fourty thou<U+017F>and men, took <hi>Chaquoam</hi>
in the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Alca<U+017F>tus</hi> and put that flitting
prince in <U+017F>uch a fright that he <U+017F>taied no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
before he repented of what he had done.
<hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>equele marched
with a great army into <hi>Camboia; Alcidor</hi>
who was Field-mar<U+017F>hall of it led the Van
when they entred the Countrey and finding
Prince <hi>Eu<U+017F>ebes</hi> retiring with his Army was
earne<U+017F>t to have bid them battle: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever
clear day he <U+017F>aw of utterly defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and what<U+017F>oever a<U+017F><U+017F>urance he gave
the King of it, he could not get his con<U+017F>ent
that he might fall on, he would re<U+017F>erve, he
<U+017F>aid, his forces to make him<U+017F>elf Ma<U+017F>ter of
all the places of <U+017F>trength in <hi>Camboia,</hi> and to
out their Prince in his Shirt. But it could not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60972:138"/>
well be that the two Armies <U+017F>hould meet
without <U+017F>triking a blow, <hi>Alcidor</hi> moved the
Quarel, prefaced with <U+017F>ome skirmi<U+017F>hes,
made a loo<U+017F>e, broke into the mid<U+017F>t of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<U+017F>trawed the ground with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of their bodies and retreated gloriou<U+017F>ly,
the King approving the exploit though not
agreeing to the attempt. At length the whole
conduct of the Army in <hi>Camboia</hi> was left to
him, and he be<U+017F>eiged Townes and took them
by the mea<U+017F>ure of quickly bringing under the
whole State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daiador</hi> in the mean time the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
place of its Countrey was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly
be<U+017F>eiged by the <hi>Indians</hi> who re<U+017F>olved
to take it or dye, if they were not hindered
by a greater <U+017F>trength, than theirs, and in all
appearance they had not long to <U+017F>tay to be
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t of it, <U+017F>o low had they brought it.
Thither therefore <hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> with all <U+017F>peed
cau<U+017F>ed thirty thou<U+017F>and men to advance under
three of his mo<U+017F>t experienced Captains,
and they with Sword in one hand and Pi<U+017F>tol
in the other bravely <U+017F>et it at liberty. Never
received <hi>Alca<U+017F>tus</hi> <U+017F>uch an affront, and he was
the more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it becau<U+017F>e he received it
in his native Countrey. To <U+017F>ee indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
and his army proudly triumpht over by
the <hi>Chinoi<U+017F>es</hi> while they forced them di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60972:139"/>
to di<U+017F>lodge from before the Town
about which they lay encampt waiting only
the hour in which according to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
that was made, they were to enter; It
was a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure which he was <U+017F>o far from
being able to dige<U+017F>t that he endured not to
<U+017F>urvive it, but within a few dayes after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
off the World. <hi>Bajador</hi> releived the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
King, and the Potentates that <U+017F>ided with
him were con<U+017F>traind to make a peace with
<hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> upon conditions advantageous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to him to declare him Victour in the
War. The Ca<U+017F>tles, Townes, places which
upon the<U+017F>e conditions he delivered back to
<hi>Alcippus</hi> were all monuments of <hi>Alcidors</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that had conquerd them. Indeed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the enemy in their own Countrey and
vanqui<U+017F>h them, to inviron Townes and take
them, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ault Places and win them, by
all the methods of valour to render for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
the arms of the ju<U+017F>t <hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> were
his ordinary exerci<U+017F>es (both at other times
and) while he had the care of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
<hi>Alcippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the labours of this extraordinary man
mu<U+017F>t have an end; they are glorious enough
for him, they have dre<U+017F>t his name with
flowers of honour which will never wither,
the grand Cheifes of the World di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60972:139"/>
of him with elogies of prai<U+017F>e which po<U+017F>terity
will with publicke voice tran<U+017F>mit to the end
of time, and <hi>Ari<U+017F>tenus</hi> regards him as one
who<U+017F>e Sword hath <U+017F>trucke as many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
blowes in his <U+017F>ervice as any's who<U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and who<U+017F>e merit might plead title to as
rich rewards. In an<U+017F>wer to his merit he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olves
to <U+017F>ettle him in the Viceroy-<U+017F>hip
which <hi>Polianis</hi> a few dayes before his death
de<U+017F>igned him: But as he is about to do it
he is called to arms by the Province of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones</hi>
for the Cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ing of that <hi>Felonious.</hi> The
leading of this War is committed to <hi>Alcidor;</hi>
but when he <U+017F>hould take the Field, he falls
<U+017F>ick. It is at fir<U+017F>t a heavy <U+017F>urcharge of trouble
to him be<U+017F>ides that of his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s that he is
hindered from waiting upon his Ma<U+017F>ter and
gathering the ro<U+017F>e which is at the end of the
thorn. But when he findes by the cour<U+017F>e
of his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that he can in all likelyhood
have none but a fatall i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of it, he looks
upon tho<U+017F>e former thoughts as no longer <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable,
he wholly applies him<U+017F>elf to think
of his retreate, the honours of the World
he with a holy elevation of mind contemnes,
and hath his de<U+017F>ires grow cold to every
thing el<U+017F>e, but to go and enjoy a purity of
happine<U+017F>s with his <hi>Dorame</hi> and <hi>Florinda.</hi> In
