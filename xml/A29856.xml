         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

either Natural, or Artificial; the
Natural, is when the Bones are
all excarn'd, but kept together by

one, is when the Bones
are Artificially Cleans'd, Whiten'd

Definition, as it is not compleat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<U+017F>o on the other hand, the
word Faculty, is a Term which they
u<U+017F>ed to expre<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves by, when
they were at a lo<U+017F>s for an An<U+017F>wer or
Solution to any Que<U+017F>tion propo<U+017F>ed;
be<U+017F>ides, it's not at all agreeable to the
Idea we have of the formation of the

Antients made u<U+017F>e of that Term to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
mo<U+017F>t of the Actions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for when they were to declare
how the Chyle, or Blood was made,
or how the Bones or Cartilages were
form'd, nay, how the Sen<U+017F>es acted;
they an<U+017F>wer'd, That the Stomach had

a Chylific Faculty, the Liver a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifying;

               <p>This was a general An<U+017F>wer, by

Actions purely Mechanically; as I
<U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew in demon<U+017F>trating each

the Action which it performs, ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

that it can do nought el<U+017F>e, but what it

which is about the time when the

               <p>The Bones are compo<U+017F>ed of many

points, commonly about the Centre;
Nature is al<U+017F>o very cautious in O<U+017F><U+017F>ify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long Bones all at once; for if
their Extremities had been O<U+017F><U+017F>ified as

<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily their ends, to join them
together, which they can do, being
not totally O<U+017F><U+017F>ified. The O<U+017F><U+017F>ification,
as I <U+017F>aid afore of the <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>a Innominata,</hi>
begins at three points, that they may
have the greater <U+017F>olidity; but quite
contrary in the Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi>
for while the middle of mo<U+017F>t Bones of
the <hi>Cranium</hi> are fully O<U+017F><U+017F>ified, their
edges are only Membranous, that
they may give way <U+017F>omewhat in time
of Birth, which they would not, were
the <hi>Cranium</hi> compleatly O<U+017F><U+017F>ified.
The<U+017F>e are the Rea<U+017F>ons why Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
O<U+017F><U+017F>ification in <U+017F>ome Bones, and
advances it in others.</p>

I think it will not be ami<U+017F>s to drill two or

them in their right Situation, in time of

Fingers, put them in the Fingers of a

admit of longer boiling than the <U+017F>mall;
now <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it be the Skeleton of a young
Subject, boil not above an Hour, or an Hour
and half at mo<U+017F>t, le<U+017F>t the Cartilaginous
tips of the Bones come away; but in an
Adult you may boil longer, the older the
Subject is, the longer time is required in
boiling; but before you put the long Bones
into your boiling Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, bore a hole in
their Extremities, large enough, according
to the bigne<U+017F>s of the Bones, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar
Parts may have free <hi>exit</hi> in boiling;
to further which, run up the Bones <U+017F>o
drill'd, a red hot Wire to and fro, to make
a quicker di<U+017F>patch of the fatty Particles,
then ca<U+017F>t them into your boiling Water;
for it's this fatty Sub<U+017F>tance only, which in
many Skeletons makes them look <U+017F>o muddy
and dull; when you think your Bones <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
boil'd, let them be pre<U+017F>ently taken
out and cleaned one after another, a fa<U+017F>t
as you can; it's very good to rub the Bones
with Ma<U+017F>ons Du<U+017F>t, which fetches off the
<hi>Periostion,</hi> and levigates them very well;
or you may wa<U+017F>h them in boiling Lye made
of A<U+017F>hes, which <U+017F>cowers and clean<U+017F>es them
very well; after they are thus clean<U+017F>ed,
throw them in clean cold Water, in which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52388:69"/>
let them lye about half a Day, then take
them out, and wipe them dry, putting
them <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame order as they were
before you boiled them, and ob<U+017F>erving to
make the <U+017F>ame marks of di<U+017F>tinction; when
they are thus dried, place them on the
Leads of he Hou<U+017F>e for <U+017F>ome Days and
Nights, e<U+017F>pecially when the Dews fall mo<U+017F>t,

by this means they will become as white as

carefully from the Fle<U+017F>h as you can, then
let it dry moderately in the <U+017F>hade, always
<U+017F>triving to keep the Cartilages in their true
