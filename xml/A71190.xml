            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In order to this de<U+017F>ign, he made choice of the great and rich City of <hi>Lions,</hi> where he proclaimed open hou<U+017F>e: Prepared <U+017F>o many Ma<U+017F>ques, Tiltings, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He having been long a Widdower, and the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Amalberge,</hi> wife unto the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> dead two years ago, there was no Ladies that lay in the Palace Royal: But the more to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<U+017F>trate this A<U+017F><U+017F>emb;ly, he <U+017F>ent for the young Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda</hi> from <hi>Viennae,</hi> where <U+017F>he had been educated <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Chilperick</hi> her father; As for <hi>Ama<U+017F>inda,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> <U+017F>he was yet in the Armes of her Nur<U+017F>e; <hi>Sigerius,</hi> her elder Brother, being not above four years of age. When <hi>Clotilda</hi> came into the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> <U+017F>he carryed her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o prudently and <U+017F>weetly, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>o fair in the eyes of all, as the Kings good will towards her was much encrea<U+017F>ed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53528:4"/>
and as if he had forgotten <U+017F>he was the child of <hi>Chilperick,</hi> he made no difference betwixt her and his own child. It is worth ob<U+017F>ervance, that his equal affection unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Clotilda,</hi> in lieu of kindling any <U+017F>parks of envy or jealou<U+017F>ie betwixt them (as is very u<U+017F>ual in per<U+017F>ons of that age) it produced quite contrary effects in them, and tyed them together in fa<U+017F>t knots of amity, not inferiour unto any ligaments of con<U+017F>aguinity what<U+017F>oever.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Clotilda</hi> was come and her lodgings prepared for her, the Court ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in greater lu<U+017F>ter: for <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had preferred unto her <U+017F>ervice twelve young Ladies, the principal of all his Kingdom, called out among<U+017F>t the faire<U+017F>t, and be<U+017F>t qualified in all his Dominions; It was my hap to be one of this number, cho<U+017F>en not for any manner of merit in me, but rather for the place <U+017F>ake where I was born, or indeed rather to give fortune, an occa<U+017F>ion of afflicting and per<U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me the more.</p>
               <p>I thought that now I was quite rid of the importunities of <hi>Periander,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of his levity; of <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of his fal<U+017F>hood: and of <hi>Merindor,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of his preferring his brother in his room. But I found, that as <U+017F>oon as the deformity of my face was with time vani<U+017F>hed away, <hi>Periander</hi> was as bu<U+017F><U+017F>ie as ever about me: and as if he had been only a<U+017F>leep all the time of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, will needs have me believe that he was ever my <U+017F>ervant, u<U+017F>ing all his arguments and rethorique to glo<U+017F><U+017F>e over his levity, and <U+017F>paring no manner of oath and prote<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to purcha<U+017F>e belief. On the other <U+017F>ide, to my mi<U+017F>ery, <hi>Alderina</hi> chanced to dye, leaving the fal<U+017F>e <hi>Bellimartes</hi> at liberty to per<U+017F>ecute me. And to make me mo<U+017F>t perfectly mi<U+017F>erable, <hi>Merindor</hi> did the like; as if he had drunk of the water of oblivion, and would have me pledge him, he acco<U+017F>ted me with a <U+017F>miling look, <U+017F>eeming to wonder I <U+017F>hould not be as free with him as I was wont to be before his trea<U+017F>on, and making horrible complaints again<U+017F>t my wavering and unequal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Oh Heavens! was ever <U+017F>uch impudence heard of? e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Merindors:</hi> As for <hi>Periander,</hi> though he did quit me, yet it was after my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e had made me ugly; and if he did return, when my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was over, he was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>able, becau<U+017F>e it was never me that he loved, but that fading thing which the world cals beauty, <U+017F>o as this is <U+017F>ome kind of excu<U+017F>e for him. As for <hi>Bellimartes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did commit a mo<U+017F>t gro<U+017F><U+017F>e fault, yet I can find <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e for him; for though he was married, yet it was his love and e<U+017F>teem of me which prompted him to marry me, But for <hi>Merindor,</hi> I cannot find any collour of excu<U+017F>e for him, but only that he is a man; and being <U+017F>o, he is allowed to be incon<U+017F>tant and fal<U+017F>e. Yet I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I am mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his di<U+017F>loyalty, becau<U+017F>e he had lea<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on for what he did, and I a greater inclination unto him then any other.</p>
               <p>During the time of the<U+017F>e Baccanalian Fea<U+017F>tes, it hapned that the King one day after he had delighted the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Clotilda,</hi> and the Ladies with <U+017F>everal <U+017F>hews, they went all to walk in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Gardens, where the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> and the <hi>Arar</hi> meeting, there is a mo<U+017F>t dilectable I<U+017F>le betwixt two great Rivers, which <U+017F>everal Kings have imbelli<U+017F>hed with abundance of Art: planting it with trees, and adorning it with magnificient Fountains, Walks, Turra<U+017F><U+017F>es, and Arbors, which being contrived with excellent de<U+017F>ign; and order out of <U+017F>o much confu<U+017F>ion, does <U+017F>till take the eye of the walker with <U+017F>omthing of novelty and wonder. But indeed at that time, the trees were not decked in their mantles of green, nor ca<U+017F>t of their gray garments of winter. Yet the King, to <U+017F>upply that defect; brought forth abundance of Orange Trees, which he had pre<U+017F>erved in vaultes from the <U+017F>torms of Fro<U+017F>t and Snow, and planted them in <U+017F>uch indu<U+017F>trious order, as it <U+017F>eemed as if the Summer had preceded the Spring.</p>
               <p>It was at this time, and in this place, when and where <hi>Periander, Bellimartes,</hi> and <hi>Merindor,</hi> intended to renew their importunities: <hi>Periander</hi> who fir<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fal<U+017F>e, was the fir<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o that acco<U+017F>ted me with this language. This, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> is the day of your Triumph and Victories, for which way <U+017F>oever you ca<U+017F>t your eye, you cannot <U+017F>ee any thing which does not yeild and <U+017F>ubmit unto your beauty. I looked coldly upon him, and then without any an<U+017F>wer turned the other way, and continued my walk with my Companions. But he, nothing daunted at my cold looks, followed, and taking hold of my Gown; what fair one? <U+017F>aid he

Can you doubt it (replied he) <U+017F>ince I called you by the Epithite which is mo<U+017F>t your due? How did you call me (<U+017F>aid I unto him) I called you, <U+017F>aid he, by your own right name; did you not hear me call you fair <hi>Dorinde</hi>? I know none of that name, replied I; for do you not remember that <U+017F>he dyed of the <U+017F>mal Pox. At this he blu<U+017F>ht, yet an<U+017F>wered; yes, yes, but <U+017F>he is ri<U+017F>en again: I cannot tell, an<U+017F>wered I, whether <U+017F>he be ri<U+017F>en as to others, but I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>he is for ever dead as to you: After this, <U+017F>ay what he would, I would not turn any longer towards him. Then <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Companion di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, he acco<U+017F>ted me, and would needs take me under the arm: but I faign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had not yet <U+017F>een him, I looked him <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>tly in the face, and <U+017F>aid unto him, Sir, <hi>Alderina</hi> whom you look for is not here: <hi>Alderina</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) was once the cau<U+017F>e of my mi<U+017F>ery, and now <U+017F>he is dead, her memory I hope will not be as fatal to me as <U+017F>he was. The Gods are <U+017F>o full of all goodne<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered I, as that they can make the happine<U+017F>s of one out of the mi<U+017F>ery of another: and this mi<U+017F>ery of which you complain was my happine<U+017F>s; So as I <U+017F>hould be very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful if I <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e the memory of it. But in good earne<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid he, I hope you do know that <hi>Alderina</hi> is dead, and that <U+017F>he will never trouble either you or me. <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered I very faintly, be mo<U+017F>t confident of this that though <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derina</hi> be dead, yet I <U+017F>hall never be inclinable to marry you, lea<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be the <hi>Alderina</hi> of <U+017F>ome other <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Upon this <hi>Bellimartes</hi> left me, as much a<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as <hi>Periander</hi> was, and <hi>Merindor</hi> immediately <U+017F>tept into his place: and I mo<U+017F>t ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F>s, as I told you before, that I was more offended again<U+017F>t him then all the re<U+017F>t. Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto me after a low conge) thanks be to the fates, I am now <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>olute ma<U+017F>ter of my <U+017F>elf, as that I am able to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you I am your mo<U+017F>t humbly devoted <U+017F>ervant. <hi>Merindor,</hi> an<U+017F>wered I, is this the language which you taught your brother when you <U+017F>ent him unto me? Oh fair <hi>Dorinde</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he immediately) when I wi<U+017F>hed that happine<U+017F>s unto my brother, it was when I could not render you a greater te<U+017F>timony of my affection: but now I am free, I <U+017F>peak unto you in the behalf of <hi>Merindor,</hi> who <U+017F>till loves and adores you, and ever <U+017F>hall; The<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions <hi>Merindor,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him in a little impatiency, might well deceive any other but <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and yet truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I would be not be ungratefull, if I had a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter I would advi<U+017F>e her to accept of your good will: but as for me, never think any more of it; for I was told by a very good A<U+017F>trologer that your marriage and mine together was never made in Heaven. Then turning away towards my Companions, and declining any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talk with them, we began to dance after the <hi>Gauli<U+017F>h</hi> mode. Many Caveliers of the Court did hear all our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and what an<U+017F>wers I gave unto them: and as there are alwayes <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e practice is to carry tales unto the King, thereby to in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into favour, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome pick-thank, or other acquainted the King immediately with all my an<U+017F>wers; The King who was much taken with them told them again unto <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons, laughing at the<U+017F>e three Cavaliers. But <U+017F>ee if I had not good rea<U+017F>ons to <U+017F>ay that fortune which makes <U+017F>ome happy beyond their de<U+017F>ires, did make me more mi<U+017F>erable then I could imagine; for who would ever have thought that the<U+017F>e reproaches which I gave unto the<U+017F>e impudent men, <U+017F>hould have co<U+017F>t me <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>ery as I have endured? And yet <U+017F>o it hapned that the King being plea<U+017F>ed with them, and hearing what great affection tho<U+017F>e three Cavaliers did bear unto me, he began to entertain <U+017F>ome good opinion of me, and from that day to this would never let me live in quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Oh Heavens! how dear did his favours a while after, co<U+017F>t me? For, I cannot tell upon what rea<U+017F>on, but the King, to my mi<U+017F>ery, took a liking unto me: and I do prote<U+017F>t, I never took any notice of it until it was too late be remedied.</p>
               <p>Though Heaven has elevated great Princes much higher then tho<U+017F>e over whom they command: yet they do want that liberty which private per<U+017F>ons do enjoy; for even as high Towers are <U+017F>een farther then the humble Cottages of Shepherds; <U+017F>o the grandure of Kings is <U+017F>o obvious unto all eyes, that they cannot <U+017F>tir a <U+017F>tep but they are <U+017F>een by all, and the very lea<U+017F>t of their actions is <U+017F>ubject unto the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

courted by them, but all the Court mo<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently perceive it. <hi>Gondebaut</hi> who knew this very well, and being de<U+017F>irous to apply <U+017F>ome remedy unto it, (for he knew that if he did not, <hi>Arcingeutorix,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of my kindred would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Clotilda</hi> would have a ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of complaint) and therefore his de<U+017F>ign was to carry this court<U+017F>hip as covertly as he could, and with <U+017F>uch clo<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>pection, as <U+017F>hould delude the eyes of the mo<U+017F>t clear <U+017F>ighted. As for me, I was altogether ignorant of the Kings de<U+017F>ign, and minded nothing but my attendance upon that wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e endeavoring by my <U+017F>ervice to gain her favour; and I found by many of her noble expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions to me that my endeavours were not in vain; which was <U+017F>uch a high contentment unto me as every one might <U+017F>ee it in my face; <U+017F>o as I found the Proverb to be true, which <U+017F>ayes, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is the be<U+017F>t painting; and truly me thought, that I had quite another kind of a face, and was not as I was wont to be: Al<U+017F>o my judgment in this was not <U+017F>ingular; for all my Companions thought <U+017F>o as well as I, even the prudent Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf who<U+017F>e kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me was the principal cau<U+017F>e of it.</p>
               <p>The King who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ign was to render me mi<U+017F>erable, was very <U+017F>tudious how to acquaint me with his intention, and was a long while before he could tell which way he <U+017F>hould begin the work; for <U+017F>eeing me to very young, he could not tell whether I had <U+017F>o much government over my <U+017F>elf as to keep <U+017F>ecret. But one night when we were all dancing, and when, according to the cu<U+017F>tome, they <U+017F>tole her away which danced, the King in his turn, came towards me; and as <U+017F>oon as he touched my hand, he <U+017F>aid unto me, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf more happy if I could <U+017F>teal away this trea<U+017F>ure, then I am in the conque<U+017F>t of all <hi>Gaule.</hi> Unto which I <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and an<U+017F>wered, the theft Sir which you are plea<U+017F>ed to mention, is exceedingly <U+017F>mall, e<U+017F>pecially compared unto <U+017F>o great an Empire. If this which you e<U+017F>teem <U+017F>o trivial (<U+017F>aid he unto me, and gra<U+017F>ped my hand) could be as <U+017F>oon atchieved, as I could conquer all <hi>Gaul,</hi> I would this very hour put on my Armor, and never put it off until I had made an ab<U+017F>olute conque<U+017F>t. Upon this, not <U+017F>taying for my an<U+017F>wer, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on to another. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I was much <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed at this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but not being able to per<U+017F>wade my <U+017F>elf that there was any thing in me that was worthy either of the eye or thought of a King, I believed it to be his cu<U+017F>tome of <U+017F>peaking <U+017F>o unto all, and only to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away time: <U+017F>o as in this belief, I grounded nothing upon tho<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean time, who was very ob<U+017F>ervant to <U+017F>ee how I would take this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; hearing no more talk of it, he thought me to have more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then tho<U+017F>e of my age u<U+017F>e to have: and as it is common with Lovers to Flatter them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o he per<U+017F>waded him<U+017F>elf, that the knowledge which he had imparted unto me of his good will, was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto me. And therefore growing more confident in my di<U+017F>cretion, and more encouraged to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf: one day when we were all in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Gardens, and when my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were a little <U+017F>eperated from me, as I was reaching at a flower which grew upon a tree that was a little too high for my arm, he left the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e walking and came and pulled the flower; here fair one, (<U+017F>aid he and gave it unto me) take this flower as a pledge of my heart which I have already given unto you: then he went pre<U+017F>ently to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e again. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that this <U+017F>econd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration did open my eyes; but yet I thought it a thing <U+017F>o impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the King <U+017F>hould ever have any thoughts of me, as I <U+017F>till remained in my blindne<U+017F><U+017F>e and would take no notice of it, nor mention it unto any. The King finding by the<U+017F>e two te<U+017F>timonies that I could keep <U+017F>ecret, he thought it now high time to tru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf wholly unto my di<U+017F>cretion: <U+017F>o as a while after, when the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Clotilda</hi> was making preparations to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her<U+017F>elf, and to dance in the habit of the <hi>Druyde</hi> and <hi>Nayade</hi> Nimphs, he was very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf: <U+017F>o as he came unto her all alone by him<U+017F>elf, and fir<U+017F>t of all began to commend <hi>Clotilda</hi> very highly, who indeed was a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of mo<U+017F>t rare beauty as well of mind as of body: then he <U+017F>eemed de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee us all; and when he <U+017F>aw all very bu<U+017F>ie in triming up them<U+017F>elves, he came unto me, and <U+017F>aid in a low voice, as for you fair one, your beauty is <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendent, that nothing can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be added or dimini<U+017F>hed without doing you wrong.

               <p>This brought blu<U+017F>hes into my face as red as if my cheeks were all on fire; and a thou<U+017F>and to one, but it had been perceived: yet all my Companions were <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie in tricking up them<U+017F>elves, as they never <U+017F>aw when the King went out; and from that day I never doubted what the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Gonbebaut</hi> was, though till then, I mu<U+017F>t ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I could not imagine his meaning.

As long as any was <U+017F>o near as to hear, he made no an<U+017F>wers but only by <U+017F>igns, but when all the company was parted from her, he took <hi>Duriana</hi> by the hand, and <U+017F>aid unto her in a low voice; it is very

<U+017F>trange <hi>Duriana</hi> you <U+017F>hould not know that per<U+017F>on who loves you above all the world.

But as to the fir<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e, I thought that if I did burn it, then if the King <U+017F>hould come to know it, he would be extreamly offended at this <U+017F>corn: and how could I an<U+017F>wer him, if he asked me my rea<U+017F>on for it? I thought it therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to read it fir<U+017F>t, and then to burn it: but then, if <hi>Clotilda</hi> <U+017F>hould come to know of this<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> either by the King or any other, how unkindly would <U+017F>he take this from me? Que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Gondebaut</hi> him<U+017F>elf would be the fir<U+017F>t that would tell her, when he <U+017F>ees I will not con<U+017F>ent unto all that plea<U+017F>eth him; or if he <U+017F>hould alter his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; as to my <U+017F>ad experience, I find <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> hath done; their examples teach me at a dear rate, that the con<U+017F>tancy of a man, la<U+017F>ts no longer then till his eyes finds an object that plea<U+017F>eth him better. This Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid I to my <U+017F>elf) does me the honour to love me, and I am mo<U+017F>t confident of her good advice; and <U+017F>ay the King <U+017F>hould come to know that I have acquainted her, he cannot chu<U+017F>e but know withal, that my duty obliged me unto what I did; and I am very confident that when the heat of the humour is a little over, he will e<U+017F>teem me more for it, and <U+017F>ay I did well.</p>
               <p>According to this la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olution, I took the Letter and went unto <hi>Clotilda</hi>

and as fortune was, found her in her Clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing away the time with many of my Companions. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he honoured me <U+017F>o far as to love me above any of the re<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to come unto me; and becau<U+017F>e all young per<U+017F>ons have alwayes <U+017F>ome trivial news to tell one another, <U+017F>he took me a<U+017F>ide unto a window of a little di<U+017F>tance from the re<U+017F>t of the company, where <U+017F>he related unto me not only all <U+017F>he had done <U+017F>ince the la<U+017F>t time <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me, but al<U+017F>o, all her mo<U+017F>t intimate thoughts: at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me, but good <hi>Dorinde</hi> tell me what you have done <U+017F>ince la<U+017F>t you were with me; come, come, give me an exact accompt not only of your actions, but even of every thought.

The young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e longing to know what I had to tell her, and being al<U+017F>o very de<U+017F>irous to give me contentment, <U+017F>he did as I de<U+017F>ired her; and when we were both in the Clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, the door bolted, <U+017F>he <U+017F>at down, and I according to my cu<U+017F>tome, kneeled down before her, mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eeching her to think, that my de<U+017F>ire of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <U+017F>elf within the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of my duty, and to carry my <U+017F>elf in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her commands, did prompt me to impart unto her what I then would; then I did not only <U+017F>hew her the Kings Letter, but al<U+017F>o imparted unto her all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of my three la<U+017F>t encounters with <hi>Gondibaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Clotilda,</hi> <U+017F>tood mute, after the reading of this Letter; and after <U+017F>he had long paw<U+017F>ed upon it, <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) you need not entreat me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which is <U+017F>o unfit to be publi<U+017F>hed: and becau<U+017F>e you de<U+017F>ire my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and I am obliged to give it, not at random, but upon mature deliberation, I will take this night to con<U+017F>ider upon it. Thus we parted; and becau<U+017F>e none of my Companions <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any matter of <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>ie to be betwixt us, the wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e went out laughing, and commanded me to do the like, as if we had been talking upon matter of mirth and jollity. You know, that the Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> younger brother unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> went to travel into the Courts of Neighbour Kings, there to learn the Cu<U+017F>toms, Laws, and Manners of other Countries; to be acquainted with their Countries and <U+017F>trength, and the better to improve him<U+017F>elf in his travels, he carried with him the great and wi<U+017F>e <hi>Avitus,</hi> who had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, not only unto him, but to his brother <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> al<U+017F>o. Now this young Prince was lately returned to the great contentment both of King and people; for truly both <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Gondemar</hi> being in<U+017F>tructed by <U+017F>uch a Sapient Tutor, wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> both very hopeful. This prudent Governour, above all other documents, did mo<U+017F>t imprint amity and concord betwixt them; <U+017F>hewing them that little

things grow great by union; and great things become nothing by di<U+017F>cord; he hinted unto them, the jars betwixt their father and his brothers, how their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and emnity did draw upon them<U+017F>elves the odium of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and their own ruine: that this wound would be long in healing in their family, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e they with a contrary de<U+017F>ign did remedy it, to wit, by mutual love, as the others did make the wound by hatred. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>age in<U+017F>tructions, imprinted them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o upon the <U+017F>pirits of the<U+017F>e two young Princes, that a greater league of Love and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be imagined then was betwixt them.</p>
               <p>This wi<U+017F>e man finding by the phi<U+017F>iognomy of <hi>Clotilda,</hi> that <U+017F>he would prove a mo<U+017F>t Excellent and Wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e; he thought it would be advantagious unto the<U+017F>e two Princes to contract a league of amity with her: for con<U+017F>anguinity was not enough to <U+017F>alve up tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ores which former di<U+017F><U+017F>entions had made. This wi<U+017F>e advi<U+017F>e, together with the <U+017F>weet inclination of <hi>Clotilda,</hi> did make the<U+017F>e two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <U+017F>o exceedingly love her, that all the animo<U+017F>ities of their fathers hatred were not only rooted out, but the<U+017F>e young hearts did link them<U+017F>elves together in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong tyes of affection, as each of them had as kind a care of the others good as of their own: nothing was in <U+017F>ecret among<U+017F>t them: and knowing the humour of <hi>Gondebaut</hi> to be collerick and violent, they after con<U+017F>ulted together what was the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to be taken in any affair, and above all, they followed the Prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their wi<U+017F>e Governour. And yet, as there is often a certain kind of blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which moves <U+017F>ome to affect one per<U+017F>on above another, <U+017F>o this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e had ever a kind of natural affection more towards the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brother <hi>Godomar</hi>: and this was the rea<U+017F>on that at this time <U+017F>he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him only with my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>he related the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age unto him, <U+017F>hewed him the Kings Letter, and asked him what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay unto me and what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould do. <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> was at the fir<U+017F>t extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed; afterward he asked her, how <U+017F>he came to know the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and how I carried my <U+017F>elf in it; to whom the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e an<U+017F>wered, <hi>Dorinde</hi> carries her <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>he ought to do, and will not do any thing without my advice; for it was from her I came to know the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Now, ob<U+017F>erve, I be<U+017F>eech you, how dangerous it is to acquaint young men with <U+017F>uch matters; <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> had never ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon me but only by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, as upon the re<U+017F>t of my Companions, had it not been for this. But dear Companions, well may we <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome are happy beyond their hopes, and others more unfortunate then they could imagine: and I am one of tho<U+017F>e whom fortune has made the butt for the wor<U+017F>t of her arrows. Could any ever have imagined, that <hi>Clotilda</hi> by reprehending the Fathers fault <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e the Son to commit it? No certainly, and but my cro<U+017F>s fate mu<U+017F>t needs have it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>urely it had never been.</p>
               <p>Now the de<U+017F>igns of the young Prince is wholly upon me, and becau<U+017F>e he did not know whether his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e would be as welcome unto me as his Fathers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved at the fir<U+017F>t, to hide his affection from <hi>Clotilda,</hi> knowing very well that <U+017F>he would di<U+017F>wade him from it if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, and perhaps divert me al<U+017F>o. But he did extreamly di<U+017F>approve of the Kings intention, <U+017F>eemed to wonder at it, and to vilifie me in <U+017F>uch a manner as if I <U+017F>hould be the la<U+017F>t of all the Court whom he could love. Then turning his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he, for <U+017F>o he called her) we mu<U+017F>t upon any terms take <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e or other to prevent this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e from going any farther; for though <hi>Dorinde</hi> has hitherto carried her <U+017F>elf very well in the matter, yet it is to be feared that a long continuance of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip may make her change her mind: A place may make a brave re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, yet yeild at the third: be<U+017F>ides, Love you know is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and infects another party. Truly brother (an<U+017F>wered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e) I am not well acquainted with the nature of that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but adhere much unto your opinion of it, and therefore I de<U+017F>ire your advice. I <U+017F>hould be very re<U+017F>erved in giving it, (an<U+017F>wered the Prince) as well becau<U+017F>e it concerns my King, as becau<U+017F>e that King is my Father, but that the honour of our family, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly yours, dear Si<U+017F>ter, is at the <U+017F>take, and therefore I <U+017F>hall be the more open and free in giving it. Let me tell you therefore, that con<U+017F>idering the Kings hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53528:8"/>
and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, I do fore<U+017F>ee much mi<U+017F>chief may come of this matter, if you if you do not oppo<U+017F>e in its fir<U+017F>t beginning; and believe this for certain, that when it has once taken root, you can never do it: or if you do, it will be with much heartburning and di<U+017F>content. Let not the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e gather <U+017F>trength, it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in all di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, but mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>pecially in Love, above all others. This is my advice at the fir<U+017F>t: and if we find that the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e do yet <U+017F>till increa<U+017F>e, we mu<U+017F>t have recour<U+017F>e unto other remedies, which time and occa<U+017F>ion may di<U+017F>cover unto us; but above all things, make <U+017F>ure that <hi>Dorinde</hi> do not deceive her <U+017F>elf, and that <U+017F>he do not deceive you; for Love is a thing of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ubtle nature, as that it does <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e upon a heart unperceived; and if it do <U+017F>o in her, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Si<U+017F>ter, your labour will be all lo<U+017F>t. Such a thing may be, an<U+017F>wered the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, but I fear it not; for I know <hi>Dorinde</hi> to be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet and wi<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he will never do any act prejudicial unto her <U+017F>elf or me.</p>
               <p>The next morning, <hi>Clotilda</hi> took me a<U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>aid thus unto me; I have thought <hi>Dorinde</hi> upon your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e or indeed ours, for I am concerned it it, and perhaps more then you are. It is a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s wherein you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew both your prudence and your courage: your courage, in <U+017F>corning any thing that may wound your reputation, and your prudence, in doing it <U+017F>o that the King may not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended either again<U+017F>t you, or me. Fir<U+017F>t you mu<U+017F>t conceive, that the King courts you only to ruine you, and that as <U+017F>oon as it is known, your honour is lo<U+017F>t; think upon tho<U+017F>e noble Ance<U+017F>tors from whom you are de<U+017F>cended; con<U+017F>ider what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of hazard and pains they took in getting that reputation which they left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their po<U+017F>terity. I hope you will not be the fir<U+017F>t that for want of courage will <U+017F>uffer this anciently de<U+017F>cended reputation to be <U+017F>tayned: as for matter of prudence, you mu<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde</hi> fight this enemy, not by <U+017F>triving and contending, but by flying from him; Love is of <U+017F>uch a nature as is <U+017F>ooner overcome by flight. then re<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance; and the Love of Kings above all others; for pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Princes are alwayes extreamly offended again<U+017F>t any thing which does re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t them; they are jealous of their power, and will at any rate pre<U+017F>erve it unre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table. I advice you therefore, that in the practice of this prudence, you do not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, but flye from this enemy; that is, that you <U+017F>hun all occa<U+017F>ions of being in any place where <hi>Gondebaut</hi> may have any di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with you; and if he chance to find <U+017F>uch an opportunity, <U+017F>eem as if you did not under<U+017F>tand what he <U+017F>aid; and be <U+017F>o far from being per<U+017F>waded that he loves you, as to <U+017F>eem ab<U+017F>olutely ignorant in all matters of love. If you carry it <U+017F>o, perhaps you may divert his intention, or at the lea<U+017F>t tyer him out: and above all be <U+017F>ure, that I be adverti<U+017F>ed of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt you; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that as long as you do <U+017F>o, I will never for<U+017F>ake you.</p>
               <p>This was the <U+017F>age coun<U+017F>el which <hi>Clotilda</hi> gave me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and which I re<U+017F>olved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mo<U+017F>t punctually, as well becau<U+017F>e of her rea<U+017F>ons which <U+017F>he alledged unto me, as becau<U+017F>e I had been formerly deceived by <U+017F>uch as u<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ame language, he did in his Letter. I returned the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, mo<U+017F>t humble and hearty thanks for the honour of her advice, and promi<U+017F>ed all exact ob<U+017F>ervance.

The King looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout if there was any hor<U+017F>e in the Company upon which I might mount, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none good enough, he commanded <hi>Merindor</hi> to ride after <hi>Clotilda</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our Governe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I could not overtake the Company, and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take order for another hor<U+017F>e, or el<U+017F>e to come and keep me Company, it not being fit I <U+017F>hould be left alone.

It <U+017F>eems you think (replied he) that I have the <U+017F>ame power which you have, who can when you plea<U+017F>e cure the wound which you make. Oh Sir (<U+017F>aid I and interrupted him) I be<U+017F>eech you let us talk of that another time, and for the pre<U+017F>ent, talk of my poor hor<U+017F>e who is not able to carry me.

               <p>The King in the mean time, meeting <hi>Merindor</hi> and his Company, go, go, <U+017F>aid he unto him, you did not ob<U+017F>erve that the hor<U+017F>e was only <U+017F>tamped with a nail, which being pulled out, the hor<U+017F>e will be as ever he was.

               <p>Con<U+017F>ider now, I be<U+017F>eech you, what mortal enemies men are unto us; and what abundance of pains they will take to ruine poor women: but oh Heaven! how hard it is to avoid their treachery, e<U+017F>pecially when we fall into the hands of a <U+017F>ubtle per<U+017F>on that has authority? I had <U+017F>ufficient experience of their fal<U+017F>hood, and the wounds which their per<U+017F>idy had made in my <U+017F>oul were yet fre<U+017F>h: I wanted not any good coun<U+017F>el, and yet I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s the flatteries of <hi>Gondebaut</hi> were plea<U+017F>ing unto me, maugre my re<U+017F>olution, and I delighted the <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>o great a King: <U+017F>o as I advi<U+017F>e all women to beware of <U+017F>uch enemies, and <U+017F>hun them as Syrens, without lending the lea<U+017F>t care unto them.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as I was come up to the company, I acquainted <hi>Clotilda</hi> with all that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had <U+017F>aid unto me, and with all my an<U+017F>wers, and <U+017F>he thought that I had done very prudently in it; but when I told her of his invention to lame my hor<U+017F>e purpo<U+017F>ly to <U+017F>peak with me, Oh <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) I am extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of <U+017F>ome mis-fortune, and let me tell you my mind freely, that if he do not fall off as <U+017F>oon as you have given him his an<U+017F>wer, you mu<U+017F>t marry.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53528:10"/>
all our pains will be to no purpo<U+017F>e, and you may incur much danger. I cannot believe her <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clotilda</hi>) as to hide any thing from me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, if you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ound her, <U+017F>he will be much more re<U+017F>erued to you then to me. Refer that unto me (an<U+017F>wered he) and after two or three tryals, I <U+017F>hall tell you more of my mind.</p>
               <p>The King on the other <U+017F>ide, told <hi>Ardilan,</hi> all that I had <U+017F>aid unto him, and it was re<U+017F>olved as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that <hi>Duriana</hi> <U+017F>hould be acquainted with the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto me; for the crafty <hi>Ardilan</hi> had <U+017F>o tampered with her, what by gifts and what by promi<U+017F>es of marriages, that in all likelyhood <U+017F>he was wholly at his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e. But to <U+017F>et a hand<U+017F>om glo<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the matter, they mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eem as if the Kings intention was to marry me, thinking by this gilded bait to draw both <hi>Duriana</hi> and me to <U+017F>wallow the hook <U+017F>ooner. The next morning <hi>Ardilan</hi> failed not to <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Duriana</hi>; after many prote<U+017F>tation of affection and promi<U+017F>es of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, <hi>Duriana</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) to let you <U+017F>ee how in<U+017F>eperably in am yours, I will tru<U+017F>t you with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ecret as if ever it be di<U+017F>covered, I am utterly ruined, and I will <U+017F>o tye my <U+017F>elf unto you by this freedom, as you may <U+017F>ee nothing can <U+017F>eperate me from you. Know therefore <hi>Duriana,</hi> that the King is <U+017F>o extreamly in love with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that he never enjoys any contentment or re<U+017F>t, but when he <U+017F>ees her, and yet carries it out <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly, that I believe none takes any notice of it. I prote<U+017F>t (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Duriana</hi> with much admiration) you amaze me in telling me the King loves my Mi<U+017F>tris; for <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons can hardly, love without di<U+017F>covery: but I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, how does <U+017F>he take it? I cannot tell (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered he) <U+017F>he has not given him his an<U+017F>wer; but I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he is ill advi<U+017F>ed if <U+017F>he reject <U+017F>uch an advantagious fortune. Advantagious? (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Duriana</hi> pre<U+017F>ently) how do you mean it? Without all doubt highly advantagious (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he) and <U+017F>o perhaps that when you know all you will wonder more; for mo<U+017F>t certainly, if <U+017F>he carry her <U+017F>elf towards him as <U+017F>he ought to do, the King will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. How, how? (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and clapped her hands together) the King marry <hi>Dorinde</hi>? and my Mi<U+017F>tris become Queen of the <hi>Burgundians</hi>? doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he may (an<U+017F>wered he) if <U+017F>he will but accept of her fortune. Oh <hi>Ardilan</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and took him about the neck) doubtle<U+017F>s you but mock me. I prote<U+017F>t before Heaven I do not mock, an<U+017F>wered he, and you will find all I <U+017F>ay to be mo<U+017F>t certainly true, if <U+017F>he be well advi<U+017F>ed; why <U+017F>hould you think it a thing <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange or impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible? Do you not remember his affection unto <hi>Cri<U+017F>eide,</hi> and how he would have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her? And can you think that <U+017F>tranger of a better family or more meritorious then <hi>Dorinde</hi>? No <hi>Duriana,</hi> believe me, the King is re<U+017F>olved upon it, he has told me as much, and I know his mind mo<U+017F>t perfectly; but to tell you truly I am afraid your Mi<U+017F>tris is not <U+017F>o well advi<U+017F>ed as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be, and in lieu of being Queen of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> will make her <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable woman in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for if ever <U+017F>he acquaint <hi>Clotilda</hi> with it, mo<U+017F>t certainly <U+017F>he will give her ill coun<U+017F>el, and <U+017F>trive to divert her for many rea<U+017F>ons, e<U+017F>pecially becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he cannot brook that a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o inferiour <U+017F>hould become her Lady and Mi<U+017F>tris, nor obey one who obayes her now.

               <p>This was the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt <hi>Ardilan</hi> and <hi>Duriana,</hi> who believed all for mo<U+017F>t infallible truths: and I have <U+017F>ince found the <U+017F>aying of my Father to be mo<U+017F>t true; which was, that if any Prince have a de<U+017F>ign to deceive another, he mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t deceive the Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adour which is employed betwixt them, becau<U+017F>e he once ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an opinion that what is told him is true, wel invent rea<U+017F>ons and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions to imprint belief, better then he could if he had lyed, So <hi>Duriana,</hi> believing my marriage as a matter mo<U+017F>t certain, and fore<U+017F>eeing future grandures upon me and her <U+017F>elf, above al hopes, I knew <U+017F>he watched for an opportunity of talk with me: but thinking it to be only about <U+017F>ome dome<U+017F>tique affaires, and never dreaming <U+017F>he could know any thing of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, I did not give her that opportunity <U+017F>he longed for. Yet at night, when we were al alone, becau<U+017F>e I did love her for the fidelity and affection to me, and <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o de<U+017F>iring to <U+017F>peak unto me; wel <hi>Duriana</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) what news have you to tel me?

               <p>The next evening, when we were all in <hi>Clotildas</hi> chamber, and my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, very earne<U+017F>t at play, by fortune I was alone at the farther end of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and he came unto me; and <U+017F>eeing that I took no notice of him, as being wholly taken up with my own thoughts, he waved his hand two or three times before my eyes, ere I did <U+017F>ee him, <U+017F>o much was my mind di<U+017F>tracted another way. I perceive <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me) that you entertain your thoughts in very <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious earne<U+017F>t: at this voice I recollected my <U+017F>elf, and rubbing my eyes as if I were newly waked out of a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>leep, I would gladly have excu<U+017F>ed my fault. Nay, fair one (<U+017F>aid he unto me) you need not be a<U+017F>hamed of your contemplation, for I am mo<U+017F>t confident it is very good, and you could not entertain your <U+017F>elf better then with it. Sir, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) I have more manners then to contradict you in any thing; but I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to <U+017F>ay, that your language proceeds either from your exce<U+017F>s of courte<U+017F>ie, or from flattery. Could you but <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elf, faire<U+017F>t, with my eyes (<U+017F>aid he unto me) you would not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o; I a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf every one will be of my opinion; and if you plea<U+017F>e to give me leave, I dare venture a wager, that I can tell what you were thinking upon when I came unto you. Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, it will be very hard for you to do it, <U+017F>ince I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell my <U+017F>elf, and I dare accept of your wager without any fear of lo<U+017F>ing. You need not fear any lo<U+017F><U+017F>e by me (an<U+017F>wered he) but what you plea<U+017F>e; for<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I am <U+017F>o much yours, that none can be more, and if you would have any thing of me, though it be my life, ask, and it <U+017F>hall not be denied.

Language (replied he) were fitter be<U+017F>towed upon another then me; I mean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whom you were thinking upon when I came towards you. I know not Sir what you mean, replied I, nor him whom you <U+017F>ay I was thinking upon; for I had no other thought but upon <U+017F>leep: You do di<U+017F><U+017F>emble fair one, <U+017F>aid he, for you were thinking upon the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e the King had with you, when he lamed your hor<U+017F>e. At this I began to blu<U+017F>h, and was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed: Nay, nay, faire<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he) never blu<U+017F>h at what I <U+017F>ay, for when you know with how much affection I adore you, you will not be <U+017F>orry that I am acquainted with the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s whereof I <U+017F>peak: I offer unto you my <U+017F>elf and <U+017F>ervice mo<U+017F>t freely; and to let you <U+017F>ee the truth of my words, I know the Kings de<U+017F>ign, and adverti<U+017F>e you, that if you do not look very unto your <U+017F>elf, he will deceive you. <hi>Ardilan</hi> and his acce<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <hi>Duriana</hi> is di<U+017F>covered in the Court, and every one thinks it tends to your di<U+017F>advantage; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that this adverti<U+017F>ement which I give unto you is the be<U+017F>t you can receive from any.</p>
               <p>He added unto this other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which did plainly evidence unto me that he knew all the Kings de<U+017F>ign, and the pandari<U+017F>me of <hi>Ardilan</hi>; and becau<U+017F>e, I thought that to deny it ab<U+017F>olutely, would but more confirm him in his belief, al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e I thought his adverti<U+017F>ement not without <U+017F>ome colour of rea<U+017F>on, I an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him thus; You tell me of a thing Sir, which if concealing it from you could hide it from my <U+017F>elf, I would <U+017F>ooner dye then confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it to you; but <U+017F>ince I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, to my misfortune make my <U+017F>elf<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>ignorant of it, I do confe<U+017F>s that the King has made <U+017F>uch an overture unto me, and I do know that <hi>Ardilan</hi> has held more communication with <hi>Duriana,</hi> then I would have her; but Sir, what remedy is there again<U+017F>t all this, <U+017F>ince it is the King, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould get out of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions <U+017F>o far that none who knows me <U+017F>hall ever hear the <U+017F>ound of my name, Do not think Sir, but I know, that the King is only plea<U+017F>ed to make him<U+017F>elf a little <U+017F>port by mocking me; but that which mo<U+017F>t vexeth me, is, that every one will be apt to cen<U+017F>ure as they plea<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>ince Sir your are plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o much upon this <U+017F>ubject, and <U+017F>ince the Title of Cavalier, be<U+017F>ide that of a great Prince, does oblige you to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t afflicted and di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Ladies, I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, what you think to be my be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e.

               <p>This was the fir<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he had with me, and becau<U+017F>e he ob<U+017F>erved <hi>Clotilda</hi> ca<U+017F>t an eye two or three times upon us, he went pre<U+017F>ently towards her to acquaint her with what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt us: but he never told her what expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions he had u<U+017F>ed of his good will unto me; only told her what he had <U+017F>aid unto me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King, and <hi>Ardilan.</hi> And <U+017F>ee, how <U+017F>ubtil he was, to make her more zealous in diverting me from the King; he <U+017F>eemed unto her as if I was not <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e unto this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s as I <U+017F>eemed unto her; and that <hi>Ardilan</hi> was crafty and <U+017F>ubtil, that if good heed was not taken he would in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly prevail with me. <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi> who was very unwilling I <U+017F>hould be deceived, did promi<U+017F>e him to have <U+017F>uch a vigilant eye over me, that neither <U+017F>he nor I <U+017F>hould be deceived; and he al<U+017F>o was very a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant in it, <U+017F>o as when to conjoyn the matter was not <U+017F>o difficult, to divert the King, and find out the <U+017F>ubtilties of the man.</p>

men only to torment us. And <U+017F>ee I be<U+017F>eech you, how crafty this young Prince was; <U+017F>ince this day he never talked to me of any thing but expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his affection to me; yet told <hi>Clotilda</hi> that he <U+017F>poke again<U+017F>t <hi>Gondebaut</hi> and <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> And they laboured the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o betwixt them, that I began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubt of the Kings promi<U+017F>es, and approve of tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> alledged: but my greate<U+017F>t wonder was, the long delay of the King <U+017F>ince my la<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer: and becau<U+017F>e I had till then concealed from the Prince<U+017F>s, the la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Ardilan</hi> had with <hi>Duriana,</hi> I re<U+017F>olved to acquaint her with it, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I feared lea<U+017F>t the Prince <U+017F>hould tell her, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he be angry with me, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e being confident, that the Prince<U+017F>s loving me as <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to to, <U+017F>he would be glad of my future grandure of it came to pa<U+017F>s, or el<U+017F>e would help me to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my <U+017F>elf. One night therefore when <U+017F>he was in bed, and according to her cu<U+017F>tom, called me, I <U+017F>aid unto her, not without a blu<U+017F>h; This candle, Madam, which I hold in my hand (for I alwayes u<U+017F>ed to hold one by her as I kneeled) will let you <U+017F>ee that I am a<U+017F>hamed of what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto you; but <U+017F>ince it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary you <U+017F>hould know it, my duty bids me not conceale it. Be plea<U+017F>ed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know, Madam, that <hi>Duriana</hi> brought me a very plea<U+017F><U+017F>ant news this morning, but truly, Madam, I cannot well tell whether I <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F>s as to tell you: <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, out with it freely and boldly, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that though it make me angry with him; yet it <U+017F>hall make me plea<U+017F>ed with you: what? is it <U+017F>ome Letter?

How? (replied <hi>Clotilda</hi>) the King marry you? <hi>Ardilan,</hi> replied I <U+017F>wore it unto <hi>Duriana</hi> with a thou<U+017F>and oaths, and gave her in charge to tell me as much. Oh Sweet-heart (replied the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e pren<U+017F>ently) take heed of believing it; it is mear poy<U+017F>on under a gilded Pill, and will ruine you; bid <hi>Duriana</hi> return this an<U+017F>wer, that if the Kings inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be honourable and advantagious to you, let him acquaint me with it, and mo<U+017F>t certainly I <U+017F>hall never contradict him; which if he do not do, then believe it, that he would deceive you. For why <U+017F>hould the King marry in <U+017F>ecret? Or if he would, how can he think it will be concealed? No, no, <hi>Dorinde,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, it is not the Kings de<U+017F>ign, but only <hi>Ardilans,</hi> who cares not how he does engage his Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>o he can but obtain his de<U+017F>ires; and therefore my advice is, that if you do not pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e words made good, to forbid <hi>Duriana</hi> <U+017F>trictly from having any farther conference with <hi>Ardilan,</hi> <U+017F>o as he may have no farther hopes of deceiving you: I wonder <hi>Duriana</hi> <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>o little di<U+017F>cretion as to bring you any <U+017F>uch me<U+017F><U+017F>ages: a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf this <U+017F>ubtle fellow has <U+017F>uborned her, either by gifts or <U+017F>ome trick or other; and if <U+017F>o, I advice you to be rid of her a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, for there is no wi<U+017F>dom in keeping per<U+017F>ons of that temper about one. Madam, replied I, I <U+017F>hall be alwayes mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervant of all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and as for <hi>Duriana,</hi> I do wonder at her as much as you, and <U+017F>hall keep <U+017F>uch an ob<U+017F>ervant eye over all her actions, as I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover the truth.</p>
               <p>Some dayes pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed before I could find a heart to break off quite with the King: for hopes of grandure had <U+017F>o dazled my eyes as cau<U+017F>ed me to delay it. In the time the young <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who was adverti<U+017F>ed of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, <U+017F>eeming to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me from the Kings Love, lo<U+017F>t no occa<U+017F>ion to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his own, but <U+017F>o cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou<U+017F>ly that <hi>Clotilda</hi> did not perceive it, but on the contrary would <U+017F>ooner have believed any thing el<U+017F>e: but when he was in a place where none could hear his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he did nothing el<U+017F>e: but expre<U+017F>s his affection: and I mu<U+017F>t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s, that if I were to chu<U+017F>e, the <U+017F>ons Love would have made me reject the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and therefore it was, that I never acquainted <hi>Clotilda</hi> with it as I ought, though I knew it to be my duty: for I was afraid to incen<U+017F>e both the Father and the Son again<U+017F>t me at one time. One day when we were in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, for winter was then pa<U+017F>t, and Trees began to put on the livery of the

Spring, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who of late was continually among<U+017F>t us, took me under the arm, and having <U+017F>eperated me a little from the re<U+017F>t of the Company, my deare<U+017F>t fair one (<U+017F>aid he unto me) I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf that you cannot chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affection which I have unto you; and <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, it <U+017F>eems <U+017F>omthing <U+017F>trange that no <U+017F>ymptomes of any pitty <U+017F>hould appear unto you. Sir, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) though your language he only to make your <U+017F>elf merry in je<U+017F>ting with me, yet I think my <U+017F>elf much obliged unto you for it; and be what it will, I take it as coming from Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> in <U+017F>uch a reverential manner as I ought to do. Did I think (<U+017F>aid he) that your heart con<U+017F>ented unto your tongue, I <U+017F>hould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly complain again<U+017F>t you: but I know <U+017F>uch an<U+017F>wers are ordinary in the mouths of <U+017F>uch fair ones as you are, and therefore, I conjure you by what you e<U+017F>teem mo<U+017F>t dear, to tell me whether you do not know that the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> is really in love with you. Your conjuration Sir, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) has <U+017F>o much prevalency in it as to draw any truth, be it never <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, from my <U+017F>oul. Be plea<U+017F>ed therefore to know Sir, that it is true, I think you wi<U+017F>h me very well, but it is no more then you own unto any that honours you, as I do. Fair one repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he pre<U+017F>ently, you think a right; for there is nothing under the Sun more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then my affection unto you; and I will <U+017F>ooner hate my <U+017F>elf then not love you in the highe<U+017F>t degree. The<U+017F>e thoughts Sir (<U+017F>aid I unto him) cannot avail you any thing at all, and may be very prejudicial unto me. The<U+017F>e thoughts, replied he, are they which can give me the greate<U+017F>t contentment that I can hope for in this world, and cannot be any way prejudicial unto you; for take this as a mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible maxime, that nothing which brings you any di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, can be plea<U+017F>ing unto me. I do know very well Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, that Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> is courte<U+017F>ie in the very ab<U+017F>tract, and a <U+017F>ervant unto all Ladies in general. Truth is, replied he, I do infinitely honour all your <U+017F>exe: but, my faire<U+017F>t, it is for your <U+017F>ake. Good Sir, (<U+017F>aid I and interrupted him) con<U+017F>ider this, that all the pains you take in your fluent Language, (admit your words to be true) is but <U+017F>o much labour lo<U+017F>t; and an honour unto me, <U+017F>o dearly bought, as if ever it be known, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do me: for what can you hope for Sir, from me? And if this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould ever come to be known, it would turn to my di<U+017F>advantage. <hi>Dorinde</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he with a more <U+017F>erious look) I will not <U+017F>ay unto you as the King does, that I will marry you, for I will never deceive you; but I will <U+017F>ay, and <U+017F>wear by all that is Sacred, that I wi<U+017F>h with all my <U+017F>oul I might marry you. And I cannot think that though this <U+017F>hould come to be known unto the world, any would blame you for it, but rather honour and e<U+017F>teem you the more, and cen<U+017F>ure it by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto you. As for the advantage or utility which I can hope for, know this my faire<U+017F>t, that I do e<U+017F>teem you <U+017F>o much, that I de<U+017F>ire no other advantage but the contentment of loving you: and if the affection be but plea<U+017F>ing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted I may <U+017F>ay that my greate<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire is accompli<U+017F>hed. I was ready to an<U+017F>wer him when one of my Companions came to tell me, that <hi>Clotilda</hi> would <U+017F>peak with me, and <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our conference broke off; for which I was not <U+017F>orry, becau<U+017F>e I found that the affection and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this young Prince, began to work upon me. But oh, how careful ought all of our age be of <U+017F>uch encounters? I had been already deceived by three or four <U+017F>mooth tongued lovers. I was not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fettered from tho<U+017F>e fallacies which the Father had laid to entrap me, and yet I know not how, I began by little and little to hearken unto the candid flatteries of the Son, and which was wor<U+017F>t of all, I was <U+017F>o taken with them that I could not guard my <U+017F>elf from them.</p>
               <p>Ever <U+017F>ince this day, that Prince did <U+017F>o continue his court<U+017F>hip, that <hi>Clotilda</hi> took notice of it; but he, crafty and wary as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw that, he <U+017F>o retired him<U+017F>elf, and kept <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>tance of indifferency towards me, as that opinion quickly vani<U+017F>hed: and be<U+017F>ides, I did contribute my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance towards it, and did adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>e him when at any time he di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elf too freely; conjuring him to keep it clo<U+017F>e, and to carry him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>cretly and warily: The<U+017F>e adverti<U+017F>ements which I gave unto him, were certain a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of the good will which I had unto him; which begot <U+017F>uch a confidence in him, that he began to write unto me, &amp; pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after to <U+017F>end me pre<U+017F>ents under the notion of the good will he bore unto all that

waited upon <hi>Clotilda,</hi> unto whom he <U+017F>ent the like pre<U+017F>ents, purpo<U+017F>ly to collour his pre<U+017F>ent unto me: He would al<U+017F>o play with me very often for wagers, and lo<U+017F>e purpo<U+017F>ely; and though his pre<U+017F>ents were never without the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es leave, yet he did alwayes accompany them with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret Letter, or copy of Ver<U+017F>es: and I received many Letters and Papers of Ver<U+017F>es from him, according to the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the pre<U+017F>ents on the accidents which hapned; but with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion, that neither the Prince<U+017F>s nor <hi>Gondebaut</hi> perceived them. And becau<U+017F>e I knew what intimacy there was betwixt <hi>Ardilan</hi> and <hi>Duriana,</hi> I kept the matter all clo<U+017F>e from her as from any other. For I confe<U+017F>s that the young Prince and the <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition which I found in him, had <U+017F>uch an influence upon me, that I fell of by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from <hi>Gondebaut</hi>: for be<U+017F>ides the affection of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond, Clotilda</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buzzing in my ears the wavering humour of the King, and how rea<U+017F>ons of <U+017F>tate would quite bla<U+017F>t al tho<U+017F>e hopes which he had given me. I was in a long di<U+017F>pute with my <U+017F>elf; but at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome good genius opened my eyes, and let me <U+017F>ee how all that <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>aid unto me was only tricks and fal<U+017F>ities. I re<U+017F>olved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the advice of <hi>Clotilda</hi> to put him to the tryal, to the end I might no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be deluded: <U+017F>o one night when <hi>Duriana</hi> by the in<U+017F>tigation of the <U+017F>ubtle <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> was harping upon the old <U+017F>tring, and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing me according to her cu<U+017F>tom, to hearken unto the Kings motion. <hi>Duriana</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) do you think. <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> is hone<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>peaks truth? Ah Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I dare <U+017F>wear he had rather dye a hundred deaths then tell one lye; I believe (<U+017F>aid I unto her) you are mi<U+017F>taken in him, and am confident he does but mock both you and me; and to <U+017F>hew you that I have good intelligence, did he not promi<U+017F>e to marry you? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but Madam, alwayes with a condition of your leave. Well (<U+017F>aid I) but if he be not a deluder, why does he not make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e? Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I never urged him unto it, but I believe, that as <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>uch a thing, he will be as forward to embrace <U+017F>uch a motion as my <U+017F>elf. Well <hi>Duriana</hi> (replied I) by little things we do often come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the greater; if <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>hould prove fal<U+017F>e in his promi<U+017F>e to you, is it not probable he is likewi<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>e in all his negotiations concerning me? Mo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he. Then, replied I, to try whether all he has <U+017F>poken from the King be true, I would have you pre<U+017F><U+017F>e him to marry you; and tell him, by way of excu<U+017F>e, that all your fellow <U+017F>ervants and <hi>Clotilda</hi> al<U+017F>o di<U+017F>likes of the familiarity betwixt you, and therefore it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that he either keep his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e in marrying you, or el<U+017F>e withdraw him<U+017F>elf ab<U+017F>olutely from you; I am mo<U+017F>t confident, that this propo<U+017F>ition will <U+017F>tartle him, and make him quickly very cold in the matter. I cannot imagine (<U+017F>aid <hi>Duriana</hi>) that <U+017F>uch a man as he <U+017F>hould fail in his promi<U+017F>e; that which mo<U+017F>t grieves me, is, that I mu<U+017F>t by this marriage lo<U+017F>e your <U+017F>ervice, which is the greate<U+017F>t grief that can come unto me. As <U+017F>he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the<U+017F>e words, tears began to trickle from her eyes: and I could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile at her <U+017F>implicity; nay, nay, <U+017F>aid I, never cry for the matter, I warrant you, your marriage with <hi>Ardilan</hi> will never part us.</p>
               <p>Now <U+017F>ee the con<U+017F>equence; <hi>Duriana</hi> <U+017F>poke to <hi>Ardilan</hi> the next time <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, as I had commanded her: and though he was as <U+017F>ubtle a fellow as any was about the Court, yet was he <U+017F>o damped at her <U+017F>peech, that he was not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer one word; at la<U+017F>t, he recollected him<U+017F>elf, and asked her, who gave her that coun<U+017F>el? Tho<U+017F>e that gave it me (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) will never deceive me, and is <U+017F>orry to hear what reports are rai<U+017F>ed concerning our familiarity: do not think that you are exempt from cen<U+017F>ure more then I, for they <U+017F>ay, you intend to deceive me which I cannot believe; but reports go that you make addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me, only to make me an in<U+017F>trument of delivering the Kings me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, an<U+017F>wered the cunning man, certainly you have devulged the Kings <U+017F>ecrets unto <U+017F>ome or other, and by this means have for ever ruined me in the opinion of my Ma<U+017F>ter: Do not think me <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creet (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Duriana</hi>) but it is true, I could not tel <hi>Dorinde</hi> tho<U+017F>e things which you de<U+017F>ired me, but I mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o tell her my Author: And is it <hi>Dorinde</hi> (replied he) who gave you coun<U+017F>el to <U+017F>peak thus unto me? Suppo<U+017F>e it he (<U+017F>aid <hi>Duriana</hi>) or whoever el<U+017F>e, it was good; for I know that mo<U+017F>t of my fellow <U+017F>ervants do grumble extreamly at our <U+017F>ecret familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53528:14"/>
The rea<U+017F>on of that is, replied he, becau<U+017F>e they are ignorant of our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Well, well, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, however they have an ill opinion of me, and if you have any mind to marry me do it quickly; for to tell you truly, <hi>Clotilda</hi> is offended at me, and does not like I <U+017F>hould live in that manner: He <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent a long while, and fixed his eyes upon the ground, which offended <hi>Duriana</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and moved her to <U+017F>ay, what is the rea<U+017F>on <hi>Ardilan</hi> you do not an<U+017F>wer me? Is the news <U+017F>o bad you cannot endure to hear it; I thought that when I made this motion you would have entertained it with open arms, and given Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks for it; but on the contrary, you are as mute as if you were tongue tyed. <hi>Duriana</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ardilan</hi>) the <U+017F>ilence which you ob<U+017F>erve in me, and which makes you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect my good will towards you, does not proceed from that cau<U+017F>e which you imagine, but from abundance of difficulty which I do fore<U+017F>ee in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and which you your <U+017F>elf will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e. When I acquainted the King with my de<U+017F>ires of marrying you, he told me, that as <U+017F>oon as I was once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I would then no longer care for the love which he bore unto <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and when I vowed the contrary unto him, no, no, replied he, I know better then you do how the enjoyment of the party loved, will take up the mind of a man: and if it <U+017F>hould do the like by you, then I am no better then dead; for unto whom then can I <U+017F>peak concerning this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e? and therefore I do po<U+017F>itively command you, as you value my Love, not to think upon any marriage, until mine be pa<U+017F>t, But <hi>Duriana</hi> (<U+017F>aid he and took her hand) be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that ere it be long I will give you your de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>atisfaction. <hi>Duriana,</hi> <U+017F>melling his fal<U+017F>hood, and not being able to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; if it be <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that the King does really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to marry <hi>Dorinde,</hi> why does he not do it? Where is the <U+017F>tick? Oh <hi>Duriana</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) the affaires of Kings are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>patched, as the affaires of a private per<U+017F>on: A great Prince has con<U+017F>iderations of his e<U+017F>tate and good of his people, which we cannot dive into. Did you but know what affection the King has unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you would wonder at it, as I have done many a time; but he cannot nor ought not lay a<U+017F>ide all other con<U+017F>iderations, and ru<U+017F>h ha<U+017F>tily upon marriage: but on the contrary he is Wi<U+017F>e and Prudent, and can lay a<U+017F>ide his pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, until he has put every thing in order, and <U+017F>o as he may enjoy his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without any danger or inconveniency: believe it, that when the time is fit, he will not need any Solicitor, nor any to put him in mind of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for his love unto her, is enough to bring her into his memory. Then <hi>Duriana</hi> finding that the advice which I gave her was but too true. Well <hi>Ardilan</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) I am <U+017F>o little ver<U+017F>ed in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of State, that I will leave it unto tho<U+017F>e who know how to manage it; but <U+017F>ince you cannot marry me until the King be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and <U+017F>ince his marriage cannot be accompli<U+017F>hed until bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of State gives him leave, I think it fit that you <U+017F>ee me no more, nor <U+017F>peak unto me concerning <hi>Dorinde</hi> until the Wi<U+017F>dome of the King hath <U+017F>et all his State affairs in order, <U+017F>o as he may have lea<U+017F>ure to make good his word, and give you leave to make good yours. Upon this not <U+017F>taying for his an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he came into my Chamber in a pelting cha<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t <hi>Ardilan,</hi> and again<U+017F>t the King, and told me her whole Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate manner, that I could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at her anger. But <U+017F>ee how fortune was bent to di<U+017F>turb my tranquility; and to <U+017F>hower mi<U+017F>eries upon me: <hi>Duriana</hi> as <U+017F>he talked with <hi>Ardilan,</hi> and pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket; <U+017F>he pulled out al<U+017F>o the paper of Ver<U+017F>es which <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>ent unto me; and which <U+017F>he unknown to me had taken out of my pocket, as <U+017F>he looked for my handkerchief to be wa<U+017F>hed. This paper being but little, and <U+017F>he half out of her wits, <U+017F>he dropt it on the ground as <U+017F>he came away from him. The crafty fellow, did pre<U+017F>ently take it up, and went away with it as fa<U+017F>t as he could to his lodging: there un<U+017F>een by any, he unfolded the paper, and read it over <U+017F>everal times, but could not judge who write it, nor to whom it was directed; yet he had a <U+017F>trong opinion that it was intended either unto her or unto me; and to which of the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>oever it was, it would <U+017F>erve him for a good excu<U+017F>e to the King concerning his negotiation. To lo<U+017F>e no time therefore, he went as fa<U+017F>t as he could to <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> from whom he did not conceal a <U+017F>illable of his conference with <hi>Duriana</hi>: after a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e together, and when the Kings hopes were

all bla<U+017F>ted, <hi>Ardilan</hi> continued thus; I cannot imagine Sir what divel it is, that thus thwarts your de<U+017F>ires: I cannot think it to be <hi>Clotilda,</hi> for I hold her to be more di<U+017F>creet and better advi<U+017F>ed then to commit <U+017F>uch a fault: and be<U+017F>ides her obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations unto you are <U+017F>o great; as it were the height of ingratitude if <U+017F>he offer to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you in any thing; but yet it is very <U+017F>trange<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> yonder fool <hi>Duriana</hi> as <U+017F>he pulled out her handkerchief did drope this paper, which un<U+017F>een to her I took up, and by it, I find that there is <U+017F>ome lurking Lover or other that courts either her or <hi>Dorinde</hi>: I know not the hand, but you may <U+017F>ee Sir whether you can pick any more out of it then I can. Upon this the King took it, and no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eye upon it but he knew it to be the hand of the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>: Oh <hi>Ardilan</hi> (<U+017F>aid he in a great fury) wonder no more from whence the alteration in <hi>Dorinde</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; It is <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> that loves her, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he loves him al<U+017F>o: heer's his hand, and from hence <hi>Durianas</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was grounded. Upon this laying the paper down upon the Table, and folding his arms together he began to walk a great pace up and down the Chamber, and was a long quarter of an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he uttered one word. At la<U+017F>t in a great rage, I will make them both repent it (<U+017F>aid he) and if I do not puni<U+017F>h them according to their de<U+017F>erts, let me no longer be taken for King <hi>Gondebaut.</hi> And to begin, go <hi>Ardilan</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) go immediately unto <hi>Clotilda,</hi> and tell her from me that I under<U+017F>tand <hi>Dorindes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour is <U+017F>o <U+017F>candalous and <U+017F>hameful, as I would have her <U+017F>end her away this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night unto <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> her father, and let her under<U+017F>tand the rea<U+017F>on why I would not have her entertain her any longer: From thence go unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and command him from me to retire him<U+017F>elf into <hi>Gallogurio</hi>; unto which place I confine him until he further hear my plea<U+017F>ure: bid him begone in the morning before day, and let none <U+017F>een him; and that if he fail in my commands, I will put him into a place where he <U+017F>hall lear his duty. Afterwards, beginning to walk again, <U+017F>tamping his foot again<U+017F>t the floor, and pulling his hat over his eyes, he u<U+017F>ed all the actions of a di<U+017F>tracted per<U+017F>on. <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>eeing him in this condition, he was the mo<U+017F>t perplexed man in the world: for he fore<U+017F>aw, that to carry the<U+017F>e me<U+017F><U+017F>ages unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Clotilda,</hi> would be his ruine: and on the other <U+017F>ide, not to do the Kings commands was wor<U+017F>e, and more certain ruine; <U+017F>o as he knew not which way to turn him<U+017F>elf, and repented heartly that ever he <U+017F>hewed this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto the King.</p>
               <p>There was none in the chamber, but the King and <hi>Ardilan</hi>; but in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drob which was clo<U+017F>e by, it fortuned that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> intelligencer was there, who hearing the name of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> began to hearken very attentively unto what the King <U+017F>aid; and heard the har<U+017F>h command which the King impo<U+017F>ed upon <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>; of which he thought to acquaint <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> immediately; and in order to that he went down a back pair of <U+017F>tairs and ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could to the young Prince, who he found in his Clo<U+017F>et.</p>
               <p>Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I made all the ha<U+017F>t I could, to adverti<U+017F>e you of a thing which your prudence mu<U+017F>t prevent, otherwi<U+017F>e, I fear a great <U+017F>torm will fall upon us. I under<U+017F>tand that the King is extreamly in Love with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Ardilan</hi> is his Agent in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, who brought him a paper of Ver<U+017F>es which you had writ unto <hi>Dorinde</hi>: and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Duriana, Dorindes</hi> Chamber-maid, gave <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer contrary to her cu<U+017F>tom, the King conceives the rea<U+017F>on of it to be from <hi>Dorindes</hi> loving you: you know Sir, that no pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion is more violent then jealou<U+017F>ie in Love; and the King is entered into <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate anger again<U+017F>t you and again<U+017F>t her, as he has commanded <hi>Ardilan,</hi> to did <hi>Clotilda</hi> from him, to <U+017F>end away <hi>Dorinde</hi> immediately unto <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> her Father, and to tell her withal that her behaviour is <U+017F>o <U+017F>candalous, that he would not have <U+017F>uch a one to keep her company; Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible (<U+017F>aid the young Prince) that the King <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o far tran<U+017F>ported with pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as to commit <U+017F>o great inju<U+017F>tice again<U+017F>t that wi<U+017F>e Woman? Nay Sir, replied the man, this is not all, his anger does reflect al<U+017F>o upon you: Again<U+017F>t me? (<U+017F>aid the Prince) yes Sir, <U+017F>aid the man, again<U+017F>t you, and I cannot tell whether or no I dare acquaint you; Speak freely, replied the Prince, and fear not that any thing can anger me more, then the di<U+017F>grace which is prepared for <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Then Sir, continued the man, he has commanded <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilan</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53528:15"/>
to come unto you, and bid you from him, depart to morrow before day and confine your <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Gallo-Liguria,</hi> till you receive his farther commands; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <U+017F>uch menace unto his me<U+017F><U+017F>age, as I cannot well tell whether or no he be in his right <U+017F>en<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>Friend (<U+017F>aid the Prince) I hope the Kings anger will wear away with time, and haply he means not <U+017F>o ill as he <U+017F>ays; however, I thank you heartily for the pains you have in my behalf, I de<U+017F>ire you to continue it, and believe in that I <U+017F>hall die very young if you die unrewarded: Go therefore, and hear what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther news, and adverti<U+017F>e me with all <U+017F>peed, that I may prepare as good remedies as I can.</p>
               <p>Thus they parted; and <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> came to me in <U+017F>uch a rage again<U+017F>t <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> that had not I re<U+017F>trained him, I think he had gone beyond the re<U+017F>pects of a <U+017F>on due to a Father; and I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, that this action of this young Prince, did infinitely plea<U+017F>e me. <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me, after he had told me all he heard) I <U+017F>ee that my affection unto you procures you all this mi<U+017F>ery, and my misfortune is the cau<U+017F>e of yours: But let me tell you my opinion, which is. That I do not think the Kings anger proceeds only from the love he <U+017F>ee. I bear unto you, but much more from the good will he fears you bear unto me; and were I as happy as that his fears were true, I would give you the <U+017F>ame coun<U+017F>el that I will take my <U+017F>elf. You may be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, that your good will has obliged me to honour you, as I ought to do. Honour (an<U+017F>wered he) I do look for from tho<U+017F>e who mu<U+017F>t hereafter be my <U+017F>ubjects; but from <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I require love. If that word, replied I, were hand<U+017F>ome in the mouth of a woman, I think (to content you) I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak it. <hi>Dorinde,</hi> replied he pre<U+017F>ently, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto you is <U+017F>uch, as I had rather die, then entertain any thoughts which are di<U+017F>honourable to you; and <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to give me this te<U+017F>timony of your good will, I am fully contented and <U+017F>hall from this hour, think my <U+017F>elf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie<U+017F>t man that lives: and I am re<U+017F>olved, my Faire<U+017F>t, in de<U+017F>pite of the King, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to call him Father; and will in <U+017F>pite of him, love you double to what I did before: and deare<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> if you do love me, put you on the <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>olution. Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, I do prote<U+017F>t to love you in <U+017F>pite of all the world, as much as my honour will give me leave. Then did I <U+017F>ee in this young Prince <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden and great alteration, as a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me of the contentment which my words did give unto him; but the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which he u<U+017F>ed at the <U+017F>ame time, did much more a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me. For my part (<U+017F>aid he unto me, and took my hand) I do promi<U+017F>e and vow unto you, my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> by all that is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>acred and holy, that I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the very utmo<U+017F>t of my power, never to have any other wife but you: and were it in my free di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e, I would this very hour receive you as my wife, but <U+017F>ince my will does depend upon another, I cannot, unle<U+017F>s I <U+017F>hould abu<U+017F>e you, <U+017F>ay any more; only I be<U+017F>eech you (continued he, and put a Ring upon my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) to take and keep this Ring as a pledge of what I now do promi<U+017F>e. and more, that I will never marry, unle<U+017F>s your bad Fortune con<U+017F>train you to marry before me. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, and blu<U+017F>hed for <U+017F>hame, though I never receive any other contentment then this honour of your love, yet I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>teem my <U+017F>elf, as long as I live, the happie<U+017F>t woman that ever was; and in te<U+017F>timony of this, I take this Ring, with the <U+017F>ame prote<U+017F>tations and vows that you have made. But Sir (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I) notice will be taken of our actions, and therefore (I be<U+017F>eech you) let us break off di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Now, my Faire<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he unto me) I have <U+017F>o much intere<U+017F>t in you, as I mu<U+017F>t needs be careful of any thing that concerns you, and therefore I cannot brook that the fury of the Kings pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould offer this injury unto you: if you think it expedient, I will tell him as much to his face, and will not <U+017F>tartle at all his anger; for it is no <U+017F>uch capital crime to love a fair Lady: I do believe that at the fir<U+017F>t he will be extreamly angry at it, but he will cool again at la<U+017F>t, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him<U+017F>elf; then he cannot chu<U+017F>e but confe<U+017F>s, that the equality of our ages pleads more rea<U+017F>on to love each other, then he has to think, that the flowers in your fair face will ever grow in the winter of his age. Oh Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, take heed of the fury of a King. Deare<U+017F>t (an<U+017F>wered he) we will u<U+017F>e all the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we can; but the very truth is, I value not any mi<U+017F>ery that can full out,

<U+017F>o <hi>Dorinde</hi> be not compri<U+017F>ed in it. Upon this, without <U+017F>tay for any an<U+017F>wer, he went away to enquire what news of the King, who in the mean time was in clo<U+017F>e coun<U+017F>el with that arch Traytor <hi>Ardilan</hi>: for as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> intelligencer was gone, the King turning about, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>till there? How now? <U+017F>aid he unto him, are not you gone yet whither I commanded you? Sir, an<U+017F>wered be, I <U+017F>tay to know whether you will plea<U+017F>e to command me any thing el<U+017F>e: No, no, replied he, but go immediately and execute my Will. <hi>Ardilan</hi> then drawing neerer him, But Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, If the Prince <U+017F>hould ask me the rea<U+017F>on why you <U+017F>end him this command, what <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>ay? Tell him (replied <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> It is for his di<U+017F>-re<U+017F>pect of me in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s concerning <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and to <U+017F>top his mouth if he offer to deny it, take that paper that lies upon the Table, <U+017F>hew it him. Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ardilan,</hi> and took the paper, I know what an<U+017F>wer he will make, and if you plea<U+017F>e I will tell you. What an<U+017F>wer can he make (<U+017F>aid the King) but only confe<U+017F>s his fault, or tell a lye? No Sir, replied <hi>Ardilan.</hi> not lye neither; for he will <U+017F>ay that he never knew of your love to <hi>Dorinde</hi>; if he had, that he would never have offered it: And truly Sir, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould: for the matter has been carried <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that I believe none in the world knows it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly You, <hi>Dorinde, Dariana,</hi> and I: and <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, me-thinks his crime not <U+017F>o great, as at the fir<U+017F>t you thought it. What then (<U+017F>aid the King) would you have me to do? Upon this he began to walk again, but a little more calmly then at the fir<U+017F>t. <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>eeing the Kings anger begin to cool; Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto him and <U+017F>miled) I could never have believed that great Kings could ever have loved <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as I <U+017F>ee you do; I am confident you are not a little <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it: for I <U+017F>ee a little blow makes a great wound in you, el<U+017F>e you would never let a poor <U+017F>illy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ver<U+017F>es, which perhaps were writ without de<U+017F>igne, only to pa<U+017F>s away the time, to put you into <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>order: Pardon me Sir, if I <U+017F>ay you were a little too ha<U+017F>ty. Well, well (<U+017F>aid the King) but <hi>Ardilan,</hi> you have no rea<U+017F>on to blame me for a fault which you are guilty of your <U+017F>elf; for was it not you that told me fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> loved <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and that this was the only rea<U+017F>on of her rejecting me? True Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ardilan</hi>) I did <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, but it was only out of opinion; and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, had I thought it would have thus offended you, I <U+017F>hould not have acquainted you with it, till I was better informed: for Sir, <U+017F>ee into what a <U+017F>trange confu<U+017F>ion you are ready to bring every thing, for to ruine all your hopes in the main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: Secondly to bla<U+017F>t the honour of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and all her Family. Thirdly, To <U+017F>candal the hou<U+017F>e of the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda</hi>? And la<U+017F>tly, To ruine your own Son. But now, I hope your goodne<U+017F>s and prudence, which hath furmounted the fury of this violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, will denote this day to be the happie<U+017F>t of all your Raigne; for on it you have obtained the greate<U+017F>t victory that ever youd id in all your life; for you have overcome your <U+017F>elf. <hi>Ardilan</hi> continued on his flatteries, and as we under<U+017F>tood by <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> Intelligencer, at la<U+017F>t concluded thus: Now Sir, this is my opinion upon the whole matter, If you <U+017F>hould adverti<U+017F>e the Prince of his affection unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and de<U+017F>ire him for your <U+017F>ake to retire him<U+017F>elf from that affection, and keep the matter <U+017F>ecret; if he after this overture <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till continue, then had you ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to complain again<U+017F>t him for his <U+017F>mall re<U+017F>pect of you: But however you have no cau<U+017F>e, nor colour of a cau<U+017F>e to blame <hi>Dorinde,</hi> before you know whether <U+017F>he loves him or no: for Lovers do often convey <U+017F>uch papers unto their Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es, and they not know from whence they came: I <U+017F>hould advi<U+017F>e therefore, that <hi>Clotilda</hi> forbid her from you, from having any more talk with him, or receiving any more pre<U+017F>ents from him; after this, they are both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excu<U+017F>e if they continue.</p>
               <p>This was the advice of <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who added <U+017F>till more expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions by way of explanation: and the King who had a great confidence in him, after <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, did approve of it; and thereupon commanded him to go pre<U+017F>ently and put what he had propo<U+017F>ed in execution; which he did with more alacrity then he <U+017F>hould the fir<U+017F>t commands. He went therefore fir<U+017F>t to the Prince<U+017F>s, unto whom he made known the opinion which the King had of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> addre<U+017F>s unto <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi>; and to <U+017F>hew her upon what grounds it was, he <U+017F>hewed her tho<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es which <hi>Dariana</hi> lo<U+017F>t; at which the Prince<U+017F>s was much amazed: yet like a wi<U+017F>e and

               <p>As fortune was, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> was not then in the Town, being gone after dinner to hunt towards the Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>Eri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) I had no mind to an<U+017F>wer unto your que<U+017F>tion, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of her who is mo<U+017F>t intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in it, to the end the an<U+017F>wer which I <U+017F>hall make may be <U+017F>ooner credited, and <U+017F>he exempted from all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation.

Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, and blu<U+017F>hed, I cannot give any an<U+017F>wer, but that I do not (yet I wi<U+017F>h I did) merit <U+017F>o great an honour. How? replied <hi>Clotilda,</hi> Dare you pre<U+017F>ume to love the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and would have him love you again? The young Prince then interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, for he <U+017F>aw that mode<U+017F>ty would not permit me to <U+017F>peak. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he, you can hardly have a more ample declaration then this Fair one hath given you; but I will make it for us both, and I think <U+017F>he will <U+017F>econd me. Then taking my hand, See Si<U+017F>ter this Ring (<U+017F>aid he unto her) which <hi>Dorinde</hi> wears; I did give it unto her as a Pledge, that if I could marry her at this very in<U+017F>tant, I would: but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of a Father, and not able to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf, without offence to the Laws of God and man, I will <U+017F>tay until I have his con<U+017F>ent, or till time di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with me from that duty.

Si<U+017F>ter, replied the Prince, If I have offended you, I mu<U+017F>t heartily beg your pardon; and above all, I mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>tly be<U+017F>eech you to let all the blame reflect upon me, and nothing upon this Fair one; and if my life, or any thing el<U+017F>e will expiate the crime, I am here mo<U+017F>t ready to obey what<U+017F>oever you plea<U+017F>e to command: only I beg of you, as you love me, not to be angry in the lea<U+017F>t manner with <hi>Dorinde</hi>: for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Si<U+017F>ter, that if we have offended, it was only in point of time; for we were both of us fully re<U+017F>olved to acquaint you and put our <U+017F>elves into your hands.

But Brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Prine<U+017F>s, Why did you not acquaint me with your intention at the fir<U+017F>t? At the fir<U+017F>t, I could not, replied the Prince, becau<U+017F>e then I could not tell whether I <U+017F>hould love her, or whether <U+017F>he would entertain my affection. But <U+017F>ince (<U+017F>aid <hi>Clotilda</hi>) why did you not tell me, when you were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of both? And <U+017F>he, who talked <U+017F>o freely with me concerning the Kings addre<U+017F>s, why did not <U+017F>he as well acquaint me with yours? Si<U+017F>ter, replied the Prince, If ever you chance to love any one, you will an<U+017F>wer this Que<U+017F>tion: You mu<U+017F>t know, that when one loves, it is not a work that is begun with de<U+017F>igne: He that walks upon a piece of Ice, do you think his de<U+017F>igne is to fall? No, it is a <U+017F>urprize cau<U+017F>ed by the <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s of the Ice: <U+017F>o it is in Love, When one <U+017F>ees a Beauty, this Beauty does <U+017F>urprize, and makes us in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly glide into love, and we are become Lovers, before ere we thought of being in love. We do prote<U+017F>t unto you Si<U+017F>ter, and I can an<U+017F>wer for this Fair one as well as for my <U+017F>elf, that within the<U+017F>e two days we did not think it would ever have proceeded <U+017F>o far; but the Intelligence which we had that the King would by extream tyrannry break off all affection betwixt us, was the cau<U+017F>e of our re<U+017F>olution to contract: and it was no <U+017F>ooner re<U+017F>olv'd upon, but we intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, and follow your wi<U+017F>e and prudent advice in every thing; and <U+017F>orry we are you knew it no <U+017F>ooner. But <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, the thing is pa<U+017F>t and done, and now all coun<U+017F>el comes too late, and we can do nothing el<U+017F>e but mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>tly beg your pardon.</p>
               <p>Brother, <U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F>s, two things do give me great <U+017F>atisfaction: The one is, to <U+017F>ee the confidence that you have in me, in freely acquainting me with a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, which if known to the King, would certainly be very prejudicial to you: and the other is, To <U+017F>ee your affection aim at a noble and honourable end; and in this I cannot charge you with any fault: But all the errour that has been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is in <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who knew very well that it was her duty to tell me; <U+017F>he could be free enough in acquainting me with the Kings Court<U+017F>hip, but concealed yours <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtilly, that God knows whether I <U+017F>hould ever have known it, but for the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h <hi>Duriana</hi>; yet Brother, for your <U+017F>ake, I will not only pardon her, but more, I promi<U+017F>e you both to forget it; or if I do remember it, it <U+017F>hall be only to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you as much as I can, for I do fore<U+017F>ee a great controver<U+017F>ie to en<U+017F>ue betwixt the King and you. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid the Prince, this Fair one and I are infinitely obliged unto you for your pardon, and promi<U+017F>ed a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and as for the King, we have armed our <U+017F>elves with re<U+017F>olution to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t all that he can do again<U+017F>t us: we are not culpable of any capital crimes: If the King tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s the bounds of a Father to a Son, I <U+017F>hall tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s the bounds of a <U+017F>on to a Father; and <U+017F>ince we have right on our <U+017F>ide, we <U+017F>hall be more contented then you can imagine.</p>
               <p>The Prince after this, and <U+017F>ome expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of thanks, would have gone away, becau<U+017F>e he was weary with hunting, but <hi>Clotilda</hi> <U+017F>tayed him; Brother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) before you go, let us advi<U+017F>e what I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay unto the King concerning the me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age which <hi>Ardilan</hi> brought unto me from him.

               <p>In the morning, <hi>Ardilan</hi> was <U+017F>o early at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> that he found him in bed; and <U+017F>aying that he came from the King, he was pre<U+017F>ently admitted. <hi>Ardilan</hi> de<U+017F>iring that none might hear what he <U+017F>aid, be<U+017F>eeched the Prince to command all the <U+017F>ervants to with-draw, which <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> did; and then he began thus.</p>
               <p>I come Sir, from the King your Father, to communicate unto you <U+017F>ome news which he hath received from King <hi>Alerick,</hi> and which he thinks it requi<U+017F>ite to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you withal. <hi>Ardilan</hi> made this his Prologue by command from <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> who thought it good to begin with that preamble. <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> who was no lover of <hi>Ardilan,</hi> did an<U+017F>wer with a <U+017F>mile; I thought <hi>Ardilan</hi> your <U+017F>ervice of the King had been only in negotiations of love; but I <U+017F>ee you are become a State<U+017F>man, <U+017F>ince the King communicates unto you <U+017F>uch Forreign News. <hi>Ardilan</hi> who was doubtle<U+017F>s as <U+017F>ubtle a man as any of his time, did very well under<U+017F>tand the Princes meaning: but <U+017F>eeming to take no notice of it, Truly Sit, <U+017F>aid he unto the Prince, you are not much be<U+017F>ide the mark, for the me<U+017F><U+017F>age which I am to deliver, is indeed matter of Love: for the King has received an an<U+017F>wer from his Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors which he <U+017F>ent unto the King of the Vi<U+017F>igots, to treat about a marriage betwixt you and one of his daughters; that they have received a very good an<U+017F>wer, and hope to bring the matter to a good conclu<U+017F>ion. Now the King who <U+017F>tudies your welfare and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, has <U+017F>ent me to acquaint you with it, to the end you may prepare your <U+017F>elf for a voyage which he would have you make in an equipage be<U+017F>itting the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Prince.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> who was adverti<U+017F>ed betimes in the morning of all the <U+017F>tratagem, did ask <hi>Ardilan</hi> where tho<U+017F>e Letters from the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors were. The King keeps them, replied <hi>Ardilan,</hi> becau<U+017F>e (as I believe) they contain <U+017F>ome things which he would have kept <U+017F>ecret from me. How <hi>Ardilan,</hi> replied the Prince) does the King keep any thing <U+017F>ecret from you? Surely it is not <U+017F>o; for me-thinks he who does not hide his mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret thoughts from you, <U+017F>hould hide nothing el<U+017F>e. Does not the King Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ardilan</hi>) hide his mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret thoughts from me, I be<U+017F>eech you Sir, who tells you the<U+017F>e Tales? Why all the Court can tell it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>: Witne<U+017F>e the marriage that you did negotiate for him <U+017F>o <U+017F>lily: Witne<U+017F>s the poor Hor<U+017F>e that you lamed, and witne<U+017F>s all your negotiations unto the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda,</hi> to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you in your de<U+017F>igns; and would you now make me believe that the King will not tru<U+017F>t you with a Letter? No, no <hi>Ardilan,</hi> I am too neer a neighbour to you to be ignorant what credit you have with him, I would to God his Son had as much. <hi>Ardilan</hi> hearing this, was <U+017F>o blank'd, that he knew not what to an<U+017F>wer; but like a man of a quick and pre<U+017F>ent wit, he <U+017F>oon recollected him<U+017F>elf, and thought it be<U+017F>t to turn all to Rallery, and <U+017F>o divert the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

Be plea<U+017F>ed Sir to know, that what I <U+017F>ay does neerly concern your e<U+017F>tate: You have no Neighbours whom you need to fear, but <hi>Thierry, Alarick,</hi> and the King of the Franks; As for <hi>Thierry,</hi> you have alliance with him already: As for the King of Franks, he is a Neighbour to be feared, and watches his opportunity to make attempts upon your Dominions, he wants neither will nor means to do it: And this con<U+017F>ideration invited the King your father to <U+017F>end his Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors unto the King of the Vi<U+017F>igots, who<U+017F>e power once joyned with yours, and the O<U+017F>trogots is <U+017F>uch, as will give a check unto all the ambitious de<U+017F>igns which the Franks can have again<U+017F>t you. Now Sir, this Treaty is brought to as good a period as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire; but it <U+017F>eems in lieu of being glad, you mock at it, as if it did not concern you. <hi>Ardilan</hi> (an<U+017F>wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who extreamly feared the anger of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> after he had waited a while, was con<U+017F>trained to go away without any di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the love which he bore unto me, and much le<U+017F>s of the Kings, unto whom he related word for word all that the Prince had <U+017F>aid unto him; and afterwards added, Give me leave to tell you Sir, <U+017F>aid he, that I think there is none can compo<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>orders better then the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda</hi>: For fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he has the <U+017F>ole power over <hi>Dorinde.</hi> And <U+017F>econdly, I <U+017F>ee the Prince does love her, and has a great confidence in her.

Now Si<U+017F>ter, the King intends to come unto you and to command you to u<U+017F>e your power in breaking off all amity betwixt <hi>Dorinde</hi> and me; for my part, I prote<U+017F>t by heaven, that death <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>eize upon me, then any <U+017F>eparation from her: and yet the cunning <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who loves neither you nor me, would make the King believe, that you have the ab<U+017F>olute power over <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and that you can do what you will with me: <U+017F>o as you mu<U+017F>t take good heed of the King, for he will employ you; and if all <U+017F>ucceed not to his mind, he will be apt to do you <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief; the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that I know, is to prevent him, I mean, that before he come to you, <U+017F>end you unto him, and be<U+017F>eech him to let you come and communicate <U+017F>ome affairs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he <U+017F>hould know; when you are with him, I would have you make a great complaint unto him again<U+017F>t me, and my love to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Be<U+017F>eech him to employ all his prudence in preventing it; that for your part, you have done all you can, and all to no purpo<U+017F>e, for when you <U+017F>poke unto me of it, I told you plainly that I did love <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that it was a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible ever to <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate me from her; and the wor<U+017F>t of all is, that you think <hi>Dorinde</hi> al<U+017F>o loves me, and that things are gone <U+017F>o far, that you fear there is <U+017F>ome promi<U+017F>es pa<U+017F>t betwixt her and me.</p>
               <p>I make no que<U+017F>tion (continued the Prince) but the King will be very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me; but Si<U+017F>ter, of two evils, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er is to be cho<U+017F>en: <U+017F>hould his fury be turned towards you, it would be wor<U+017F>e; you know how he u<U+017F>ed <hi>Chilperick,</hi> the cruel death of <hi>Godomar,</hi> the ma<U+017F><U+017F>acres of his male children, the hard u<U+017F>age of your Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Mutucuna,</hi> in cloy<U+017F>tering her up among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals: To be brief, Si<U+017F>ter, the<U+017F>e bloody cruelties upon tho<U+017F>e from whom you are de<U+017F>cended, makes me extreamly fear his fury <U+017F>hould fall upon you: But for my part, what can he do but drive me out of his pre<U+017F>ence as he would have done before? And I prote<U+017F>t <hi>Clotilda,</hi> that I do <U+017F>o much abominate his violences, as were he not my father, and <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently I bound to honour and <U+017F>erve him, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ooner de<U+017F>ire to be out of his <U+017F>ight, then any ones living; <U+017F>o that his puni<U+017F>hment will be a kind of a plea<U+017F>ure unto me.</p>
               <p>The Prince<U+017F>s who did extreamly love <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> as well becau<U+017F>e he loved her, as becau<U+017F>e of his many other good qualities, after many thanks unto him for his indulgent care of her, <U+017F>he endeavoured by all her arguments and rea<U+017F>ons to divert him from his affection to me, demon<U+017F>trating unto him the great inconveniences he would draw upon him<U+017F>elf by it; in<U+017F>tancing the lowne<U+017F>s of my quality, what a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful

graceful alliance it would be to his Royal Family, how much it would di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e the King, hinting unto him the duty and obedience that he owed unto him as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as his King; Briefly, <U+017F>he laid before him all the inconveniencies and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents that would en<U+017F>ue upon it. Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) in an<U+017F>wer unto all the<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderations, I will u<U+017F>e but one word, and that is, <hi>I Love</hi>: and did you but know the validity, extent, and power of this word, you would confe<U+017F>s all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to be poor and weak arguments to divert me from my unalterable re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clotilda,</hi> and <U+017F>ince you advi<U+017F>e me to it. I will talk with the King according to your directions, and will let you know his an<U+017F>wer. Upon this, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>patched one of her <U+017F>ervants to the King immediately, according as it was re<U+017F>olved upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gondebaut</hi> hearing this me<U+017F><U+017F>age, <U+017F>ent her word, that he al<U+017F>o had <U+017F>omthing to communicate unto her, and that after dinner he would come unto her. The Prince knowing this an<U+017F>wer, and having no mind to be in the way, he took hor<U+017F>e, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to hunt; and <U+017F>o kept him<U+017F>elf out of Town all the day.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus, <hi>Arcingenterix</hi> my father being very old, and fallen <U+017F>ick of a Fever, he grew <U+017F>o ill, as being pa<U+017F>t hopes of life, he <U+017F>ent unto <hi>Clotilda,</hi> to be<U+017F>eech her that I might come and <U+017F>ee him before he died: Upon this <U+017F>he commanded me to go in all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te, and to tell him from her, that <U+017F>he would <U+017F>end him <U+017F>ome things which haply might conduce to his pre<U+017F>ervation, and thereupon gave me <U+017F>ome excellent receipts, which I carried with me. My poor father, as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw me, and heard what the Prince<U+017F>s had <U+017F>ent unto him, he <U+017F>eemed to receive much contentment; and taking me by the hand, I hope (<U+017F>aid he unto me) <hi>Tautates</hi> will provide one that will be a <U+017F>tay unto thy youth, for now daughter reckon your <U+017F>elf without a father; and therefore be<U+017F>eech the Prince<U+017F>s from me, to have pity upon <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as upon an Orphan left to the wide wicked world, without any <U+017F>upport and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, but from God and her; it will be (tell her, a charitable office, and God will reward it double: after this, my father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faint, notwith<U+017F>tanding all remedies that could be applied, and in the night after he died.</p>
               <p>The King in the interim, as <U+017F>oon as dinner was done, failed not to go unto the Prince<U+017F>s; and taking her a<U+017F>ide, he began to make great complaints of the Prince; but <U+017F>he who had been well in<U+017F>tructed, prevented him, and told him, that <U+017F>he had a very great de<U+017F>ire to talk with him about a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of great importance, in which <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eeched him to take <U+017F>ome order: And thereupon <U+017F>he related unto him how <U+017F>he had chidden me for tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es which were <U+017F>ent unto me and which I had received unknown to her: Afterwards <U+017F>he complained again<U+017F>t the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> for tampering with one of her women; nay wor<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>covered an intimate affection betwixt us: Nay wor<U+017F>e then all that, <U+017F>he was afraid the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was gone <U+017F>o far, that the Prince had engaged him<U+017F>elf by <U+017F>ome promi<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! cryed out <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> has <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> engaged him<U+017F>elf by promi<U+017F>e unto <hi>Dorinde</hi>? Is he <U+017F>o far out of his wits?

When you commanded me to forbid <hi>Dorinde</hi> from any <U+017F>peech with the Prince, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me, That if he came to her, <U+017F>he could not drive him away: And when I asked her why <U+017F>he received tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es without my knowledge, <U+017F>he replied. That the good will which the Prince was plea<U+017F>ed to honour her withal, was to <U+017F>uch intentions as could not offend any. And when I urged her to tell me what tho<U+017F>e intentions were; Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) the Prince can tell you better then I, if you plea<U+017F>e to ask him: and afterwards do what I could, I could not draw one word from her. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e Sir, did exceedingly trouble me; and this morning when he was plea<U+017F>ed to come unto me, I re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>peak unto him as privately as I could; when I was urgent with him to di<U+017F>cover the truth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained again<U+017F>t the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> he gave a cold faint an<U+017F>wer, in the<U+017F>e terms.

And I an<U+017F>wering, yes; Then Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he, Love <hi>Dorinde</hi> as your Si<U+017F>ter: Judge Sir the meaning of the<U+017F>e

               <p>This News did <U+017F>o nettle the King, that though he was a man which could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him<U+017F>elf well enough when he would, yet could he not chu<U+017F>e but give great <U+017F>igns of his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure: for after he <U+017F>tood a while mute, he grumbled to him<U+017F>elf in a low voice; Is the heart of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is <U+017F>uch a fault, as if I did not re<U+017F>ent it, I might be cen<U+017F>ured as dulpable as he is: And therefore I will make appear to all the world, that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> does not con<U+017F>ent unto the <U+017F>in of his Son. Then turning towards <hi>Clotilda</hi>; I thank you (<U+017F>aid he unto her) and think my <U+017F>elf much obliged unto you for your adverti<U+017F>ements; and to make it appear how kindly I take them, you <U+017F>hall obtain from me what<U+017F>oever you can de<U+017F>ire: I was very de<U+017F>irous to talk with you about the <U+017F>ame bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, though I could not imagine things to be at this height; but I <U+017F>ee you have prevented me, and are de<U+017F>irous to turn this ra<U+017F>h incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderate young man from his de<U+017F>tructive de<U+017F>ignes: if you continue thus obliging me, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>et you in <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> room, and he <U+017F>hall be as indifferent unto me, as the meane<U+017F>t man in my Dominions. Sir (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clotilda,</hi> and accompanied the King, who was going away) I can never do you <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervices as your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s obligeth me unto: But Sir, I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you not to deprive the Prince (my brother) of the honour of your favour, for a few extravagancies of youth, which doubtle<U+017F>s he will repent, when he knows that they di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. Con<U+017F>ider Sir, he is your <U+017F>on, and young, and it is unto Fathers whom God has given wi<U+017F>dom and prudence to in<U+017F>truct, not to de<U+017F>troy their children. <hi>Clotilda</hi> replied he, and took his leave, you are too wi<U+017F>e for your young years; I would to heaven <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> would imitate you in obedience, or el<U+017F>e that he were in his grave.</p>
               <p>Then the King went pre<U+017F>ently to his chamber, and related unto <hi>Ardilan</hi> all that <hi>Clotilda</hi> had told him: and after a thou<U+017F>and menaces, <U+017F>omtimes again<U+017F>t the Prince, and <U+017F>omtimes me, the Kings mind was <U+017F>o enflamed with two violent pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> that he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly re<U+017F>olve upon any <U+017F>etled cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, the Prince being returned from hunting, he came pre<U+017F>ently to the Prince<U+017F>s, to know what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt <hi>Gondebaut</hi> and her; and <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating all that was <U+017F>aid and done; Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) I thank God with all my heart, that the anger of the King reflects only upon me, and that you are exempt: I <U+017F>hall now with a calm mind undergo what<U+017F>oever he will plea<U+017F>e to impo<U+017F>e upon me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for though he lay the fault upon me, yet all the world will excu<U+017F>e me; Then ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where I was, and being told that my Father was dead: If I dur<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he) I would go and help to lament her lo<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>ince that is not permitted, Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) do you think it would be ami<U+017F>s if I <U+017F>ent unto her?

You mu<U+017F>t force <hi>Dorinde</hi> to marry, for if <U+017F>he do love the Prince, no puni<U+017F>hment can be more <U+017F>harp; the Prince al<U+017F>o will vex to <U+017F>ee her whom he loved <U+017F>o dearly, in the arms of another, and be out of all hopes to <U+017F>ee her his.

And if <U+017F>he be <U+017F>tubborn, and will not marry him, who will blame you if you force her. The Phy<U+017F>itian knows better what is good for the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e then the Patient; <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>ick mu<U+017F>t be taken by force; and her father being dead, you may cover your de<U+017F>igne with a cloak of piety, and will not <U+017F>ee the childe of <hi>Arcingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> without a Guardian: Be<U+017F>ides, there is a way to make her marry without u<U+017F>ing your Royal Authority. There is a Law Sir, which from the Vi<U+017F>igots is come to us, by which it is ordained, That the Father having made a promi<U+017F>e of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto one, and die, <U+017F>he being unmarried, his promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall be made good after his death.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Clotilda</hi> told me (replied the King) that there is <U+017F>ome promi<U+017F>es already pa<U+017F>t betwixt them. No matter for that (replied <hi>Ardilan</hi>) for you mu<U+017F>t know Sir, that there is another Law which ordains, that if a woman di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elf otherwi<U+017F>e then as her Father would have her, both <U+017F>he, and he who married her, <U+017F>hall be put into the hands of him to whom the Father did promi<U+017F>e her, to be <U+017F>old or u<U+017F>ed as he plea<U+017F>eth: Since Sir, <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e two Laws are in force, why may not you marry <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto <hi>Periander</hi> or <hi>Merindor,</hi> <U+017F>ince <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e unto them both: In the fir<U+017F>t place, <U+017F>end unto her, and let her know, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53528:19"/>
you will provide her a match for her contentment; that this your care proceeds from your love unto her father and her; and that you will give her the choice of one of tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers for a Husband: You may <U+017F>end the <U+017F>ame me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto others of her kinred, and <U+017F>o oblige them likewi<U+017F>e; for it is no mean prudence in a Prince, to oblige many by one benefit; I am confident that if <U+017F>he make a dor at the motion, her friends will per<U+017F>wade her; and if <U+017F>he be ob<U+017F>tinate, they will be the fir<U+017F>t that will blame her, and commend you though you <U+017F>hould compel her unto it by force: And then God knows what will become of her, when <U+017F>he has none to <U+017F>upport her: For the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda,</hi> I dare <U+017F>ay will have nothing to do with her, <U+017F>he is betrer advi<U+017F>ed, and will not do any thing that <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. The King liked this advice, and re<U+017F>olved upon it. He commanded <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to go from him unto the Prince<U+017F>s; who could give no other an<U+017F>wer, but that <U+017F>he would per<U+017F>wade her with all the arguments that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could.</p>
               <p>She <U+017F>ent immediately to the Prince, to let him know <U+017F>he would <U+017F>peak with him, and when he came, <U+017F>he acquainted him with the de<U+017F>igne: for though <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw much danger to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he would run the hazard, rather then do any thing that <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him. <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> was much amazed at the de<U+017F>igne; and the more, becau<U+017F>e his Intelligencer failed him at this time; but the rea<U+017F>on was, becau<U+017F>e he was not pre<U+017F>ent at that time when it was re<U+017F>olved upon: but he came time enough to hear the King prote<U+017F>t and <U+017F>wear. that he would marry <hi>Dorinde</hi> by fair means or by foul; and that if neither of tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers would accept of her, <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>hould, though it were <hi>Ardilan</hi> him<U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>The Prince hearing this news, and <U+017F>eeing the King had recour<U+017F>e unto extream remedies, he thought that nothing would cure his extream violences, but extream re<U+017F>olutions. He propo<U+017F>ed therefore unto <hi>Clotilda,</hi> for him and I to go out of <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Dominions, and there con<U+017F>umm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution of ab<U+017F>ence was pitched upon, it was long in debate whether I <U+017F>hould go: for, beyond the Alpes I could not, becau<U+017F>e they were allied with the O<U+017F>trogots; To the Franks was le<U+017F>s likely, becau<U+017F>e they were all in <U+017F>uch combu<U+017F>tion among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, about the new election of a King, that all was in di<U+017F>order there: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, the Queen <hi>Methina</hi> was in <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of aid and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as it was not probable <U+017F>he would entertain me again<U+017F>t the will of <U+017F>o potent a King her Neighbour. As for the Vi<U+017F>igots, the journey was too long, for I was to pa<U+017F>s through all <hi>Spain</hi>; be<U+017F>ides, there being a Treaty about a marriage with <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> there was no <U+017F>afety for me in that place: At la<U+017F>t, they concluded I <U+017F>hould go into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> with whom <hi>Clotilda</hi> held much corre<U+017F>pondency: and becau<U+017F>e they knew not whether the authority of <hi>Gondebaut</hi> would not deter her from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me <U+017F>afe protection, they thought it expedient for me to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf in this habit wherein you <U+017F>ee me, to the end that if the protection of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did fail me, the <U+017F>olitary habitation among the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon</hi> might pre<U+017F>erve me unknown.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the night time, I repaired to her, who as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me, <U+017F>he carried me into her clo<U+017F>et; where being alone together, and <U+017F>eeing me weep, <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) it is not now a time to weep and complain; you mu<U+017F>t arm your <U+017F>elf with a more couragious and generous re<U+017F>olution.

Madam (an<U+017F>wered I, and grew as pale as death) mu<U+017F>t I marry either one of tho<U+017F>e two, or <hi>Ardilan</hi>? What Law is there for that? The <U+017F>ame Law, replied <U+017F>he; that the <U+017F>tronger will impo<U+017F>e upon the weaker. He will have <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> marry a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s, whom he pretends will bring great advantage; and he knows that he will never be per<U+017F>waded unto it, till you be married unto another; and therefore he is re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>acrifice you unto the marriage of his Son, and has given me in charge to tell you as much, and to know what you re<U+017F>olve upon. Upon death, Madam (an<U+017F>wered I pre<U+017F>ently) yes the mo<U+017F>t cruel death that ever any Tyrant like him<U+017F>elf invented.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> knocked at the door, and interrupted us: <hi>Clotilda</hi> not knowing who it was, went her <U+017F>elf to open it; and <U+017F>eeing the Prince, Come Brother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him in a low voice) and <U+017F>ee here a poor de<U+017F>olate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and having <U+017F>hut the door, <U+017F>he conducted him unto me all in tears.

I know that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> intends to force an injurious marriage upon you, only becau<U+017F>e he thinks that I will never marry till then; but he is gro<U+017F>ly mi<U+017F>taken if he think to bring his enterpize to pa<U+017F>s that way; for I will <U+017F>ooner lo<U+017F>e my life, then con<U+017F>ent unto it; prote<U+017F>ting that if he do con<U+017F>train you to marry again<U+017F>t your will, he <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>urvive an hour after I hear of it. He would have proceeded further, but <hi>Clotilda</hi> interrupted him, <U+017F>aying, That when things are come to that height, as extream re<U+017F>olutions mu<U+017F>t be taken, then perhaps none will blame you if you do <U+017F>o; but yet (thanks be to heaven) they are not, and therefore it is more requi<U+017F>ite to endeavour the prevention by prudence: It was upon this <U+017F>ubject I was talking to this poor woman but now, and before I gave her my advice, I asked her what <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved upon: Upon death replied <U+017F>he again, and with as good a will as ever any de<U+017F>ired to live. Death, replied the Prince, is the la<U+017F>t remedy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have recour<U+017F>e unto it, as I live, half of the Burgundians <U+017F>hall die in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t a cau<U+017F>e.

No, no, replied <hi>Clotilda,</hi> there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of having recour<U+017F>e unto death, until there be no other remedy; nor is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity of <U+017F>ubmitting unto the unju<U+017F>t violences of a Tyrant, as long as they may be avoided; Heaven has given us prudence to pre<U+017F>erve our <U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns: Let us therefore make u<U+017F>e of it as we ought to do, and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will pro<U+017F>per our endeavours.</p>
               <p>Upon this <U+017F>he propo<U+017F>ed unto me what <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <U+017F>he had before re<U+017F>olved upon; and told me, that if I took this cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he might be much a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant to me, becau<U+017F>e there was very good corre<U+017F>pondency betwixt the <U+017F>age <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and her, and that if upon any con<U+017F>ideration that Prince<U+017F>s could not protect me, I might keep my <U+017F>elf concealed among<U+017F>t the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon,</hi> (<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>) with whom I might live very happily, they being the faire<U+017F>t, the mo<U+017F>t vertuous, and the be<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed women in all <hi>Europe</hi>: And when I an<U+017F>wered, that to fly from this unju<U+017F>t violence which was threatned, I would not only go into Forre<U+017F>ts, but into any other place of the world; and that my only fear was, that I <U+017F>hould not hit the way, or el<U+017F>e be taken by <U+017F>ome or other. The Prince an<U+017F>wered, I will be your guard, and <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o <U+017F>afely conducted, that none dare do you any harm: Then turning towards the Prince<U+017F>s, Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he unto he) I be<U+017F>eech you let her return unto her hou<U+017F>e, to take order for her departure, before any take notice of it; for if you approve of it, I conceive it be<U+017F>t for her to be gone as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he can, nor <U+017F>hall I be at re<U+017F>t, till <U+017F>he be out of that place where inju<U+017F>tice is <U+017F>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.</p>
               <p>The Prince<U+017F>s who pitied my misfortune, and was a true wi<U+017F>her of my welfare, did willingly con<U+017F>ent unto it; and at parting, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me, Remember <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi> that you take your be<U+017F>t Jewels with you, which are mo<U+017F>t portable, and may be<U+017F>t be hidden; for Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity is a mon<U+017F>ter that has no Law, no <U+017F>hame, nor rea<U+017F>on;

and a woman above all ought to fear meeting with <U+017F>uch a fierce and dangerous bea<U+017F>t.

But good Sir, <U+017F>aid I, what will the King <U+017F>ay when he <U+017F>ees he has lo<U+017F>t you?

               <p>Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was long upon this <U+017F>ubject; but at la<U+017F>t we re<U+017F>olved, that the third day betimes in the morning, we <U+017F>hould meet at the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> becau<U+017F>e we were to go forth of that Gate; and the fir<U+017F>t that came there, was to con<U+017F>ult with the Oracle, to know which way we <U+017F>hould go; being certain that this Godde<U+017F>s (who was a great favourer of Lovers) would give us good coun<U+017F>el: and le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould be known, <hi>Dariana</hi> and I were to be di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed in the<U+017F>e habits which you <U+017F>ee me wear, and he in the habit of a Shepherd: with him there was only that young man in whom he had <U+017F>o much confidence: We promi<U+017F>ed each other to <U+017F>tay in the Temple until five of the clock in the morning, but if that time were pa<U+017F>t, if the one did not <U+017F>ee the other coming, then to <U+017F>tay at a little Bridge out of the Town, in the way to <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>eron,</hi> until four of the clock in the evening; becau<U+017F>e at that place there was a thicket of wood where one might hide them<U+017F>elves as long as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed, and that our hor<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay al<U+017F>o in that wood.</p>
               <p>This being re<U+017F>olved upon, and the third day being come, I failed not to ri<U+017F>e betimes in the morning; and as <U+017F>oon as day appeared, I con<U+017F>ulted with the Oracle of the Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Venus,</hi> which gave me this an<U+017F>wer:</p>

               <p>I had forgot to tell you, that before I departed, I writ a Letter unto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda,</hi> to di<U+017F>charge her of my flight from the cruelty of that Tyrant: and I left it lying upon my Table, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elf it would be conveyed unto her when I was gone.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> did make me believe that there were <U+017F>ome men that were not fal<U+017F>e and perfideous: But now he made it appear, that Nature can never be <U+017F>o well corrected, but there will alwaies remain a <U+017F>mack of the old vice. Oh God! How difficult it is for a <U+017F>oul to counterfeit a thing long, which is contrary unto it. But where was my wits? What was become of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after three times being deceived? Had I not <U+017F>ufficient experience of mens fal<U+017F>hood? And if now I have occa<U+017F>ion to complain that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> hath deceived me, of whom can I complain but my <U+017F>elf? Could I be <U+017F>uch a fool as to believe the Prince, or tru<U+017F>t in any mortal man, after <U+017F>o much experience?</p>
               <p>Well, five a clock <U+017F>truck, no <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> appeared; and <U+017F>ee how I was deceived by his <U+017F>mooth language: Though I <U+017F>aw he did not come according to his promi<U+017F>e, yet I could not believe he would deceive me: Oh God! What will a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which one hath conceived of another do? Though I <U+017F>aw he came not, yet I could not but imagine that he would come: And thus I fancied occa<U+017F>ions of his <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long, that but for <hi>Dariana,</hi> I had <U+017F>tayed at the Temple door all the day; but <U+017F>he per<U+017F>waded me, and not without <U+017F>ome probability, that perhaps he was <U+017F>taying for us at the Bridge where we appointed to meet, and that not daring to come unto the Temple le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be known, he <U+017F>tayed for us there, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is blaming us for that whereof we accu<U+017F>ed him.</p>
               <p>This advice cau<U+017F>ed us to walk through the <U+017F>treet, not without much fear of being known; yet my fears for the Prince were double to my own, <U+017F>o much did his affection which I believed he bore unto me, oblige me to wi<U+017F>h his welfare. When we were out of the Town, we were much amazed when we found our <U+017F>elves in the wide fields, and knew not which way to go; and that which mo<U+017F>t troubled us, was, that all along the high way, there were <U+017F>o many pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers, that we were <U+017F>till out of our way to mi<U+017F>s meeting with them. At la<U+017F>t, after much a do, we <U+017F>aw the Bridge, and as we thought, the Prince <U+017F>taying for us; this, though we were very weary, made us double our pace: But when we came there, and found no body, then were we much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, e<U+017F>pecially when we con<U+017F>idered that now Noon was pa<U+017F>t: we looked many a long look back the <U+017F>ame way we came, and every thing we <U+017F>aw, <U+017F>eemed to be what he looked for, and at la<U+017F>t every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us.</p>
               <p>The Sun began to grow very low, when I (out of all patience) re<U+017F>olved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> to know the rea<U+017F>on why the Prince came not: But as I was <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward, I <U+017F>aw coming the <U+017F>ame way that we were to go, five or <U+017F>ix Hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which con<U+017F>trained me to retire into the thick of the Wood, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee me. <hi>Dariana,</hi> who was alwaies of a contrary opinion, and would not have me return back; Well Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) if the<U+017F>e men had met you, I pray tell me in what a ca<U+017F>e had you been in?

Oh (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) the days are long, and it will not be night above eight hours; let us not de<U+017F>pair, perhaps the Prince may come <U+017F>ome other way when we are gone; but if you be <U+017F>o impatient, I will tell you what I will do, I will take <U+017F>ome of yonder dirt, and rub my face all over with it, afterwards I will be walking up and down the high way as <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>ee him, I will run to adverti<U+017F>e you, by this means I <U+017F>hall not be known, and you may re<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf in the Wood; <U+017F>o as when the Prince does

come, you may be able to go whither you will in the night.</p>
               <p>My longing de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> made me con<U+017F>ent unto this motion though it went <U+017F>omthing again<U+017F>t my mind to <U+017F>tay in the wood by my <U+017F>elf; yet in hopes that <U+017F>he would go into the Town, and make him come the <U+017F>ooner, and becau<U+017F>e I was confident none could <U+017F>ee me in that place, I took <U+017F>o much courage as to <U+017F>tay by my <U+017F>elf. <hi>Dariana</hi> then daubing all her face over with dirt, I could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh in the mid<U+017F>t of my mi<U+017F>ery: Go <hi>Dariana,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto her, and return quickly. Did <hi>Ardilan</hi> <U+017F>ee me in this pickle (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) though he did not die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the love of me, yet I am confident he would now die with laughter. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <U+017F>he embraced me, and went to the place from whence we came.</p>
               <p>Alas! Could I have fore<U+017F>een the <U+017F>orrows which that departure co<U+017F>t me, I would <U+017F>ooner have con<U+017F>ented unto my death then it: But Heaven, not contented only to bani<U+017F>h me my native Country to <U+017F>atisfie a perfideous man, but would have me al<U+017F>o re<U+017F>ent the <U+017F>orrows of a <U+017F>ad and terrible <U+017F>olitude: And as I had for<U+017F>aken all for this mans <U+017F>ake, <U+017F>o was I for his <U+017F>ake al<U+017F>o left de<U+017F>titute of all humane help and con<U+017F>olation, As long as I could <U+017F>ee her, I did accompany her with her eye; but when <U+017F>he was out of <U+017F>ight, then began I to be apprehen<U+017F>ive of my fault: At the fir<U+017F>t I went into the thick of the Wood to hide my <U+017F>elf, but impatience <U+017F>oon invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me out again, fearing le<U+017F>t if <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>hould come, and not find me, he would not <U+017F>tay, but return back again; otherwhiles I was afraid left <U+017F>ome Wolf <U+017F>hould do me harm; <U+017F>omtimes I had a de<U+017F>ign to go after <hi>Dariana,</hi> and <U+017F>etting forward in the way two or three times, I either <U+017F>aw or heard <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>enger, which made me retreat again into the Wood: The<U+017F>e frights were nothing unto tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon me when the Sun was <U+017F>et; and more yet, when all light was gone<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Oh Heavens! In what a horror was I then? The lea<U+017F>t bla<U+017F>t of wind made me <U+017F>tart, and <U+017F>hake like a leaf; and when any Bryer took hold of me, I thought it to be <U+017F>ome Wolf, or other wilde Bea<U+017F>t that would devour me: When I heard any noi<U+017F>e, or any Owl <U+017F>crick, I was ready to fall down for fear; There was not a tale of Hags, Hobgoblins, and night walkers, that ever I had heard in my life but they came all into my fancy, and <U+017F>eemed real unto me: And being neer a high Road, I heard Hor<U+017F>men pa<U+017F>s by <U+017F>everal times; and God knows how careful I was then to hide my <U+017F>elf in the thick of the Wood. I cannot relate all the Tears, the <U+017F>ighs, the groans and complaints that I made again<U+017F>t the perfidie of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and again<U+017F>t the hollow affection of <hi>Dariana,</hi> who then I believed went away purpo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to for<U+017F>ake me in this extream nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not run the hazards of this enterprize. Oh how true it is (<U+017F>aid I unto my <U+017F>elf) that every one is afraid to keep company with an unfortunate per<U+017F>on? Oh the mi<U+017F>ery of us humanes, that can never know our friends, till we be in adver<U+017F>ity! And as <U+017F>oon as we know them, we are <U+017F>ure to lo<U+017F>e them! Oh the di<U+017F>mal lodging of a dark wood in a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy night, unto one who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirit was <U+017F>o timerous and afflicted as mine was at that time! So it was, that it was day before I dur<U+017F>t offer to clo<U+017F>e an eye to <U+017F>leep. When the Sun appeared, I was <U+017F>o weary with my walking, <U+017F>o tormented with my fears, and <U+017F>o hungry, having eaten nothing all the day before, that as I had taken a little better heart at the coming of day, I fell a<U+017F>leep, and <U+017F>lept <U+017F>o <U+017F>oundly, that it was late before I waked; and then <U+017F>eeing the Sun <U+017F>omthing low, fear and hunger for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to take the next path I <U+017F>et my foot into, and to follow it until I came to <U+017F>ome Vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age, or till I met with <U+017F>ome charitable per<U+017F>on, who perhaps out of pity would direct me in the way I was to go. Now did my tears renew and my <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o many high hopes all da<U+017F>hed; and I that the day before thought of nothing el<U+017F>e but being Queen of the Burgundians, now <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and de<U+017F>olate woman in all the Kingdom: And in this con<U+017F>ideration, you may imagine that the Tyrannie of <hi>Gondebaut</hi> was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>This thought brought into my memory all the fair promi<U+017F>es of perfidious <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who as I thought, did <U+017F>eem to love me, only becau<U+017F>e he would <U+017F>hew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to be a man, and con<U+017F>equently a Traytor. But what a fool was I (<U+017F>aid I to my <U+017F>elf) and where was my judgement, that I <U+017F>hould ever believe him to be other then a Traytor if he was a man? And <U+017F>ince all men are <U+017F>o, how could I think him only to be different the re<U+017F>t? Could I be <U+017F>o <U+017F>illy as to think Crab Trees would bear
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53528:22"/>
any other fruit then Crabs? And could I hope that a <U+017F>on of the perfideous <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi> would not (like his Father) be di<U+017F>loyal? The<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad con<U+017F>iderations enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me till it was almo<U+017F>t night, whil<U+017F>t I hardly took notice which way I went; at la<U+017F>t, recollecting my <U+017F>elf a little, and <U+017F>eeing it <U+017F>o late, I looked about to <U+017F>ee if I could <U+017F>py any Village or Cottage where I might receive <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>olation, and by Fortune, I <U+017F>aw a little hou<U+017F>e thatch'd with <U+017F>traw, upon my left hand, and not far di<U+017F>tant from the way. I turned my <U+017F>elf therefore that way, in hopes of meeting with <U+017F>ome good woman, who perhaps would compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate my ca<U+017F>e, for I had <U+017F>uch an horrour again<U+017F>t all men that I feared meeting any, as much as the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>alvage bea<U+017F>t in the woods.

               <p>Upon this, it being dark, he lighted a little dry wood, which <U+017F>erved for a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and <U+017F>tuck it in a Turnip, which <U+017F>upplied the want to a candle<U+017F>tick, and <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it upon the Table<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he bolted the door with a Hazle-<U+017F>tick, and went to his homely hard bed with his little children.</p>

               <p>In the morning I waked very early, yet not before the old man, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ordered every thing for his little family, with a re<U+017F>olution of going with me, and not leaving me till he had <U+017F>hewed me Forre<U+017F>ts; hoping (as he told me) that God would keep his children better then he could him<U+017F>elf, whil<U+017F>t he was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that office of charity for me. I gave heaven humble thanks for moving his heart unto it; and after he had given directions unto the elde<U+017F>t of his children what to do, he offered him<U+017F>elf unto me as my guide<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> with a promi<U+017F>e unto them, to return before it was night; becau<U+017F>e (as he <U+017F>aid) it was not above four leagues from thence to Forre<U+017F>ts, and that though he was very old, yet his de<U+017F>ire of doing me that office, and returning unto his children again, would add wings unto his feet, and make him go as fa<U+017F>t as if he were younger.</p>

The names of the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers were not unknown unto him, and knowing them to be <U+017F>ubjects of the Burgundian King, their arrival at that <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on made him <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect left they came for the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Polemas</hi>; and had it not been at a very un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hour, doubtle<U+017F>s he would have <U+017F>ent for <hi>Clindor,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand from him the cau<U+017F>e of their coming, and what acquaintance he had with them, to entertain them in his hou<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>This troubled him all the night long, and therefere he took but little re<U+017F>t: As <U+017F>oon as day appeared, he aro<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ent for <hi>Clindor</hi>; and his chamber door was no <U+017F>ooner open, but a young man came and pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf, very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>peak with him. The man was not unknown unto him, for he was brought up in his hou<U+017F>e from a childe. Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Adamas</hi>) I come unto you about a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s which may perhaps prove of great importance, and perhaps may not; But <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch a thing came to my knowledge. I thought I <U+017F>hould be extreamly too blame if I did not acquaint you with it: And therefore I have made all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te that I could to let you under<U+017F>tand, that ye<U+017F>terday about two hours after noon, <U+017F>ome men who <U+017F>aid they belonged unto King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> came in a body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther armed, to carry away a young woman which was upon the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> betwixt <hi>Julieu,</hi> and the Temple of the good Godde<U+017F>s: When they had taken her, another company (though fewer in number, yet much <U+017F>uperiour in <U+017F>trength and courage) followed them, and re<U+017F>cued this woman out of their hands, and <U+017F>ince (as it is <U+017F>aid) have brought her for <U+017F>afety into this Town, with <U+017F>ome Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es. The Combat was very hot and tho<U+017F>e who would have carried her away, were almo<U+017F>t all <U+017F>lain, and the re<U+017F>t rid away.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, it was my fortune to be there at the <U+017F>ame time, where many Druids, Vaces, and Eubages a<U+017F><U+017F>embled them<U+017F>elves, to Interr three Cavaliers of tho<U+017F>e who re<U+017F>cued the woman, and were killed. But becau<U+017F>e many of their enemies were killed al<U+017F>o, the Commander in chief, and the Ancients, thought good to bury him according to cu<U+017F>tom, and not let their bodies be devoured by Dogs and Wolves, or lie there to infect the Ayr. As I pulled off the clothes of the chief of them, I found <U+017F>ome papers in his pocket, which I thought might perhaps be of <U+017F>ome importance to the Nymph; I found therefore this Letter Sir, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected as you <U+017F>ee unto <hi>Polemas;</hi> and afterwards, as I <U+017F>earched his Helmet, I found this little one, lapt up very clo<U+017F>e in a corner of his Helmet: This Sir, I <U+017F>hould have acquainted you withal the la<U+017F>t night, but your <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long in the Ca<U+017F>tle, was the cau<U+017F>e why I could not make my addre<U+017F>s until this morning.</p>

'Tis true, that your arrival here <U+017F>o opportunely without any other de<U+017F>igne but by the good will of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, does give us a mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured confidence, that you will become in<U+017F>trumental in the pre<U+017F>ervation of <U+017F>o good a Prince<U+017F>s, and in the puni<U+017F>hment of <U+017F>uch wicked men as dare <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>tly attemt again<U+017F>t her authority. This action, Sirs, when it <U+017F>hall be fam'd among the Gauls, will not add a little lu<U+017F>ter unto your glory; for it will have all the qualifications that are honourable, and e<U+017F>teemed by per<U+017F>ons of vertue, as well for the equity of it, as the danger, which (to any courage but yours) would be terrible, and affright them from undertaking it. He would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but <hi>Damon</hi> being all impatiency, interrupted; Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto the Nymph) I prote<U+017F>t and vow unto Grand <hi>He<U+017F>us,</hi> never to leave you, until you be out of all danger, and will <U+017F>pend every drop of my blood in your <U+017F>ervice, again<U+017F>t all men in the world: and when I mu<U+017F>t arm my <U+017F>elf in your defence, no wound <U+017F>hall keep me a minute longer in my Bed. <hi>Alcidon</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ured the Nymph of the <U+017F>ame with <U+017F>o much alacrity and freedom, that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> could not find words full enough to expre<U+017F>s their thanks.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Adamas</hi> acquainted them with the plot of <hi>Polemas,</hi> and the means by which he hoped to effect it. The great preparations he had made before hand, as well within and without the Dominions; his corre<U+017F>pondency with Neighbour Princes; the authority he had cunningly u<U+017F>urped in the Country; the means he had u<U+017F>ed to make him<U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of all the Forts, and to win the good will of all the Souldiers and Officers; and briefly, that having impoveri<U+017F>hed the Nymph of money and men, nothing did hinder him from executing his pernitious de<U+017F>ign, but only his fears of <hi>Clidamant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore.</hi> And now the King of the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians hath written unto him of <hi>Clidamants</hi> death. To be brief, he omitted nothing which he thought expedient for them to know. But all the extream dangers and perils which he repre<U+017F>ented unto them, did exa<U+017F>perate their courage to undertake the defence of the Nymph: And to joyn prudence unto their valour, the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what <U+017F>afety there was for her re<U+017F>iding in that place, and what orders <U+017F>he had taken. <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>atisfied all their demands, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured them, that nothing would be wanting but men: As for Arms, he had a magazine <U+017F>tored with all <U+017F>orts in the Ca<U+017F>tle: As for provi<U+017F>ion, it was not a moneth <U+017F>ince harve<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o as their Granaries were full: But as for men, he knew not where to have them, nor whom to tru<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>My opinion is (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi>) that the way to get <U+017F>ouldiers unperceived, is to appoint <U+017F>ome publique <U+017F>ports, and <U+017F>et up Prizes, for <U+017F>hooting in the Bowe, for Wre<U+017F>tling, and <U+017F>uch like; and when they are a<U+017F><U+017F>embled, we <U+017F>hall order them into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53528:25"/>
Arms. I think Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi>) that the coun<U+017F>el is good; for if there be any Traytors, they are per<U+017F>ons of quality; it being not likely that <hi>Polemas</hi> would declare him<U+017F>elf unto any others; and we have an excellent pretence for it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>even days hence is the <U+017F>ixth of <hi>July,</hi> a day de<U+017F>tined to gather the Mi<U+017F>leto of the New year; It <U+017F>hall be given out, that you intend to be pre<U+017F>ent, to invite many unto it; and you know it is the cu<U+017F>tome for every one to bring what Arms they will in honour of the Fea<U+017F>t; when they are come together, we may cull out tho<U+017F>e whom we like be<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>This was the re<U+017F>olution, <hi>Adamas</hi> went immediately to put it in execution; and as he went out, <hi>Clindor</hi> came in, who by the Druide's command pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> unto the Nymph: <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> received them with abundance of curte<U+017F>ie: And becau<U+017F>e they intimated that they had <U+017F>omthing to <U+017F>ay in private, the Nymph cau<U+017F>ing them to <U+017F>it down by <hi>Damons</hi> bed, <U+017F>he told them that they might <U+017F>peak freely before tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers, from whom <U+017F>he concealed nothing. Madam (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Merindor</hi>) <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure to have it <U+017F>o, we <U+017F>hall be obedient, although we were charged to <U+017F>peak unto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and <U+017F>o we will, though it be your plea<U+017F>ure to hear us with many ears. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he continued thus.</p>

               <p>The Prince would have only one man with him, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes,</hi> in whom he had great confidence; and <U+017F>he only one woman who had long <U+017F>erved her, and in who<U+017F>e fidelity <U+017F>he could not doubt. <hi>Cerae<U+017F>tes</hi> was to lead the hor<U+017F>es for all four, unto a certain place which they had appointed without the Town: And the Prince with her and <hi>Dariana</hi> (for that was the name of her who <U+017F>erved her) were to go on foot to the place, where <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>tayed for them. But how hard a thing it is to deaf the ears, and blind the eyes of jealou<U+017F>ie!</p>
               <p>The King, or <hi>Ardilan,</hi> or rather both, had <U+017F>et <U+017F>pies over the Prince and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi>; and therefore when they perceived that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> went one evening unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> though he carried with him but very few men, yet <U+017F>o it was, that one of tho<U+017F>e who took notice of their actions, went into the hou<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, who took no notice of him: but he carried him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o confidently, that the Princes <U+017F>ervants took him to be one of <hi>Dorindes</hi> dome<U+017F>tiques, and <hi>Dorindes</hi> dome<U+017F>tiques took him for one of the Princes <U+017F>ervants. This man <U+017F>aw the Prince talk with great mode<U+017F>ty and re<U+017F>pect unto the Lady, and that beginning of their talk was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condoling the death of <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> the father of this Fair one. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ob<U+017F>erved them to talk very low, and the Prince to be very angry; for the actions of his hands, his head, and the re<U+017F>t of his body, <U+017F>hewed as much, though he did not hear one word, unle<U+017F>s when he bade her good night, he chanced to rai<U+017F>e his voice, and utter the<U+017F>e words: <hi>Do not fail on your <U+017F>ide, and be <U+017F>ure that I will be there.</hi> The<U+017F>e words were well ob<U+017F>erved, and pre<U+017F>ently carried to the King, who entring <U+017F>till into greater doubts, charged <U+017F>ome of his confidents to have a <U+017F>pecial eye over all the actions of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> that they might di<U+017F>cover his de<U+017F>ign. And <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who was no friend of the Princes, re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>leep a wink all night, purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee if he could di<U+017F>cover any thing. In the morning therefore he <U+017F>aw <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> take Hor<U+017F>e, and cau<U+017F>ed three others to be brought after him by <U+017F>ome certain boyes: He <U+017F>ent commands immediately to the Gates, from the King, to let none out; and in the mean time ran him<U+017F>elf to advertize the King, who judged the<U+017F>e three hor<U+017F>es to be for the Prince, <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Dariana</hi>; and that doubtle<U+017F>s they had a de<U+017F>igne to go together. This was the rea<U+017F>on that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Gates of the Town to be <U+017F>hut, the keys to be brought unto him, the River <hi>Arar</hi> to be blocked up with chains, and afterwards <U+017F>ent for Prince <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Godomar</hi> to come unto him.</p>
               <p>By fortune, he who went unto Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> was the Prudent <hi>Avitus,</hi> who had been his Governour; but the commands came not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon to the gates, but <hi>Dorinde</hi> was fir<U+017F>t gone out: for <U+017F>he being more quick then the Prince, or to <U+017F>ay better, had le<U+017F>s to do in ordering her dome<U+017F>tiques, was before him. When the prudent <hi>Avitus</hi> came into the Princes chamber, he knew that his pre<U+017F>ence would be unwelcome, and that the Prince would be very bu<U+017F>ie about the execution of his de<U+017F>ign; for the king had acquainted him with it: The <U+017F>age Governour loving <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> extreamly well; Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto him, and took him a<U+017F>ide) I come to acquaint you that your intentions are di<U+017F>covered, and I am <U+017F>orry that the King knows of it, then for the di<U+017F>covery of the enterprize. What enterprize do you mean? <U+017F>aid the Prince. If we were in a place where our actions could not be ob<U+017F>erved, replyed he, I would tell you. The Prince then (who had a great confidence in the wi<U+017F>dom and fidelity of this man) went half dro<U+017F>t into his Clo<U+017F>et with him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Avitus</hi> began thus, Sir, the King hath <U+017F>ent me to tell you, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires to <U+017F>peak with you, and with the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> your Brother: In the mean time, he hath commanded to <U+017F>hut up all the Gates of the Town, and keeps the Keys him<U+017F>elf; Judge therefore whether or no he knows of your De<U+017F>igne. My De<U+017F>igne! replyed the Prince, what does he think it is? He hath an opinion (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Avitus</hi>) that you intended to go out of his Dominions with <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Who put him into that opinion? <U+017F>aid the Prince. Many circum<U+017F>tances (an<U+017F>wered he)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53528:26"/>
and conjectures; for he knows that you do love her. I never concealed it, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prince, either from him, or any el<U+017F>e; But I pray, is there any Law enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that one mu<U+017F>t not love in his Dominions? No, replyed he, but he knows more then that, for he hears that you intend to marry her. If he (replyed the Prince) were a good and kind Father, he ought to give her unto me, and not thus to cro<U+017F>s me, and deprive me of all contentment. Mo<U+017F>t true, replyed the prudent <hi>Avitus,</hi> if you were a private per<U+017F>on; but Sir, as all the <U+017F>ubjects of the Realm are not their own, but the Kings who governs them, <U+017F>o the King is not his own, but the peoples over whom he rules. Great Princes (<U+017F>uch as you) never u<U+017F>e to marry to plea<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, but for the welfare, grandeur, and <U+017F>afety of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Did you ever <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ssgi<U+017F>mond</hi>) any Sacrificer to <U+017F>acrifice one Victime twice? That is not the cu<U+017F>tome, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Avitus.</hi> Why then will the King <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice me twice for the welfare of his Dominions? For he has once <U+017F>acrificed me, when he married me again<U+017F>t my mind to the Kings daughter of the O<U+017F>trogots. That which is allowed unto women<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> ought al<U+017F>o to be allowed unto men: Women marry the fir<U+017F>t time by obedience, but the <U+017F>econd time by election. Sir, an<U+017F>wered the wi<U+017F>e Governour, Tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ubject unto the Dominion of another, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e terms, <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>I will not.</hi> That is right, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond,</hi> in tho<U+017F>e that are born <U+017F>ubjects; but I am born the <U+017F>on of the King. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (replyed he) that you be born the Kings <U+017F>on, yet the King is then your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and does not a childe owe all duty unto a Father? Give me leave to tell you Sir, that by the Law, the Father may <U+017F>ell the Son in his nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. Laws, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered the Prince, are but Spiders webs, which hold the <U+017F>mall flies, but the great ones ea<U+017F>ily break through. The truth is Father, (for <U+017F>o he called him <U+017F>ince he was his Governour) I do love <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and I will never marry any other but her. Will the King then force an unju<U+017F>t marriage upon her? Let me tell you freely, I cannot <U+017F>uffer it; acd therefore I did re<U+017F>olve to fly from a Prince that is <U+017F>o violent, and has <U+017F>o little regard of equity: If you do love me, as I ever thought you did, I be<U+017F>eech you contrive my departure, for I am as fully re<U+017F>olved upon it, as I am to die. The wi<U+017F>e and prudent <hi>Avitus.</hi> <U+017F>eeing it was no time to pre<U+017F>s him any further, Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto him) your de<U+017F>igne might at any other time be accompli<U+017F>hed, but now it cannot; for the Gates are all locked, the Guards are <U+017F>et in every quarter of the Town, and without wings there is no getting out: and that you may know I <U+017F>peak truth, <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> cannot get out with your Hor<U+017F>es. Oh heavens! cryed the Prince out, and what is become of <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Upon this word <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> entred into the Clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Avitus</hi> there, he would have gone out again, but the Prince called him in. No, no <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, come in, and <U+017F>peak freely before <hi>Avitus,</hi> for he de<U+017F>ires my contentment as much as I can my <U+017F>elf. Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> with a <U+017F>ad look) I have been with your hor<U+017F>es at the Port of <hi>Venus,</hi> but they would not let me pa<U+017F>s: And becau<U+017F>e I thought that perhaps I might get out by the River <hi>Arar,</hi> I went thither al<U+017F>o; but I found all <U+017F>hut up, and the Keys carried to the King. Oh God! <U+017F>aid the Prince, and what is become of <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Sir, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, I hear nothing of her. Then <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Prince, go as fa<U+017F>t as you can to her hou<U+017F>e, and if <U+017F>he be there <U+017F>till, bid her not <U+017F>tir till <U+017F>he hear from me. Then turning towards the <U+017F>age <hi>Avitus,</hi> I <U+017F>ee Father (<U+017F>aid he unto him) that I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tand in need of your coun<U+017F>el. Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, not only my coun<U+017F>el, but my life, and all I have, is dedicated to your <U+017F>ervice, But Sir, the King has <U+017F>ent me to you, what an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>hall we return him.</p>
               <p>The King (an<U+017F>wered he) does u<U+017F>e me <U+017F>o har<U+017F>hly, that I know not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my <U+017F>elf. Con<U+017F>ider Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Avitus,</hi> that if you do the duty of a Son, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will e<U+017F>teem you; and the fault of one, ought not to exempt another from doing his due. The great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who is the univer<U+017F>al father of all men, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partial in the behalf of Fathers; and therefore he has promi<U+017F>ed a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence upon children that are obedient, then for any thing el<U+017F>e upon earth. I have often told you Sir, that a good man will not only follow vertue in things that plea<U+017F>e him, and are ea<U+017F>ie, but in things that are har<U+017F>h and hard, though never <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing: for otherwi<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e animals which are guided only by <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and have no other light but their own appetites, might be as vertuous as men, <U+017F>ince they are as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53528:26"/>
prompt unto things that plea<U+017F>e them, and more then we are: But in things that are cro<U+017F>s and aver<U+017F>e to our minds, we do <U+017F>hew our <U+017F>elves rational, and not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual. Now Sir, I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>et the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations before your eyes, and <U+017F>ay when you are before the King, I will do my duty Sir, though it be never <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t my mind, becau<U+017F>e yon are my King, and becau<U+017F>e you are my Father: and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee heaven will infinitely reward your obedience. Father (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) I will do what<U+017F>oever you would have me: But truly, if the King marry <hi>Dorinde</hi> by force, I profe<U+017F>s that I cannot <U+017F>uffer it; I had rather render back unto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which he hath given me, which is my life, then <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch an injury to be offered unto her. No, no (an<U+017F>wered the prudent Governour) the King does only make a <U+017F>hew of doing it, but indeed he dares not; for the Laws are ab<U+017F>olutely again<U+017F>t any force in marriages: But yet (<U+017F>aid the Prince) he grounds upon a Law, which ordains, That if a Father promi<U+017F>e his daughter unto one, and die before the marriage be effected, the daughter cannot otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elf; and if <U+017F>he marry another, they are both to be in the power of him unto whom <U+017F>he was promi<U+017F>ed, to do what he plea<U+017F>eth with them. How (<U+017F>aid <hi>Avitus</hi>) does this Law concern <hi>Dorinde?</hi> It concerns her very much (an<U+017F>wered the Prince) or at lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o; for <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> had promi<U+017F>ed her unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> unto <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and unto <hi>Merindor.</hi> She will want no Husbands then (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Avitus</hi>) but becau<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be the wife of three, therefore the promi<U+017F>e is null, and of no effect. But Sir, you mu<U+017F>t know, that tho<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es which the Law intends, are <U+017F>uch as are pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by Writings, and parole promi<U+017F>es are invalid; for otherwi<U+017F>e this Law would prove a gro<U+017F>s inconveniency: But be<U+017F>ides all this, I have heard <U+017F>ay that <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> during the life of her Father, did di<U+017F>claim that marriage, and <hi>Bellimartes</hi> (who was married before) had married her, if his wife had not come in and prevented it: All the<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es were made void during the life of her father; and they may fright <hi>Dorinde</hi> and you, but no Judge will give any <U+017F>entence to enforce her upon tho<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es. Oh Father! replyed the Prince, had I <U+017F>poke with you before I fixed upon that re<U+017F>olution of going away, we had taken a better cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> returned, and told the Prince that <hi>Dorinde</hi> was not in her hou<U+017F>e, and that going into her chamber, he found a Letter upon the Table, which he pre<U+017F>ented unto the Prince.</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! <U+017F>aid he, whither is <U+017F>he gone? Doubtle<U+017F>s Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>he is gone out of the Town; for otherwi<U+017F>e, when <U+017F>he found all the Gates locked, <U+017F>he would have returned to her hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Avitus</hi> in the mean time having opened the Letter which the Prince gave unto him, they <U+017F>ound the<U+017F>e words.</p>

Alas Madam, it had been enough, and too much to be deceived, without an addition of <U+017F>uch grand Inju<U+017F>tice unto Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. I have heard <U+017F>ay, and I hope its true, That the Gods cannot endure any unju<U+017F>t Marriages. In the mean time, I will ab<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>ince I am born free, fly from <U+017F>uch cruel <U+017F>ervitude.

It grieves me, as well to be out of her <U+017F>ervice, as that <U+017F>he is in a place where I fear the <U+017F>ins of another will be charged upon her, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>

               <p>This Letter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Avitus</hi> pre<U+017F>ently) is a full di<U+017F>charge for the Prince<U+017F>s, if <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi> be gone away; and I conceive it very expedient to keep it, until the truth be known whether <U+017F>he be gone or no, and afterwards that it be carried rather unto the King then the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda,</hi> to free her from any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition. To this end, let it be <U+017F>ealed up with <U+017F>ome unknown Seal, and carried to the place where it lay, to the end, that tho<U+017F>e who doubtle<U+017F>s will carry it to the King, may find it there. But in the mean time Sir, I conceive it requi<U+017F>ite that you go unto <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice of any thing. If he ask whither <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> was leading the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, both he and you may an<U+017F>wer, that you were going to cour<U+017F>e a Stag, and that he was carrying them to the <U+017F>tand; and for a better colour of it, it is expedient you put on your hunting habit.</p>
               <p>All things were done as <hi>Avitus</hi> advi<U+017F>ed; <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> carried back the Letter, and laid it upon <hi>Dorindes</hi> Table; in the mean time the Prince dre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently after went to the King, accompanied with a great number of Cavaliers; who <U+017F>eeing men armed walk up and down the Town more then u<U+017F>ual, and hearing that the Gates were locked, did flock unto his lodging to receive his commands, for his <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and goodne<U+017F>s made him beloved by all.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the King <U+017F>aw him in that habit, he asked him the rea<U+017F>on of it: To cour<U+017F>e a Stag, Sir, <U+017F>aid he, and I was ready to take hor<U+017F>e when <hi>Avitus</hi> told me that you would <U+017F>peak with me. I believe (an<U+017F>wered the King and <U+017F>miled) that you were going to cour<U+017F>e rather an Hind then a Stag. The Prince <U+017F>eeming not to under<U+017F>tand him; That might have been Sir (<U+017F>aid he) if the Hunt<U+017F>men <U+017F>hould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>take the one for the other, but it was not my intention. I commanded the gates to be locked, and the Guards doubled, upon <U+017F>ome intelligence which much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, and which I will impart unto you; and to that end, follow me into my Clo<U+017F>et: Upon this he went into his Clo<U+017F>et, and called with him none but <hi>Sigi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Godamar,</hi> and the prudent <hi>Avitus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </p>
               <p>The door was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>hut, but <hi>Ardilan</hi> knocked, and <hi>Avitus</hi> by the Kings command went to <U+017F>ee who it was. As <U+017F>oon as the King <U+017F>aw him, he went unto him; and the Prince ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>Ardilan</hi> talked to the King with a face of a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment, but he could not hear a word, for he <U+017F>poke very low; their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was very long, and in the conclu<U+017F>ion he gave the King a Letter, and went away. <hi>Gondebaut</hi> in a great <U+017F>ume, as one might <U+017F>ee by his countenance and eyes, did <U+017F>it him down in his chair, and <U+017F>hewing the Letter which <hi>Ardilan</hi> gave him, here's news of our hunting, <U+017F>aid he; then holding it unto <hi>Avitus,</hi> who knew it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently, he commanded him to read it, which he did; yet in reading it, did <U+017F>weeten the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t places as well as he could.</p>
               <p>What do you think <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Gondebaut</hi>) had not I good cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay that you were going to cour<U+017F>e the Hind? Do you think that any of your de<U+017F>igns can be concealed from me? Can you believe that I am ignorant of your fond and fooli<U+017F>h affection, and unto what height it is grown? And yet becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>eemed deaf unto all reports that was told me, and would not <U+017F>ee what all the world did, this connivance has made you forget your duty both unto me and your <U+017F>elf. Sir, <U+017F>aid the Prince, if you will be plea<U+017F>ed to hear my rea<U+017F>ons without being <U+017F>wayed with too much prejudicated pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, you will not think me <U+017F>o culpable as I am fal<U+017F>ely reported to be. Can you think it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible (replyed <hi>Gondebaut</hi>) that I <U+017F>hould not be extreamly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate in a thing which <U+017F>o much concerns you? For you have forgotten the duty of a <U+017F>on, yet I cannot the duty of a Father: But to let you <U+017F>ee how much you are mi<U+017F>taken in thinking me <U+017F>o <U+017F>wayed with pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I will give half my Kingdom upon condition that I were now in the wrong, and you in the right; I had rather the fault <U+017F>hould be branded upon me then you; for alas, I have almo<U+017F>t fini<U+017F>hed the cour<U+017F>e which the Fates have de<U+017F>tined me to live, and for that poor pittance of time which remains for me, it is no matter what opinion is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53528:27"/>
conceived of me; but you who are beginning that cour<U+017F>e which I have ended. O <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> did you know how much it concerns you to keep an un<U+017F>tained repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you would e<U+017F>teem your lo<U+017F>s of it by this occa<U+017F>ion, to be the greate<U+017F>t of your life. I know very well Sir, replied the Prince, that I can never <U+017F>atisfie tho<U+017F>e obligations wherein I am bound unto you, and I would be<U+017F>eech you to add this unto the number, and tell me wherein I have <U+017F>tained this reputation, which I ever held <U+017F>o dear unto me. You have judgement enough, replied the King, to know it without my telling you, but <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire to have it from my mouth, is it not true that you do love <hi>Dorinde?</hi> mo<U+017F>t true Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, I do love her; but I never knew that it was ever any <U+017F>hame to love a fair and a wi<U+017F>e Lady. But, <U+017F>aid the King, <U+017F>he is below your quality. If Kings and Princes, replied he, ought to love none but Queens and Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, then truly I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F>s my fault, but if it be a fault, it has been committed by example. Though it be permitted us, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, to love per<U+017F>ons of lower rank then our <U+017F>elves, yet their loves ought not to go <U+017F>o far as to marry them: for when I be<U+017F>towed <U+017F>ome good language up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> do you think it was ever my intention to marry her? for my part Sir, <U+017F>aid the Prince, if ever I <U+017F>hould promi<U+017F>e any marriage, I would perform it as religiou<U+017F>ly, as if all the Druides in Gaul had married me. What? <U+017F>aid the King, would you marry <hi>Dorinde?</hi> I do not <U+017F>ay I will Sir, an<U+017F>wered the Prince, but I <U+017F>ay that if I did promi<U+017F>e to marry her, I would perform it, though I became the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Cavalier in your kingdome. The King then pulled down his hat over his eyes, and <U+017F>aid unto him, I know mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly, that you have promi<U+017F>ed to marry her. Sir, an<U+017F>wered the Prince, you are ill informed: It is very true indeed, I did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e. that if I were at my own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e, I would marry her; and whether I have not in this made my duty unto you appear, I refer it unto your <U+017F>elf. But I hope to find you <U+017F>o kind a father, as not to give me any occa<U+017F>ion to complain again<U+017F>t you. O Heavens! replied the King, is <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> of <U+017F>o a ba<U+017F>e a <U+017F>pirit, as to marry <U+017F>uch a woman, if I <U+017F>hould give him leave, and ask wherein he has <U+017F>tained his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: Well, well, I will take an order to apply <U+017F>uch remedies, as <U+017F>hall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any <U+017F>uch inconveniencies. Uoon this <hi>Gondebaut</hi> ro<U+017F>e up, and commanded <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond</hi> to his hou<U+017F>e, and to <U+017F>tay there until he received further commands: then the Prince went away extremely vexed, and gave no reply.</p>
               <p>Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued <U+017F>o long, that before they parted the <U+017F>un was low; and the Prince, by fortune, as he was going to his lodging, he <U+017F>aw a great crowd of people in the <U+017F>treet, which cau<U+017F>ed him to <U+017F>tay, as if his heart had told him, that perhaps they had found <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and were carrying her away: her thoughts were partly true, for he <U+017F>aw that it was <hi>Dariana,</hi> whom he knew better by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit then her face, which was <U+017F>o dawbed with durt as he wondred that any <U+017F>hould know her, As <U+017F>oon as ever the Prince <U+017F>aw her he went unto her, took her by the arm, and by his authority carried her to his hou<U+017F>e. The poor wench did tremble <U+017F>o, as cau<U+017F>ed all that <U+017F>aw her to pity her. But when <U+017F>he was in the Princes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <U+017F>he took <U+017F>ome heart; O God Sir (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to the Prince) what do you think is become of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? where is <U+017F>he?

By the way, they asked me many que<U+017F>tions concerning <hi>Dorinde,</hi> but I alwayes an<U+017F>wered that <U+017F>he was not with me, for I was come into the town to <U+017F>eek her. <hi>Ardilan</hi> was at the Port with the keyes of the gates when I was <U+017F>eized upon, and gave mo<U+017F>t ba<U+017F>e language a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the honour of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> which I <U+017F>hall never forget nor forgive: But Sir,

when fortune will run a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ee how all ill chances will fall upon the neck of one another: as this Traitor <hi>Ardilan</hi> was thus belching out his venome again<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> one of the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> did <U+017F>ay aloud, that one in <U+017F>uch a habit as I had, came that morning to con<U+017F>ult with the Oracle: <hi>Ardilan</hi> hearing this, did ask him what an<U+017F>wer the Oracle gave.

               <p>Not one of us failed according as was commanded, and the young <hi>Godomar</hi> was there at the time appointed; <U+017F>o taking hor<U+017F>e as <U+017F>oon as we were all together, (becau<U+017F>e we heard <hi>Clorantes</hi> was gone with a good Troop,) we came to the gate. <hi>Ardil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then <hi>Godomar</hi> advancing; How dare you <U+017F>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, <U+017F>aid he, be <U+017F>o bold as to controul me and my actions? open the gates without any further replies. Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ardilan,</hi> I did not <U+017F>ee you; but <U+017F>ince the King hath commanded me, I hope you will not take it ill, if I do not open them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a further command from him.</p>
               <p>Ah Traitour (<U+017F>aid <hi>Godomar</hi> then, and laid his hand upon a Pole-ax which he wore at the pomel of his laddle) I will with one blow, give thee the ju<U+017F>t reward of all thy treachery; and gave him <U+017F>uch a blow upon his head that he clove it quite in two. Tho<U+017F>e at the gate were <U+017F>o affrighted at this man, that not one dur<U+017F>t deny opening the gates unto the Prince: For he being very well beloved among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ouldiers, and <hi>Ardilan</hi> hated for his intollerable arrogancy, the gates were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently <U+017F>et upon: and <hi>Godomar</hi> with all his company went out without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53528:29"/>As <U+017F>oon as we were out, it was night, yet not very dark, though the Moon appeared not: We came to the Bridge from whence <hi>Dariana</hi> came; but finding none there, we went on towards Forre<U+017F>ts; I think we lo<U+017F>t our way twenty times among<U+017F>t the mountains, not one of us knowing the right way unto <hi>Fevres,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we aimed to go; and therefore our hor<U+017F>es being almo<U+017F>t tyred, we re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay until it was day at the fir<U+017F>t villages we came unto, and to take <U+017F>ome guides along with us. We did as we re<U+017F>olved; and when we asked where we were, tho<U+017F>e of the place told us, that we were far out of our way, and <U+017F>hould have taken much more upon the left hand, and mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity return back <U+017F>o far as within the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Lions</hi>; which cau<U+017F>ed the young Prince almo<U+017F>t to de<U+017F>pair: yet one thing was a comfort unto us; which was, we under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Clorantes</hi> was not far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and that his hor<U+017F>es were almo<U+017F>t quite tyred. And asking which way he took, it was an<U+017F>wered, that he enquired the way towards <hi>Fevres</hi>; and therefore, as <U+017F>oon as it was day, we departed; but becau<U+017F>e our hor<U+017F>es were as ill tyred as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Clorantes,</hi> it was <U+017F>omthing late before we <U+017F>et out. One pa<U+017F><U+017F>age by the way did much plea<U+017F>e us, which was, that we met with an old man who was coming from the place unto which we were going, and who for his age walked very fa<U+017F>t: The Prince riding up unto him, Father (<U+017F>aid he) did you <U+017F>ee a Troop of Hor<U+017F>e pa<U+017F>s this way towards <hi>Fevres</hi>? No Sir (an<U+017F>wered he) I <U+017F>aw none: But I ob<U+017F>erved all along the way which comes from yonder Town which you may <U+017F>ee upon your left hand, a great track of hor<U+017F>es: yet (replied the Prince) did you come from <hi>Fevres,</hi> and meet none? I was but a league further Sir (<U+017F>aid he) and have been guiding thither a young woman that is extreamly <U+017F>ad. That's <U+017F>he whom we do <U+017F>eek (<U+017F>aid the Prince, and turned towards us) Good Father (<U+017F>aid the Prince) tell us where <U+017F>he is whom you guided? Sir, <U+017F>aid the man, you <U+017F>hall know no more from me, for I know not whether you intend good or bad unto her. It is for her good (<U+017F>aid the Prince.) If it be (replyed he) the great <hi>Tautates</hi> <U+017F>peed you, and guide you where <U+017F>he is, for he knows your intentions, but I do not, and therefore dare not tell you any more, for <U+017F>he is worthy of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did commit her <U+017F>elf unto my guarding, I <U+017F>hould be guilty of all the harm that befalls her. The young Prince admiring the vertue of this country fellow, did put his hand in his pocket, and gave him a piece of gold, and de<U+017F>ired him to be as wi<U+017F>e unto all as he had been unto him: Then pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing on, we had not gone far, before we found the track which the old man told us of, and we followed it unto <hi>Fevres,</hi> where night coming on us, we re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay, and enquire further news of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> which we did; for by fortune he had lodged in the <U+017F>ame place where we took up our quarters. <hi>Godomar</hi> then knew that he had found him whom he looked for, which was no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>atisfaction unto him.</p>
               <p>In the morning, enquiring which way he took, it was told us that he was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over <hi>Lignon,</hi> and indeed we found again the track of his hor<U+017F>es feet, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us unto a place where there was four ways, where we perceived he had made a Halt; for the track was very fre<U+017F>h and new: but we were mo<U+017F>t troubled to find, that of tho<U+017F>e four ways, three of them were printed with hor<U+017F>es feet, which made us think that they were divided into three Troops.</p>
               <p>The generous Prince (who was infinitely de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>erve his brother) was of opinion, that it was be<U+017F>t for us al<U+017F>o to divide our <U+017F>elves into three companies, and each company take one of tho<U+017F>e ways. We being unwilling to leave him <U+017F>o <U+017F>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly guarded, did a little dorr at it; but he perceiving it; No, no <U+017F>aid he, you all promi<U+017F>ed to obey me, and I had rather die then fail in this fir<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion, upon any con<U+017F>ideration of my per<U+017F>on. And therefore let <hi>Bellimartes, Periander,</hi> and <hi>Merindor,</hi> with their three friends take the way that pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth over <hi>Lignon, Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tes</hi> and five other Cavaliers take the way upon the right hand, yet not to pa<U+017F>s over the <hi>Loire,</hi> and I (<U+017F>aid he) with <U+017F>ix others, will al<U+017F>o pa<U+017F>s over <hi>Lignon</hi> upon the left hand; and at three days end, we will all of us rendezvous at yonder Temple which we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>tand in the mid<U+017F>t of that plain, that we may con<U+017F>ult what cour<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hould take.

yet <U+017F>ome good angel in<U+017F>pired him; for <hi>Bellimartes, Periander,</hi> and our <U+017F>mall Troop had not marched above a League and a half, but we overtook <hi>Dorinde</hi> yet in the hands of <hi>Clorantes,</hi> who was carrying her away: Heaven was <U+017F>o favourable unto our enterpri<U+017F>e, that though we were but <U+017F>ix, and they fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen at the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t, yet we defeated them, and took <hi>Dorinde</hi> from them, although our victory was very dearly bought; for we lo<U+017F>t there the valiant <hi>Bellimartes, Periander</hi> lo<U+017F>t a co<U+017F>en german, and I a brother; yet <U+017F>ince the Gods had made us <U+017F>o happy as to <U+017F>erve the Princes <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Godomar,</hi> and that fair and vertuous Lady, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the misfortune with much patience.</p>
               <p>Now Madam, we have brought <hi>Dorinde</hi> into this City, who ca<U+017F>ts her <U+017F>elf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <U+017F>helter of your protection as a <U+017F>afe Sanctuary; we hope that you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the<U+017F>e Princes, and <U+017F>hew your <U+017F>elf to be a pious refuge for innocents.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Merindor;</hi> and <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> began to <U+017F>peak: Generous Cavaliers (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto them) <hi>Dorinde</hi> is by your valour brought unto a place where <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall find no wor<U+017F>e u<U+017F>age then <hi>Galathea</hi> my daughter; and had I been <U+017F>ooner informed of your Quality, I would not have <U+017F>uffered either her or you to have had any other lodging then my own hou<U+017F>e, which I offer unto all, with as much freedom as I have my <U+017F>elf: Al<U+017F>o I conjure you by your order of Cavalry, to promi<U+017F>e me that you will go unto Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> at Mount <hi>Verdune,</hi> for I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that to be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where you are to meet him, and be<U+017F>eech him from me, to honour me <U+017F>o far as to come hither; where I have a mo<U+017F>t extream de<U+017F>ire to render unto him <U+017F>uch <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as are due unto <U+017F>uch a great and generous Prince.

               <p>They had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> But <hi>Leonide</hi> did acquaint <hi>Galathea</hi> that <hi>Dorinde</hi> and her company were in the Hall; of which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o glad, that <U+017F>he bade <hi>Galathea</hi> go and receive them, and conduct them unto her; which office <hi>Galathea</hi> undertook very willingly; for under<U+017F>tanding that <hi>Lycidas</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Celadon</hi> was there, <U+017F>he was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>peak with him: She went therefore with a great number of Nymphs, who could not chu<U+017F>e but admire the beauty of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, though the habits of Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es did much dim the lu<U+017F>ter of their faces. <hi>Galathea</hi> who was informed who <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> were, after <U+017F>he had complemented <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>he went unto them, and treated them <U+017F>o kindly, as was beyond their expectation. <hi>Madonthe</hi> hearing that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers of her acquaintance were <U+017F>o near, <U+017F>he went unto them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her obligations unto them all, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Hylas, Lycidas, Tircis,</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> and bade them mo<U+017F>t kindly welcome: But when <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw them in tho<U+017F>e habits, <U+017F>he hardly knew them; and they <U+017F>eeing the rank which <U+017F>he held, did begin to blu<U+017F>h, and out of re<U+017F>pect, keep at a di<U+017F>tance.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Madonthe</hi> who loved the women very well, and de<U+017F>ired that they <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame freedom with her, which they were wont; Did I think (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them) that the gaudery of my garments would make you keep at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance from me then you were wont to do, I prote<U+017F>t I would this very hour leave them off, and never wear them again.

Alas <hi>Lycidas,</hi> replyed <U+017F>he, it cannot be called any crime, for am I not the very <U+017F>ame I was before?

               <p>Hitherto neither <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> nor <hi>Hylas</hi> had <U+017F>poke a word; the fir<U+017F>t becau<U+017F>e he was ravi<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee the hou<U+017F>e adorned after another fa<U+017F>hion then the ru<U+017F>ty cottages wherein he was brought up; and <hi>Hylas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e there was none in all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who did put him into a mood of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but <hi>Madonthe,</hi> who till then did not <U+017F>ee him; Oh <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) are you there, and I not yet paid tho<U+017F>e devoirs which are due unto our ancient Friend<U+017F>hip? What opinion will you have of me? Better Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) then ever I had before. And yet (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility does not de<U+017F>erve it. You are mi<U+017F>taken, Madam, replyed he, I have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of you then ever I had; for me thinks we two are of humours alike. Oh heavens defend <hi>Hylas,</hi> (replyed <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently) for I would not re<U+017F>emble you in Incon<U+017F>tancy. Nay, never fear it (<U+017F>aid he) for you can never arrive at that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but my meaning is, that when I have that contentment which I de<U+017F>ire, I care for nothing el<U+017F>e; and me thinks you do the <U+017F>ame now you have found this Cavalier; and I do <U+017F>o like the humour of it, that I do e<U+017F>teem you much more. <hi>Damon</hi> who could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at the an<U+017F>wer, did ask <hi>Madonthe</hi> in a low voice, who that Shepherd was; and being informed, Kind Shepherd (<U+017F>aid he unto him) will you give me leave to believe what this fair Lady tells me? Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> doubtle<U+017F>s you may, for nothing but good can come from <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a mouth. yet an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon,</hi> what <U+017F>he tells me, makes not for your advantage. Perhaps Sir, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> you may be mi<U+017F>taken; the <U+017F>ame merchandize bears not the <U+017F>ame price in all Countries; That which is extreamly dear in one Country, may perhaps be dog cheap in another. But that merchandize wherewith your pack is <U+017F>tuffed, as <U+017F>he tells me, replyed <hi>Damon,</hi> is not dear in any place of the world, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as I have heard among<U+017F>t the Shepherds of <hi>Lignon</hi>; for <U+017F>he tells me, that you are full of incon<U+017F>tancy. Me thinks (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) that you are <U+017F>o much obliged unto tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Lignon</hi> for keeping this fair Lady <U+017F>o long among<U+017F>t them, that you <U+017F>hould have a better opinion of them; for had not their curte<U+017F>ie and civilities <U+017F>tayed her <U+017F>o long there, perhaps you would not have found her there, but had wandered God knows whither before you had met her. I do mo<U+017F>t thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my obligations unto them (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon</hi>) and <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e them; but I thought that I had obliged them by what I <U+017F>aid. Did you not <U+017F>ay, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that Incon<U+017F>tancy was not dear in that Country? I did <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon.</hi> Why then did you as good as <U+017F>ay, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is great abundance of it; for abundance of any thing, be it never <U+017F>o good, makes it cheap. I did not <U+017F>o intend it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon</hi>; but on the contrary, my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that on the Banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> your merchandize is not a <U+017F>aleable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, becau<U+017F>e none ever makes any u<U+017F>e of it. Oh Sir, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly mi<U+017F>taken in that belief; for there is not a place in all Gaul where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple know better how to love then they do who inhabite about tho<U+017F>e happy Banks of <hi>Lignon:</hi> That is the rea<U+017F>on, replyed <hi>Damon,</hi> why I believed that Incon<U+017F>tancy was bani<U+017F>hed from thence. Nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>ince you are in that errour, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you tell me, is not this the quality of all tho<U+017F>e that love well, to change them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves (as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they can) into the humours of tho<U+017F>e they love? And if it be, there is not one Shepherd who is not incon<U+017F>tant; and where can you find one Shepherde<U+017F>s who does not <U+017F>o?</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and interrupted him, you know very well that now you <U+017F>peak again<U+017F>t your con<U+017F>cience.

I cannot believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide</hi>) that you can prove it. Then an<U+017F>wer me unto the<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>: You <U+017F>ay that <hi>Hylas</hi> is incon<U+017F>tant; and if Lovers do change them<U+017F>elves as much as they can into the homours of tho<U+017F>e they love, is it not certain that I loved <hi>Laonice, Phillis, Alexis, Stella,</hi> and many others? I do believe it, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ay it. If <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid he, then they were incon<U+017F>tant, or el<U+017F>e in loving them I was not changed into them: And <hi>Lycidas, Corilas,</hi> and many others who loved them, they al<U+017F>o were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tant; or el<U+017F>e in loving them, they were not changed into them: <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e who call them<U+017F>elves lovers of tho<U+017F>e whom I loved, do but call them to

               <p>
                  <hi>Palemon</hi> then, who <U+017F>ilently li<U+017F>tned unto all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas,</hi> Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Madonthe</hi>) if the mi<U+017F>erable condition of this poor di<U+017F>tracted Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd have moved you unto any compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I be<U+017F>eech you become a mediator un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> for his former liberty and <U+017F>en<U+017F>es. Why <hi>Palemon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Madonthe,</hi> Do you think it in her power to cure him?

Then taking the Shepherd by the hand, <U+017F>he carried him to <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who was talking with <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and ju<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time as <hi>Madonthe</hi> was pre<U+017F>enting him unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas</hi> returned from out of the Town, where he had given orders for every thing as was re<U+017F>olved upon.

               <p>The Druid then, <U+017F>eeing every one <U+017F>ilent; Madam (<U+017F>aid he aloud, and addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to the Nymph<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>) I come to acquaint you, that there are <U+017F>even Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers come into the town, who inquire for Prince <hi>Godomar.</hi> Do you know their names, asked <hi>Periander</hi> and interrupted him; one of them, an<U+017F>wered he, is called <hi>Alcander,</hi> and the other, I think, <hi>Amilear.</hi> They, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Periander,</hi> they are none of our Troop; but they are of our acquaintance and are our friends. <hi>Circienea,</hi> who heard <hi>Alcander</hi> named, could not chu<U+017F>e but blu<U+017F>h: and <hi>Florice,</hi> approching to the Druide.

treat them they will favour me <U+017F>o far, as to come hither, if they inquire of Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> and I am very confident, that being your brothers, I <U+017F>hall find them <U+017F>o courteous as not to deny my reque<U+017F>t. I be<U+017F>eech you Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> let us have the honour to go and let them know your plea<U+017F>ure, for I am mo<U+017F>t confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they will obey you.

               </p>
               <p>They were not gone half down the <U+017F>tairs which de<U+017F>cend from the Ca<U+017F>tle, but they met them, and being adverti<U+017F>ed of their arival, they judged it to be them, though they were armed. Their meeting was with many demon<U+017F>trations of good will, as if the amity betwixt them were much augmented, <U+017F>ince the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight; and <hi>Merindor,</hi> having acquainted them with the de<U+017F>ire of the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> they went altogether unto the Ca<U+017F>tle where they were entertained by the Nymphs and Cavaliers, with all manner of welcome; but tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw the Care<U+017F><U+017F>es which <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palanice,</hi> made unto their brothers, would have thought <U+017F>ome greater intere<U+017F>t to be among<U+017F>t them then that of kindred.</p>
               <p>After all complements of civilitie were pa<U+017F>t on both <U+017F>ides, for the Nymph was plea<U+017F>ed to permit to contentment unto the three <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, though it was her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence; <hi>Alcander</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto her and <U+017F>aid, Madam, we have commi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion from the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who hath <U+017F>ent after the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of his <U+017F>ervice: and that if any occa<U+017F>ion pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may give a te<U+017F>timony of his affection, he will think him<U+017F>elf infinitely happy to receive your commands.

               <p>Then <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> acquainted <hi>Alcander</hi> where he might find him in the morning; and <hi>Alcander,</hi> looking about him, he <U+017F>aw <hi>Dorinde.</hi> This, this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is <U+017F>he (<U+017F>aid he unto the Nymph) which is the happy accompli<U+017F>hment of our journey, <hi>Dorinde</hi> is <U+017F>he that is the principal cau<U+017F>e of Prince <hi>Godomars</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, one came to adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> that a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes,</hi> was at the gates, with twelve others armed, who de<U+017F>ire to enter: the Druid told it unto the Nymph aloud.

                  </gap>eet him, and offer him my Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and that is in my power. <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing the opinion of the<U+017F>e Cavaliers, <U+017F>ent in all ha<U+017F>te to cau<U+017F>e the gates to be opened, and to adverti<U+017F>e him, as near as could be, of the truth.

I conceive it fit, if <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi> and <hi>Damon</hi> approve of it, that when this young Prince is come, you acquaint him with the <U+017F>tate of things, as well with the death of <hi>Clidamant,</hi> as with the treachery of <hi>Polemas:</hi> For it is out of all doubt, that the corre<U+017F>pondency which

this wicked man holds with <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> will hinder from your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in killing <hi>Ardilan</hi> at his coming out of the gates, does <U+017F>hew that this Prince loves his brother better then he does his father. For my part, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, I will be ruled by you in all things: and calling for <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>he command the Druid to acquaint them with what he had propounded, which they hearing, they were of the <U+017F>ame judgement, and advi<U+017F>ed Nymph to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Prince as much as <U+017F>he could: for mo<U+017F>t certainly <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> (<U+017F>he having with her two per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o dear unto him) would <U+017F>end her relief if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood in need of him.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were talking of the<U+017F>e things, and putting all things in the be<U+017F>t or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they could in the Ca<U+017F>tle to receive <hi>Godamar,</hi> all the Cavaliers came to the gates of the Town, in which the Prince was already entred unknown; but when they met, their joyes were <U+017F>o great, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any longer to hide them. For they all run to ki<U+017F>s his hand with <U+017F>o much affection and reverence, that every one knew him to be the Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> of which the Nimph was pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>ed by tho<U+017F>e whom <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>ent thither, and <U+017F>he was extreamly joyed at it.

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw the Nymphs he alighted from his hor<U+017F>e, and di<U+017F>arming his head, he appeared <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome and fair, that he attracted the eyes of all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies upon him: and taking a hat, he went to <U+017F>alute <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with <U+017F>uch a grace, that every one admired his deportment. After <U+017F>ome complements of civility, to which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wered with the like re<U+017F>pect, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Galanthea,</hi> and profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed abundance of <U+017F>ervice unto them both: I come Madam, <U+017F>aid he<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> to pay that duty which all Cavaliers are obliged unto, and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that Prince <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond</hi> and I are wholly devoted unto your <U+017F>ervice, and <U+017F>o are all tho<U+017F>e that have any dependency upon us: of which number, here are <U+017F>ome which we offer unto you, and all mo<U+017F>t ready to defend you again<U+017F>t any that <U+017F>hall offer any wrong unto you, upon condition (added he and <U+017F>miled) that you will defend us from any wrongs we may receive from the beauty of the<U+017F>e Ladies, whom we <U+017F>ee about you.

               <p>Upon this <hi>Dorinde</hi> came and ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf at his feet, to thank for the pains he had teken for her, be<U+017F>eeching him not to for<U+017F>ake her; and I believe, the Mymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething unto her which prompted her thereunto: the Prince <U+017F>eeing her in that habit, did hardly know her, if <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>poke; but knowing her rather by her tongue then face, he very graciou<U+017F>ly took her up and <U+017F>aluted her: Fair one, <U+017F>aid he unto her, the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> has <U+017F>o great a care of you, that you need not doubt any of tho<U+017F>e who have any dependency upon him, will ever for<U+017F>ake you: be<U+017F>ides, you are now under the wings of this great Nymph, who is plea<U+017F>ed to honour you <U+017F>o far as to take you into her protection, as I have commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion from Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> my brother' mo<U+017F>t humbly to be<U+017F>eech her to do: Your virtue and merits will al<U+017F>o oblige her unto it, and us to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you, in all that we can to the uttermo<U+017F>t of our power; upon this turning towards <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> he <U+017F>aid unto her in a loud voice: The cau<U+017F>e, Madam, of my voyage, and why I armed my <U+017F>elf, was only in defence of this fair one, and mo<U+017F>t-humbly to be<U+017F>eech you that you would be plea<U+017F>ed to let her remain <U+017F>afe in your dominions, and in requital of the favour, the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> (my brother) and I, do promi<U+017F>e for us and all our friends, to <U+017F>erve you upon all occa<U+017F>ions whatsoever.

               <p>The <U+017F>ouldiers were <U+017F>o damped at the <U+017F>ight of me, and to hear this language, that they were all ready to run away. At la<U+017F>t, doing me that honour which was due unto me, they excu<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves as well as they could, and were extremely glad when I gave them leave to be gone. That night they went no further then the town where we had quartered, becau<U+017F>e their wounded fellows were retired thither: but I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf, that the next day they told <hi>Gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for us, when the<U+017F>e men were gone, becau<U+017F>e it was very late, we lodged in a place which is called <hi>Pon<U+017F>ius,</hi> where we heard the whole <U+017F>tory of the combate with <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> and that three of our Cavaliers were <U+017F>lain, which grieved me extremely. And la<U+017F>tly, that you had carried <hi>Dorinde</hi> into this Town for <U+017F>afety. This news, made me re<U+017F>olve to wend my cour<U+017F>e this way, and not unto the appointed ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Godomar</hi> related all his adventure, and had dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, when <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of his company came to ki<U+017F>s his hands: for though he had <U+017F>een

               <p>The next morning we departed, though not altogether, but at <U+017F>everal part and without arms, having conveyed them out <U+017F>ecretly before.</p>
               <p>But I pray, <U+017F>aid the Prince, what <U+017F>aid the King when he heard of <hi>Ardilans</hi> death, and of my departure?

But Sir, though the King do blame you, yet all the people ble<U+017F>s you, and the Court commends you: The Prince your brother is <U+017F>o joyed at it, that he cannot chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>hew his extream contentment: <U+017F>o as the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Avitus</hi> was forced to be<U+017F>eech him he would at the lea<U+017F>t hide it, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould too much exa<U+017F>perate the King: Al<U+017F>o I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, the joyes of the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda</hi> were no le<U+017F>s, who extremely commended you, <U+017F>o as Sir, this action has gotten you that glory which you will never lo<U+017F>e: Be<U+017F>ides, all the Ladies think them<U+017F>elves highly obliged unso you, for attempting the defence of this innocent woman.

Then, <U+017F>aid the Prince I give thanks unto God for directing us <U+017F>o well, and bringing our intentions to <U+017F>o good an end: If the King do but con<U+017F>ider who I am, he will love me better then he did <hi>Ardilan</hi>; if he do not, then I am re<U+017F>olved with <U+017F>uch good company as will follow me, to follow <U+017F>uch fortune as heaven will plea<U+017F>e to give me: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf it will be good, and give us all contentment, <U+017F>ince ju<U+017F>tice and equity are the ends which all our de<U+017F>ignes do aim at. Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcander</hi> further, the Prince your brother hath <U+017F>o loadned me and all my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with <U+017F>o many jewels to bring unto you, as I think they out-weigh our arms: And I believe, if we had been able to have carried more, he would have <U+017F>ent them unto you, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tand in any need of <U+017F>uch things in your voyage. Upon this, they laid them all down upon the table, to the admiration of all beholders, at the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o many and <U+017F>o large and precious jewels together. The Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them in te<U+017F>timony of his brothers good will, and care that he had of him: Not, <U+017F>aid he, that I think I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tand in any need of them, as long as I have a <U+017F>word by my <U+017F>ide, and accompanied with <U+017F>o many brave men as I <U+017F>ee about me; but only becau<U+017F>e I will not refu<U+017F>e the kindne<U+017F>s of my brother. Upon this, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them all once more, he commanded one of his <U+017F>ervants to have a care of tho<U+017F>e things which his brother had <U+017F>ent unto him; and then, he with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, went out of the chamber unto the place where the Nymphs were, who <U+017F>tayed for him in the great chamber, where the cloth being laid, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> would have him to dine. But he being adverti<U+017F>ed of <hi>Damons</hi> quality, and that his wounds kept him in bed, be<U+017F>eeched the Nymph to let him go and <U+017F>ee him before dinner, and te<U+017F>tifie that e<U+017F>teem which he had of his valour. <hi>Madonthe</hi> hearing this re<U+017F>olution did pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Damon,</hi> who received that honour which the Prince did him, with much acknowledgement; and e<U+017F>teemed this favour at <U+017F>uch a rate, that it ever after obliged him unto his <U+017F>ervice. Every one admired the noblene<U+017F>s and genero<U+017F>ity which appeared in all his actions, and his curte<U+017F>ie and

After the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>alutions, they entred into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of civility, which la<U+017F>ted not long, becau<U+017F>e dinner was upon the table, and therefore the Prince as con<U+017F>trained to abridge it, with a promi<U+017F>e to continue longer in his company after dinner.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore they parted: and <hi>Clindor</hi> in the mean time had obtained leave of the Nymph to take his gue<U+017F>ts unto his hou<U+017F>e to dinner, becau<U+017F>e that abundance of company was come in upon a <U+017F>udden: He therefore carried with him all the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, except <hi>Dorinde,</hi> whom <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> would needs have dine with <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir, replyed <U+017F>he, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that I had good cau<U+017F>e to hate tho<U+017F>e, unto whom I am now in <U+017F>pite of my teeth obliged.

               <p>At the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Periander</hi> and all his company whom <hi>Clindor</hi> had carried with him, returned, and came into the great chamber, and becau<U+017F>e '<hi>Dorinde</hi> was de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to break off di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with the Prince; Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, if you do not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> ca<U+017F>t your eye upon that plain Shepherd, who<U+017F>e hair is a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to red, and you may <U+017F>ee the man that of all Lovers living is the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embler.

Your argument Madam is very naught (replyed <hi>Hylas</hi>) for if men do not complain again<U+017F>t your infidelities, it is becau<U+017F>e they are a<U+017F>hamed to complain again<U+017F>t a thing <U+017F>o common and ordinary. <hi>Godomar</hi> began to laugh, and <U+017F>o did <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> at this merry an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Hylas</hi>; and interrupting <hi>Dorinde</hi> who was about to an<U+017F>wer, me thinks (<U+017F>aid he unto her) this Shepherd has in a few words very well defended our cau<U+017F>e.</p>

But Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> they tell us of a Receipt which may cure him, and which we intend to try. What is that? asked the Prince. It is Sir, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> to drive a nail unto the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the wall which is toward the Ve<U+017F>try of <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>; and this nail mu<U+017F>t touch the Temples of the di<U+017F>tracted party.

               <p>THere are <U+017F>ome who <U+017F>ay that love proceeds neither from <U+017F>impathy nor de<U+017F>tiny but from de<U+017F>igne and will of the lover: and that the original of this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction has its ri<U+017F>e from the violence of beauty, which does tiranize over the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <U+017F>oul: but <U+017F>uch, have not had that experience which <hi>Amilcar</hi> and I have had: for had they, they would pre<U+017F>ently be of another opinion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s with us, that every one is at his nativity de<U+017F>tinied unto her whom he mu<U+017F>t love and <U+017F>erve. This is a po<U+017F>ition (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi> and interrupted) which I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor grant: for were it <U+017F>o, nuto which of the thirty or fourty whom I have <U+017F>erved will you decree me by <U+017F>impathy and de<U+017F>tiny? To that, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Amilcar,</hi> we will <U+017F>peak another time; for a general rule mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till be ob<U+017F>erved, though it may haue <U+017F>ome exceptions; and be<U+017F>ides, <hi>Hylas</hi> is a mon<U+017F>ter in love, quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the nature of other lovers. This, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, <U+017F>mells of <hi>Silvander,</hi> but <hi>Alcander</hi> continued.</p>
               <p>You mu<U+017F>t know, <U+017F>aid he, that a little before the marriage of <hi>Florice,</hi> <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Amilcar</hi> and me, unto <hi>Theombres,</hi> our father <U+017F>ent for us to return home unto his hou<U+017F>e, having no mind until then, that we <U+017F>hould be with him, until we had <U+017F>o qualified our <U+017F>elves <U+017F>utable to the degree of our Ance<U+017F>tours. In our more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares he <U+017F>ent us to the mo<U+017F>t famous Univer<U+017F>ities, to be in<U+017F>tructed in the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sciences and Arts: when we were grown to be more men; he cau<U+017F>ed us to be taught in all the exerci<U+017F>es and behaviours of the body, as riding, fencing, dancing, and the like: and afterwards <U+017F>ent us abroad to learn the languages, and know the manners and cu<U+017F>tomes of our neighbours; then when we were arived at the age of two or three and twenty years, he <U+017F>ent for us home unto his hou<U+017F>e, where we were <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trangers in our own countrey, and knew <U+017F>o very few, that had we not been told <hi>Florice</hi> was our <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, we could not have known her to be <U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>Our return was (as you know) a little before <hi>Florices</hi> marriage, and when we began to love one another, <hi>Theombres</hi> carried her out of the Town: <U+017F>o as we lo<U+017F>t her almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as we found her: but heaven it <U+017F>eems had pity upon us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tored her back in a <U+017F>hort time, by the death of <hi>Theombres,</hi> who lived not above three months after he was married. She took her lo<U+017F>s as <U+017F>he ought to do, and we helped her in this charitable office, but our tears were quickly dried up: for the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of this man was not very plea<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>he married him rather as a fortune then as a lover, without any fancy to him.</p>
               <p>Our <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters <U+017F>orrows <U+017F>unk not <U+017F>o deep into her <U+017F>oul, but <U+017F>he was quickly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the affection which we expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her; and <U+017F>he in requital to make our <U+017F>tay at home with our father, as little tedious unto us as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could: and doubtle<U+017F>s that droning kind of life, <U+017F>o different unto that which we had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tomed unto, had been intollerable to us without her <U+017F>weet conver<U+017F>ation. Some dayes after <hi>Florice</hi> was returned home, and her mourning not of <U+017F>o deep a black, but would allow her colours, <U+017F>he took notice of the melancholy lives we led, and few recreations we frequented: Brothers, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto us, I am <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee you droop thus; but I mu<U+017F>t divert you <U+017F>ome wayes or other, <U+017F>o as you <U+017F>hall find this place not <U+017F>o drow<U+017F>ie as you did at fir<U+017F>t. Our father does tire you with the<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>its
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53528:36"/>
of kindred, who never talk of any thing but <U+017F>erious matters: but I will make you acquainted with <U+017F>ome of my a<U+017F><U+017F>ociates, and dare lay a wager, you will not think them <U+017F>o dull and tedious as his. We who had lived with our father in a kind of impri<U+017F>oned con<U+017F>traint, and could not indure it any longer, did intreat her to be as good as her word. She deferred the effecting of her promi<U+017F>e, no longer then the next morning, when <U+017F>he carried us unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Cercinea,</hi> where we found <hi>Palanice, Dorinde, Cloris, Parthenopea,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others, all very fair and hand<U+017F>ome women. But <hi>Hylas,</hi> to prove the de<U+017F>tiny which I <U+017F>poke of, I did no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t my eye upon <hi>Cercinia,</hi> but I found in her <U+017F>o many allurements unto love, that I could not deny her my heart, and my soul: My brother al<U+017F>o at the <U+017F>ame time thought <hi>Palanice</hi> <U+017F>o lovely, that he could not chu<U+017F>e but be<U+017F>tow him<U+017F>elf wholly upon her.</p>
               <p>Now let tho<U+017F>e who think that it is beauty which doth tiranize over our <U+017F>ouls, tell me the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Cercineas</hi> beauty <U+017F>hould not tiranize as well over the <U+017F>oul of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> as mine; or why <hi>Palanice</hi> <U+017F>hould not have as powerful an influence upon my heart, as upon my brothers? I am confident that mauger all their rea<U+017F>ons, they will confe<U+017F>s, that it was de<U+017F>tiny and fate that did di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of us as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>De<U+017F>tiny, I <U+017F>ay, decreed that we <U+017F>hould at one and the <U+017F>ame time receive two great lo<U+017F><U+017F>es: for the lo<U+017F>s of our liberty, was pre<U+017F>ently after <U+017F>econded with the lo<U+017F>s of a father, who being of a great age, was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eized upon by a violent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which in few dayes brought him to his grave. Perhaps if the new affection which we had conceived unto the<U+017F>e two Ladies, had not been written in the fatal book of de<U+017F>tiny, this la<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>s might have <U+017F>tifled it in his grave: for the truth is, we took it more <U+017F>adly to heart then others u<U+017F>e; but <hi>Hylas,</hi> what can re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? For our affections by this contrariety, increa<U+017F>ed as a flame will by contrary wind.</p>
               <p>There is nothing which hinders a growing love from taking deep root, more then to be out of <U+017F>ight of the party loved, becau<U+017F>e the eyes are they that give beginning unto love, and the <U+017F>ight does nouri<U+017F>h it and make it grow: <U+017F>o as when this <U+017F>ight is denied, commonly love dies, or at lea<U+017F>t langui<U+017F>hes. But this, we found, might hold true unto others, who love by election, but not unto us who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed unto it by unre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table Fate: for being con<U+017F>trained to ob<U+017F>erve the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of mourning, we were a long time deprived of the <U+017F>ight of the<U+017F>e beauties, but all would not do any good: only helped to make our mi<U+017F>ery more painful, and hard to be indured.</p>
               <p>But the dayes of deepe<U+017F>t mourning being pa<U+017F>t; it is the cu<U+017F>tome, upon <U+017F>uch accidents for friends and nighbours to come and vi<U+017F>it the mourners, as well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with them and offer their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as to renew that amity and friend<U+017F>hip which they formerly had with the predece<U+017F><U+017F>our. All our friends and neighbours, failed not to pay tho<U+017F>e duties of civillty: <U+017F>o as our hou<U+017F>e was frequented as much as any famous Temple; <hi>Palanice</hi> and <hi>Cercinea,</hi> among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t that were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends unto my mother and <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, were not failing at this vi<U+017F>it: and we who were almo<U+017F>t alwayes with <hi>Florice,</hi> were, heaven knows, mo<U+017F>t glad to <U+017F>ee them. The truth is the death of our father did greatly afflict us; and there was not the lea<U+017F>t appearance of any mirth in our hou<U+017F>e, until the<U+017F>e two fair Ladies were plea<U+017F>ed to come unto it. But then, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, the mourning of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and me, did vani<U+017F>h like a cloud before the Sun. When <hi>Cercinea</hi> had complemented my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a long while, <U+017F>he came to render the <U+017F>ame civilities unto <hi>Florice</hi>: and becau<U+017F>e I could never <U+017F>atisfie my eyes with looking upon her, I drew near unto my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter; and after I had thanked <hi>Cercinea</hi> for the pains <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to take in coming to a hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>orrows, and that in requital of this honour, we offered unto her all our <U+017F>ervices, <hi>Florice</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to go and <U+017F>ay as much unto <hi>Palanice</hi>: <U+017F>o as <hi>Cercinea</hi> and I remained together at a di<U+017F>tance from the re<U+017F>t of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: this invited me, in pur<U+017F>uance of my former di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ay unto her; the truth is, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Cercinea,</hi> I have very little rea<U+017F>on to thank you for this favour, <U+017F>ince I fore<U+017F>ee more harm then ever I can hope for good by this vi<U+017F>it. She who did not yet perceive the affection which I had unto her, for all former demon<U+017F>trations
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53528:37"/>
of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es were received only under the notion of civilities and courte<U+017F>ies, I cannot tell <hi>Alcander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, what harm my vi<U+017F>it may do unto you; but I am <U+017F>ure that I have no intentions of doing any: if you have no intention Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) then it is my de<U+017F>tiny, for certainly <hi>Cercinea</hi> will be the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Alcanders</hi> death: Who I? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the cau<U+017F>e of your death? Doubtle<U+017F>s you will, an<U+017F>wered I: but I will pardon you, not being my <U+017F>elf able to be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed with it.</p>
               <p>Upon this we were parted, by the coming in of a great number of Ladies, and after that, I could not renew this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e all that day. In the mean time <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> who would not, no more then I, lo<U+017F>e this opportunity, he acco<U+017F>ted <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> I did not think Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, that the beauties of this countrey had been <U+017F>o cruel as I find them; what cruelties Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do you complain of? of yours Madam, replied he, who are not contended to <U+017F>ee this hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, but you will add more <U+017F>orrows unto it. Your <U+017F>orrows, replied <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, are doubtle<U+017F>s to be condoled; but I do not <U+017F>ee which way I am any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto them, or if I be, I am <U+017F>ure it is very innocently. That innocency, <U+017F>aid he, is not enough to repair my lo<U+017F>s which you have cau<U+017F>ed, without <U+017F>ome other cordial.</p>
               <p>Doubtle<U+017F>s their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued longer, had they not been interrupted by the <U+017F>ame accident which <U+017F>evered <hi>Cercinea</hi> and me. And judge whether de<U+017F>tiny did not drive us both unto this affection, <U+017F>ince the words by which we made the fir<U+017F>t overtures of our loves unto the<U+017F>e Ladies, were almo<U+017F>t the very <U+017F>ame, although we did not con<U+017F>ult together about it.</p>
               <p>Now though the<U+017F>e few words wrought no great effects, yet they <U+017F>erved, at the lea<U+017F>t to open the eyes of <hi>Cercinea</hi> and <hi>Palanice,</hi> and let them know that we were in love with them: And upon the next opportunity of di<U+017F>course with them, we found not the difficulty <U+017F>o great to make them under<U+017F>tand us. It was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had that opportunity, for when the fir<U+017F>t dayes of mourning are pa<U+017F>t, it is cu<U+017F>tomary to return tho<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>its which we received: and you may well imagine that my brother and I were not very backward in paying <U+017F>uch debts unto tho<U+017F>e fair ones, with whom we might have what opportunity of <U+017F>peech we plea<U+017F>ed. <hi>Florice</hi> who accompanied us thither, and ob<U+017F>erved that I had talked very long unto <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi> when we were returned, <U+017F>he took me a<U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>aid unto me: I forgot brother to adverti<U+017F>e you, when I <U+017F>hewed you <hi>Cercinea,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould have a <U+017F>pecial care of being <U+017F>urpi<U+017F>ed by her beauty: for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o engaged another way, as I fear you will take abundance of pains for very <U+017F>mall contentment: O my dear <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered I, your councel comes too late, for I am already <U+017F>o deeply enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that there is no hopes of any retreat till death. O Heavens brother, cried <U+017F>he, I pity you extremely, and am very <U+017F>orry that I was the cau<U+017F>e of your <U+017F>eeing her, for there is not a beauty in all the countrey more likely to make one in love then <U+017F>he. You mu<U+017F>t know that <hi>Clorian</hi> brother unto <hi>Palanice</hi> does <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s her, as I believe none whom<U+017F>oever can divert her from him. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid I unto her, you a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h me extremely, in telling me <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o engaged unto a man: perhaps, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I do not mean as you do, when I <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he is engaged unto <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> my meaning is, that he being brother unto <hi>Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> the mo<U+017F>t intimate friend of <hi>Cercinea</hi>; and be<U+017F>ides, the husband which <hi>Palanice</hi> had (for you mu<U+017F>t know <U+017F>he was married) being uncle unto <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and as long as he lived, <U+017F>he was alwayes with his wife: the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations hath cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Cercinea</hi> to honour her, as much as if her husband was living: <U+017F>o as <hi>Palanice</hi> has a great command over her, and <U+017F>he loving her brother <hi>Clorian</hi> extremely well, <U+017F>he gives him <U+017F>uch acce<U+017F>s unto <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and has <U+017F>uch a hand over her, that <U+017F>he dare hardly turn her eye without her leave. Not that I will <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he loves him, or that any thing has pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between them that is unhand<U+017F>ome, for <U+017F>he is e<U+017F>teemed to be a very virtuous and di<U+017F>creet Lady. But certain it is, that <U+017F>he being without father or mother, <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffers the <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter of <hi>Clorian</hi> to have <U+017F>o much authority over her, as it is not credible any el<U+017F>e can be entertain'd.

And as for <hi>Lucindor,</hi> he being the Brother of <hi>Cercinea,</hi> I will think him to be a man of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and if he be, why may he not marry you? Your young years will not let you continue long in a widowed habit; and for my part, I will never advi<U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould Oh Brother, replyed <U+017F>he, talk no more of that I be<U+017F>eech you for <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombres</hi> is yet too fre<U+017F>h in my memory to entertain any <U+017F>uch thoughts. Oh the gro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>t piece of folly that ever was, replyed I; Do not I know that you married him only out of obedience to my Father and yours? And what great affection could you therefore have unto him? Ah <hi>Alcander,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled, you are very plea<U+017F>antly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed; why might not I conceive affection unto <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombres</hi> in three moneths <U+017F>pace, as well as you unto <hi>Cercinea</hi> in a moment? Oh Brother, did you know how the Bonds of marriage do oblige every good wife unto it, you would change your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: For the knots of it are tyed to fa<U+017F>t, and are <U+017F>o dear, that they can never be unloo<U+017F>ed without re<U+017F>entments of <U+017F>orrow, <U+017F>o as a <U+017F>eparation is like unto that of the <U+017F>oul and the body. But though this con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which is very great, had no force in me; yet there is another which is prevalent enough to keep me from any more marriages, which is Brother, The extream jealou<U+017F>ie which he had conceived of me, <U+017F>o as I thought my life to be a torment unto me: As for <hi>Theombres,</hi> I <U+017F>hould have thought my <U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t of all my Family, had he not taken this toy in his head. Now after all the<U+017F>e great inconveniences, would you have me <U+017F>o mad as to plunge my <U+017F>elf into the like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eries again? Why Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid I unto her, will <hi>Lucindor</hi> be jealous? Or why <U+017F>hould you think he will? <hi>Alcander,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled, I <U+017F>ee you de<U+017F>ire to know all, and I will tell you, <U+017F>ince I am re<U+017F>olved to hide no action of my life from you. You know Brother, that in this great City there is abundance of company, and one cannot chu<U+017F>e but be <U+017F>een, and conver<U+017F>e with <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons: It happens that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>eeing us, many come to love us, or at the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o: for I believe that is the cu<U+017F>tome of mo<U+017F>t men: But however, many eyes being upon us, they

will <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, be they true or fal<U+017F>e; and thus this multitude of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance produceth this enemy; or rather, this mortal di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of Love, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jealou<U+017F>ie. <hi>Lucindor</hi> having ob<U+017F>erved one of <hi>Palanices</hi> brothers did <U+017F>eem to love me, or perhaps loved me in earne<U+017F>t, he became <U+017F>o jealous upon it, that he will let me nor him<U+017F>elf take any re<U+017F>t. How? Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid I and <U+017F>miled) I be<U+017F>eech you explain this a little better unto me; Does this Brother of <hi>Palanices</hi> love you, and did not you <U+017F>ay that he loved <hi>Cercinea?</hi> Is he in love both with you and her? No, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, <hi>Palanice</hi> has two Brothers, The one is called <hi>Clorian,</hi> who is in love with <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and the other is called <hi>Cerintes,</hi> who makes a <U+017F>hew of <U+017F>ome good will unto me. This Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid I unto her, and laughed heartily) is one of the fine<U+017F>t encounters that ere could happen: <hi>Palanice</hi> has two Brothers, the one of which is called <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes,</hi> who loves you; and the other is called <hi>Clorian,</hi> who is in love with <hi>Cercinea. Cercinea</hi> al<U+017F>o hath two brothers, <hi>Selcines</hi> loves <hi>Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Lucindor</hi> courts you; And you <hi>Florice,</hi> you may <U+017F>ay, that the<U+017F>e two fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cannot lend you any thing, but you are able to pay them back again in their own coyn: for as I do love the fair <hi>Cercinea,</hi> <U+017F>o <hi>Amilcar</hi> is de<U+017F>perately in love with <hi>Palanice.</hi> How? cryed out <hi>Florice) Amilcar</hi> in love with <hi>Palanice?</hi> Yes, yes, replyed I, mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perately. This (replyed <U+017F>he) were an excellent <U+017F>ubject for a Comedy. I would it were, replyed I, for Comedies, they <U+017F>ay, conclude always with a marriage: but yet <U+017F>ince we are <U+017F>ix, and you but three, <U+017F>ome of us mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be di<U+017F>contended; for I am <U+017F>ure I will <U+017F>uffer none to <U+017F>hare with me in her that I do love. Do you think (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that any one of us would be divided into two? As for that, an<U+017F>wered I, I refer it unto your <U+017F>elf: But Si<U+017F>ter, all that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from you, is, to work <U+017F>o with <hi>Lucindor,</hi> that his Si<U+017F>ter may love me; and with <hi>Cerintes,</hi> that he work <U+017F>o with <hi>Palanice,</hi> that <U+017F>he may take <hi>Clorion</hi> off from his Court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cercinea.</hi>

               <p>It was by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I came to the knowledge of all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; and becau<U+017F>e I could not <U+017F>ay any more, by rea<U+017F>on that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons came in and interrupted us; The conclusion was, that <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me with all her power, but al<U+017F>o to deal <U+017F>o with <hi>Cerintes,</hi> that <hi>Amilcar</hi> <U+017F>hould find no ill entertainment from <hi>Palanice</hi>: for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I think my <U+017F>elf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you both, <U+017F>ince I was the cau<U+017F>e of your being in love.</p>
               <p>Thus then we parted; and becau<U+017F>e I was adverti<U+017F>ed of <hi>Clorians</hi> affection unto <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and of the influence which <hi>Palanice</hi> had upon her, I thought to gain <U+017F>ome of <hi>Cercineas</hi> good will, before either the Brother or the Si<U+017F>ter took notice of it; to the end, that when <hi>Clorian</hi> entreated his Si<U+017F>ter to do me any ill offices, <U+017F>he might be armed a little before hand in my defence: and therefore the way that I took to oblige her, was principally di<U+017F>cretion; having heard that nothing does more engage a maid to love then it; and it is but mean prudence to employ any confidents in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: I have already told you how I made the fir<U+017F>t declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my affection; and I <U+017F>aid no more unto her for <U+017F>ome days after: but being almo<U+017F>t continually with her, all the demon<U+017F>trations that I gave her of it, was a mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervant re<U+017F>pect; and to the end <U+017F>he might know that it was a re<U+017F>pect wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the one was a common road of complement, and to the other, a particular reverence, which glanced <U+017F>parks of Love:</p>
               <p>One day, when <hi>Cercinea</hi> was at <hi>Palanices</hi> hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he would wa<U+017F>h her hands before a collation; I, as I always u<U+017F>ed to be, was clo<U+017F>e by her to hold her Gloves; <U+017F>he was nothing nice in giving them unto me, becau<U+017F>e it was a trivial <U+017F>ervice which any would freely undertake: And pretending to have a little bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at my own hou<U+017F>e, I went thither as fa<U+017F>t as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, and with the <U+017F>ame ha<U+017F>te, wrote this in one of her Gloves.</p>

                  <hi>Cercinea</hi> took her Gloves again, but took no notice at that time what I had written in them: but at night when <U+017F>he was going to bed, her chamber-maid made the di<U+017F>covery.

I wi<U+017F>h Mi<U+017F>tris (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, and thanked her) that he who writ this in the<U+017F>e Gloves, may often do <U+017F>o; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, did I know him, I would give him hearty thanks.

Take heed of <U+017F>uch a trick, replyed <hi>Cercinea,</hi> for you may chance do me an extream di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure.

What need you care Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, as long as you know not who it was? No matter, replyed <hi>Cercinea,</hi> I would not have him <U+017F>ee them; and then feigning as if <U+017F>he had not read what was written, let me <U+017F>ee them again <hi>Andronira</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that I may read it; and <U+017F>he having given them unto her, Go, go to bed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi>) thou art <U+017F>uch a fool, that thou <U+017F>halt not have them. Ah Mi<U+017F>tris! cryed <U+017F>he, then re<U+017F>tore me back the thanks which I gave unto you. If that will content thee (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea</hi>) prithee take them with all my heart, and I will give thee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pair of Gloves be<U+017F>ides; Then calling for a Cabinet where <U+017F>he kept <U+017F>uch things, <U+017F>he gave her another pair of Gloves. Mi<U+017F>tris (<U+017F>aid <hi>Andronira</hi> and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her) you have taught me a way never to want Gloves. How? asked <hi>Cercinea.</hi> Why Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) when the<U+017F>e are worn out, I will get <U+017F>ome body to write a little upon tho<U+017F>e you wear, and you will pre<U+017F>ently give me a new pair in exchange of them. Thou <U+017F>ay<U+017F>t right, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> but in the mean time, leave me to my re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Cercinea</hi> knew very well that it was I who writ upon them, and though <U+017F>he had no thoughts that were advantagious unto me, yet would <U+017F>he not upon any terms let <hi>Clorian</hi> <U+017F>ee them; and le<U+017F>t this wench <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew them unto him, <U+017F>he cho<U+017F>e rather to keep them: yet it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to avoid that which heaven had decreed, as you <U+017F>hall hereafter under<U+017F>tand.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, this trivial pa<U+017F><U+017F>age was not altogether, unprofitable; for <hi>Cercinea</hi> remembring the words that I had <U+017F>poke unto her, and <U+017F>eeing with what ob<U+017F>ervance I behaved my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he was better a<U+017F><U+017F>ured by the reading of the<U+017F>e words, that I did really love her; and though <U+017F>he was far engaged with <hi>Clorian,</hi> yet could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as I was uttering the<U+017F>e words, Since all I can do will not avail to conquer the courage of this cruel Fair one, who is he that can help me? and from whom can I hope for any relief?

Do you think it is not? <U+017F>aid <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> <U+017F>ince it concerns the contentment and the life of <U+017F>uch a Cavalier? for know <hi>Cercinea,</hi> that <U+017F>ince fir<U+017F>t he <U+017F>aw you, he never thought of him<U+017F>elf, nor ever talks unto me of any thing but you; the whole <U+017F>tudy of his thoughts is to find out wayes how to <U+017F>erve you: all his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is to extol and e<U+017F>teem you, and all his de<U+017F>ires have no other ambition but the honour of your favour; But Madam, for God<U+017F>ake, I be<U+017F>eech you, keep all this <U+017F>ecret.</p>
               <p>I promi<U+017F>e you I will, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>ecret in <U+017F>uch a manner, that <hi>Cercinea</hi> her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hall neither know nor believe a word of it. O Madam, <U+017F>aid he then, that's not it which I de<U+017F>ire, but on the contrary, I would have <hi>Cercinea</hi> both know and believe it, as a mo<U+017F>t infallible truth: but my meaning is, that you <U+017F>hould not impart it either unto <hi>Palanice</hi> or <hi>Clorian</hi>: No, no, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Palanice</hi> or <hi>Clorian,</hi> nor <hi>Cercinea</hi> <U+017F>hall ever know it. Do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I told you at fir<U+017F>t, that when any told me a thing with a charge of <U+017F>ilence, I <U+017F>hould quite forget it? tru<U+017F>t me <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> I will do the <U+017F>ame by this <U+017F>ecret which you have imparted unto me, for I will not <U+017F>o much as think of it any more. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e woman, replied <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> do you think I would tell you any thing that you might forget it? Do you thus <U+017F>corn what I <U+017F>ay, and what concerns <U+017F>o deeply a Cavalier of <U+017F>uch merit, and a Lady that is the faire<U+017F>t in the world? what you have told me, replied <hi>Cercinea,</hi> has none of tho<U+017F>e qualifications, and therefore I <U+017F>ee you do but only mock me: for the Lady of whom you <U+017F>peak is good, but not fair, and the Cavalier whom you <U+017F>ay it <U+017F>o much concerns, does not think <U+017F>o; and this <U+017F>ecret which mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ly kept is known already to any that will. I am very glad, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> that, <U+017F>ince again<U+017F>t your con<U+017F>cience you will deny what I <U+017F>ay, you confe<U+017F>s, that every one knows it: As for that beauty which you deny to be in <hi>Cercinea,</hi> all that have eyes and look upon you will give you the lie; as for the affection of <hi>Alcander</hi> which you put in doubt, all his actions do give you a <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timony of it. And la<U+017F>tly, for the <U+017F>ecret, which you <U+017F>ay is none: time which is the di<U+017F>coverer of truth, will let you know, that none ever heard it but <hi>Cercinea, Alcander,</hi> and <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid:</hi> Ah lier, replied <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently, has not <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> <U+017F>poke of it <U+017F>everal times unto me? <hi>Florice,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, might perhaps <U+017F>peak what <U+017F>he thought, but not that <hi>Alcander</hi> imparted any thing unto her: then <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Palanice,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, they are acquainted with it; how, <U+017F>aid <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> they acquainted with it? mo<U+017F>t certainly, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for both of them have told me of it, and with many a bitter reproach: believe it <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> <U+017F>ince they have known it, I have not been without exerci<U+017F>e. Then <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> <U+017F>miling, fair <hi>Cercinea,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, would you have me confe<U+017F>s the truth? All that I have told you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Alcander</hi> is as true as that there is a heaven, and a God: let me be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>heered out of the number of the living, if he do not love you, nay rather adore you: but the rea<U+017F>on of my coming to you, and of all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which I have had with you, was only to know, what now you have told me concerning <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Clorian</hi>: for <hi>Alcander</hi> and I could not imagine why you <U+017F>hould treat him <U+017F>o cruelly, con<U+017F>idering his extream affection unto you, and the di<U+017F>cretion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath loved you; and thinking it not likely, that con<U+017F>idering his merit and his de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>erve you, he <U+017F>hould be cour<U+017F>ly u<U+017F>ed: but now I plainly <U+017F>ee, that all this proceeds from no ill will in you, but only from the importunity of <hi>Clorian</hi> and his <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, who are the only cau<U+017F>es of it; will you be plea<U+017F>ed to let us make this con<U+017F>truction of it? and for the <U+017F>atisfaction, or rather for <U+017F>aving the life of my dear ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>hall I let him under<U+017F>tand it <U+017F>o? and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke not; but in lieu of an<U+017F>wer ro<U+017F>e up, and walked <U+017F>oftly up and down the chamber, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this manner: I have many a time admired at the good fortune of <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, and at the bad fortune of others; I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome have great e<U+017F>tates, who were unworthy of them, and others of great worth and merit to want. The <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>ideration may be had upon this occa<U+017F>ion; for with what ju<U+017F>tice,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53528:44"/>
can the honour of your favour be denied <hi>Alcander?</hi> and what <U+017F>hadow of rea<U+017F>on can you have to let <hi>Clorian</hi> have <U+017F>uch a tirannical power over your will? If the merits of both be con<U+017F>idered, they are out of their wits that will not prefer <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander</hi> before him. This very con<U+017F>ideration is enough to win you from him: <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> is imperious and domineers over you, <hi>Alcander</hi> does humbly reverence and adore you, as if you were a godde<U+017F>s, and yet you make him inferiour to <hi>Clorian.</hi> This is a thing <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange as is hardly credible, yet it is true: you are all <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto him that tramples you under his feet, and you are all cruelty and <U+017F>corn towards him that humbly adores you. O no, replied <hi>Cercinea,</hi> you are mi<U+017F>taken <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi>; I do not <U+017F>corn him, but I do e<U+017F>teem <hi>Alcander</hi> as I ought, and as his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does oblige all tho<U+017F>e that know him: a large gratification indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid,</hi> to e<U+017F>teem him as all that know him do; but are not you obliged unto him more, <U+017F>ince he would not live but only to do you <U+017F>ervice? What more (an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) would you have me do? why <U+017F>hould I tell you, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince you will do nothing? Upon this they went to the table, and he taking up a pen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any de<U+017F>igne, why <U+017F>hould I tell you what you <U+017F>hould do more, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince I fear you will not do it? perhaps, replied <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled, you have gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed right; and perhaps al<U+017F>o you are mi<U+017F>taken: Fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid he, an<U+017F>wer me to one que<U+017F>tion I will ask: do you love <hi>Alcander,</hi> or do you hate him? A very fine que<U+017F>tion indeed, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled, and why <U+017F>hould I hate one of <U+017F>o much merit, and who never gave me any occa<U+017F>ion for it? you <U+017F>ay very true, an<U+017F>wered he, why then do you treat him with <U+017F>o much rigour? I do not know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what you call rigour. When you <U+017F>ee him, replied <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> you turn another away: if he come towards you, you flie him; if he <U+017F>peak unto you, you will not an<U+017F>wer him; or if you be forced unto it, it is but half words: breifly, all your other actions are <U+017F>corn and di<U+017F>dain of him. <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he (and laid her hand upon his <U+017F>houlder) <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>peak freely to you?

I knew well enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, that you would be incredulous, and therefore I offered you at fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>uch a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, as might make you believe what I <U+017F>ay: bethink your <U+017F>elf what will mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>pire you with belief; then <U+017F>wear, <U+017F>aid I unto him, by the love thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t me, that indeed, <U+017F>aid he, were well; but go on. Swear then, <U+017F>aid I, by the love I bear unto <hi>Cercinea.</hi> Oaths, <U+017F>aid he, are but words, and words are but wind; but I would give you <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which you may <U+017F>ee and touch: I conjure thee, (<U+017F>aid I unto him being all impatiency) to tell me what it is. I pray you content your <U+017F>elf, replied he, and believe me another time, if I <U+017F>hew you in writing, that all I have <U+017F>aid is true. O I fear, <U+017F>aid I, that your promi<U+017F>es are to bigg to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I will make it evidently appear unto you, replied he, that the effects are greater then all my promi<U+017F>es; for you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee it in writing, nay, in writing from her to you: Then giving me the paper; <U+017F>ee there, <U+017F>aid he, how that contract of love, to which I was Secretary, is approved of and <U+017F>igned by her own fair hand: there you may <U+017F>ee <hi>Cercinea</hi> <U+017F>ent unto you in writing, as an earne<U+017F>t that afterwards <U+017F>he will make you po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>our of her <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> how can I expre<U+017F>s my joys and my ravi<U+017F>hments? I ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the name

of <hi>Cercinea</hi> a thou<U+017F>and times, and laying it to my heart, me-thought I received unimaginable comfort; and becau<U+017F>e I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, and admired how it was po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould obtain this declaration from her, he related the whole <U+017F>tory of his negotiation, not omitting one <U+017F>illable; and I heard with <U+017F>o much attention and delight, as I could have wi<U+017F>hed he never would have ended: But in conclu<U+017F>ion, Ma<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he unto me) this woman has not only all imaginable excellencies of body, but <U+017F>he is one of the rare<U+017F>t wits in the world; her years, though few, are yet full of prudence and wi<U+017F>dom; and believe me, you are obliged to love her, not only for her high Beauty, but more for the good will <U+017F>he bears unto you: for be<U+017F>ides her Letter unto you, her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e does better te<U+017F>tifie, that all tho<U+017F>e actions which have <U+017F>o much tormented you, were only con<U+017F>traints, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t do no otherwi<U+017F>e: But Sir, what may you now expect from her, <U+017F>ince I have this fir<U+017F>t time obtained more then ever you could hope for?</p>
               <p>Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e together had not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon ended, had not <hi>Florice</hi> and <hi>Amilcar</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon returned from the Nuptial hou<U+017F>e, where neither of them had been very merry, and returned without much contentment; for <hi>Lucindor</hi> and <hi>Cerintes</hi> were there, who never left <hi>Florice,</hi> and <hi>Seleines</hi> kept <hi>Palanice</hi> company, <U+017F>o as <hi>Amilcar</hi> could not talk unto her without witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. As <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>aw them, <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> and I having done di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I took them both by their hands, and drawing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide; now (<U+017F>aid I unto them) I will participate of your contentments, that this merry night pa<U+017F>s not away without <U+017F>ome delight unto me.

Then (replyed <hi>Florice</hi>) I cannot tell you any news, but that I have been the mo<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ecuted woman in the world with their importunities, or rather jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ies; for I could never <U+017F>peak to the one, but the eye of the other was upon me, and I could not do any manner of thing which did not di<U+017F>oblige them both: he to whom I talked, was <U+017F>orry I did not look upon her; and he upon whom I looked, was angry it was not him I talked unto: and I was afraid left they <U+017F>hould have faln foul upon one another.

               <p>We could not forbear laughing at this Declaration: Si<U+017F>ter <U+017F>aid I unto her, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love them, or love them not, that's all I care, <U+017F>o you will but <U+017F>eem to do as I de<U+017F>ired: But <hi>Amilcar</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) what adventures have befallen you? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well at fir<U+017F>t, an<U+017F>wered he, but at la<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o: When we were altogether at the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, <hi>Seleines</hi> was not there; <U+017F>o as finding the place free, and becau<U+017F>e I would not let <U+017F>uch an opportunity <U+017F>lip, I told her, that I <U+017F>hould have cur<U+017F>ed my Brother, if I had gone with him, as he de<U+017F>ired: Perhaps (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) you would have found more contentment there then here: Indeed (replyed I) there's none can tell better then <hi>Palanice,</hi> <U+017F>ince it is in her power to make me the mo<U+017F>t contented, or the <U+017F>adde<U+017F>t man in the world, and this <U+017F>he may do with one word: If <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you have confined your good or bad fortune unto a very narrow room. No, no, an<U+017F>wered I, for I <U+017F>et <U+017F>uch a value upon you, that the very lea<U+017F>t things which come from you, <U+017F>eem great unto me. Take heed <hi>Amilcar</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that what you think <U+017F>o, do not prove <U+017F>o really. Oh faire<U+017F>t <hi>Palanice,</hi> replyed I, I would to God you would be plea<U+017F>ed to make me judge of it by experience. What would you have me do (replyed <U+017F>he) to make you <U+017F>o knowing? I would have you <U+017F>peak but one word only (<U+017F>aid I) that is, I love <hi>Amilcar.</hi> That word (replyed <U+017F>he) <U+017F>ounds <U+017F>o ill in the mouth of a woman, that I cannot <U+017F>peak it. Say then replyed I, The love of <hi>Amilcar</hi> is plea<U+017F>ing unto me. How? replyed <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, would you have me <U+017F>ay it when I do not think <U+017F>o, nor believe it? Oh heaven! cryed I,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53528:45"/>
do you not believe it? What <U+017F>hould I do to create a Belief in you? If that Belief (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) would do you any good, you mu<U+017F>t find our ways to infu<U+017F>e it; but I will advi<U+017F>e you no further. When I have brought it to that pa<U+017F>s, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe I love you (<U+017F>aid I) will it be plea<U+017F>ing unto you then? The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon things future (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) is very uncertain, and one can hardly be <U+017F>ure of any thing. Unto what then (replyed I) <U+017F>hall I have recour<U+017F>e? Upon this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leines</hi> came in, who hindred us from any further talk, but that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me in a low voice, unto Tryal; And after this, we could not all that night <U+017F>peak a word, without that trouble<U+017F>ome witne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Hylas</hi> we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed together, and I thus under<U+017F>tood their adventures, and they not mine; Not but that I <U+017F>hould willingly have imparted it unto them, had I not feared the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Cercinea,</hi> who I <U+017F>aw was extreamly con<U+017F>trained by that authority which <hi>Palanice</hi> had u<U+017F>urped over her; and becau<U+017F>e it was very late, we retired to our re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>But I held <hi>Bili<U+017F>ard</hi> <U+017F>o long in talk in my chamber, by making him repeat what he had told me before, that day did appear before I would permit him to retire. The Sun then <U+017F>hining upon us, we re<U+017F>olved to gain <hi>Cercineas</hi> chambermaid, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find any defence from her eyes: And <U+017F>ince <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> had been already <U+017F>o pro<U+017F>perous in his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign, I referred the managing of all matters wholly unto him.</p>
               <p>The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <hi>Hylas</hi> would be too long, if I <U+017F>hould relate unto you all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages concerning my Brother and me, and the<U+017F>e four Cavaliers. But <U+017F>o it was, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>ard</hi> did negotiate the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o well, that he did not only in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elf into great credit with <hi>Cercinea,</hi> but al<U+017F>o made <hi>Andronira</hi> entirely his. Yet as ill fortune was, I was that time con<U+017F>trained to take a journey of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary importance about our e<U+017F>tate, into the Country of <hi>Veragrois,</hi> and my mother, do what I could, would by all means have me po<U+017F>t away with all <U+017F>peed; God knows whether this journey was not with an ill will, and whether I would not willingly have referred this charge unto <hi>Amilcar</hi>: But I being the elder, and con<U+017F>equently the heir to the e<U+017F>tate, I mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve upon this unwilling departure.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>ee whether Fortune was not re<U+017F>olved to try my re<U+017F>olution and patience? When I had <U+017F>tayed to the la<U+017F>t minute, and my journey could not be deferred a jot longer, <hi>Cercinea</hi> fell <U+017F>ick; whether it was by too exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive heat (for then it was the Dog-days) or whether by eating too much fruit, as young per<U+017F>ons are apt at that <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on; but <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he was forced to her bed by a violent Fever: Oh <hi>Hylas</hi>! How heartily I wi<U+017F>hed <hi>Amilcar</hi> were my elder brother; or at lea<U+017F>t that tho<U+017F>e Rents which I was to receive and give di<U+017F>charge for, had not been due: and the wor<U+017F>t was, <hi>Clorian</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> never <U+017F>tirr'd from her Beds <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>o as it was a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to <U+017F>peak unto her before I went, unle<U+017F>s before tho<U+017F>e two malignant witne<U+017F><U+017F>es: Imagine what a leave I took, and what <U+017F>atisfaction I had in my adieu. It was my cu<U+017F>tome always to carry <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> with me, becau<U+017F>e I loved him as a <U+017F>econd <U+017F>elf; but at this time I left him behind expre<U+017F>ly, to try if he could convey a Letter unto this Fair one, which might te<U+017F>tifie my <U+017F>orrows by my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to <U+017F>end me word how <U+017F>he did.

               <p>
                  <hi>Amilcar</hi> in my ab<U+017F>ence was <U+017F>o diligent in his court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Palanice,</hi> as he put <hi>Seleines, Cercineas</hi> elder brother, to abundance of pain. This <hi>Seleines</hi> as you know, was a very brave Cavelier, none excelled him, and few equall'd him in feats of Arms, or any thing belonging to a Cavalier: At Barriers, and Tiltings he always got the advantage: And as he had the e<U+017F>teem of every one, <U+017F>o had he no ill opinion of him<U+017F>elf; yet curteous and full of re<U+017F>pect to his friends, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle imperious in his affection, and thought that he obliged a Lady if he loved her. This Cavalier being brought up in the Court of King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> and being very young, he ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon <hi>Palanice</hi>: Their hou<U+017F>es being near adjoyning, and <U+017F>he being oft in the Queens Court, he had frequent opportunities of <U+017F>eeing her. This affection grew <U+017F>o great by degrees, that <hi>Sileines</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> al<U+017F>o, became both perfect Lovers: yet becau<U+017F>e the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> who was about the <U+017F>ame age, fell in love at the <U+017F>ame time with that Lady, re<U+017F>pect made them di<U+017F><U+017F>emble their loves, and move <hi>Sileines</hi> to keep at a di<U+017F>tance: And though this at the fir<U+017F>t was more in appearance then in effect, yet continuing in this di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, <hi>Sileines</hi> turned his eyes upon <hi>Dori<U+017F>a</hi>; and though he deny it, yet it was generally thought that his je<U+017F>ting proved to be in earne<U+017F>t. <hi>Palanice,</hi> as young as <U+017F>he was, con<U+017F>ented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Artifice, to remove from Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> all cau<U+017F>e of withdrawing that affection which he profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, and never re<U+017F>ented the lo<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Sileines,</hi> as long as <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> continued loving her: But it hapned a while after, that this young Prince who<U+017F>e humour was not unalterable, did for <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e or other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his affection. I believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and interrupted) that the occa<U+017F>ion was not great; for being then at <hi>Lions,</hi> I heard as much. The relation of it, replyed <hi>Alcander,</hi> is various; but the mo<U+017F>t common report is, that <hi>Palanice</hi> being with the Queen, Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> mother, as <U+017F>he was helping to dre<U+017F>s her, this young Prince came to her, and took her fingers to play with them: <hi>Palanice</hi> fearing left the Queen <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee, pull'd back her hand two or three times; and becau<U+017F>e he continued <U+017F>till, Sir (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I be<U+017F>eech you let me alone: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>omthing <U+017F>harply, he <U+017F>aid unto her, Would you indeed have me let you alone? Then <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wering in the <U+017F>ame words and tone; I promi<U+017F>e you (replyed <U+017F>he and blu<U+017F>hed) you <U+017F>hall never have occa<U+017F>ion to bid me the third time; and upon that he left her, <U+017F>o as ever <U+017F>ince he looked upon her only as a per<U+017F>on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: The cau<U+017F>e indeed of this <U+017F>eparation was very trivial, but it <U+017F>erved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce this affection, <U+017F>o as it never <U+017F>ince knit again.</p>
               <p>A while before <hi>Sileines</hi> making <U+017F>hew of love unto <hi>Dori<U+017F>a,</hi> a very fair and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome Lady, he became fettered in good earne<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hewing by this experience, that fictions in love are very dangerous; for Love is but a play, and by playing, one may come to love in earne<U+017F>t. <hi>Palanices</hi> vexing at the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at the diver<U+017F>ion of <hi>Seleines,</hi> made the way ea<U+017F>ie for <hi>Ro<U+017F>iliander,</hi> who no <U+017F>ooner began to wooe, then to win her; and the more ea<U+017F>ily, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of the Court, and de<U+017F>irous to be far from the place where <U+017F>he found nothing but di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures, <U+017F>he entertained <hi>Ro<U+017F>iliander,</hi> who<U+017F>e habitation was the mo<U+017F>t remote parts of the Sebu<U+017F>ians: But <U+017F>ee whether Love be not a very child, <hi>Sileines</hi> no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Palanice</hi> gone, but he began to remember that heretofore he had loved her, and grieved more for her ab<U+017F>ence then he cared for her pre<U+017F>ence. Now began Letters and Me<U+017F><U+017F>ages to pa<U+017F>s apace betwixt them, and Love found more heat at a di<U+017F>tance, then near hand: But it mu<U+017F>t needs be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that both of them did well de<U+017F>erve the pains they endured; Love <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf ju<U+017F>t in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hing Incon<U+017F>tancy, or rather the imprudency of the<U+017F>e two Lovers, by a two-years ab<U+017F>ence, during which time there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed good corre<U+017F>pondency betwixt them, and they heard from each other very oft.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t heaven (which does ordinarily favour tho<U+017F>e that love, and continue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) did deliver <hi>Palanice</hi> from the obligations of marriage by the death of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iliander.</hi>

She <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf now free, and weary of the Sebu<U+017F>ians, <U+017F>he returned into her native air, where <U+017F>he found Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> married: and though he was pre<U+017F>ently after a widdower, yet no <U+017F>parks of that old affection which once he extingui<U+017F>hed were <U+017F>een to revive: But <hi>Seleines</hi> who expected her with extream impatience, receaved her with abundance of contentment.</p>
               <p>I make a brief relation of the<U+017F>e things unto you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you may the better under<U+017F>tand what a task <hi>Amilcar</hi> undertook when he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>erve <hi>Palanice:</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was already engaged another way long before, and that to a per<U+017F>on of very rare and high accompli<U+017F>hments; yet the ob<U+017F>ervances of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were <U+017F>uch, and he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with <U+017F>o much prudence and di<U+017F>cretion, that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leines</hi> could not defend him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ions of jealou<U+017F>ie, a thing very common among<U+017F>t lovers, and <U+017F>uch as have not a very full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of the good will of tho<U+017F>e they court. At fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Palanice</hi> <U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>he were afraid to ca<U+017F>t any eye of love upon him; but afterwards, whether it was that <U+017F>ome friend had given her advice, or whether <U+017F>he di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ted <U+017F>omething in <hi>Selienes,</hi> but <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he received the <U+017F>ervices of <hi>Amilcar</hi> very favourably, making it appear that <U+017F>he gave <U+017F>uch coun<U+017F>el unto <hi>Cercinea,</hi> as <U+017F>he would not follow her <U+017F>elf, for <U+017F>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed her to make <hi>Clorian</hi> jealous. One day when <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Silienes</hi> both were with her at her hou<U+017F>e, and neither of them, for fear of each other, dur<U+017F>t talk a <U+017F>illable of their affections, they began to hint at it after <U+017F>uch a manner, as <U+017F>laves do, for fear of beating, and fell into a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <U+017F>laves. I wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sileines,</hi> that I might, as <U+017F>laves are for fear of loving, be marked under that notion, by your fair hand: Truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if you will, I will <U+017F>atisfie your de<U+017F>ire. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his hand, <U+017F>hall I, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with the point of a needle, <U+017F>et my mark upon your arm? If you <U+017F>hould, <U+017F>aid he, I <U+017F>hould not keep it long, for it would wear out: No, no, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, (after <U+017F>he had begun to <U+017F>cratch it a little) I will put a little ink upon it, and it will continue long: <hi>Sileines</hi> then con<U+017F>enting, <U+017F>he began with the point of a needle to ra<U+017F>e the skin by little and little; but he impatient of <U+017F>o much pain, could not any longer indure it. Then <hi>Amilcar,</hi> holding out his arm, here Madam, <U+017F>aid he, honour this arm with what mark you plea<U+017F>e, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, the pain <U+017F>hall not deprive me of that contentment. <hi>Palanice,</hi> who was not <U+017F>o fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with my brother, no, no, <hi>Amilcar,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I dare not do you <U+017F>o much harm: and yet, replied he, you dare do it for <hi>Sileines</hi>; 'Tis true, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but it is by way of revenge, for he did me an injury long <U+017F>ince, and I would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h him for it. Then Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amilcar,</hi> do that unto this arm by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, which you would have done by way of revenge upon the arm of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leines.</hi> Pray Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Seleines,</hi> what recompence can you demand of her? The gods, replied my brother, do accept of the good will for the deed it <U+017F>elf. This Lady therefore, whom I e<U+017F>teem and honour no le<U+017F>s then any godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, does own unto me a great recompence, if it be proportionable unto the good will I have to do her <U+017F>ervice. The Ladies of this country, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sileines,</hi> are <U+017F>o far from <U+017F>o much liberality, that they do not pay tho<U+017F>e debts which they ju<U+017F>tly ow, and therefore it is very unlikely they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o forward as to pay off tho<U+017F>e obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are yet to come. There are, replied my brother, both <U+017F>ervants and <U+017F>ervices of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts and prices: be<U+017F>ides, I believe, prayers and <U+017F>upplications will never offend any; and I do beg this favour, but not as a due debt. <hi>Palanice,</hi> who as I believe was de<U+017F>irous to nouri<U+017F>h the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Sileines</hi>; No, no, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I would have <hi>Amilcar</hi> to know that you do make us far more niggardly and <U+017F>pairing of our favours then we are: then taking his hand, but now I do not know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, whether my re<U+017F>olution will let me fini<U+017F>h that payment which you ask: upon this word <U+017F>he made in his arm the fir<U+017F>t letter of her name, whil<U+017F>t he did not <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o much as to feel what <U+017F>he did; and afterwards <U+017F>he took the blacke<U+017F>t ink <U+017F>he could chu<U+017F>e, and filled up the <U+017F>cratch which <U+017F>he had made, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <U+017F>o into the skin, that the print of it would remain a long while, at which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leines</hi> began to grumble, but <U+017F>he began to laugh, and <U+017F>aid, had I marked all tho<U+017F>e that were mine, thus, I <U+017F>hould have known them again when they <U+017F>trayed from me, or might in rea<U+017F>on have demanded them back from tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>tole them from me. If you think to have retained them that way (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sileines,</hi> who was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53528:47"/>
extreamly stung, and knew <U+017F>he did it in reproach of him) I believe you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. However, replyed <U+017F>he, I will try this means, <U+017F>ince I have found all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers naught. Take heed (<U+017F>aid he, and went away in a di<U+017F>contented manner) that the fault be not your own. Thus <hi>Sileines</hi> went away, and left the room free unto my Brother, who was not at all <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee this petty divorce, which yet la<U+017F>ted not long; for within two days after <hi>Sileines</hi> returned, and with a thou<U+017F>and repentant <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, obtained a pardon for his cholerick departure.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Lucindor,</hi> the younger Brother of <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Cerintes,</hi> Brother unto <hi>Clorian</hi> and <hi>Palanice,</hi> who loved our Si<U+017F>ter, they lo<U+017F>t no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <U+017F>hewing their wills; and as <hi>Seleines</hi> was jealous, <hi>Lucindor</hi> and <hi>Cerintes</hi> were no le<U+017F>s. I will not here enter into any elogies in commendations of <hi>Florices</hi> deportment, left, <hi>Hylas</hi> you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me of flattery and partiality (<U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Si<U+017F>ter) but the truth is, <U+017F>he carried her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o prudently, as de<U+017F>erved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of e<U+017F>teem; you <U+017F>ee her mode<U+017F>t behaviour, and equality towards all, and <U+017F>he is the very <U+017F>ame towards one that <U+017F>he is towards the other; <U+017F>o ballancing her favours, as one can very hardly brag of any favour above the other.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t that loved her was <hi>Lucindor,</hi> but he was pre<U+017F>ently con<U+017F>trained to a long journey, he found <hi>Cerintes,</hi> if not in his place, yet in one that was no le<U+017F>s advantagious then his; and therefore he being in humour very like unto his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Selienes,</hi> he was out of all patience; yet <hi>Florices</hi> di<U+017F>cretion did <U+017F>o temper his <U+017F>pirit, that at la<U+017F>t he was brought to terms of rea<U+017F>on, though not without much heart-burning betwixt the<U+017F>e two Rivals; and had not <hi>Cerintes</hi> been a very rarely accompli<U+017F>hed Cavalier, and <hi>Lucindor</hi> the <U+017F>ame, certainly the jealou<U+017F>ie that was betwixt them was <U+017F>uch, as perhaps might have produced ill effects.</p>
               <p>When the affections of the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers were at the height, <hi>Florice</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the Town to <U+017F>ee an Aunt that was very <U+017F>ick: This departure was very <U+017F>ad unto both the<U+017F>e Lovers; for nothing is more in<U+017F>upportable in love, then to lo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ight of the loved party.</p>
               <p>Thus the<U+017F>e four Cavaliers pur<U+017F>ued their de<U+017F>igns, whil<U+017F>t I was at <hi>Agaune,</hi> where days <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o long and tedious to me as years. And becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>aw my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s would retain me yet longer there, my de<U+017F>ires of knowing how <hi>Cercinea</hi> did, and how <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> did thrive in my negotiation, I di<U+017F>patched a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger unto him, with a Letter for him to pre<U+017F>ent unto <hi>Cercinea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This me<U+017F><U+017F>enger made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te, that the third day he arrived at <hi>Lions,</hi> where <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> began to be weary, and wonder that he heard no ofter from me, and to think that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which I left to his negotiation, ought to have made me write oftner unto him: He began therefore to complain again<U+017F>t my forgetfulne<U+017F>s, when he received my letter, which convinced him that he was too blame in having any <U+017F>uch thoughts of me: He received the<U+017F>e Letters with extream contentment, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clorian</hi> about three days before was forced into the Country about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which would retain him there; but yet <hi>Palanice</hi> was always at <hi>Cercineas</hi> beds <U+017F>ide, or el<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ervant which they had <U+017F>et to wait upon her: But <hi>Amilcar</hi> knowing what affection I bore unto <hi>Cercinea,</hi> he would go often unto <hi>Palanice,</hi> and entertain her with talk of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, whil<U+017F>t in the interim <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> effected his.</p>
               <p>At this time, when my Letters came, <hi>Amilcar</hi> was very bu<U+017F>ie at Court with Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>; and <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> who <U+017F>ate upon thorns till he talked with <hi>Cercinea,</hi> he dur<U+017F>t not go unto her alone; but as fortune was, he met <hi>Palanice</hi> as <U+017F>he was going from her hou<U+017F>e to the Temple; and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was out of <U+017F>ight, he went immediately into the hou<U+017F>e, where by fortune he met <hi>Andronira</hi>; Sweetheart (<U+017F>aid he) how does our Mi<U+017F>tris? As for your Mi<U+017F>tris (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how <U+017F>he does; but as for mine, <U+017F>he begins to mend, thanks be to God, and I believe will not long keep her bed. If I have any Mi<U+017F>tris, (replyed he) it mu<U+017F>t be under<U+017F>tood <hi>Andronira,</hi> but when I <U+017F>ay our Mi<U+017F>tris, you mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand I mean <hi>Cercinea</hi>; for <U+017F>he being Mi<U+017F>tris unto my Mi<U+017F>tris and my Ma<U+017F>ter, I may very well call her ours. Ah Di<U+017F><U+017F>embler (replyed <U+017F>he. and <U+017F>miled) if <U+017F>he were no more the Mi<U+017F>tris of your Ma<U+017F>ter, then <hi>Andronira</hi> is yours, you would not come to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>o often. Then having <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to do in the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he told him, that he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53528:47"/>
might venture to go unto <hi>Cercinea</hi> for all the other woman was there, for <U+017F>he will not tell tales. How? <U+017F>aid <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> have you gained her already? <hi>Cercinea,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, has charmed her, and won her love, <U+017F>o as I dare <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he will not do any thing that will di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her; but for all that, it is not good to tru<U+017F>t unto her altogether, until a little further tryal; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he takes <U+017F>o much delight in <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you dance, and hearing you <U+017F>ing, I am afraid <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> that if you be my <U+017F>ervant, I mu<U+017F>t ere long go look out for another. No, no <hi>Andronira,</hi> (replyed he) but however, I will dance and <U+017F>ing; and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall love me, and I will <U+017F>eem to love her: Upon this, becau<U+017F>e he would not lo<U+017F>e the opportunity, he went up to <hi>Cercineas</hi> chamber, in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>inging, dancing, and jolly manner, that as <U+017F>oon as the Wench heard him; Oh Madam (cryed <U+017F>he, and clapt her hands together for joy) yonder is <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi>; At the <U+017F>ame time he entred, and <U+017F>eigning not to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cercinea</hi> in bed, he ran to the wench with open Arms, as if he would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her; but when he came to the middle of the room, he <U+017F>topt upon a <U+017F>udden, <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if he had not <U+017F>pyed her Mi<U+017F>tris till then: Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) had I thought you had been in bed, I <U+017F>hould not have pre<U+017F>umed to enter. <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I know your di<U+017F>cretion, and therefore you are welcome: this is not the fir<U+017F>t time you have <U+017F>een me in this place. 'Tis true Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, but now you are <U+017F>ick, what pretence can I have for my coming hither? To comfort me in my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, replyed <U+017F>he. Madam (<U+017F>aid he then very gravely unto her) If you would take one medicine which I can tell you, I <U+017F>wear by <hi>Jupiter</hi> it would pre<U+017F>ently cure you. Are you in good earne<U+017F>t? <U+017F>aid the wench, and interrupted him. Yes (replyed <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi>) and I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>he would believe me. Did I think (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Cercinea</hi>) that your medicine were a good one, I would u<U+017F>e it. <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> who de<U+017F>ired to give her the Letter under this pretence, Madam (<U+017F>aid he) when did I ever tell you a lie? Or wherein did I ever deceive you? Never, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but I am <U+017F>o weary of all Phy<U+017F>icians, who torment me with <U+017F>o many loth<U+017F>ome drugs, as if I thought your medicine were a good one, I would take it with all my heart. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> never let me live a moment longer in your favour, if it do not mo<U+017F>t perfectly cure you. <hi>Cercinea</hi> knew wel enough that this medicine was <U+017F>omthing which was more proper for the mind then the body; and being very willing to be deceived, <U+017F>he hearkned unto him: What? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, mu<U+017F>t I take any loth<U+017F>ome potion? No, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he; This medicine does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t mo<U+017F>t in the vertue of <U+017F>ome words. Perhaps then, replyed <U+017F>he, it is <U+017F>ome charm. No, replyed he, I am no Sorcerer; The words may be well under<U+017F>tood, they are no unknown Characters, nor has any thing like Sorcery in them. Then <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am willing to make u<U+017F>e of them, tell me therefore what I mu<U+017F>t do? This remedy, replyed he, mu<U+017F>t be kept very <U+017F>ecret; for if it be divulged, it will lo<U+017F>e its vertue. Upon this he kneeled down by her beds <U+017F>ide, and taking the Letter which I had written unto her, Do you think (<U+017F>aid he aloud) that I mock you? He who give it unto me, did write in this paper the directions which are to be u<U+017F>ed, and which I will let you <U+017F>ee: then feigning to look it out among<U+017F>t many other papers that he had in his pocket, he gave her the Letter, which he fir<U+017F>t un<U+017F>ealed, to the end the wench <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any thing: Then <U+017F>he read the<U+017F>e words.</p>

Well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, I will take the advice of my Councel, <hi>Clorian</hi> and <hi>Palanice.

               <p>The next morning he went to vi<U+017F>it his patient, and <U+017F>ee what operation his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt had, taking his time for it, when <hi>Palanice,</hi> according to her cu<U+017F>tome, had bid good morrow unto <hi>Circinea,</hi> and was gone to the Temple.</p>

My Receipt Madam, replyed he, is only for you; but I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, how did you pa<U+017F>s away the night? <hi>Andronira</hi> can tell you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I have ob<U+017F>erved your directions: Upon this, <U+017F>eeing none in the chamber, <U+017F>he took the Letter from <hi>Andronira,</hi> and gave it unto him; Here (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) Seal it, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your Ma<U+017F>ter that I writ it for your <U+017F>ake. Oh Madam, replyed he, This favour will make him compleatly happy; and I dare <U+017F>ay, this paper mu<U+017F>t never depart from that place where you wear that Receipt which I gave unto you, for he will hold it at a far dearer rate then all his e<U+017F>tate. You have that opinion, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, becau<U+017F>e you think he loves me. I do not think it, replyed he, for I know it of mo<U+017F>t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge. As <hi>Andronira</hi> was combing her hair, <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> was very bu<U+017F>ie in taking that hair which <U+017F>tuck upon the Combe, and which, by rea<U+017F>on of her <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, did come off very much. Madam (<U+017F>aid he) if you will make him mo<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy, give me leave to <U+017F>end him this which your Comb hath <U+017F>tolen from your fair hair. Oh God! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I had rather die then any man living <U+017F>hould have any of my hair; and becau<U+017F>e he had it already in his hand, <hi>Andronira,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, let him not have it. Believe it, Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he has it already. Oh God! <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> what a fool you were to let him take it. Then turning towards <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>ard,</hi> Come, come <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, give it me again, for I will have it, el<U+017F>e be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry with you. Pardon me Madam, I be<U+017F>eech you, an<U+017F>wered he; for trea<U+017F>on, and breach of tru<U+017F>t, is the mo<U+017F>t abominable vice that can be in man. True, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but there is neither in this which I ask: If in re<U+017F>toring this which you ask, an<U+017F>wered he, I do not commit trea<U+017F>on, and break my tru<U+017F>t, I am contented to re<U+017F>tore what I <U+017F>tole; but <U+017F>ince I know you will count me the mo<U+017F>t infamous man upon earth if I <U+017F>hould, I will keep it. The<U+017F>e excu<U+017F>es and pretences (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>erve your turn, for I will have it; and indeed <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> you will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53528:49"/>
do me a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, if you do not re<U+017F>tore it unto me. Fir<U+017F>t Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Andronira,</hi> he plea<U+017F>ed to hear his rea<U+017F>ons. My rea<U+017F>ons, an<U+017F>wered he, are invincible; for when my Ma<U+017F>ter commanded me to <U+017F>tay in this Town, about the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which I know of I vowed unto him, to do all I could that would conduce to his contentment; and were I not a Traytor, and a mo<U+017F>t perjur'd per<U+017F>on, if I <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>tore this back? and did I not fal<U+017F>ifie that tru<U+017F>t which he repo<U+017F>eth in me? Certainly Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Andronira</hi>) he is obliged in Con<U+017F>cience to keep his Vow. Certainly <hi>Andronira</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea</hi>) you are out of your wits, to think that any man ought to have any of my hair. Madam, replyed <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard,</hi> as unto you, <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> is no man, he is only your <U+017F>ervant. She would have replyed, but <hi>Mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ina</hi> entred; <U+017F>he <U+017F>topt upon a <U+017F>udden: and <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> fearing le<U+017F>t this <U+017F>udden <U+017F>ilence <U+017F>hould rai<U+017F>e any mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, Sweet-heart (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I am glad you are come to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me, for this Lady will continue the Receipt no longer, and <U+017F>ays, that once is often enough to u<U+017F>e it: and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>he had better never to have begun, then to leave it <U+017F>o imperfect. Oh Madam, an<U+017F>wered the Wench, What a <U+017F>trange humour is this? Will you be always <U+017F>ick? I pray what pain does the Receipt of <hi>Beli<U+017F>ard</hi> put you unto? It vexes me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> to continue the <U+017F>ame thing <U+017F>o long. But Madam, replyed <hi>Andronira,</hi> Is it not better to continue it <U+017F>o long then to continue <U+017F>ick in your bed? The truth is Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ina,</hi> if you will not ob<U+017F>erve the directions of the Receipt with a good will, you <U+017F>hall by force, for you mu<U+017F>t read it: Then untying the <U+017F>tring which was about the paper, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented it unto <hi>Cercinea</hi> to read. Prithee good <hi>Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ina</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea</hi> unto her, read it for me. Nay by my Faith Madam (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and turned away) I heartily thank you, would you have me to be <U+017F>ick? <hi>Andronira</hi> and her Mi<U+017F>tris laughed heartily at the <U+017F>implicity of the wench; and after <hi>Cercinia</hi> had read it, what (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t I do with it now?

But in what a rapture of joy was I, when opening <hi>Cercineas</hi> Letter, I found her hair in it! I ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it a thou<U+017F>and times, and it was happy that none was pre<U+017F>ent when I opened them, for it had been a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to have concealed my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream contentment. At la<U+017F>t after I had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and over-ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed this fair hair, I read the Letter, which was in the<U+017F>e terms.</p>

               <p>For <hi>Hylas,</hi> no mortal man can be capable of greater felicity, and no le<U+017F>s then two hearts and two <U+017F>ouls are requi<U+017F>ite to gu<U+017F>t it.

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>aw my beloved <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> I was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy at tho<U+017F>e good offices which he had done me in my ab<U+017F>ence, that I could not Carre<U+017F>s him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. He on the other <U+017F>ide who loved me extremely well, had <U+017F>o great a de<U+017F>ire to talk with me in private, that he would hardly give me leave to <U+017F>ee my mother and my brother. But after our fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>alutations, (having given a general relation of my ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s) I pretended to be very weary, that I might retire with my dear <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid</hi>: and I believe my brother took notice of it; for I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>mile two or three times at my impatience, and mea<U+017F>uring me by him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who was no le<U+017F>s impatient then I, did follow me <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e into my chamber, as I was no <U+017F>ooner entred, but he had <U+017F>hut the door. Then did I redouble my Care<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, and asked particular que<U+017F>tions of all he had done during my ab<U+017F>ence.

               <p>But being late we were con<U+017F>trained to part, and therefore bidding goodnight we retired to our chambers with much <U+017F>atisfaction to my <U+017F>elf, where as late as it was, <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> and I, had a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, from whom I heard all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt <hi>Andronira</hi> and him.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Florice</hi> heard of my return, it <U+017F>eems <U+017F>he had a mind to make good the words of <hi>Cercinea</hi>; for <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently came to <U+017F>ee me, but becau<U+017F>e her Aunt was very <U+017F>ick <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>tay, only dined with us and then returned; yet not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, but <hi>Lucindor</hi> was fir<U+017F>t adverti<U+017F>ed of it: for <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid,</hi> who thought this to be advantageous unto my affairs, was of opinion that it was requi<U+017F>ite to oblige him, and to enter into <U+017F>ome conferrence with him, to the end that when he came to <hi>Cercineas</hi> hou<U+017F>e he might bid him welcome: It was <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> therefore that gave him this intelligence, yet he no <U+017F>ooner came but <hi>Florice</hi> departed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hylas,</hi> you may remember how I once did write <U+017F>omething in the glove of <hi>Cercinea</hi>; I know not how it came to pa<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>o it was, that they came to <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices</hi> hands: we had conceit that <hi>Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ina</hi> finding them, did give them unto her; but however, <hi>Clorian</hi> was quickly acquainted, and leaving all his Court bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at randome, he returned home with more ha<U+017F>t then I de<U+017F>ired. The fir<U+017F>t vexation I re<U+017F>ented, was, that <hi>Cercinea</hi> entreated <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> to keep me from making <U+017F>o many vi<U+017F>its; and when I did go to <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t hardly come near me, or ca<U+017F>t an eye that way, much le<U+017F>s to <U+017F>peak unto me; I did re<U+017F>ent this change very <U+017F>adly, and much admired at it: for I thought tho<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies of good will which <U+017F>he had given me, were too great to be forgotten, and to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, it was too gro<U+017F>s; and becau<U+017F>e I could not indure this without making <U+017F>ome demon<U+017F>trations of my re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Beli<U+017F>aid</hi> thought it good for me to <U+017F>end for <hi>Florice</hi>; for <hi>Lucindor</hi> perhaps
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53528:51"/>
might gain upon her; which if he did, he might cau<U+017F>e <hi>Cercinea</hi> to <U+017F>hake off the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Palanice</hi> and <hi>Clorian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As fortune was, when we were bu<U+017F>ied to find out <U+017F>ome hand<U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e for her return, the death of our Aunt did furni<U+017F>h us with a very good one, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he returned of her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ooner then we looked for her. The ceremony of mourning for this good aged woman was <U+017F>oon over; for the infirmities of old age were <U+017F>uch a great burthen unto her, that her friends rejoyced, rather then mourned to <U+017F>ee her delivered from them. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Florice</hi> came, I de<U+017F>ired her to u<U+017F>e her utmo<U+017F>t endeavours upon <hi>Lucindor,</hi> to favour me; <U+017F>he, who loved me very well, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither wit nor will to negotiate <U+017F>uch a matter, did <U+017F>o prevail with <hi>Lucindor,</hi> that he took my part both again<U+017F>t <hi>Clorian,</hi> and again<U+017F>t <hi>Palanice</hi>: indeed he <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o affectionately to his Si<U+017F>ter, as <U+017F>he (to our thoughts) had <U+017F>ome inclination to me, and began to lean towards my <U+017F>ide; when <hi>Clorian</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, re<U+017F>olved to negotiate with <hi>Sileines,</hi> after the very <U+017F>ame manner that <hi>Florice</hi> did with <hi>Lucindor</hi>; for <hi>Sileines</hi> was in love with <hi>Palanice,</hi> and was elder brother unto the fair <hi>Cercinea,</hi> <U+017F>o as by this means he took their part all that po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly he could. To what purpo<U+017F>e <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>hould I u<U+017F>e any longer di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this matter; <hi>Sileines</hi> for the love he bore <hi>Palanice,</hi> took <hi>Clorians</hi> part, <U+017F>o as the<U+017F>e two Brothers were one again<U+017F>t the other, and the Family <U+017F>o divided, that all was like to be in a great confu<U+017F>ion: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> it hapned al<U+017F>o at the <U+017F>ame time, that as <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineas</hi> family was divided betwixt <hi>Clorian</hi> and me: <U+017F>o ours al<U+017F>o was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Lucindor</hi> and <hi>Cerintes</hi>; for tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers (as I told you) loved our Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Florice</hi>; and I took part with <hi>Lucindor,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was <hi>Cercineas</hi> brother, who did me all the good offices he could; and <hi>Amilcar</hi> favoured <hi>Cerintes,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto <hi>Palanice,</hi> upon the <U+017F>ame intere<U+017F>t: And pre<U+017F>ently after, the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F><U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hapned between <hi>Clorian</hi> and <hi>Cerintes,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clorian</hi> was all for <hi>Sileines,</hi> who loved <hi>Palanice</hi>; and <hi>Cerintes</hi> <U+017F>olicited <hi>Palanice</hi> for <hi>Amilcar,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was the <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Florice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <U+017F>ee, I be<U+017F>eech you, how Love had bu<U+017F>ied him<U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t us; for <hi>Florice</hi> never met <hi>Cercinea,</hi> but <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke unto her in my behalf, and <hi>Cercinea</hi> <U+017F>olicited as much in behalf of <hi>Lucindor, Cercinea</hi> never <U+017F>aw <hi>Palanice,</hi> but <U+017F>he entreated her to favour <hi>Sileines,</hi> and <hi>Palanice</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time recommended <hi>Clorian</hi> unto her. When <hi>Palanice</hi> met <hi>Florice,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>olicited her in behalf of her Brother <hi>Cerintes,</hi> and <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>olicited her in behalf of <hi>Amilcar.</hi> Judge (I be<U+017F>eech you) when we met all together, what fine di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e there was among<U+017F>t us: It was very happy we were all intimate friends before the<U+017F>e cro<U+017F>s intere<U+017F>ts fell out; for otherwi<U+017F>e, doubtle<U+017F>s things would have fallen out very foul among<U+017F>t us: But all of us fore<U+017F>eeing that things could not long continue thus, without <U+017F>ome more bitter exa<U+017F>perations, one day when we were all met together at <hi>Cercineas</hi> hou<U+017F>e, we all agreed, both Ladies and Cavaliers, to <U+017F>ubmit our <U+017F>elves unto the Will of God, and <U+017F>o went all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enquire of the Oracle, at the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> where we received this an<U+017F>wer.</p>

               <p>Thus ended <hi>Alcander</hi>; and it being very late, <hi>Hylas</hi> (who began to be very <U+017F>leepy) bade them good night, went to his own Bed, and <U+017F>lept till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Important affairs did <U+017F>o take up the mind of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and interrupted his <U+017F>leep that he oft left his bed before he had clo<U+017F>ed an eye; and though his age required re<U+017F>t, yet his affection to the <U+017F>ervice of the Nymph, and the publique <U+017F>afety, did make him <U+017F>train his weak and wearied body beyond belief; <U+017F>uch power has de<U+017F>ire of doing well upon a generous per<U+017F>on. The greater he <U+017F>aw the danger, and the more difficult he found the remedies, the more did he rou<U+017F>e up his generous <U+017F>pirit and judgement to oppo<U+017F>e the de<U+017F>ignes of <hi>Polemas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, the difficulties he <U+017F>aw were not a few, nor <U+017F>mall; for he <U+017F>aw the Nymph de<U+017F>titute of men and money, and to have no place of <U+017F>ecurity but <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle,</hi> where he made no que<U+017F>tion but her enemies had many friends, and good intelligence: That <U+017F>he was to defend her <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t a great Souldier, who had all the men, the Forts, the Intelligence, and all the money of her Dominions in his power: His greate<U+017F>t difficulty was, to make his preparations to oppo<U+017F>e this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, that the enemy <U+017F>hould not perceive it; a thing <U+017F>o difficult, that it <U+017F>eemed impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible: For <hi>Polemas</hi> had <U+017F>o corrupted all tho<U+017F>e which he had drawn to his faction, as <hi>Adamas</hi> hardly knew whom to tru<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the unexpected coming of Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> in a time <U+017F>o oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and of all tho<U+017F>e Cavaliers who were with him, as al<U+017F>o of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> did much encourage him; thinking it a mo<U+017F>t infallible <U+017F>igne, that the Gods intended to pre<U+017F>erve the Nymph again<U+017F>t the tyranny of this wicked man. When he was deep in the<U+017F>e thoughts, tho<U+017F>e of the Guard <U+017F>ent to let him know, that there was a good Troop of <U+017F>trangers who de<U+017F>ired entrance, who not being willing to tell their names, <U+017F>tayed there; yet their de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>eemed not to be bad, <U+017F>ince there was many Ladies in Coaches. This intelligence was no <U+017F>ooner given unto the Druide, but two Cavaliers were conducted unto him, to let him under<U+017F>tand what men they were.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e two Cavaliers were well in years, and <U+017F>eemed to be per<U+017F>ons of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect, which cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Adamas</hi> to do them much honour. And becau<U+017F>e they de<U+017F>ired to talk in private with him, he carried them into his Clo<U+017F>et, where the elder of them began thus.</p>
               <p>Prudent and <U+017F>age Sir, <hi>Argira,</hi> Queen of the Picts, hath <U+017F>ent us unto the great Nymph, to let her know, that <U+017F>he is entred into her Dominions, before <U+017F>he gave her any notice of it, becau<U+017F>e, not de<U+017F>iring to be known, for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons which <U+017F>he will <U+017F>hew her, <U+017F>he thought it would not be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is con<U+017F>trained to obey an Oracle, <U+017F>he has <U+017F>ent us, to be<U+017F>eech you from her, you would be plea<U+017F>ed to permit her entrance, and to let her pa<U+017F>s unknown, a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her <U+017F>elf, that when the Nymph does know the rea<U+017F>on of her de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>he will think it mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t.

And being an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he was; Oh God (<U+017F>aid he) how <U+017F>orry will the Nymph be, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not know it, and will be extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed that <U+017F>o great a Prince<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould be no better received in her Dominions! He would have gone on in his excu<U+017F>e, if the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers had not interrupted him. Sir (<U+017F>aid they) the Queen de<U+017F>ires not to be known upon any terms, and be<U+017F>eecheth the Nymph to conceal her: We are not <U+017F>hye in acquainting you with it, becau<U+017F>e we hear great reports of your wi<U+017F>dom; but we be<U+017F>eech you, from the Queen our Mi<U+017F>tris, to take no notice of it, and to let her <U+017F>ee the Nymph, as a <U+017F>tranger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, that <U+017F>he may communicate the cau<U+017F>e of her Voyage unto her. I know Sirs (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto them) that the Nymph would not upon any terms in the world di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e the Queen, but will be extreamly joyed to <U+017F>ee her within her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire to have it <U+017F>o, we will go all together unto the Nymph,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53528:52"/>
and acquaint her who<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure I know is, that the Queen may command any thing here as freely as among<U+017F>t the Picts.</p>
               <p>Upo this, they went all three together, and <hi>Adamas</hi> acquainted her with the news, which being <U+017F>o unexpected, did not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h her; and cau<U+017F>ing the two Cavaliers to enter, <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood from them what <hi>Adamas</hi> had briefly hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto her, and more, that the principal cau<U+017F>e which moved <hi>Argira</hi> to come thus unknown, was that misfortune of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> whom <U+017F>he brought with her, and who<U+017F>e mind was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tracted, as moved much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion from all tho<U+017F>e that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly knew him.</p>
               <p>For his rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired that he might be lodged by him<U+017F>elf, where none might <U+017F>ee him but his dome<U+017F>ticks. The Nymph would have gone her <U+017F>elf to meet her, but the Cavaliers fell down upon their knees and be<U+017F>ought her not to do <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e the Queen would be extremely offended at it; for <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> would <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commit <U+017F>uch gro<U+017F>s follies when he was in any company, that <hi>Argira</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to come almo<U+017F>t alone, having brought with her but the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Poliander</hi> King of the Boyers and Ambaries, and a <U+017F>mall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Cavaliers to guard them.</p>
               <p>Since (<U+017F>aid the Nymph unto them) the Queen is not pleas'd to let me pay that honour which I ow unto her, my daughter <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>hall go in my room to wait upon her unto her lodging in the Ca<U+017F>tle, where <U+017F>he may be <U+017F>een by none but whom <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e: No, <U+017F>aid the Cavaliers, <U+017F>he will not be plea<U+017F>ed with that, <U+017F>he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the lodging which you are plea<U+017F>ed to offer, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would be near you; but we mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you not to let the Nymph, your daughter, meet her. Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto her) <U+017F>ince it is her plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>o to have it, be plea<U+017F>ed to content her in it, and tell her that all your Dominions is in her power, and that you will obey her in all things: If you plea<U+017F>e to command me I will wait upon her to her lodging, and <U+017F>eem as if I went only to command the gates to be opened for her entrance.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Argira</hi> brought to the Ca<U+017F>tle, and all tho<U+017F>e that came with her, which were about a hundred Cavaliers, were lodged in the Town with all fitting acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. <hi>Adamas</hi> did mo<U+017F>t heartily rejoyce at the arival of the Prince<U+017F>s, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a great advantage to the Nymphs affairs: for he could not imagine <U+017F>he came to <U+017F>tay only a few dayes; and that if <hi>Polemas</hi> did attempt any thing, <U+017F>he would be engaged in the Town with them, which would invite the Picts to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her: Be<U+017F>ides, having heard of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilions</hi> great exploits in arms, and of the amity betwixt him and <hi>Policander</hi> the King of the Boyers and Amburies, and moreover, knowing that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> his daughter was with the Queen of the Picts, it was not likely that <U+017F>uch great Kings her neighbours, would <U+017F>uffer her to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieged in a place without <U+017F>ending relief. And having thus communicated the<U+017F>e things unto the Nymph and Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> they were both of opinion, that it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to oblige this Queen, by all manner of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es, to intere<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf in their affairs.</p>
               <p>And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> had already obtained of the Queen, that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> might come and <U+017F>ee her, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had a little refre<U+017F>hed her <U+017F>elf, the Nymph went unto her, carrying with her only <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Adamas.</hi> And that none might take any notice of it, <U+017F>he went through a gallery which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between both their lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argira,</hi> hearing of her coming, went into the gallery to meet her, having none with her, but three aged Ladies and old Cavalier. The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>alutations being done, <hi>Argira</hi> taking the Nymph by the hand, and <U+017F>itting down, <hi>Galathea</hi> de<U+017F>ired leave to go and ki<U+017F>s the hands of the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> which the Queen mo<U+017F>t willingly con<U+017F>ented unto: when <U+017F>he was gone with one of tho<U+017F>e old Ladies, and the doors being <U+017F>hut, the Queen commands the old Cavalier to relate, as briefly as he could, the cau<U+017F>e of her voyage, and not to conceal or di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e from the Nymph, or any thing which concerned that bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>o the Cavalier, in obedience to her commands, began thus.</p>

               <p>PAtience and impetuo<U+017F>ity are two means by which men may bring great things to pa<U+017F>s; for the one works by force and violence, throwing down every thing that oppo<U+017F>es his de<U+017F>ign: and the other by temporiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <U+017F>moothing the enemy, does get the victory, <U+017F>o as it <U+017F>eems one may arive at one and the <U+017F>ame end, by two contrary wayes. He that is ma<U+017F>ter of both the<U+017F>e qualities together, may be thought more then man; but becau<U+017F>e hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity is very rarely capeable of both, I think, that all things rightly ballanced, Patience and Moderation is mo<U+017F>t comendable and profitable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mo<U+017F>t grounded upon rea<U+017F>on, And that he, who takes violent impetuo<U+017F>ity for his guide, is <U+017F>ooner brought to ruine, and inevitable precipices.</p>
               <p>Wi<U+017F>e and great Nymph, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I am to make unto you, will te<U+017F>tifie, that if the Queen had alwayes <U+017F>et this maxime before her eyes, <U+017F>he would not have fallen into <U+017F>o many inconveniency and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures as <U+017F>he hath; but when one goes into pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for advice, it is not to be wondred if the advice be often again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on, and draw after it a long train of misfortunes and di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>ters; of which I will make you as brief a Relation as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I can.</p>
               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know Madam, that <hi>Policander</hi> King of the Boyers and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries, being a Prince very young, and <U+017F>eeing that his Provinces, under the <U+017F>age go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King his father, did enjoy a <U+017F>ecure peace, he was de<U+017F>irous to travel, and by his courage to get glory and renown, <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>tole away <U+017F>ecretly, and with one <U+017F>ervant only, went into the next warre he heard of. This young Prince pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed under the notion and title of the errant Cavalier, not only through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Gaul, but al<U+017F>o among<U+017F>t the Grudiens, Menapiens, Battaves, Ubiens, Lato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briges, Henides, Tullingeans, Marcomanes; and briefly through all high and low Germany: and afterward pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into great Brittain, he <U+017F>tayed long in the Court of that great King, where, and every where el<U+017F>e, under the name of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Cavalier, he got <U+017F>o much glory, as hardly any in all Europe was better known then he that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for unknown.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, de<U+017F>iring to return into his own Kingdome, he imbarqued loadned with abundance of glory, and being upon the Armorick coa<U+017F>t, his de<U+017F>tiny carried him into the Court of the King of Picts, who hearing the fame of his valour, did receive him with <U+017F>o much curte<U+017F>ie as invited him to <U+017F>tay longer there, then he de<U+017F>igned.</p>
               <p>During the time of his <U+017F>ojourn there, he <U+017F>aw the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Argira</hi>; and as all things that are written down in the book of Fate are inevitable, <U+017F>o as he loved her, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but entertain his affection. This la<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igne made him forget his fir<U+017F>t, of returning into his own kingdome, but <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>ome moneths in this Court where he changed the name of Cavalier errant unto that of Lover. The truth is, great Nymph, his valour, and the glory of <U+017F>o many combats, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved with <U+017F>o much courage and happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, the di<U+017F>cretion honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect wherewith he courted this young Prince<U+017F>s did oblige her to entertain that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, but yet <U+017F>he would not let her good will unto him appear, until <U+017F>he knew that he was Prince of the Boyers and Ambaries; but he having <U+017F>ecretly made it known unto her, and <U+017F>he not being <U+017F>o young but <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ee that her father could not make choi<U+017F>e of a husband for her more great, nor more worthy to command over the Picts, upon his promi<U+017F>e never to marry any other but her, <U+017F>he took him for her husband, and <U+017F>uffered him to come unto her <U+017F>ecretly. I <U+017F>ee, great Nymph, that the Queen does blu<U+017F>h to hear me relate the<U+017F>e things: but the belief which <U+017F>he might ju<U+017F>tly have, that a Prince <U+017F>o great and <U+017F>o full of honour and affection, would not betray tho<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>urances which he had given unto her, does <U+017F>ufficiently ju<U+017F>tifie her action and render her blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s.</p>

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:53528:53"/>They continued thus together <U+017F>ome moneths, unperceiued by any, unle<U+017F>s her Nur<U+017F>e, whom <U+017F>he acquainted with it, as her, that was to facilitate their meetings, and her <U+017F>on who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Verances,</hi> whom <hi>Policander</hi> tru<U+017F>ted, and mo<U+017F>t em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: At la<U+017F>t, Fortune would not let them any longer live in re<U+017F>t together, but gave <hi>Policander</hi> a cau<U+017F>e of returning into his own Kingdom, by the death of the King his Father. This <U+017F>eparation was extreamly <U+017F>ad unto them both, e<U+017F>pecially unto the Prince<U+017F>s, who did not only re<U+017F>ent his ab<U+017F>ence, but did almo<U+017F>t fore<U+017F>ee that he would forget her: yet con<U+017F>idering that be<U+017F>ides the lo<U+017F>s of his father, there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of his return, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented unto it, and the more willingly, becau<U+017F>e he promi<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>end his Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adours immediately, to demand her of the King, and <U+017F>o their de<U+017F>ired contentment would this way be compleated. Thus he left her, after a thou<U+017F>and promi<U+017F>es and oaths, which no <U+017F>ooner out of <U+017F>ight, but were all forgot; for never <U+017F>ince did <U+017F>he hear any thing of him more then what common reports did bring unto her. By this common Fame <U+017F>he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood, that all his Kingdoms were in a flame, and divided into two factions, the one of the Queen his mother, who was all for him; and the other of a pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Prince, in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort his Co<U+017F>en, called <hi>Bourbon Archimbout,</hi> who relying upon his friends and confederates, pretended unto the Soveraigne Authority, and to re<U+017F>tore it unto his Family, which he <U+017F>aid the great Grandfather of <hi>Policander</hi> had taken from <hi>Bourbon</hi> his Ance<U+017F>tor, He made this attempt the more boldly, becau<U+017F>e a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was <U+017F>pread abroad that <hi>Policander</hi> was dead, who was the only Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the two Crowns. The King on the other <U+017F>ide who was old, and who<U+017F>e vigour and <U+017F>trength began to fail, never offered to make any oppo<U+017F>ition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t this de<U+017F>igne, although he <U+017F>aw it; but pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away his life <U+017F>moothly and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he could: <U+017F>o as when he came to die, the faction of the Prince <hi>Archimbaut</hi> was <U+017F>o high, that if <hi>Policander</hi> had not <U+017F>peedily arrived, certainly the Queen, his Mother, would have been forced to yeild unto rebellion: For be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>trength of his Faction, he was al<U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the power of the <hi>Limovices,</hi> the Queen of which people was his <U+017F>ole and only daughter, who had married their King, and was left a Widdow within a year, having only one daughter by him, named <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Argira</hi> came to the knowledge of all the<U+017F>e things, only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf nearly intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired the King, her Father, to <U+017F>end him relief; and the more ea<U+017F>ily to invite him unto it, <U+017F>he did craftily make it known unto him, that the unknown Cavalier who had been <U+017F>o long in his Court, was the King <hi>Policander</hi>; but for all that, rea<U+017F>on of State moved him to take the other <U+017F>ide: For the partakers of <hi>Archimbaut</hi> made him believe, that <hi>Policander</hi> was already ruined, that all his hopes were gone, and that it was no prudence to make him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o potent an enemy, as him, who had already the Kingdom of the Lemovices in right of his daughter, and who ere long would be King of tho<U+017F>e two Kingdoms: Briefly, the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations were <U+017F>o cunningly in<U+017F>inuated into the Kings Belief, as they had <U+017F>uch an influence upon him, that in lieu of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting <hi>Policander,</hi> as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, and as indeed he ought to have done (for all Kings ought to be enemies unto Rebels) he <U+017F>ent forces unto <hi>Archim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi> and <U+017F>uch, as <hi>Policander</hi> was coun<U+017F>elled not to put things to the hazard of Arms, but rather to <U+017F>top all factions by a more <U+017F>afe, and a more ea<U+017F>ie way, which was, by a marriage betwixt him and the only daughter of Prince <hi>Archimbaut,</hi> who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Clori<U+017F>ena,</hi> who though a widdow of the King of Lemovices, yet was very fair and young. <hi>Policander</hi> did the more willingly hearken to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becau<U+017F>e he was extreamly incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t the King of the Picts, for <U+017F>ending aid unto his enemy; and <hi>Archimbaut</hi> was the more willing to embrace it, becau<U+017F>e having but one daughter, and out of hopes to have any more children, he could de<U+017F>ire no more then to <U+017F>ee his daughter Queen of the Boyens and Ambaries, and his grand-children King of tho<U+017F>e two Kingdoms. But that which mo<U+017F>t of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Policander</hi> unto it was, a <U+017F>trong report that the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Argira</hi> was dead; and though the news was fal<U+017F>e, yet was it not without <U+017F>ome colour of truth; for <U+017F>ome moneths after <hi>Policander</hi> was gone, <U+017F>he perceived her <U+017F>elf to be with childe, and being de<U+017F>irous to hide it from the King her father, whom <U+017F>he feared, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he feigned her <U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>ick, which <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily do, by rea<U+017F>on of her extream di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf ca<U+017F>t off by him in whom <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o per<U+017F>waded the King unto a belief of it, that he thought it good for her to leave the Court for change of ayr; and having made choi<U+017F>e of a very retired place, which by the opinion of Phy<U+017F>icians was of a very whol<U+017F>ome ayr, <U+017F>he was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither with what company <U+017F>he be<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ed; and taking very few with her but her Nur<U+017F>e and her <U+017F>on, they only knew of her being brought to bed. Now as news is like unto a ball of <U+017F>now, which being tumbled from the top of a hill, does grow as big as another hill before it come to re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o the reports of her <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s was made to be death unto <hi>Policander,</hi> without which he could not con<U+017F>ent unto this marriage, at lea<U+017F>t not without perjury.</p>
               <p>This marriage was the fir<U+017F>t news which <U+017F>he, to her great grief, heard of, when <U+017F>he returned again to the King her father: and doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had more deeply re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if <U+017F>he had not al<U+017F>o heard, that <hi>Policander</hi> was forced unto this marriage, and that if he had not done <U+017F>o, certainly he had lo<U+017F>t his Kingdoms: This gave <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction to her <U+017F>ad <U+017F>oul, when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered, that he committed this fault by con<U+017F>traint, and not by con<U+017F>ent of will: and as if he had known what reports were among<U+017F>t us, he u<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ame to clear him<U+017F>elf; and <U+017F>ince there was no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <U+017F>he believed them. But her greate<U+017F>t grief was, to hear that the King of the Santons had <U+017F>ent to treat upon a marriage with her, and that it was already re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon. This news was mo<U+017F>t abominable unto her, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olved again<U+017F>t all bands of matrimony, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o unworthily deluded by the fir<U+017F>t: But now <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>elf con<U+017F>trained to change her re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could not contrary it, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make known what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o carefully concealed; which being once known, would extreamly vex the <U+017F>oul of her aged Father, and become a <U+017F>tain both unto his reputation and her own: Upon this prudent con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, <U+017F>he married the King of the Santons, by whom within a year <U+017F>he had a <U+017F>on who was named <hi>Celiodantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented unto this marriage only upon rea<U+017F>on of State, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till retained her fir<U+017F>t affection unto the Prince <hi>Policander</hi>; and it vexed her very <U+017F>oul to think the King of the Santons <U+017F>on <U+017F>hould inherit two great Kingdoms: whil<U+017F>t he, whom <U+017F>he had by <hi>Policander,</hi> <U+017F>hould live unknown, and without any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Then again, to have the Son of him whom <U+017F>he loved not, always under her eye, and to be always deprived of his whom <U+017F>he did love, <U+017F>eemed intolerable unto her. See Madam what affection will make her do, and into what extream it will drive one. A little while after <U+017F>he was well recovered from her lying in, <U+017F>he feigned to be very de<U+017F>irous (as it is the common curio<U+017F>ity of mothers) to know what would be the fortune of her new born <U+017F>on: The King indeed did all he could to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade her from it, as thinking it be<U+017F>t to be ignorant of things inevitable; but <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o extreamly de<U+017F>irous of it, he permitted her. There was then in tho<U+017F>e quarters a famous Sybil, who, if they may be <U+017F>o termed, rendred Oracles; and <U+017F>urely <U+017F>ome God did <U+017F>peak by her mouth, for otherwi<U+017F>e it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <U+017F>hould foretel things <U+017F>o certainly as <U+017F>he did: She was an old woman of great <U+017F>anctity and <U+017F>olitude of life, her hair, which <U+017F>he wore loo<U+017F>e about her <U+017F>houlders, was of the <U+017F>ame colour with her garment, both white as <U+017F>now, and her feet were always bare. This woman did profe<U+017F>s to be in<U+017F>tructed by tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ucceeded <hi>Vellede</hi> and <hi>Ganna,</hi> two famous Druids who rendred Oracles in Germany, and from who<U+017F>e in<U+017F>titution came the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Sayn,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e called <hi>Sena,</hi> in the Britanique Sea, oppo<U+017F>ite unto tho<U+017F>e Banks which are termed <hi>O<U+017F>i<U+017F>iniens,</hi> a place highly renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Oracles there rendred. The name of this woman was <hi>Melu<U+017F>ine,</hi> and <U+017F>he was one of the nine which inhabited in the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Sayne</hi>: But in as much as they divided them<U+017F>elves into nine Regions, and this Sybils lot was the Picts, the Santons, and mo<U+017F>t of the Armorique Cities, <U+017F>he came to inhabite upon the top of a Rock, where <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed a Tower to be built, which <U+017F>he named <hi>Lux ignis,</hi> from that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fire which <U+017F>hined in all her an<U+017F>wers, and which <U+017F>ince was called by the people <hi>Lu<U+017F>ignan</hi>; thither came all the country about to con<U+017F>ult with her: At the fir<U+017F>t it was a hard matter to <U+017F>peak with her, for <U+017F>he would never <U+017F>hew her face, to the end, as I believe, that more reverence might be had of her; and when any de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53528:54"/>
to know any thing of her, the be<U+017F>t of the company mu<U+017F>t always come and bring the demands, and carry back the an<U+017F>wers, and not daring to pre<U+017F>ume <U+017F>o high as to look her in the face; which to prevent, <U+017F>he wore a veil, that if any were <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>h as to look up, he might not <U+017F>ee her. Now this Sybil was then at the Rock of <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Oracle, not then under<U+017F>tood, did put her into a cruel perplexity, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw now that the King, her father, had good rea<U+017F>on to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade her from that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<U+017F>ity; yet <U+017F>ilently keeping the an<U+017F>wer to her <U+017F>elf, at her return <U+017F>he fancied a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent con<U+017F>truction, which was, that if the young <hi>Celiodantes</hi> were <U+017F>een, either by his father, or mother, or any el<U+017F>e, except his Nur<U+017F>e, and tho<U+017F>e that were to nouri<U+017F>h and bring him up, for a certain time, he would infallibly die. The Kings were exceedingly loth to be deprived of the <U+017F>ight of the little <hi>Cleodantes,</hi> yet fearing <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch malignant influence, they con<U+017F>ented to humour the Queen in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires. Now the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired this, was only to put the <U+017F>on of King <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licander</hi> into the place of the King of the Santons, as well to enjoy the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <U+017F>eeing him brought up with her, as to <U+017F>ee him hereafter King of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and the Picts: And her de<U+017F>ign was <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly carried, that at the return of the wrong <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> none had any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of him, though he was a little too big for his age: For the King of the Santons being of a big tall <U+017F>tature, did help to make every one believe that he would be like his father. Thus Madam, this Prince<U+017F>s was both a bad and a good mother. In the mean time, <U+017F>he fearing le<U+017F>t if the right <hi>Celiodantes</hi> <U+017F>hould remain in a place where he might be <U+017F>een by any of the Court, he might come to be known, either by his re<U+017F>emblance of his father, or by the indi<U+017F>cretion of tho<U+017F>e who had the keeping of him, <U+017F>he pack'd him away, as far off as <U+017F>he could, and <U+017F>ent him to a Port of the Santons, to be brought up as the childe of <hi>Verances,</hi> unto whom <U+017F>he committed the care of him, with a good <U+017F>um of money for his education, and to in<U+017F>truct him in all <U+017F>uch exerci<U+017F>es and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which a Cavalier ought to be: and le<U+017F>t by any fortune he <U+017F>hould chance to be lo<U+017F>t, either by the death of <hi>Verances,</hi> or any other accident, <U+017F>he thought it good to give him <U+017F>ome mark whereby he might be known: In order to this, <U+017F>he took a hot iron, with intention to burn him upon the left hand; but as <U+017F>he was looking about where it <U+017F>hould be done to do him the lea<U+017F>t harm, &amp; be lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>een, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that Nature had <U+017F>aved her that labour, and had placed upon the <U+017F>ame hand a mo<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ro<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o exactly, that no art could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly do the like: She contented her <U+017F>elf with this mark, and commanded <hi>Verances,</hi> that at the fir<U+017F>t Town he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he <U+017F>hould take the picture of that little hand, and <U+017F>end it unto her, which <U+017F>he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53528:54"/>
intended to keep as a memorandum; and when <U+017F>he was ready to part, <U+017F>he took a Turki<U+017F>h <U+017F>tone from about her neck, which <hi>Policander</hi> gave her, and which <U+017F>he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teemed at a very dear rate, not for the value of it, for it was of no great price, but becau<U+017F>e he gave it unto her when he told her that he was King of the Boyers, which he was wont to wear in all his Travels: This <U+017F>tone had engraven upon it, a Lion, with certain German letters, which in that language <U+017F>ignified a King, the <U+017F>on of a King: <hi>Policander</hi> wore it for his motto; intimating, as the Lion is the King of all other animals, and was begotten by another Lion: <U+017F>o he, though he <U+017F>eemed to be only a Cavalier errant, yet was he a King, and the <U+017F>on of a King. The Queen <hi>Argira</hi> <U+017F>eeing what fortune this little <hi>Celiodantes</hi> was to run, <U+017F>he thought this motto <U+017F>uited with him very well: be<U+017F>ides, a Turki<U+017F>h <U+017F>tone is very lucky when it is given with a good will; <U+017F>o <U+017F>he hung it about his neck, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, and recomended him to <hi>Verances,</hi> be<U+017F>eeching the gods to be propitious unto him: Natural affection began to work upon the heart of a mother, yet the Tirant love would needs <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf the <U+017F>tronger. Perhaps Madam, you may think it <U+017F>trange, that in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of this importance, the Queen <U+017F>hould imploy <hi>Verances,</hi> a young man, and one who<U+017F>e under<U+017F>tanding perhaps was not <U+017F>o great as <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. But be plea<U+017F>ed to know that <hi>Verances</hi> was <U+017F>on unto her nur<U+017F>e, and they two only did know of <hi>Policanders</hi> love, and the birth of that child which was in the room of <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he thought it not convenient to tru<U+017F>t any more with tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, but better to imploy the<U+017F>e then any other: be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he was de<U+017F>irous, that if it were her fortune to die, the King <hi>Policander</hi> might be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <U+017F>ome, what love had made her do for his <U+017F>on, and <U+017F>he knew that he would give credit unto what<U+017F>oever this man did <U+017F>ay.</p>
               <p>In the mean time King <hi>Policander</hi> had by the Queen his wife a <U+017F>on and a daughter: The <U+017F>on was called <hi>Ariontes,</hi> and the daughter <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Clori<U+017F>one</hi> died, and left many that <U+017F>adly lamented her lo<U+017F>s. <hi>Policander</hi> mourned beyond the imaginations of every one, for it was thought that he loved her only as the mother of his children; yet mo<U+017F>t certain it was that he did love her, and as certain that <hi>Argira</hi> was quite out of his memory: O the odd hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of <U+017F>ome men, who can forget tho<U+017F>e they once loved as <U+017F>oon as ever they are out of <U+017F>ight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policander</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf a father of <U+017F>o fine an off-<U+017F>pring and a widdower, he bent all his <U+017F>tudies to rule his dominions well, and to <U+017F>ee his children educated in all noble and Princely exerci<U+017F>es and qualities <U+017F>utable to their <U+017F>exes and degrees. And becau<U+017F>e the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e,</hi> his wifes daughter, whom <U+017F>he had by the King of the <hi>Lemovices,</hi> and <U+017F>omthing elder then <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> was in his hands, after the death of her mother, he brought her up with his own children, making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between her and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> who having attained to the age of <U+017F>even or eight years began to appear <U+017F>o fair that <U+017F>he carried away the glory from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t beauties in all Gaul, although <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> in the eyes of many did not yield unto her. The young Prince <hi>Ariontes</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, was <U+017F>o apprehen<U+017F>ive and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of every excellency (that he applied him<U+017F>elf unto) that no Prince of his age did equal him either in exerci<U+017F>es of warre or peace, which joyed the heart of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licander</hi> beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>At that time there was <U+017F>ome certain Merchants which u<U+017F>ed to traffick upon the Armorick <U+017F>eas, and by rea<U+017F>on of the conveniency of the river Loire, did bring their wares into the Provinces of Gaul, among<U+017F>t the Heduois, Burgundians, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobroges, Galloligures, and others: The<U+017F>e being con<U+017F>trained to pa<U+017F>s through the Territories of the Boyers and Ambaries, in hopes of a free and <U+017F>afe conduct did pre<U+017F>ent unto the King <hi>Policander</hi> many rare and precious things, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, a young <U+017F>lave, <U+017F>o farre and <U+017F>o exceedingly hand<U+017F>ome, that as <U+017F>oon as the King <U+017F>aw him, he did dedicate him unto the <U+017F>ervice of the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>eemed to be no elder then the younge<U+017F>t of them. The<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es lov'd him exceedingly well, being of a very pliant and <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <U+017F>trove who <U+017F>hould mo<U+017F>t oblige him by care<U+017F><U+017F>es: and becau<U+017F>e his name was Kynic<U+017F>on and that word hard to pronounce, they called him mo<U+017F>t commonly by rea<U+017F>on of his beauty, the fair <U+017F>lave. But O the fate of inclination? Although
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53528:55"/>
he was given at the fir<U+017F>t unto both tho<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, yet he devoted him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>olely unto the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>; not but that he obeyed <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> in all her commands, becau<U+017F>e he knew it was her de<U+017F>ire and his duty <U+017F>o to do; but yet that <U+017F>ervice which proceeds from affection was wholly unto the other, at which <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> would doubtle<U+017F>s have been very angry, if <U+017F>he had been compo<U+017F>ed of any Gaul, but <U+017F>he was of <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e and <U+017F>weet a temper, that though <U+017F>he had a mind to be ill plea<U+017F>ed with him, yet <U+017F>he could not be angry: <U+017F>o as all her anger did turn it <U+017F>elf into jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie of her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, and <U+017F>ometimes to twit him, who as young as he was, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of that Prince<U+017F>s might do him as much harm, did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to plea<U+017F>e her, but it was <U+017F>o hard to hide his affection unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> that <U+017F>he was alwayes harping upon that <U+017F>tring.</p>
               <p>One day, <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> chid him for that he minded no <U+017F>ervice but her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, and <U+017F>corned all others: <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> by fortune heard him an<U+017F>wer thus: Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I think it a mo<U+017F>t high honour to do you <U+017F>ervice, and if I fail, you will oblige me, if you puni<U+017F>h me; but the very truth is, that though you <U+017F>hould not be willing I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve your <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, yet you mu<U+017F>t take away my life if I do not; for if I live I cannot chu<U+017F>e. But why (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> very angrily) and did not <U+017F>ee <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>) have you a more ready will to <U+017F>erve my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, then me? are not you mine as well as hers? I did not <U+017F>ay (replied he very mode<U+017F>tly) but that I am as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <U+017F>erve you as I ought to do: but, but me no buts, replied <U+017F>he, and looked red with anger, and going nearer him: but Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, then <U+017F>pying <hi>Ro<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> and changing his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon a <U+017F>udden: but Madam, here is the Prince<U+017F>s your <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter: upon this word, going back a pace or two, he <U+017F>lipt out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door.</p>
               <p>This Mode<U+017F>ty did extreamly plea<U+017F>e both the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es; <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would not acquaint <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> with any pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt them; and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> at his di<U+017F>cretion, in hiding the anger of her Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi>; <U+017F>o as that pa<U+017F><U+017F>age cau<U+017F>ed both of them to love him better then before. And a few days after, <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> having an opportunity of talk with him, Prithee, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, tell me one thing truly; Have you not much ado to content my Si<U+017F>ter? Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) I <U+017F>hall be very glad to be told of my faults, if I neglect any thing in her <U+017F>ervice. I can tell you one (replyed <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled) and advi<U+017F>e with your <U+017F>elf whether you will relap<U+017F>e into it, or no. Surely Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, I <U+017F>hall not; at lea<U+017F>t I will endeavour all I can.

Yes mine, replyed <U+017F>he, and con<U+017F>ider with your <U+017F>elf whether or no you will continue it any longer, for this is it which does <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her. Oh Madam, cryed he, if her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure proceed from thence, I <U+017F>hall continue it as long as I live. Why, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, had you rather di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, then leave my <U+017F>ervice? Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, will you plea<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould tell you the truth?

But (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>) were you not at the <U+017F>ame time given unto my Si<U+017F>ter as well as me? No Madam (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered he) for the King only gave me unto her, but both the King and my own con<U+017F>ent did give me unto you. But yet (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) <U+017F>he pretends to have as much right unto you as I; yet <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee your inclination, I will be<U+017F>eech the King to be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>ome other upon my Si<U+017F>ter, and let you be wholly mine. To make me become wholly yours Madam (replyed he) re<U+017F>ts wholly in your own will, and though the favour you would do me in asking me of the King, be one of the greate<U+017F>t you can do me, yet I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you not to <U+017F>peak unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, for it may procure me <U+017F>o much ill will from my Lady, your Si<U+017F>ter, as I am afraid the King <U+017F>hould remove me from her <U+017F>ervice, and yours al<U+017F>o.

Upon this, fearing le<U+017F>t her Si<U+017F>ter, or <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>hould come in upon them <U+017F>he retired, giving him a gentle blow with her hand upon his cheek, as a gage of that promi<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he had made unto him; with which he was <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfied, that he was highly contented with his fortune: And as he increa<U+017F>ed in age, he encrea<U+017F>ed al<U+017F>o in affection; of which, the vertues of the Prince<U+017F>s: and continual conver<U+017F>ation with her, was both Mother and Nur<U+017F>e; Yet knowing him<U+017F>elf to be a <U+017F>lave, he dur<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ume <U+017F>o high, as to di<U+017F>cover any <U+017F>uch thing.

               <p>A little while after, the King <U+017F>eeing him to be every way very hand<U+017F>ome, had a de<U+017F>ire to have him wait upon the young <hi>Ariontes,</hi> and <U+017F>o have him more in his eye: but fate which had de<U+017F>igned him for other imployments, did afford him <U+017F>uch a glorious occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf, as the like is not upon the Theater of the whole univer<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>Policander</hi> being one that did abominate all ea<U+017F>e and idlene<U+017F>s, did much delight in hunting: one day as he was cha<U+017F>ing a Hart through a thick wood, a lion ru<U+017F>hed out <U+017F>o near the King, that his hor<U+017F>e extremely affrighted began to turn about, and <U+017F>o unhappily, that he fell backward with the pomel of the <U+017F>addle again<U+017F>t the Kings bre<U+017F>t: <U+017F>o as the King being under his hor<U+017F>e, he was not able to di<U+017F>engage him<U+017F>elf: The hor<U+017F>e was run through the body by the Kings <U+017F>word; <U+017F>o as he died pre<U+017F>ently: the King al<U+017F>o received a little wound in his thigh; all tho<U+017F>e that followed the King, were <U+017F>o affrighted by this fierce bea<U+017F>t, which they knew very well (being the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t furious of all tho<U+017F>e the King kept in iron cages, and was e<U+017F>caped out) that they were all glad that their hor<U+017F>es were affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in lieu of holding them in, they <U+017F>purred them away as fa<U+017F>t as they could: The fair <U+017F>lave only, lighting from his hor<U+017F>e, he ran towards the King, and in <U+017F>uch a happy nick of time, that he got between the Lion and him, when this fiery ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal was with open mouth ready to devour him: but the courageous boy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado, drew his <U+017F>word, and wielded it <U+017F>o happily, that he ran the Lion to the heart; but for all that, though the <U+017F>word was in the mid<U+017F>t of his heart; yet this furious animal in dying, did give his valiant enemy <U+017F>uch a wound upon his <U+017F>houlder with one of his claws, as might very well have di<U+017F>patched him. At the fir<U+017F>t, the fair <U+017F>lave <U+017F>taggered, and afterwards fell, <U+017F>ome five or <U+017F>ix paces di<U+017F>tant from his dead enemy: but though his wound was great, and his fall violent; yet, half a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, he pre<U+017F>ently got up again and ran betwixt the King and the Lion, apprehending him <U+017F>till alive: He <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>o a while, and <U+017F>eeing the furious animal now tame enough, he run to help the King, who was <U+017F>triving to get him<U+017F>elf from under his hor<U+017F>e, and with much ado, he helped him up; but when he <U+017F>pied the bloud to run from the Kings thigh: O Sir, <U+017F>aid he, you are wounded and with tears in his eyes would have held him up. <hi>Policander,</hi> who had more courage then to be daunted at any dangers, did admire the valour and affection of this young boy: fair <U+017F>lave (<U+017F>aid he, and embraced him) thou ha<U+017F>t not this day imployed thy courage for an ungrateful ma<U+017F>ter: and till a better occa<U+017F>ion offer it <U+017F>elf, ask what thou wilt, and I <U+017F>wear by my fathers <U+017F>oul it <U+017F>hall not be denied. The <U+017F>lave kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, it is your own goodne<U+017F>s to acccept of this <U+017F>ervice which I have done you: but alas Sir, both this, and all that I am able to do, are but tributes of that <U+017F>eruice which I ow, and I dare not pretend unto any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: An act <U+017F>o generous as this, replied the King, argues the height of merit, and cannot be equall'd by any recompence, and therefore I command thee to a<U+017F>k <U+017F>omething that may argue me not ungrateful. Sir, replied he, the gods do not mea<U+017F>ure they benefits the be<U+017F>tow upon us, according to our merits, but their own

The King, who thought he would have asked <U+017F>ome great <U+017F>umm of money, or other matter of profit, did <U+017F>till more and more admire the Genero<U+017F>ity and Magnanimity of his courage, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him again, yes (<U+017F>aid he) your reque<U+017F>t is granted, you are from this hour free, and in te<U+017F>timony of it, you <U+017F>hall receive the honour of knighthood as <U+017F>oon as we are returned unto Avarick: and though in any other, your age would not permit it (for he was then not above eighteen) yet in you, your courage and fortune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e that ran away for fear returned, and finding the Lion dead, they were a<U+017F>hamed that <U+017F>o young a boy <U+017F>hould have more courage and re<U+017F>olution then them<U+017F>elves, and dur<U+017F>t hardly look the King in his face: but when they <U+017F>aw what extraordinary favours the King did unto him, then every one <U+017F>welled with envy; for noble actions does cau<U+017F>e envy in the <U+017F>ouls of ba<U+017F>e people, and emulation in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King, who de<U+017F>ired only to invite others unto well doing, by the example of this valiant youth, as <U+017F>oon as he came into Averick, he made this <U+017F>lave a Knight: and although their wounds would not give them leave to u<U+017F>e much cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: yet would he needs have the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> with all the Ladies, to be pre<U+017F>ent. He him<U+017F>elf put on his <U+017F>purrs, and girt him with a <U+017F>word, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing him, commanded the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> to do the like, which <U+017F>he did with much willingne<U+017F>s and contentment; when all Ceremonies were performed, the King addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto him and <U+017F>aid, Cavalier, I do pronounce you free, and would have all e<U+017F>teem you <U+017F>o: Al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince your merits do claim a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter name then that of <U+017F>lave, I do ordain it <U+017F>hall be changed, and hereafter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve the memory of your brave Act in killing a Lion, be called <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>anirus</hi> Cavalier: This title will oblige both my daughter and me to remember our engagements unto you.</p>
               <p>The joyes and thanks of the new <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> were great, but not greater then tho<U+017F>e of the Prince<U+017F>s: after he had humbly ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Kings hands, he did the <U+017F>ame unto that Prince<U+017F>s, with a thou<U+017F>and prote<U+017F>tations of eternal <U+017F>ervice; the expre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of which had not ended <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, if his wounds in his <U+017F>houlder had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained him to bed, and to keep it for <U+017F>ome dayes.

which the Prince<U+017F>s had done him, he had a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee what was in the Taffaty, in a conceit, that the Receipt was writ by the fair hand of his adored <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> which trea<U+017F>ure he <U+017F>hould e<U+017F>teem as dear as his life; he took it then from his neck, and opening it, he found the Letter, which he read; then he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, with <U+017F>uch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of joy and admiration, that his wounds began to bleed a fre<U+017F>h; and had not the man who waited upon him, heard him <U+017F>igh, this accident doubtle<U+017F>s had done him much harm, before any notice could have been taken of it. But the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very careful of his ma<U+017F>ter, ran pre<U+017F>ently to his Bed, and <U+017F>eeing his complexion changed, he asked him how he did? Friend (<U+017F>aid he unto him) help me a little to put this on, which I have in my hand; for it is the Receipt which the Prince<U+017F>s <U+017F>ent me to <U+017F>top blood, and which I would needs <U+017F>ee: but I no <U+017F>ooner took it from about My Neck, then my wound began to bleed: Alas Sir (<U+017F>aid the man) I have oft heard <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>uch things ought not to be <U+017F>een; for if they be, they pre<U+017F>ently lo<U+017F>e their vertue; and if you have read it, expect no good from it. I did read it indeed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>) little thinking that <U+017F>uch a thing could take away its <U+017F>trength: Upon this he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and put it about his neck again; which done, he perceived the blood to run <U+017F>till: Friend (<U+017F>aid he) thou tolde<U+017F>t me right; the Receipt has lo<U+017F>t its vertue: run therefore, and call <U+017F>ome to apply another remedy.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the Phy<U+017F>icians and Chyrurgions were applying <U+017F>ome powder of his hair burned, and <U+017F>ome other re<U+017F>tringent things; <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> who<U+017F>e mind ran more upon the wound of his heart, then that of his <U+017F>houlder, did think this accident to be a very good occa<U+017F>ion of thanking the Prince<U+017F>s for the extraordinary favour which <U+017F>he had done him, thinking it to be infinitely beyond his merits: and retaining this thought in his memory, till every one was retired, he called for Ink and Paper, and writ what love did dictate unto him: afterwards lapping it up in the <U+017F>ame form that <hi>Ro<U+017F>aniras</hi> Receipt was, and taking the other out of the Taffaty, he put this in the room of it. After he had lapped it up, he bade <hi>Meri<U+017F>in</hi> (<U+017F>o was the man called that waited upon him) to go unto the Prince<U+017F>s, and thank her for the great care <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to have of him in <U+017F>ending that Receipt: but his curio<U+017F>ity was <U+017F>uch, that thinking he had been cured, he read it, and then his wound began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently to bleed again: That he knew no better remedy for his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e then that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech her to <U+017F>end him another, in lieu of that which he returned back: <hi>Meri<U+017F>in</hi> was diligent and faithful in delivery of his me<U+017F><U+017F>age: and though the Prince<U+017F>s did very well under<U+017F>tand the meaning of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> yet the dur<U+017F>t not to take any notice of it: But taking the Taffaty; Friend (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) tell your ma<U+017F>ter he was too inqui<U+017F>itive; he <U+017F>hould have been contented with the good which the Receipt would have done him, without de<U+017F>ires of knowing what it was: tell him I will make him the <U+017F>ame Receipt, but bid him take heed of <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to be <U+017F>een; for if he do, it may much prejudice him.</p>
               <p>Then going into her Clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>hutting the door, <U+017F>he was long in debate with her <U+017F>elf, whether <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould read what <U+017F>he doubted he had written, thinking it <U+017F>omtimes a di<U+017F>honour unto her <U+017F>elf to love: <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> con<U+017F>idering the condition wherein he was when fir<U+017F>t he came into her <U+017F>ervice; but pre<U+017F>ently beginning to flatter her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and who can blame me (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for loving him that <U+017F>aved the life of the King my father?

To be the fir<U+017F>t whom Fortune was plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>pit her venome at? Surely pa<U+017F>t ages can furni<U+017F>h out with examples of the like: and perhaps we may meet with a great abundance of that deplorable number, and never go out of Gaul; but very few, who by their valour, could recover their lo<U+017F>t liberty, as <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> hath done. Then looking upon the Taffaty, but who can tell (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that I do love him, but him<U+017F>elf? If he is of <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e an extract as he is e<U+017F>teemed, he never dare be <U+017F>o bold as to think of any <U+017F>uch affection<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and much le<U+017F>s to publi<U+017F>h it: and if his birth be as high as his actions and courage, who can blame me if I <U+017F>uffer him to love me? But who<U+017F>oever he be, the very truth is, I do love him, and have already hinted as much unto him: Why then <U+017F>hould I not read his an<U+017F>wer? The wor<U+017F>t is, if it do contain more then does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, I will <U+017F>end him a blank paper by way of Reply, in lieu of that which he hath writ unto me.</p>

to the end all the Court might imitate him, he him<U+017F>elf would needs go vi<U+017F>it him, as <U+017F>oon as the wound in his thigh would permit him, and carried with him the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e,</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> telling them, that the great genero<U+017F>ity of that Cavalier, and the good <U+017F>ervice which he had done him, did very well de<U+017F>erve their extraordinary care of him.</p>
               <p>Though this unexpected vi<U+017F>it of the King did <U+017F>urprize him, yet the <U+017F>ight of the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> was the height of contentment unto him; and <U+017F>uch, as not knowing what thanks to return for <U+017F>uch an unaccu<U+017F>tomed favour, he could not find words to expre<U+017F>s his re<U+017F>entments of it. <hi>Policander</hi> came up to him, took his hand, asked him how he did, and whether the Receipt which his daughter had <U+017F>ent him, had done him any good? Very much Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, and <U+017F>o much, that I think I do owe my life unto it. 'Tis very well, an<U+017F>wered the King, for both <U+017F>he and I are obliged to have a care of your recovery. But Daughter (<U+017F>aid he, and turned towards the Prince<U+017F>s) pray tell me who gave you this Receipt? Sir (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>anira,</hi> and was a little <U+017F>urprized) it is <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince I fir<U+017F>t had it, that truly I have forgotten who gave it unto me; but I do very well remember, that who<U+017F>oever it was, he told me that it would not fail: yet having no experience of it, I laid it up, and made no reckoning of it. The King then turning towards <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (<U+017F>aid he) that this which you wear about your neck is the Receipt: It is Sir, (an<U+017F>wered he) and <U+017F>ince I found <U+017F>o much benefit by it, I would not leave it off. <hi>Policander</hi> very de<U+017F>irous to know what it was, did take it from his neck, and would have opened it. But the Prince<U+017F>s who trembled for fear of di<U+017F>covery, did pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay her hand upon it, and would not let him. Sir (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if you do <U+017F>ee what it is, it will be unprofitable to <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion:</hi> And did not you <U+017F>ee it? (an<U+017F>wered he.) I did (replyed <U+017F>he) but it was, becau<U+017F>e otherwi<U+017F>e I could not make it: yet if any other <U+017F>ee it, the vertue of it is lo<U+017F>t. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titions (<U+017F>aid <hi>Policander</hi>) are to be ob<U+017F>erved by little children, and their Nur<U+017F>es: and to tell you truly, I have known <U+017F>o many of the<U+017F>e kind of Receipts, which never wrought any effect, that I will <U+017F>ee what this is: Then calling for a pair of <U+017F>ci<U+017F><U+017F>ars, he opened the Taffaty, and took out the paper. Judge Madam, in what a perplexity <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> was; <U+017F>he was indeed more dead then alive, and could not devi<U+017F>e what excu<U+017F>e <U+017F>he could u<U+017F>e to cover the crime which <U+017F>he had committed; yet when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw it was not the <U+017F>ame paper which <U+017F>he had written, <U+017F>he took a little heart: but <U+017F>he was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a <U+017F>econd fear, not inferiour to the fir<U+017F>t; for <U+017F>he thought it to be <U+017F>ome reply which <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> intended to <U+017F>end: but ca<U+017F>ting her eye upon him, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>mile, which gave her <U+017F>ome courage; and more when <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved that nothing but Cyphers and Figures were in the paper: Oh how glad <U+017F>he was, and how <U+017F>he applauded the prudence of him, whom a little before <U+017F>he condemned, for <U+017F>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily to be <U+017F>een, when it <U+017F>o nearly concerned his life. What Daughter (<U+017F>aid he, and was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, after he had a while con<U+017F>idered it) does your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of nothing but <U+017F>uch odd Characters and <U+017F>criblings as this? You <U+017F>ee Sir (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) all there is. I hope then (<U+017F>aid the King and laughed) that it will cure me, if I be ill: Then lapping up the paper as it was, he put it him<U+017F>elf about <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilions</hi> neck, who ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing his hand, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that he had received <U+017F>o much good from it, that he would keep it mo<U+017F>t carefully as long as he lived. But (<U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F>s) it will not now do you any good, becau<U+017F>e it hath been <U+017F>een: I believe Madam (<U+017F>aid he) that if I do not <U+017F>ee it my <U+017F>elf, it will retain its vigour: for you <U+017F>ee, that though the King have looked upon it, yet I do not bleed again, as I did before. I am glad of it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>) becau<U+017F>e I cannot make it any more; for the condition of the Receipt is <U+017F>uch, that it cannot be made above twice for one per<U+017F>on. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> did very well under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>he meant, that he <U+017F>hould write no more this way: and yet he could not chu<U+017F>e but an<U+017F>wer her; 'tis hard the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which we receive from the Gods, <U+017F>hould be always <U+017F>o conditioned, that we can enjoy them but a while.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> received the Prince with all due re<U+017F>pects; and after he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his hand for <U+017F>o great a favour, Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto him) the honour you are plea<U+017F>ed this day to confer upon me, is <U+017F>o great, as makes me a<U+017F>hamed of my little merit: But <U+017F>ince he is not ungrateful, who though unable to <U+017F>atisfie as he ought, yet <U+017F>trives to do all he can, <U+017F>o I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the Prince <hi>Ariontes,</hi> that for the<U+017F>e extraordinary favours, <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilian</hi> <U+017F>hall never be branded with that odious name, <U+017F>ince I do from this very day dedicate all the days of my life, not to exonerate my <U+017F>elf of this debt, becau<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but in doing you all the <U+017F>ervices that a man can do unto his Ma<U+017F>ter and Lord. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> (an<U+017F>wered the Prince) your blood employed in the pre<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King my father, can never be fully recompenced, as well for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nero<U+017F>ity wherewith you <U+017F>pilt it, as for the great <U+017F>ervice you have done, and the whole State in it; a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that it <U+017F>hall never be forgot.

No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> but on the contrary, I would have you know that if I had not done as I did, I <U+017F>hould have blamed my <U+017F>elf; but I <U+017F>ay, that it was done without any debate with my <U+017F>elf, for I was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, to hear that the King was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <U+017F>o great a danger, and that it was by the valour of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> as without any con<U+017F>ult I <U+017F>uffered my hand to intimate my joyes unto you Then Madam, replied <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> <U+017F>hould tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which you are plea<U+017F>ed infinitly beyond my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make, work in me any of tho<U+017F>e effects you mention, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t unworthy man that ever lived upon the earth: but Madam, I did not draw any <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>equencies or hopes as you are plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay, from them; nay, on the contrary, your favour, <U+017F>o far from my expectation or hopes, was like the <U+017F>plendour of the Sun, which <U+017F>o dazled my eyes and my <U+017F>oul, that I knew not what to think, nor what to hope, nor what to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>o infinitly they were above all my thoughts, my hopes, and my de<U+017F>erts. As for the anger which I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again<U+017F>t you, it was only, becau<U+017F>e being <U+017F>o entirely yours, methought you did me wrong in not commanding me any thing in your <U+017F>ervice. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> replied the Prince<U+017F>s, the value which I find to be in you, and the affection which you <U+017F>eem to have unto me, together with your di<U+017F>creet carriage of it, hath moved me to love you. Your unknown extraction does much trouble me; but I wi<U+017F>h your valour may make you <U+017F>o known unto all, that it may be no reproach unto me when it is known that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> loves you. Draw from hence all the mo<U+017F>t favourable con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences you can to content you, for I will not forbid you one, only remember the victimes which ought to be offered in this <U+017F>acrifice, as formerly I writ unto you.</p>
               <p>Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with joy) if I dur<U+017F>t throw my <U+017F>elf at your feet by way of gratitude, I would, as the mo<U+017F>t obliged man living: but I know <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, before <U+017F>o many witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, would di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you; only I <U+017F>ay, that words being too weak to do it, I <U+017F>hall with extream de<U+017F>ire wait for the honour of your commands, to te<U+017F>tifie my obedience, that as there is none living more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be loved, or rather adored, then the fair <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> nor any heart more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to adore her then <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilions,</hi> <U+017F>o there is nothing <U+017F>o difficult which I would not think ea<U+017F>ie in your <U+017F>ervice. As for the unknown place of my birth which, and with rea<U+017F>on does <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, I be<U+017F>eech you be plea<U+017F>ed, as <U+017F>oon as my wounds are healed, I may as a wandering Cavalier <U+017F>ee out the place, or el<U+017F>e die in the que<U+017F>t; or at lea<U+017F>t, till the unknown place of my birth at my return, be no reproach unto you or him.</p>
               <p>How? replied the Prince<U+017F>s, do you ask if it will plea<U+017F>e me? Be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Ro<U+017F>ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if you do otherwi<U+017F>e, you will extreamly di<U+017F>oblige me.</p>
               <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was a cau<U+017F>e, that as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> was recovered, which was not many dayes, he be<U+017F>eeched the King to give him leave, as a Cavalier errant, to go and <U+017F>eek adventures, according to the cu<U+017F>tome which the famous King <hi>Arthur</hi> e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed in great Brittain, that <U+017F>o he might better inable him<U+017F>elf to do him <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The King, though with much regret, con<U+017F>ented, but upon condition he would return as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. I need not relate the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s and <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> at his departure: for Madam, you may imagine it to be <U+017F>uch, as lovers before a long <U+017F>eparation and an uncertain return would u<U+017F>e. But <hi>Ro<U+017F>inara,</hi> as <U+017F>oon almo<U+017F>t as he was departed, received great con<U+017F>olation by the fame of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble exploits, which he atchieved in all countreys he came into; for his Acts and his Glory, was all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e at all a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies of Ladies and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</p>

but it was opened for the King of the Santons, which indeed were greifs unto the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> but with one con<U+017F>ideration that was no <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>olation unto her, thinking that <U+017F>urely now <hi>Policander</hi> would make good his promi<U+017F>e: for by Fortune, a little before his mother died, <U+017F>o as being now both at liberty, it was likely he would give all <U+017F>atisfaction de<U+017F>ireable. But O, how much mi<U+017F>taken are the hopes of love, e<U+017F>pecially when they are ex<U+017F>pected from <U+017F>uch men who look only after their pre<U+017F>ent intere<U+017F>ts: heretofore, I do believe, that if it had been in the power of <hi>Policander</hi> to have di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of him<U+017F>elf, he would have <U+017F>atisfied his promi<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>ince the welfare of his affairs and dominions had con<U+017F>trained him to marry <hi>Clori<U+017F>ina,</hi> he did <U+017F>o forget all his relations to the kingdome of the Picts, that he did not <U+017F>o much as remember the very name of <hi>Argira.</hi> But now to leave him without excu<U+017F>e, and that there might be no faillure on her <U+017F>ide, though <U+017F>ince the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance <U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t him to the Prince <hi>Archimbant,</hi> there was no good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondency betwixt us, yet when <hi>Clori<U+017F>ina</hi> died, <hi>Argira</hi> <U+017F>ent to condole with him, and to acquaint him with the King of the Santons death, intimating a kind of Summons to <U+017F>atisfie his former promi<U+017F>e: His an<U+017F>wer was indeed full of civility and courte<U+017F>ie, but <U+017F>o empty of all love, as the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of <U+017F>uch a flame did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it,</p>
               <p>The Queen did believe (for <U+017F>he was apt to flatter her <U+017F>elf in it) that perhaps he was unwilling to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf unto her Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent unto him, he being a per<U+017F>on with whom he never had any familiarity; and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he did attribute that unto prudence which indeed was defect and want of affection, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <U+017F>he found when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent this Letter <U+017F>ecretly unto him.</p>

Grief for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>es which <U+017F>he and I have had <U+017F>hould take our thoughts off any <U+017F>uch things: The affection which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53528:59"/>
we do ow unto tho<U+017F>e children which the gods have given us, <U+017F>hould wain our wills: and it were a kind of cruelty to add more brothers unto them, who would <U+017F>hare with them in e<U+017F>tate; be<U+017F>ide, the age which <U+017F>he and I are of, is a <U+017F>ufficient priviledge unto us from any <U+017F>uch treaties: Aged matrimony is out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and fit only for <U+017F>uch as are green. and in the vigour of their age, not gray, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to drag into their graves. This an<U+017F>wer and me<U+017F><U+017F>age, which was no better then a reproach, did make a deep wound in the <U+017F>oul of the Queen, who ever had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a mo<U+017F>t zealous affection unto <hi>Policander</hi>: but this did bla<U+017F>t all her hopes, and made good the old Proverb, that from great love proceeds great hatred. For <U+017F>he conceived <U+017F>o great a hatred of him, that <U+017F>he did abhorre the very name of <hi>Policander</hi> and all his: and as <U+017F>he did for his <U+017F>ake love the <U+017F>on which <U+017F>he had by him, better then the <U+017F>on of the King her husband, <U+017F>o now <U+017F>he changed her mind, and wi<U+017F>hed he had never been born, for <U+017F>he never looked upon him, but <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the ingratitude of his father imprinted in his face. Now did <U+017F>he heartily repent <U+017F>he ever put him in the place of him of whom he bore the name, thinking it a mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t judgement of the gods upon her for that impo<U+017F>ture. This regret went <U+017F>o near her heart, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent unto the Port of the Santons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the right <hi>Celiodantes</hi>: but <U+017F>he heard that he was long <U+017F>ince carried away by certain Pirates, and his father al<U+017F>o (for <U+017F>o was <hi>Verances</hi> e<U+017F>teemed) and that his mother was lo<U+017F>t, at lea<U+017F>t never <U+017F>een <U+017F>ince in tho<U+017F>e parts. This news which took from her the foundation of her intended revenge, did more aggravate her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ure, and blew it up to <U+017F>uch a height, that <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to make <hi>Policander</hi> and her <U+017F>elf a mo<U+017F>t notable example unto future ages, for all <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould run the <U+017F>ame fortune.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Celiodantes</hi> was then about the twentieth year of his age, and by the indulgent care of the King of Santons and <hi>Argira,</hi> accompli<U+017F>hed with all the excellent qualities of a great Prince. He was every way <U+017F>o compleated both in parts of body and mind, that though he had not been the <U+017F>on of a King; yet was he worthy of a Monarchy. But as formerly <U+017F>he looked upon him with the eyes of love, as <hi>Policanders</hi> <U+017F>on, <U+017F>o now <U+017F>he lookt upon him with tho<U+017F>e of hatred and revenge: <U+017F>he was long in debate with her <U+017F>elf, before <U+017F>he could re<U+017F>olve what way of revenge <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he made choi<U+017F>e of the greate<U+017F>t that then pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf before her eyes.</p>
               <p>The King of the Cenomanes had <U+017F>ome variance with the King of the Turoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and commonly arms being alwayes judges between <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, and the <U+017F>word the be<U+017F>t Ju<U+017F>tice, both of them begun to Levy men, and li<U+017F>t Souldiers and Commanders. The King of the Rhedonians and Condates, as allies unto the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomances came pre<U+017F>ently to their aide. The King of Venetes and Darioriques, having married the <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter of the Turonian King, came almo<U+017F>t uncalled with all his forces to the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his brother in law: <U+017F>o as the<U+017F>e two Kingdomes were like to be the Theaters of many cruel and bloody Tragedies, when by the advice of the<U+017F>e four Kings, <hi>Celiodantes</hi> was cho<U+017F>en to be the Arbitratour of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Though his young experience in <U+017F>uch weighty matters, might make him <U+017F>eem unfit for <U+017F>uch an undertaking; yet the wi<U+017F>dome, Prudence and Ju<U+017F>tice had already wrought <U+017F>uch incredible effects, in all his other actions, as got him <U+017F>o great a repute that by the a common con<U+017F>ent, they referred them<U+017F>elves unto his arbitriment and doom, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pending arms and actions of ho<U+017F>tility for a time, they waited for his Judgement. This happened to be at the <U+017F>ame time when the Queen <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giras</hi> anger was hotte<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t <hi>Policander.</hi> As fortune was, the two Kings of the Armorique Cities were deadly enemies unto <hi>Policander,</hi> becau<U+017F>e when they were young, he a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted <hi>Suenon</hi> the good Duke again<U+017F>t them, under the notion of a Knight errant, and had cau<U+017F>ed them to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome certain terrritories, of which they had been long Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ours. On the other <U+017F>ide, the King of the Cenomanes and the King of the Turonians, loved <hi>Policander</hi> no better then they, becau<U+017F>e his mini<U+017F>ters had confi<U+017F>cated <U+017F>ome boats upon the river Loyre, loadned with arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they had not a <U+017F>afe conduct.</p>
               <p>This offence though but <U+017F>mall, yet was <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h, that it <U+017F>ought for revenge. <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> thought then, that if <hi>Celiodantes</hi> did compo<U+017F>e all matters between the<U+017F>e Kings, he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53528:60"/>
might ea<U+017F>ily move them both again<U+017F>t <hi>Policander,</hi> as well to <U+017F>atisfie his reque<U+017F>t us to be revenged for their particular injuries.</p>
               <p>All the difficulty was to find a good colour of warre for <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> which <U+017F>he could hardly do, for <hi>Policander,</hi> though a neighbour, had carried him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o free from any offence, as he took away all occa<U+017F>ions of complaint: yet hoping that time might perhaps afford one, that which <U+017F>he recommended mo<U+017F>t unto the Prince her <U+017F>on, and to tho<U+017F>e whom <U+017F>he had imployed to councel him, was to make a peace betwixt the<U+017F>e Kings, and to con<U+017F>ider, that the be<U+017F>t warre, was not <U+017F>o good as the wor<U+017F>t peace: and that the fire of di<U+017F><U+017F>ention being <U+017F>o near them, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parks might fly into their own hou<U+017F>es: briefly, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o in<U+017F>tructed them, that a Peace was made, and <U+017F>o as gave full <U+017F>atisfaction to all parties, each in particular thinking the advantage to be on their <U+017F>ide. This did oblige them <U+017F>o deeply unto <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> and got him <U+017F>o high a repute, that all of them de<U+017F>iring before they parted to make a firm alliance, they cho<U+017F>e him to be their general in ca<U+017F>e they a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embled any forces together: An honour indeed <U+017F>o high, and unhop'd for, he being <U+017F>o young, as in all likelyhood he would have been the lu<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould have been cho<U+017F>en for <U+017F>uch a dignity.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>ee Madam, how fatally-unavoidable <U+017F>ome things are, the Queen was <U+017F>eeking out for a colour of complaint again<U+017F>t <hi>Policander,</hi> and could not find it, when by Fortune <U+017F>ome of the officers of <hi>Celiodantes</hi> pur<U+017F>uing <U+017F>ome pilfering robbers that fled into <hi>Policanders</hi> dominions, the people of the town and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to maintain their Priviledges, did not only receive the<U+017F>e thieves, but killed a great number of his men, and took all pri<U+017F>oners, but <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>aved them<U+017F>elves by flight.</p>
               <p>This news being brought unto the Queen, <U+017F>he thought it a very good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and <U+017F>uch an offence as <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought after. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ure, that if <U+017F>he made complaint unto <hi>Policander,</hi> he would give her <U+017F>atisfaction, therefore <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid nothing, but <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ouldiers immediatly to <U+017F>ack the place, and u<U+017F>e all manner of ho<U+017F>tility: but in lieu of revenging the fir<U+017F>t injury, it did but beget a <U+017F>econd; for tho<U+017F>e that went found <U+017F>uch hot entertainment, that the Commanders hardly e<U+017F>caped with their lives after the lo<U+017F>s of mo<U+017F>t of their men: <hi>Argira</hi> was <U+017F>orry for their lo<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>he was well contented to have <U+017F>uch a colour to move tho<U+017F>e Kings to revenge the injury which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <hi>Celiodantes</hi> had received whil<U+017F>t he was out of his Dominions. And in order to this, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>patched <U+017F>uch a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, as <U+017F>he thought mo<U+017F>t fit to aggravate this offence, and move tho<U+017F>e Kings unto anger: and certainly he did negotiate according to her de<U+017F>ires, for he u<U+017F>ed all manner of arts and arguments to exa<U+017F>perate tho<U+017F>e Kings, and prompt them to revenge: all who remembring their particular injuries which they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and finding arms ready in their hands, they all agreed without more delay, to fall into the Dominions of King <hi>Policander,</hi> whom they found <U+017F>leeping in a dull <U+017F>ecurity all unarmed, and never dreaming of <U+017F>uch an unexpected inva<U+017F>ion. A long and drow<U+017F>ie peace had <U+017F>o lulled him a<U+017F>leep, that he had lo<U+017F>t all his old <U+017F>ouldiers, and he knew not where to get new ones: be<U+017F>ides, the people were all <U+017F>o drowned in an univer<U+017F>al tranquility, that they hardly knew what a <U+017F>word was. It was an ea<U+017F>ie matter for <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> finding him in this condition, to foil him at every encounter.</p>
               <p>Now the Queens de<U+017F>igne was (ob<U+017F>erve what a <U+017F>trange animo<U+017F>ity <U+017F>he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t <hi>Policander</hi>) either to make the <U+017F>on kill the father in this warre, or el<U+017F>e the father to kill the <U+017F>on: and though they knew not them<U+017F>elves to be father and <U+017F>on, yet it was a great <U+017F>atisfaction unto her, to know that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o revenged. <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander</hi> did what he could in this urgent extremity, and making a virtue of nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did mu<U+017F>ter together <U+017F>ome Cavaliers, as well of his own Va<U+017F><U+017F>als as of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and took the field with the Prince <hi>Arionthes</hi> his <U+017F>on. And though he knew it was full of danger to hazard a battel; yet not being able to endure to <U+017F>ee what plunder and ravage our Army made in his Dominions, although he was the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet he re<U+017F>olved to venture it. I will pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over all the circum<U+017F>tances of the battle, and only tell you that <hi>Celiodantes</hi> got the day, and <hi>Arionthes</hi> the only <U+017F>on of <hi>Policander</hi> was killed, and that the father had much ado to <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elf by

getting into Avarick with <U+017F>ome reliques of his broken Army: but the inhabitants of that town and tho<U+017F>e that fled thither, were <U+017F>o affrighted that I believe, if our Army had pur<U+017F>ued clo<U+017F>e, the gates had been opened unto them: But it was thought better to forrage the countrey for victuals, and <U+017F>o be<U+017F>iege that great City, which they fore<U+017F>aw would continue long, becau<U+017F>e it was fortified with great ditches, Towers, and Ramparts; and becau<U+017F>e of the great abundance of men, as well bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as <U+017F>trangers, which fled thither; but the main aim was the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander,</hi> who again<U+017F>t the opinion of his councel, would needs <U+017F>hut up him<U+017F>elf in the Town, with a re<U+017F>olution to be buried in the ruines of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The Corps of <hi>Arionthes</hi> was found among<U+017F>t the dead, and with all honour and civility <U+017F>ent unto his father, to <U+017F>hew that hatred did not go beyond life, nor that any revenge <U+017F>hould be taken of the dead. <hi>Policander</hi> received the body of his <U+017F>on with a dry eye, and <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>tancy and magnanimity in the <U+017F>ad conjuncture of woes, that the virtue of this King began to melt the enraged heart of the Queen, and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to pity his misfortune. Come, come, <hi>Argira</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her <U+017F>elf) can<U+017F>t thou find a heart to <U+017F>ee him who once loved thee, to be <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable? is the <U+017F>ight of thee <U+017F>o fatal as to bring ruine upon all tho<U+017F>e that look upon thee: Con<U+017F>ider that he who<U+017F>e Kingdome thou would<U+017F>t now demoli<U+017F>h, and who<U+017F>e life thou would<U+017F>t have, is the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on whom once thou did<U+017F>t love above all the world, and one who is the father of thy <U+017F>on: Is his fault without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excu<U+017F>e? and though it be, wilt thou remember one <U+017F>ingle di<U+017F>pleasure, more then all the <U+017F>ervices which thou ha<U+017F>t received from him.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations and many more <U+017F>uch like, did <U+017F>o mollifie her heart, that <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>eek for a good pretence of letting him alone in Peace, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Army out of his Dominions; but not daring to declare her mind unto any, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould offend the united Kings, <U+017F>he laid <U+017F>iege before Avarick: her de<U+017F>ign was when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented to the <U+017F>iege, to make <hi>Policander</hi> her pri<U+017F>oner, and then after <U+017F>he had made him acknowledge his offence, to re<U+017F>tore him unto his Crown of Kingdomes. But things fell out farre otherwi<U+017F>e; for a while after, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilion,</hi> who was following his adventures in Germany and the Macromands, he was adverti<U+017F>ed by common fame how the<U+017F>e Kings had invaded the King of the Boyers, and how he was blockt up in the City of Avarick, which could not long hold out.</p>
               <p>When he fir<U+017F>t heard this news he could not believe it, becau<U+017F>e he knew <hi>Polican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to be a King of great equity and Ju<U+017F>tice, and would not give any of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion of warre.

               <p>If tho<U+017F>e Sir who govern Kingdoms and Empires had any priviledge to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the blows of Fortune more then other men, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay you had rea<U+017F>on to be troubled and grieved at the condition wherein you are: But we <U+017F>ee the highe<U+017F>t hills mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to the <U+017F>torms and winds, and not <U+017F>o <U+017F>erene as the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and plains; <U+017F>o as the highe<U+017F>t Soveraignties are expo<U+017F>ed to the tempe<U+017F>ts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, more then the humble condition of <U+017F>ubjects, what rea<U+017F>on then have you to think you <U+017F>hould be exempted? And why <U+017F>hould you complain of a general Law, that is commong to all great ones? Your high Birth and Quality which elevates you above the rank of other men, may well excu<U+017F>e you from petty misfortunes, and trivial calamities, which they are <U+017F>ubject unto, as too inferiour and unworthy

for Grandees; but great afflictions, and <U+017F>uch as are in<U+017F>upportable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <U+017F>ort of men, are proper only for Princes, and <U+017F>uch great Kings as you are; and as you would blame tho<U+017F>e who faint in courage, and <U+017F>hrink under the burthen of little misfortunes, e<U+017F>teeming them as effeminate and pu<U+017F>illaminous, <U+017F>o believe it Sir, Tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ee you with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad dejected countenance, and bending at the fir<U+017F>t blow that Fortune gives you, what will they think of you? The fidelity which I owe unto my King, and the affection which I have unto the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodantes,</hi> does oblige me Sir, in duty and love, mo<U+017F>t humbly to be<U+017F>eech you, and conjure you, even by the memory of the King your Father, to rou<U+017F>e up your magnanimity and courage, and to look all dangers and misfortunes bravely in the face: If you tell me the blow is great, I will an<U+017F>wer, that you ought to arm your <U+017F>elf the better again<U+017F>t it: For the courage of a man cannot be vanqui<U+017F>hed but by its own fault, nor can any accident of Fortune <U+017F>tagger him, if his own will do not betray him, and con<U+017F>ent unto his defeat: Courage Sir, and rou<U+017F>e up your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>oul; you have before your eyes an example of unconquered vertue, as oft as you turn them upon King <hi>Policander</hi>; Did any of his defeats ever make him <U+017F>hrink? Did he droop and drown him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>orrows, when he lo<U+017F>t his only Son? And did his courage fail when his Kingdoms were taken from him? No, no Sir, but on the contrary, he armed him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t all the malice of Fortune, by <U+017F>uch a generous vertue, that at la<U+017F>t he overcame her, and (if it may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid) did force her to take his part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orontes</hi> would have proceeded on, if the young Prince had not interrupted him: Father (<U+017F>aid he, for <U+017F>o he called him) your pains was very ill be<U+017F>towed, and both my courage and memory were very bad, if the lo<U+017F>s of one Battel, part of my Dominions, friends, and my liberty, <U+017F>hould make me forget tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>apient docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wi<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tructions which I received from you; I would never have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any Arms into my hands, if I had not known that all the<U+017F>e accidents might fall upon me: And <U+017F>ince mi<U+017F>eries fore<U+017F>een do le<U+017F>s hurt, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that all tho<U+017F>e you <U+017F>peak of, do make no <U+017F>uch great impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions in me: I did, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, re<U+017F>ent the change of my Fortune, as being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, not faint-hearted, or pu<U+017F>illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous. The <U+017F>orrows you <U+017F>ee in my face and actions, more then ordinary, O my dear <hi>Orontes,</hi> are cau<U+017F>ed by no wounds that any do know of, but by others, which none <U+017F>ees but my <U+017F>elf: Upon this he groaned out a deep <U+017F>igh, and after a <U+017F>ilent pau<U+017F>e, he began again.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes Father, no eyes but my own <U+017F>ees the wounds whereof I complain; and though I <U+017F>ee them incurable, yet <U+017F>uch is my confidence in <hi>Orontes,</hi> that I will di<U+017F>cover them unto him, yet without any other hopes, but only, that he will help me to condole my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Upon this he made a long relation of the extream affection which he bore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> the little hopes he had in the good will of that Prince<U+017F>s, or in the King her Father, <U+017F>ince he had been the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o much <U+017F>orrow unto them, e<U+017F>pecially by the death of <hi>Ariontes</hi>: Now judge (continued he) whether I have not rea<U+017F>on to droop, and whether it were not better for me to end my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable days pre<U+017F>ently, then to groan away a life which will be <U+017F>o wretched and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a<U+017F>trous? I know you will tell me, that Love is but folly and madne<U+017F>s and that a generous <U+017F>pirit may be a<U+017F>hamed to be <U+017F>urmounted by it; but Father, whether it be wi<U+017F>dom or folly, commendable or <U+017F>hameful, if it be folly, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf a fool; and if a generous <U+017F>pirit may be a<U+017F>hamed of it, I would not be thought ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous; for the fatal truth is, that I do love <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and <U+017F>o, that I mu<U+017F>t not love my <U+017F>elf, unle<U+017F>s I love her: Doubtle<U+017F>s you wili advi<U+017F>e me to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but alas, all <U+017F>uch advice is given unto a deaf man, and to one that has not a will to be cured.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>age <hi>Orontes</hi> gave <hi>Celiodantes</hi> a long and patient hearing without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, knowing very well that a <U+017F>ick <U+017F>oul finds ea<U+017F>e in emptying it <U+017F>elf unto <U+017F>ome faithful friend; But when the Prince had done, he began thus.</p>
               <p>I am very glad Sir, you have told me your <U+017F>orrows proceed from Love, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <U+017F>ince your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion is grounded upon <U+017F>uch a worthy <U+017F>ubject as the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>; for till now, I thought you had drooped under the burthen of your

misfortunes, and that your injured patience had fainted at your di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters: But now I find your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily cured, as I wi<U+017F>h you may continue a little longer in it: for I hope this Love will be a means to re-inve<U+017F>t you in your former e<U+017F>tate and <U+017F>plendour. Do you think Sir, that the King <hi>Policander</hi> has forgot tho<U+017F>e extremities unto which your Arms reduc'd him? and out of which, heaven has mo<U+017F>t miraculou<U+017F>ly re<U+017F>cued him? Believe it Sir, though he do <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, yet he knows that all his Victories and Tryumphs may turn into the <U+017F>ame condition wherein he was, and that this is but an interval, and a gleam of Fortune: Do you think he knows not how momentary and uncertain they are? Yes, yes, and que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s <U+017F>o prudent a Prince will be glad to make his peace with you now he may, and not defer it till perhaps he may be forced to take up <U+017F>uch terms as <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e you. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Sir, he is more wi<U+017F>e then to let <U+017F>uch an opportunity <U+017F>lip. I dare be hold to <U+017F>ay, this peace will be concluded, and nothing can hinder it but your own courage: This Love of yours to the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> will remove all difficulties which can be propo<U+017F>ed: Courage therefore Sir, and command me to negotiate the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, for I dare a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you upon my life, to give you all de<U+017F>ired contentment.</p>
               <p>This was the an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Orontes,</hi> who infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch courage into this young Prince, that though his <U+017F>pirits were a little dulled with his hopele<U+017F>s pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yet upon better con<U+017F>ideration, he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome probability in the de<U+017F>igne, the conduct whereof he referred wholly unto the prudent <hi>Orontes,</hi> giving him commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to treat and conclude what peace he plea<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>o <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> might be his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orontes,</hi> who knew he could not do more acceptable <U+017F>ervice to his Ma<U+017F>ter, nor greater advantage to the State, then to negotiate the matter, he employed the whole <U+017F>trength of his Wit and Prudence in it: And having ob<U+017F>erved the <U+017F>everal Intere<U+017F>ts of all tho<U+017F>e about <hi>Policander,</hi> he perceived that two of the prime offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers about the King, who had mo<U+017F>t particular acce<U+017F>s to his per<U+017F>on, and bore a great <U+017F>way in affairs, were very ill <U+017F>atisfied with the Kings de<U+017F>ign, in giving his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> a man unknown, or at be<U+017F>t, but of an ignominious extraction; and, as they <U+017F>aid, they blu<U+017F>hed to think a man bought and <U+017F>old for money, <U+017F>hould ever be their Lord and King: That it was a vile blemi<U+017F>h to the names of <hi>Boyens, Ambarres,</hi> and <hi>Bituriges,</hi> to make choi<U+017F>e of a Slave for their Soveraign, and that he <U+017F>hould command over <U+017F>o many Provinces, and <U+017F>uch Provinces as abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great and noble Cavaliers, who<U+017F>e valours and courages were not inferiour to this enfranchi<U+017F>ed <U+017F>lave; for he was no better, though his acts were very notable. But that which moved the<U+017F>e two Grandees mo<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>like this match, was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intere<U+017F>t which touched them more nearly; for each of them had a Son, and they had a <U+017F>quint eye at the <U+017F>ame happine<U+017F>s after the death of <hi>Policander,</hi> which they <U+017F>aw <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> was like to enjoy. And though both of them had the <U+017F>ame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne, and were in the <U+017F>ame hopes, and certainly had been deadly enemies unto each other, if <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> had not been, yet they united both again<U+017F>t him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted friend<U+017F>hip <U+017F>o far, as to ruine their common enemy, and doubtle<U+017F>s to ruine one another after if they could.</p>
               <p>The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Orontes</hi> heard of all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, he thought either one or both of the<U+017F>e men might be made fit in<U+017F>truments for his de<U+017F>igne; He addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf therefore unto them, he made the overture of Peace; and <U+017F>o advantagious were his propo<U+017F>itions to <hi>Policander,</hi> that they embraced them, conceiving there was no better way to put <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> by his preten<U+017F>ions then this: And though the marriage of <hi>Celiodantes</hi> did bla<U+017F>t all the hopes of their own children, yet they liked better to fall into the hands of the King of Picts, who would be obliged unto them, then into the hands of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> who<U+017F>e fortune hung all at the point of his Sword. Both of them therefore receiving this overture of peace very willingly, and de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to promote it, they con<U+017F>ulted together to <U+017F>peak unto the King, but <U+017F>everally, to the end he might not think it a compact again<U+017F>t <hi>Rosilion</hi>: And they carried it <U+017F>o prudently, and u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much artifice, that <hi>Policander</hi> after <U+017F>ome kind of difficulty, by rea<U+017F>on of his promi<U+017F>e unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> and after their propo<U+017F>ition of giving <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>e</hi> in lieu of <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> he con<U+017F>ented unto it, knowing very well, that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwixt <hi>Celiodantes</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> was the only Cement of this peace, which

he apprehended to be <U+017F>o advantageous to him.

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as ever he received the Kings command, he obeyed it, and leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him very good orders for the Army, he came in all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible po<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te unto him, and gave him an accompt of his charge and <U+017F>tate of the Army, and how near he was to the obtaining of a perfect and entire victory: <hi>Policander</hi> thanked him, made him as welcome as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, and told him that when he had a little refre<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elf after his journey, he would communicate unto him the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>ending for him.

And becau<U+017F>e he thinks you, as well he may, to be one of his be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervants, he therefore <U+017F>ent for you to give your advice al<U+017F>o, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elf that you would approve of it, and rejoyce, as all tho<U+017F>e ought to do who love him, and have any care of his and his kingdomes welfare. The King hath con<U+017F>idered the <U+017F>tate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was when the Kings, his neighbours, invaded him, and that he <U+017F>hall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have the <U+017F>word and fortune of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> alwayes by his <U+017F>ide to help him in the like accidents: <U+017F>o as now in the height of his good fortune, he is plea<U+017F>ed to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto that coun<U+017F>el with the be<U+017F>t of his friends do give him, which is, to conclude a peace in time, when he may do it to his be<U+017F>t advantage. In order thereunto he hath thought upon <U+017F>uch expedients as may make this peace mo<U+017F>t honourable, mo<U+017F>t profitable, and mo<U+017F>t la<U+017F>ting; and the only way is, by a marriage between the King <hi>Celiodantes</hi> and the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira.</hi> For by this means, <U+017F>o many great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes will become but one Monarchy, and will for ever perpetuate the Kings Name and Glory.</p>
               <p>Hitherto <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> was patient, but when he heard of giving <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> unto <hi>Celio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantes,</hi> he rou<U+017F>ed up his courage and voice<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> What Sir?

               <p>He would have proceed further, when the King knowing him to be partly in the right, yet willing to deceive him<U+017F>elf, and not being able to endure the<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trances; <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) there is none about me who have <U+017F>uch intentions as you mention, and as for the Coun<U+017F>el which they gave me concerning peace, if you call them Traytours for it, you mu<U+017F>t put me into the <U+017F>ame number with them, and all the re<U+017F>t of my people.

               <p>In the mean time, the Peace was concluded, as <hi>Policander</hi> wi<U+017F>hed, and as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodantes</hi> de<U+017F>ired; who thought all things advantagious, <U+017F>o <hi>Ra<U+017F>anira</hi> might be his wi<U+017F>e: And the Treaty of it was <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely carried, that the fir<U+017F>t news which the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> heard of it, was, when <hi>Orontes</hi> told us who <hi>Celiodantes</hi> had <U+017F>ent to that purpo<U+017F>e.

How true are all thy Prophe<U+017F>ies? After this, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Orontes,</hi> and a while after, went to Bed.</p>
               <p>None heard what <hi>Orontes</hi> had <U+017F>aid unto her, but every one judged the News to be far different from what they thought at fir<U+017F>t: yet none was <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Orontes</hi>; for he thinking he had brought the mo<U+017F>t welcome news the Queen could receive, he knew not what to think at her cold entertainment of it. But <U+017F>omtimes he feared that in the exce<U+017F>s of his joys he had mi<U+017F>taken him<U+017F>elf, and told her one thing for another.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, the Queen did nothing but cry, and <U+017F>igh in her Bed, not uttering a word that any could under<U+017F>tand, but only from time to time <U+017F>aying, Oh Sybil Melu<U+017F>ine! and <U+017F>o lamented away all the night, until break of day, and then <U+017F>he fell a<U+017F>leep.</p>
               <p>The rea<U+017F>on why this Treaty was carried on <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely, was, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Policander</hi> knew what hatred <hi>Argira</hi> bore unto him: And though <hi>Celiodantes</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the cau<U+017F>e, yet he knew it was <U+017F>o by her own animo<U+017F>ity, in rai<U+017F>ing wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53528:66"/>
                  <hi>Policander,</hi> almo<U+017F>t without any colour of rea<U+017F>on. So as when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed not to acquaint the Queen his mother with it, till all was concluded, he was willing thereunto, left <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give any <U+017F>top unto that marriage which he <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ired; thinking that when the peace and alliance was concluded betwixt them, then <U+017F>he knew not how to break it of; nor could <U+017F>he much as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e it, without <U+017F>hewing her malice too palpably: Yet they fore<U+017F>aw that <U+017F>he would extreamly wonder at the News, and would be very backward to this peace, and therefore it was, that <hi>Celiodantes</hi> gave commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion unto <hi>Orontes,</hi> not only to cau<U+017F>e this to be publi<U+017F>hed and ob<U+017F>erved in all his Provinces, and among<U+017F>t his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but al<U+017F>o to receive tho<U+017F>e places which <hi>Policanders</hi> Forces held, and to re<U+017F>tore them unto tho<U+017F>e Kings to whom they of right belonged: Al<U+017F>o to relea<U+017F>e all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oners on both <U+017F>ides, according to the Letters which <hi>Policander</hi> writ unto the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Officers of his Army. So as the next morning <hi>Orontes</hi> went again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queen to communicate unto her all tho<U+017F>e Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ions which he had, and to be<U+017F>eech her he might put them in execution: But <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept on, <U+017F>o as it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late before he could be admitted unto any <U+017F>peech with her: And when her Lady of Honour told her that he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with her, Sweetheart (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) I am but in a very ill condition to hear of any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but <U+017F>ince his affairs are <U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, bid him do as the King his ma<U+017F>ter has commanded him, and <U+017F>o turned to the other <U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Orontes</hi> had gotten this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he a<U+017F><U+017F>embled together all the Magi<U+017F>trates, and Principal Cavaliers, to whom he imparted the news of this peace, and commanded them to publi<U+017F>h and ob<U+017F>erve it in all the Provinces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And after he had taken in all tho<U+017F>e places which <hi>Policanders</hi> men detained, he went unto the General of the <hi>Boyens</hi> and <hi>Ambarres</hi> Army, which was upon the Armorique Coa<U+017F>t, where he was <U+017F>till continuing his la<U+017F>t victories; whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Policanders</hi> will, and who had already received the <U+017F>ame intelligence by one of his principal Officers. Peace was pre<U+017F>ently proclaimed, and places and pri<U+017F>oners generally rendred and relea<U+017F>ed; and <U+017F>o welcome was the news to all <U+017F>ides, that even tho<U+017F>e who had the advantage, were glad of it, <U+017F>o weary were all of war, and de<U+017F>irous of peace.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Orontes</hi> adverti<U+017F>ed the King his ma<U+017F>ter, how <hi>Argira</hi> received the news of Peace, and of his marriage, at which he did not wonder, no more then <hi>Policander</hi>; both being of opinion, that it was an effect of the ill will which <U+017F>he bore unto the King of the <hi>Boyens</hi>; but they made no great reckoning of it, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them<U+017F>elves, that time would <U+017F>alve the <U+017F>ore, and <U+017F>he be as well contented as either of them.</p>
               <p>The con<U+017F>ummation of the marriage was deferred only till the return of <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e whom <hi>Policander</hi> had <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>ee the Treaty performed on both <U+017F>ides. And one morning as <hi>Policander</hi> was going to the Temple, according to his cu<U+017F>tom, a poor fellow <U+017F>eeing him pa<U+017F>s by, and not <U+017F>uffered by the Guards to come near him, King <hi>Policander</hi> (cryed he out in a loud voice) Command that I may tell you my name, and <U+017F>o, as none may hear me. The King ca<U+017F>ting his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and <U+017F>eeing him to be an old ragged fellow, did think him to be one that would beg: and being ever of a charitable inclination, he commanded his Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to give him <U+017F>omthing: Upon this the poor man cryed louder, No, no King, I come not to beg, though perhaps I have need enough, but only to tell you my name. Tho<U+017F>e who heard him, thought him to be <U+017F>ome mad man, and therefore would have repul<U+017F>ed him; but the King looking better upon him, did remember that he had formerly <U+017F>een him, and commanded to let him come nearer. The poor man kneeling down upon the ground, and in a better po<U+017F>ture then his habit promi<U+017F>ed; Sir (<U+017F>aid he in <U+017F>o low a voice that none could hear but the King) I am <hi>Veronces. Policander</hi> hearing that name, pre<U+017F>ently remembred both by his voice and ge<U+017F>ture, that it was the <U+017F>ame <hi>Veronces</hi> who <U+017F>erved him when he courted <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gira,</hi> and whom he left with her: <U+017F>o as being a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, after a long opinion of his death, he could not chu<U+017F>e but ca<U+017F>t his arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, and embrace him, as affectionately as if he had been his <U+017F>on: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one wondered at the<U+017F>e extraordinary care<U+017F><U+017F>es; but the King called for one of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53528:67"/>
the Officers in his chamber, and commanded him to treat that man very kindly, to put good clothes upon his back, and money in his pur<U+017F>e, and at night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to his chamber. <hi>Veronces</hi> was <U+017F>o over-joyed to <U+017F>ee the King acknowledge him, that he could not <U+017F>peak a word more, but cryed for joy.</p>
               <p>At night the Officer conducted him into the Kings chamber; who after <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h care<U+017F><U+017F>es, asked him where he had been lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o long? Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, the que<U+017F>tion which you are plea<U+017F>ed to ask, is of too great importance to be an<U+017F>wered before <U+017F>o much company, and therefore I be<U+017F>eech you let it be in private.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policander</hi> then taking him by the hand, and thinking it to be <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which concerned the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> he carried him into his Clo<U+017F>et; where <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronces</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf alone with the King, he began thus.</p>
               <p>I have wondred (Sir, a thou<U+017F>and times, when I was in the Aby<U+017F>s of my mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, why the Gods <U+017F>hould keep me <U+017F>o long alive; thinking that if the afflictions of men were equally divided, I have <U+017F>uffered above my <U+017F>hare, and more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: upon this con<U+017F>ideration, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, I did <U+017F>omtimes begin to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure again<U+017F>t the wi<U+017F>e Government of the Gods, and accu<U+017F>e them of inju<U+017F>tice, for having <U+017F>o little care of humanes. But now when I <U+017F>ee their all-wi<U+017F>e providence in pre<U+017F>erving me, to do you a <U+017F>ervice of <U+017F>uch importance, I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay they are all-wi<U+017F>dom and goodne<U+017F>s, in keeping me alive, and conducting me opportunely unto this place, where I do not think any but my <U+017F>elf can <U+017F>hew you the greate<U+017F>t errour that ever could happen in your Family.</p>
               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed therefore to know Sir, that <U+017F>ince you commanded me to <U+017F>tay with the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Argira,</hi> who was pre<U+017F>ently after Queen of the Santons, and <U+017F>ince by the death of the King her Father, was Queen al<U+017F>o of the Picts, I may <U+017F>ay my life hath been nothing but a continual chain of mi<U+017F>eries and di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters; one no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ended but another immediately began; and I think Fortune would never have been tyred with tormenting me, had it not been to do you <U+017F>ervice: But I think this favour <U+017F>o great, that I think all my pa<U+017F>t torments and mi<U+017F>erable time well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>o much life left as to <U+017F>erve my ma<U+017F>ter. Imagine Sir, that in <U+017F>eeing <hi>Veronces,</hi> you <U+017F>ee a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of God <U+017F>ent unto you, or rather, a <U+017F>oul that has been retained at lea<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e twenty years in hell, has at la<U+017F>t got leave to pa<U+017F>s over the River Styx, purpo<U+017F>ely to advi<U+017F>e you of a fault which would have eclip<U+017F>ed all your glory, made all your contentments bitter, and have <U+017F>unk you in <U+017F>orrows: For the truth is Sir, I have been pri<U+017F>oner the<U+017F>e twenty years, without any hopes of liberty, until this general Peace, by which I receive the favour of heaven, and the light of the Sun, which has been <U+017F>o long a <U+017F>tranger to my eyes. Enjoying therefore this benefit, I came to under<U+017F>tand that you are giving the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> unto the King <hi>Celiodantes</hi> in marriage: As <U+017F>oon as I heard this news, I made all the ha<U+017F>te I could unto you, to <U+017F>peak with you before the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age be con<U+017F>ummated: and if I be come time enough I do thank the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Gods; and if too late, I prote<U+017F>t that what I intended to tell you, <U+017F>hall die with me, and I <U+017F>hall think it the greate<U+017F>t misfortune that ever did befall me: I be<U+017F>eech the Gods after <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, not to let me live a minute longer, <U+017F>ince life will be a mo<U+017F>t intolerable torment unto me.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Veronces</hi> was <U+017F>ilent, and <hi>Policander</hi> laid his hand upon his <U+017F>houlder, Friend (<U+017F>aid he unto him) thy affection is <U+017F>o well known unto me, that thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of it may be <U+017F>pared: Come tell me freely what this <U+017F>ecret is which you think <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to my contentment? For the truth is, I do intend to give my daughter unto <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> but it is yet proceeded no further then promi<U+017F>es, and I <U+017F>tay only till the peace be publi<U+017F>hed, and received by all tho<U+017F>e that have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t therein. Oh ye great and good Gods! be ye for ever ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed (cryed out <hi>Veronces</hi>) as well for your goodne<U+017F>s, as for your profound judgements. Then turning towards the King, Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto him) I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with a thing that will even ravi<U+017F>h you with wonder, and will divert you from this marriage. What can divert me (replyed <hi>Policander</hi>) from a de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>o much conducing to the grandeur of my Crown, and the welfare of my people? Sir (replyed <hi>Veron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>) This marriage is again<U+017F>t all Laws, both Divine and Humane: For, is not the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> your Daughter?

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53528:67"/>
the King <hi>Celiodantes</hi> (replied <hi>Verances</hi>) is your Son. My Son?

               <p>The Prince<U+017F>s with whom you commanded me to <U+017F>tay, was pre<U+017F>ently after your delivered of a <U+017F>on, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, that none but her nur<U+017F>e and my <U+017F>elf, who <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to tru<U+017F>t, did know of it: A few moneths after, <U+017F>he was married to the King of the Santons, by whom the <U+017F>ame year <U+017F>he had another <U+017F>on called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodantes</hi>; but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he married only by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>tate, and <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erved her affection entirely for you, <U+017F>he could not endure to <U+017F>ee <hi>Celiodantes</hi> continually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her eye, and be deprived of that better beloved <U+017F>on which <U+017F>he had by you; and much le<U+017F>s that he whom <U+017F>he loved not <U+017F>hould be King of two great kingdomes, whil<U+017F>t the other had no e<U+017F>tate: and a hundred times has <U+017F>he made her complaints of it unto me, and as oft did I indeavour to comfort her: at the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he pitched upon a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olution: <U+017F>he pretended that a certain Sybil had foretold her, that if the little <hi>Celiodantes</hi> were <U+017F>een by any other but his Nur<U+017F>e, and tho<U+017F>e that were to wait upon him, until a certain time, he would mo<U+017F>t infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly die immediately after. By this device <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him away, and commanded me at the <U+017F>ame time to change him for the other which <U+017F>he had by you, <U+017F>o as ever <U+017F>ince he has been received by all for <hi>Celiodantes.</hi> Now <U+017F>he made choi<U+017F>e of me for a witne<U+017F>s of this change, to the end, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, that if <U+017F>he chanced to die, I might let you under<U+017F>tand how great her affection was unto you; and ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed be the gods, I have now, after <U+017F>o many years of mi<U+017F>ery made good my promi<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Policander</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, O <hi>Verances,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto him, do<U+017F>t thou a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me that <hi>Celiodantes</hi> is my <U+017F>on? and that the Queen <hi>Argiras</hi> love unto me, moved her to put him in place of the true Inheritour? A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Verances,</hi> upon that fidelity which I own unto you that I do not lie in one word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policander</hi> then made a <U+017F>ilent pau<U+017F>e, and afterwards clapped his hands together, certainly (<U+017F>aid he) this is the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Argiras</hi> <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entment of the news, when <hi>Orontes</hi> told her of the marriage between <hi>Celiodantes</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> for ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he has kept her bed. Doubtle<U+017F>s Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Verances,</hi> that if <U+017F>he know of <U+017F>uch a marriage betwixt them two, it will grieve her to the very <U+017F>oul; and I do judge of her by my <U+017F>elf, for I prote<U+017F>t, I think that had I come too late to prevent it, it would have co<U+017F>t me my life. But Sir, there is no rea<U+017F>on you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer one that has loved you <U+017F>o well, to continue in <U+017F>uch intollerable <U+017F>orrow; I be<U+017F>eech you therefore out of your own goodne<U+017F>s, and conjure you by the love you once bore unto her, to remedy it, and to quit your <U+017F>elf of tho<U+017F>e obligations wherein you <U+017F>tand bound unto her. Friend (<U+017F>aid the King then) now do I begin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that heaven does love me, and will let me live the re<U+017F>t of my dayes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, <U+017F>ince It hath <U+017F>o unexpectedly given me a <U+017F>on in lieu of him I lo<U+017F>t. I am re<U+017F>olved therefore not only pre<U+017F>ently to put the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> out of her pain, but al<U+017F>o give her <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timonies of my e<U+017F>teem, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall never again repent of her affection unto me.</p>
               <p>After <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this <U+017F>ubject, the King commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and above all to be <U+017F>ecret: then he went unto <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> whom he acco<U+017F>ted with <U+017F>uch new and extraordinary Carre<U+017F><U+017F>es as did amaze him, and afterwards told him, that he had a mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire that the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> his mother, <U+017F>hould be at the marriage, and therefore wi<U+017F>hed him to continue the means of getting her to come, or if <U+017F>he would not, he was re<U+017F>olved to go unto her, although <U+017F>he was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with him, for he was fully re<U+017F>olved upon a reconciliation with her, and never to <U+017F>uffer the con<U+017F>ummation of the marriage but in her pre<U+017F>ence. <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odantes,</hi> who next his marriage, de<U+017F>ired nothing more then to <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Policander,</hi> he told him after much other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that he would go him<U+017F>elf and invite her to come, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>he would not deny him that favour: and <hi>Policander,</hi> approving his de<U+017F>ign, he began to take order for his departure, and made <U+017F>uch

ha<U+017F>te, as within three dayes after. he was ready to <U+017F>et forward, when <hi>Orontes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> would be with them within two dayes, and that he came before her purpo<U+017F>ely to acquaint them. Both the Kings were extreamly joyed at this news, and <hi>Celiodantes</hi> the <U+017F>ame hour <U+017F>et forward to meet her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policander</hi> the mean time enquiring of <hi>Orontes,</hi> how it came to pa<U+017F>s, her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was <U+017F>o much changed from what it whas when he writ, did under<U+017F>tand, that after <U+017F>he had kept her bed a long while, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent one evening for him, and faintly asked him upon what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s the King her Son had <U+017F>ent him thither. Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, when I came fir<U+017F>t I began to tell you my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, but you were <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed then, that you could not hear me out; I under<U+017F>tand, replied <U+017F>he, that you come about the Publication of the peace, and to cau<U+017F>e Publique joyes to be made for his marriage. But in that there was no need of any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto me, for you had commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion ample enough for it without my approbation. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Orontes,</hi> 'tis mo<U+017F>t true, I had <U+017F>uch commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but it was with a limitation, to act in it according unto your plea<U+017F>ure, and I am to be<U+017F>eech you from <hi>Policander</hi> and your Son, you would be plea<U+017F>ed to take <U+017F>o much pains as to be at the Celebration of the marriage. Did not you tell me (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted) that the marriage was already pa<U+017F>t? Pardon me, Madam, I mo<U+017F>t hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid he, I might perhaps tell you that the marriage and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of peace were concluded upon; but the con<U+017F>ummation of the marriage was not to be, before your health would permit you to be there, or till you excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed your <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Orontes,</hi> (cryed <U+017F>he out with a joyful countenance) how I have been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, <U+017F>ince your fir<U+017F>t coming, by not under<U+017F>tanding the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: for you mu<U+017F>t know that when I under<U+017F>tood the King my Son made <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall accompt of me, it did <U+017F>o grieve me to the <U+017F>oul, that my life has been odious unto me. O Madam, replied <hi>Orontes,</hi> entertain no <U+017F>uch opinion, I be<U+017F>eech you, but believe, though he u<U+017F>ed all the expedition he could in concluding the peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imparting it unto you, becau<U+017F>e he thought it <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make him<U+017F>elf King of two great kingdomes, that he thought you would blame him if he u<U+017F>ed any delay: yet for the marriage, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Madam, he was not <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>ince the retardment of it could not be of <U+017F>uch importance; and the King <hi>Policander</hi> him<U+017F>elf de<U+017F>ires you <U+017F>hould be pre<U+017F>ent at it. The Queen upon this, <U+017F>o changed her countenance, as if <U+017F>he had not been the <U+017F>ame; and took order for her departure the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policander</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that the Queen had prudently concealed the cau<U+017F>e of her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure from <hi>Orontes,</hi> and he longed extremely to hear the relation of <hi>Veran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> confirmed from her own mouth.</p>

               <p>I am <U+017F>ure, <hi>Policander,</hi> when fir<U+017F>t you re<U+017F>ented the fury of my Sons Arms, and of tho<U+017F>e united with him, by my contrivance, to your ruine, you were then not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed. Do you remember what affection I <U+017F>hewed unto you, when (as a Knight errant) you came into the Court of the King my Father? if you do, you could not expect a le<U+017F><U+017F>e revenge upon your ingratitude, from my wrong'd affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when you have heard me out, you will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that love and hatred had never <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong an influence upon any, as it had upon the Soul of <hi>Argira.</hi> But you Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the Prince<U+017F>s) I be<U+017F>eech you wave your ill opinion of me, until you know by experience, what power the<U+017F>e two pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of love and hatred have over a Soul that loves well. And you Son (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Celiodan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>) <U+017F>tay until the end of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and then I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my fault, and think your <U+017F>elf beholding unto me.</p>

She repre<U+017F>ented her grief to <U+017F>ee this Son alwayes with her, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the other: her re<U+017F>olution was to change them, her contrivances about it, her curio<U+017F>ity to know the Fortunes of the<U+017F>e children from the Sibil Me<U+017F>uline, who<U+017F>e an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>he <U+017F>till kept in writing: how <U+017F>he put the true <hi>Celiodantes</hi> into the hands of <hi>Verances,</hi> and how extremely grieved <U+017F>he was, when <U+017F>he thought them both lo<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>Policander,</hi> who knew all the<U+017F>e things from <hi>Verances,</hi> he was not <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed as the re<U+017F>t: But <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> who <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf deprived of <hi>Ro<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> and of two kingdomes, of which he thought to be Legitimate Lord, he was <U+017F>trangely confounded; yet it was no <U+017F>mall contentment unto him, to <U+017F>ee he had found <U+017F>uch a father as <hi>Policander,</hi> who<U+017F>e virtue and valour was held in high e<U+017F>teem among<U+017F>t all the Princes of his time.

No Madam, an<U+017F>wered he; but if you plea<U+017F>e to hear the Fortune of the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable man alive, I will briefly tell you mine, by which you may be better <U+017F>atisfied in your Que<U+017F>tions: Then <hi>Policander</hi> be<U+017F>eeching her to hear him, he began thus.</p>
               <p>I was no <U+017F>ooner come to the place, where by your command I had changed this young Prince for his brother, but I changed al<U+017F>o his name, and charged his Nur<U+017F>e to call him by no other then <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on,</hi> chu<U+017F>ing that name rather then any other, becau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>tone which you hung about his neck, whereon was ingraved the figure of a Lion, with the<U+017F>e words, Kinick, Knic<U+017F>on; conceiving that if ever he were lo<U+017F>t, or came within compa<U+017F>s of your hearing this name, you would know him by it. We went then, according to your command, unto the Port of the Santons, where taking a little retired hou<U+017F>e, we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away five years, every one thinking <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on</hi> to be my <U+017F>on, and his Nur<U+017F>e my wife. When he was about that

age, one unlucky day, as he was playing among<U+017F>t other children by the Sea <U+017F>ide, he was carried away by <U+017F>ome Pirats who roved about that coa<U+017F>t: I was there al<U+017F>o, but a<U+017F>leep upon the ground, but did not awaken, till after the<U+017F>e Ravi<U+017F>hers had got my ma<U+017F>ter into their hands, and me al<U+017F>o: yet amid<U+017F>t this great di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, it was <U+017F>ome comfort unto me to be with him, that I might in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort <U+017F>erve him; but alas, Fortune did pre<U+017F>ently after rob me of this con<U+017F>olation al<U+017F>o: for we were no <U+017F>ooner upon the open Sea, but another company of Pirats fell upon tho<U+017F>e that took us, and after a long di<U+017F>pute became ma<U+017F>ters of us; and it was my chance to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Pirats, thinking that I had been one of the conquered Pirats, they put me into chains, and treated me with all the cruelties that <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily u<U+017F>e to be: The<U+017F>e men carried us into one of the Armorique I<U+017F>les, where they were wont to make their retreat, and where Merchant of the Continent u<U+017F>ed to come and buy <U+017F>uch prizes of them, as they u<U+017F>ed to take upon that coa<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, the<U+017F>e Merchants came thither, and the child was bought, as well for his hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s, as upon the promi<U+017F>es that I made unto them, to pay double what he co<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>oon as I could convey a Letter unto his friends; for I was extremely de<U+017F>irous to get him out of the clutches of the<U+017F>e wretched <U+017F>ort of men. When a thing, Madam, is decreed by heaven, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be avoided. An hone<U+017F>t Merchant bought him, and pre<U+017F>ently paid, what they asked, both for him and me. I told you that I received a wound in the Combate, and this wound for want of right dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, did <U+017F>o gangrene, that the Merchant dur<U+017F>t not take me with him, left I <U+017F>hould dy by the way; but gave me <U+017F>ome money to maintain me, with a promi<U+017F>e to return unto me within fifteen dayes. And becau<U+017F>e the Pirats had taken the <U+017F>tone which you had put about the neck of little <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Merchant to buy it al<U+017F>o, and give it him: The hone<U+017F>t Merchant did <U+017F>o, and before my face put it about the neck of the child; at which I was exceedingly contented, thinking that though I died, yet this mark might one day bring him to your knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now Madam, the fifteen dayes were pa<U+017F>t. and fifteen more, yet no Merchant came; and a while after, I heard he was dead: when I was recovered of my wound, I required a relea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e my ran<U+017F>ome had been paid; but they who made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their god, did but laugh at me, and the chief of them an<U+017F>wered, that the gods had made them Lords of all they could get, and owners of all that fell into their hands: <U+017F>o as clogging me with abundance of chains, I remained there in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mi<U+017F>ery, until this la<U+017F>t war, when the Boyers and Ambaries, after they had forced many Towns towards the Armorique coa<U+017F>t, did by fortune come into this I<U+017F>lle, which they plundered, and with many others, brought me into their camp; where though I was a pri<U+017F>oner, yet it was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction to be pri<U+017F>oner unto rea<U+017F>onable men, and to <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e who u<U+017F>ed me <U+017F>o cruelly, to be pri<U+017F>oners as well as my <U+017F>elf. Heaven at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>ome pity upon me, and after a twenty years impri<U+017F>onment, did <U+017F>et me at liberty, by the benefit of the general peace, when all pri<U+017F>oners were relea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing I did was to go unto the Temple, and render thanks unto the great Tautates, and next to be<U+017F>eech him, that if <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on</hi> were alive, to make him known unto you, that I might pa<U+017F>s away the remainder of my old age in <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Having recorded in my memory, the name and place of the Merchant, I went thither as fa<U+017F>t as I could; and all I could learn was, that the e<U+017F>tate of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, after his death, was divided among<U+017F>t his children, and tho<U+017F>e that had <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic<U+017F>on,</hi> did <U+017F>end him up the river Loyre among<U+017F>t other Merchandize, and <U+017F>old him either in Gaul about Lyons, or beyond: And being de<U+017F>irous to make a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <U+017F>earch, I under<U+017F>tood that all this Merchants children were <U+017F>lain in this la<U+017F>t war: So I went as fa<U+017F>t as I could unto the Port of the Santons to enquire of the Nur<U+017F>e whether <U+017F>he heard any news; but they told me, that as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he heard of the lo<U+017F>s of her <U+017F>on, and her husband, <U+017F>he died for grief: And indeed, Madam, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved upon the <U+017F>ame, not knowing what I had el<U+017F>e to do; but the news that I heard there pre<U+017F>ently after, prolonged my life: For I under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Policander,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53528:69"/>
having taken the King your <U+017F>on pri<U+017F>oner, he re<U+017F>olved to conclude a peace, and for a confirmation of it, to marry the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> unto him. Then did I think the Gods had pre<U+017F>erved me alive purpo<U+017F>ely to prevent that ince<U+017F>tuous marriage; and though I knew, Madam, that you were alive, and that you knew the truth of things better then I, yet I thought <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>ideration or other might keep you from declaring it. I made therefore all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, to acquaint <hi>Policander</hi> with it, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould happen in the Family of <U+017F>o good and <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t a King; and le<U+017F>t that cur<U+017F>e which would infallibly en<U+017F>ue upon <U+017F>uch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>tuous alliance, <U+017F>hould fall upon his head.</p>
               <p>Upon this, he fell down upon his knees with tears in his eyes; It grieves me Madam to the very <U+017F>oul (<U+017F>aid he) that I am not able to re<U+017F>tore unto you that charge which you committed unto me: But cur<U+017F>ed Fate! without any fault in me, did deprive me of that contentment.</p>
               <p>The queen after <U+017F>he had looked a while upon him, and <U+017F>aw his eyes <U+017F>wim in tears; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>erances</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) all that I can gather from your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, is, that my <U+017F>on is lo<U+017F>t, and that there is no hopes ever to <U+017F>ee him again. And <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> making no reply, but <U+017F>adly <U+017F>haking his <U+017F>houlders, Oh Gods! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, mu<U+017F>t the Sybil be a Liar only unto me? Here is thy prediction, oh Melu<U+017F>ine (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and pulled a paper out of her pocket) written with thy own hand; I mu<U+017F>t to my grief upbraid thee with it, and tell the world thou art an Impo<U+017F>tor, a Deceiver, and not to be believed. The King then taking the paper, and reading it he did admire it, that the Sybil <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o fore<U+017F>ee all that hapned unto her <U+017F>on, and the ince<U+017F>tuous marriage which was intended: But when he read the<U+017F>e words,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In Forre<U+017F>ts, where <U+017F>hall be Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi>

                  <l>The other <U+017F>hall his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es there recover:</l>
                  <l>Then Fate <U+017F>hall kind be both to one and other.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Oh Madam (cryed he out) Do not condemn this great Sybil. Then taking <hi>Verances</hi> by the hand; <hi>Verances</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) in what place do they <U+017F>ay the childe was <U+017F>old? Alas Sir (an<U+017F>wered he) they know nothing, but that he was <U+017F>ent up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Loyre</hi> with other Merchandi<U+017F>e. Well (replyed the King) what age might the childe be then? About <U+017F>ix years old, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Verances.</hi> Was he black or fair, <U+017F>aid the King? Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Verances</hi>) he was the faire<U+017F>t childe that ever eye beheld: fair hair, and curled; full eyes, and lively; vi<U+017F>age <U+017F>omthing oval, complexion fre<U+017F>h and delicate, big for his age, and full made; in all proportions <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om, and in every action <U+017F>o becoming, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ee, and not to love him.</p>
               <p>What was his name? <U+017F>aid the King. His right name (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Verances</hi>) was <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> but le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be known. I gave him the name of <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of a <U+017F>tone which had that name writ about it, and which the Queen did put about his neck. Oh ye infinite Gods! cryed out <hi>Policander,</hi> lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, open our eyes, that we may find out the truth which hath been <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>curely hid from our eyes.</p>
               <p>Then turning towards the Queen, Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) as you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me one <U+017F>on, <U+017F>o I will give you another, unle<U+017F>s I be the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>taken man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: For tell me Daughter (<U+017F>aid he unto the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>) do you remember the name which <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> had when the Merchants pre<U+017F>ented him unto me! Sir, (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, almo<U+017F>t out of her <U+017F>elf) his name was as you may <U+017F>ee writ upon this <U+017F>tone, which formerly he gave me, when he waited upon the Prince<U+017F>s my Si<U+017F>ter, and me; for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) having nothing el<U+017F>e to give me for a New-years gift, when they gathered the Mi<U+017F>leto of the New year, he gave me this; then pulling it out of her brea<U+017F>t, I have ever <U+017F>ince kept it (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) becau<U+017F>e he told me it was very fortunate. The King no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw it, but he knew it to be the very <U+017F>ame which he him<U+017F>elf had long worn, and afterwards gave it unto the Queen <hi>Argira</hi>; who al<U+017F>o as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eye upon it, <U+017F>he cryed out, and <U+017F>aid, Oh happy mark
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53528:70"/>
of my pa<U+017F>t contentments, I do demand of thee him unto whom I gave thee, whom if thou do<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tore unto me, I will call the mo<U+017F>t fortunate <U+017F>tone that ever was: then <U+017F>he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and laid it unto her brea<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>But all this was nothing to the joys of <hi>Verances</hi> when he <U+017F>aw it, for truly he <U+017F>eemed to be ab<U+017F>olutely out of his wits. The Prince<U+017F>s who dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>hew her joys, for fear of giving too much knowledge of her affection unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> <U+017F>he waited with extream impatience, until he was fully known, that <U+017F>he might be a <U+017F>harer in their demon<U+017F>trations of joy. In the mean time, the King taking the <U+017F>tone, and reading the in<U+017F>cription about the Lyon, he found it to be <hi>Kinic, Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic<U+017F>on,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies, <hi>a King, the <U+017F>on of a King.</hi> Here is the name (<U+017F>aid he) which he had when the Merchants <U+017F>old him unto me as a <U+017F>lave, for I do very well remember it, and that afterwards when he killed the Lion which was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me, I changed it into <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>; as well in memory of that generous act, as becau<U+017F>e he was my daughters Cavalier, and from <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> and the <hi>Lion,</hi> I formed the name <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion.</hi> When he was fir<U+017F>t brought unto me, he was about the <U+017F>ame age which <hi>Verances</hi> mentions; his face was according to his de<U+017F>cription; and all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances makes me believe <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> to be the <U+017F>ame whom the Queen lo<U+017F>t. And yet I conceive that a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of this importance ought not to be divulged, until <U+017F>ome more certain te<U+017F>timonies appear; for this <U+017F>tone might be taken from him, and put upon another<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and that name might be given unto him by chance, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, as he might well be thought worthy of that name, which indeed does <U+017F>ignifie the Son of a King; and therefore before any notice be taken, I would have it made out by more infallible circum<U+017F>tances and proofs.</p>
               <p>Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Verances</hi> pre<U+017F>ently,) he loved me <U+017F>o well, as I am confident that as <U+017F>oon as he hears my name, he will know me. If I do <U+017F>ee him (<U+017F>aid the Queen) I can know him by a mo<U+017F>t undoubted mark; for I remember that when I put him into the hands of <hi>Verances,</hi> I was in <U+017F>ome fears of lo<U+017F>ing him, and therefore to know him, would have given him a mark with a hot Iron; and looking which was the mo<U+017F>t convenient place, I found upon his hand a Ro<U+017F>e <U+017F>o perfect, that I thought it mark <U+017F>ufficient. Oh Madam (<U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F>s pre<U+017F>ently) a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf then that <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> is your <U+017F>on, for I have <U+017F>een a Ro<U+017F>e upon his left hand <U+017F>o perfectly drawn by Nature, as is beyond all imitation of Art. Oh Sir, <U+017F>aid the Queen, and clapped her hands together, what can you de<U+017F>ire more? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to give more certain a<U+017F><U+017F>urances? The name, the age, the <U+017F>tone, the merchants, and the mark upon his hand, makes it mo<U+017F>t apparent that he is the very <U+017F>ame; and above all, the prediction of the Sybil Melu<U+017F>ine, puts in out of all doubt, con<U+017F>idering the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein he is.</p>
               <p>Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Verances</hi>) I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you, give me leave to go unto him, and <U+017F>peak with him, before he hear any thing of this news, and I <U+017F>hall give you a mo<U+017F>t perfect account. Upon this he went pre<U+017F>ently to the Lodging of <hi>Ro<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> who<U+017F>e malady was not at that time in its height of Fury, but only a di<U+017F>tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the under<U+017F>tanding, which made him conceit him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>omtimes to be in the Army, and commanding, as if he were the General; otherwhiles he fancied that he <U+017F>aw <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and <U+017F>poke unto her; <U+017F>omtimes he would upbraid the King with breach of promi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>uch conceptions: And when he fell into the<U+017F>e humours, he would talk <U+017F>o temperately, and urge <U+017F>uch <U+017F>olid rea<U+017F>ons and arguments, that if he did not <U+017F>omtimes rove pre<U+017F>ently from one thing unto another, one would not have judged him to be out of his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Verances</hi> came unto him, he was walking up and down the chamber, and <U+017F>aid not a word; but as <U+017F>oon as he was told that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> had <U+017F>ent to vi<U+017F>it him, he left walking, and received him whom they pre<U+017F>ented unto him, <U+017F>o very kindly, and gave <U+017F>uch <U+017F>weet language, that none would have believed him di<U+017F>tempered: and this was no novelty; for when at any time they would have him to do any thing, if they told him that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> would have it <U+017F>o, he pre<U+017F>ently obeyed, with <U+017F>o much willingne<U+017F>s and alacrity, as if his mind had not been di<U+017F>ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verances</hi> <U+017F>eeing him in this condition, could not refrain from tears: but before he made him<U+017F>elf known unto him, Sir (<U+017F>aid he) the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> has <U+017F>ent me to know how you do, and to <U+017F>ee whether the Ro<U+017F>e which you have upon your left

hand be worn out. Worn out (<U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently) No, no, neither the <hi>Ro<U+017F>e</hi> in my hand, nor the <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> in my heart will ever wear out. She hopes the <U+017F>ame (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Verances</hi>) but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome had told her the contrary, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent me to <U+017F>ee, and report the truth unto her. Then he held out his hand unto him; <U+017F>ee Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he) how Nature knowing I was decreed by de<U+017F>tiny unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> has given me a Ro<U+017F>e, which I will keep as long as life. Poor <hi>Verances</hi> knowing him very well by that mark, Ah <hi>Kinic<U+017F>on</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee <hi>Verances</hi> and not know him? Upon this he <U+017F>tarted back two or three paces, and after he had looked a while upon him, Are you <hi>Verances</hi> (<U+017F>aid he all amazed) the husband of <hi>Lerina?</hi> (that was the name of his Nur<U+017F>e, whom he thought to be his mother.) I am the very <U+017F>ame (an<U+017F>wered he) that was taken with you upon the Sea <U+017F>ide by Pyrats, and who never <U+017F>ince enjoyed one minute of contentment till I came hither. To <U+017F>ee the good nature of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> he ran unto him with open arms, embraced and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, and for very joy, tears came into his eyes: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as if he were in his perfect <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, he enquired of his and <hi>Lerinas</hi> fortune, and why he had been <U+017F>o long ab<U+017F>ent from him. <hi>Verances</hi> then acquainted him with his long impri<U+017F>onment, and how he was <U+017F>et at liberty by the general Peace: At the word Peace he began to <U+017F>igh, and to be very extravagant in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the War which he had enterprized again<U+017F>t <hi>Celiodantes,</hi> with whom he would joyn Battel, and would have <hi>Verances</hi> there; and roved <U+017F>o far from any purpo<U+017F>e, that <hi>Verances</hi> not being able to conceal his <U+017F>orrow and tears; Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, what me<U+017F><U+017F>age will you plea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>end unto the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>? Tell her (<U+017F>aid he) that I will ere long <U+017F>end her <hi>Celiodantes</hi> a Pri<U+017F>oner; but I do not intend the <U+017F>econd victory <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>o disadvantagious unto me as the fir<U+017F>t. Then <hi>Verances</hi> would have gone away: But dear <hi>Verances</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) take heed you be not again taken by Pyrats; if you go by Land, I will be your convoy with half my Army; but be <U+017F>ure you return pre<U+017F>ently unto me again, if you love me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verances</hi> with abundance of tears returned to the King and Queen, and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he had heard, and how <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> remembred the name of <hi>Lerinda</hi> and <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic<U+017F>on</hi>; of which the Queen was <U+017F>o glad, that <U+017F>he held up her hands, thanked heaven, and wept for joy: At la<U+017F>t (after much rejoycing) they all re<U+017F>olved not to publi<U+017F>h their toys, until they <U+017F>aw the re<U+017F>t of the Sybils prediction verified; and in order thereunto, to carry <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> into Forre<U+017F>ts: And al<U+017F>o it was then concluded upon, that if he were cured, <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> <U+017F>hould be his wife, and <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> be given unto <hi>Celiodantes.</hi>

Do you not remember how I am a witne<U+017F>s of all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>olemn Oaths, and Gods which you mocked, at the making of tho<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es? A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Sir, that all the misfortunes which hitherto you have received, are but fore-runners of greater, unle<U+017F>s you do <U+017F>atisfie all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>olemn promi<U+017F>es which you made in the pre<U+017F>ence of the Gods.

I do confe<U+017F>s <hi>Verances,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto him, thou <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t mo<U+017F>t truly; and to make all due <U+017F>atisfaction, if the Queen will plea<U+017F>e to forgive, and forget the offence which I have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t her, which as thou <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t, was committed only out of rea<U+017F>on of State, I will this very hour take her for my legitimate Wife, and Queen of the <hi>Boyens</hi> and <hi>Ambarres</hi>; which <U+017F>he accepted of with much joy.</p>
               <p>Thus the grave old man made an end of relating the cau<U+017F>e of the Queen <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giras</hi> coming into that Country, and be<U+017F>eeched the Nymph to keep it, <U+017F>ecret, until it plea<U+017F>ed the Gods to re<U+017F>tore <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> unto his health. Unto which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he thought it very expedient <U+017F>o to do, although <U+017F>he had very confident hopes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53528:71"/>
of his cure: for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) be<U+017F>ides the predictions of the Sybil, which hitherto have proved all true, the coming hither of him who mu<U+017F>t cure him, which was but the day before <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> came, <U+017F>eems as if the Gods had <U+017F>ent him purpo<U+017F>ely for it: For the Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> the <U+017F>econd <U+017F>on of the Burgundian King, came unto this Town but ye<U+017F>terday, and was conducted hither by a mo<U+017F>t unexpected piece of Fortune, Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Argira</hi>) you do put me into great hopes and joys; but I be<U+017F>eech you, how do you conceive it <U+017F>hould be him whom the Sybil means? I do conceive (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) upon good rea<U+017F>on; for before your coming, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved that he <U+017F>hould drive a <U+017F>acred Nail for the cure of a Shepherd that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; and this will be a means to keep it the more <U+017F>ecret: for under preten<U+017F>e of the Shepherd, both may be done as you de<U+017F>ire. And I do think the Gods did <U+017F>end Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> hither, purpo<U+017F>ely for it; becau<U+017F>e it being nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that he who drives the Nail, <U+017F>hould be Soveraign Magi<U+017F>trate; I cannot think of any more fit for it then he, who<U+017F>e quality is above the common rank. How Madam? <U+017F>aid the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> Is then the young Prince of the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians here? He is Madam (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) and I cannot conceive any danger in acquainting him who you are; to the end, that if he <U+017F>hould come to know it afterwards, he <U+017F>hould not be offended at our diffendence in him. With all my heart (<U+017F>aid the queen) I will therefore <U+017F>end unto him, with a tender of my <U+017F>ervice, and acquaint him with it. Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto the queen) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for many rea<U+017F>ons, that all ha<U+017F>te be made in the cure of the Prince <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially becau<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s will be divulged if it be retarded, <U+017F>ince there are many in your Train who know of it: And <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>acrifice is already re<U+017F>olved upon, and prepared for the Shepherd <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> the deferring of it would give occa<U+017F>ion unto many to <U+017F>eek out for the cau<U+017F>e of it, and perhaps find it out.</p>
               <p>But be<U+017F>ides all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, the important affairs now in agitation, and which the Nymph will impart unto you, do require a <U+017F>peedy cour<U+017F>e to be taken in it; <U+017F>o as Madam without more delay, let it be effected to morrow. Father (<U+017F>aid the queen) you motion a thing which <U+017F>uits much with my approbation, though I dur<U+017F>t not trouble the Nymph <U+017F>o far as to move it; but <U+017F>ince her <U+017F>ervice requires it <U+017F>o, I be<U+017F>eech you let us joyn our petitions together, for a <U+017F>peedy conclu<U+017F>ion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> then turning towards the Nymph, Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) if you plea<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>acrifice in readine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>hall acquaint the high Prie<U+017F>t, and Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> and therefore I be<U+017F>eech you give this <U+017F>atisfaction unto the queen.</p>
               <p>The Nymph con<U+017F>ented; and <U+017F>ending for <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>he retired, and left the queen <hi>Argira</hi> to as much re<U+017F>t as her troubled <U+017F>oul would give her leave to take.</p>
               <p>The next morning the high Prie<U+017F>t, accompanied with many Flamins, and the mo<U+017F>t part of the Colledge of <hi>Augu<U+017F>talians,</hi> pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf before the Nymph, to let her under<U+017F>tand what was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be done in the publique action which <U+017F>he intended; and among<U+017F>t other things, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould chu<U+017F>e a Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>trate, unto whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould refer the Soveraign Power, as long as the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was in hand: For (<U+017F>aid he) this Ceremony did come from <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi>; and at that time <hi>Rome</hi> was under the command of Kings, and it was they who were wont to drive the Nail: But after Kings, were aboli<U+017F>hed, they u<U+017F>ed always to elect a Dictator: For this <U+017F>olemn action mu<U+017F>t not be performed by any, but <U+017F>uch a one as hath no <U+017F>uperiour unle<U+017F>s the Gods. Now Madam, I pre<U+017F>ent the<U+017F>e things unto you, that you may put in effect tho<U+017F>e good and pious intentions which you have towards <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> and the other <U+017F>tranger; and in order thereunto, to make choi<U+017F>e of him, who being made Soveraign Magi<U+017F>trate, may execute all conditions nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary: For though (Madam) you be the Soveraign Lady of the Country, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto our Cu<U+017F>toms, you are not capable of medling herein, becau<U+017F>e in all <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> men only mu<U+017F>t be mini<U+017F>ters.</p>
               <p>The Nymph who was already advertized of the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity in making this electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who al<U+017F>o thought it advantagious to her affairs, yet <U+017F>eeming to have no

other de<U+017F>ign, but the care of the<U+017F>e two Per<U+017F>ons. Father, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I am <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>irous to obtain this favour from the gods, that I intend not only to make choi<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch a man <U+017F>o quallified as you mention, but al<U+017F>o to do any thing el<U+017F>e that you <U+017F>hall think either expedient or nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and <U+017F>ince we are not well experienced in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>olemn Actions, I pray give me a full relation of all that is to be be done. Madam, <U+017F>aid the high Prie<U+017F>t, two things are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be, done: The one a <U+017F>acrifice, the other an election of a <U+017F>overaign Magi<U+017F>trate; for after the <U+017F>acrifice offered unto <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> he whom you chu<U+017F>e, mu<U+017F>t drive a nail of bra<U+017F>s, which we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ecrate and make pure and clean with Lu<U+017F>tralian wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into the wall of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, which is towards the Sanctuary of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and this to be done after the nail hath three times touched the temples of the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>ed per<U+017F>on: Then for the <U+017F>acrifice we will take <U+017F>uch order as it <U+017F>hall be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, at what hour, to morrow, you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to appoint: But, Madam, as for the election of this Soveraign, it is requi<U+017F>ite you make choi<U+017F>e of him to day pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and that you give unto him a Scepter, &amp; a Globe, as formerly they were wont at <hi>Rome</hi>: and becau<U+017F>e that was a Republique, and every one had a <U+017F>hare in it, that Dictatour was cho<U+017F>en by the votes and <U+017F>uffrages of all the people; but in this place, where you have the <U+017F>ole intere<U+017F>t, you alone mu<U+017F>t make this election, <U+017F>o it be in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that every one may know your intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> under<U+017F>tanding that the Ceremony was to be performed in this manner. Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, knowing it your plea<U+017F>ure to ob<U+017F>erve all the<U+017F>e things, I have-taken order for all things requi<U+017F>ite in this election, <U+017F>o as they have already begun to erect <U+017F>caffolds, and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf, that pre<U+017F>ently after dinner, all things will be in readine<U+017F>s. After this, the Nymph appointing the high Prie<U+017F>t to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the <U+017F>acrifice next morning, <U+017F>he referred the ordering of all the re<U+017F>t unto the Druide, intending pre<U+017F>ently after dinner to make this Election, unto which, the Prince <hi>Godomar, Alcedon, Damon,</hi> and <hi>Adamas,</hi> were of opinion, that it was requi<U+017F>ite to <U+017F>ummon <hi>Polemas,</hi> to the end he might have no colour or excu<U+017F>e for the Arms (which was in a low voice commonly <U+017F>poken) that he was preparing And though the Nymph knew very well he would not come, yet <U+017F>he approved of their opinions, and di<U+017F>patched <hi>Clindor</hi> pre<U+017F>ently unto him.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> thinking it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to adverti<U+017F>e the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and being unwilling to imploy any of his own men, left he <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e treatment from King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> he be<U+017F>eeched the Nymph to permit that <hi>Leontidas</hi> the <U+017F>on of <hi>Clindor</hi> might be the man; conceiving him to be man of courage and wit, and a per<U+017F>on whom he might tru<U+017F>t in the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince <hi>Dorinde</hi> lay at his hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ince he believed that <U+017F>he had acquainted him with the cau<U+017F>e of her coming.</p>
               <p>The Nymph liked very well of it, and <U+017F>ent Letters by him unto the King, unto Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and unto the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda.</hi> Unto the King, by way of joy, for the honour <U+017F>he received from the pre<U+017F>ence of Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> his <U+017F>on; not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice that <U+017F>he knew any thing of the cau<U+017F>e which moved him thither: Unto Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> by way of a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, to give <hi>Dorinde</hi> for his <U+017F>ake all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and unto <hi>Clotilda,</hi> to de<U+017F>ire the continuation of her favours. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Godomar</hi> thought that perhaps the King would not <U+017F>uffer <hi>Leontidas</hi> to <U+017F>ee his brother, he advi<U+017F>ed him to go unto him <U+017F>ecretly, if he could the night before, and to <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> according to the advice of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>: having then given him full in<U+017F>tructions, and <hi>Dorindes</hi> picture, he recommended him unto the Protection of Tharamis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorinde</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who as <U+017F>he thought had <U+017F>o much cau<U+017F>e to complain again<U+017F>t all men in general, and in particular again<U+017F>t <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> <U+017F>he knew not what me<U+017F><U+017F>age to <U+017F>end unto him: for when <U+017F>he remembred how <U+017F>he was left all night in the wood, in expectation of him, <U+017F>he could not afford him a good thought; when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered what <hi>Godomar</hi> told her, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he thought him partial and <U+017F>poke in behalf of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes again <U+017F>he excu<U+017F>ed him: At la<U+017F>t, at the in<U+017F>tance of the young Prince, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him a Letter by <hi>Leontidas,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> that <U+017F>he would be alwayes his <U+017F>ervant, in <U+017F>pite of Fortune.</p>

dear <hi>Clindor,</hi> have I not ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to complain? Yes certainly, if not again<U+017F>t the Nymph, yet at lea<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t my bad Fortune. This grievance makes me to love my friends and my kindred, and to <U+017F>pend my time among<U+017F>t them, <U+017F>ince my life has hitherto been <U+017F>pent in the <U+017F>ervice of one who does not <U+017F>o much as look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my affection; or if <U+017F>he do <U+017F>ee it, does <U+017F>corn and reject it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clindor</hi> heard him out without any interruption, and let him <U+017F>ay what he would, but though his words were <U+017F>mooth, and language full of candour, yet he <U+017F>aw they were <U+017F>teept in viniger, and had a hidden bitterne<U+017F>s in them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and not being <U+017F>o ignorant in the affairs of the world, but that he had heard of his bad de<U+017F>igns, e<U+017F>pecially when the Nymph at parting gave him a hint thereof, that he might more particularly ob<U+017F>erve all his actions, he found that all his complaints had been long premeditated, and that to contradict him, would not convert him, nor do the Nymph any <U+017F>ervice; and therefore without entring into any excu<U+017F>e he only told him, that perhaps his complaints had not <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t a ground as he imagined, nor as was reported unto him: That in love and court, ab<U+017F>ence was a mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unto any man: That the Nymph was <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet and every way <U+017F>o good, that he might expect all de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>atisfaction from her: That <U+017F>he e<U+017F>teemed of him above all the re<U+017F>t of her Subjects, and therefore had elevated him above all the re<U+017F>t: That the demon<U+017F>tration of her good will unto him was <U+017F>o great, that he could not any way <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the contrary: That her de<U+017F>ires of <U+017F>eeing him was an argument that <U+017F>he <U+017F>et a higher e<U+017F>teem upon him, than he was made believe by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>owers of <U+017F>edition; and that to bla<U+017F>t all the de<U+017F>igns of <U+017F>uch ill officers, he ought to come unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where he might receive from the Nymph all manner of <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contentment, and that he ought the rather to come, left the Prince <hi>Goda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> being there, <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Nymph in this publick Action which <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polemas</hi> had been already adverti<U+017F>ed of Prince <hi>Godomars'</hi> coming by his corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but becau<U+017F>e the cau<U+017F>e of his coming was kept clo<U+017F>e, he could not know it: yet imagining that <U+017F>o great a Prince would not come with <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a train, unle<U+017F>s upon <U+017F>ome great importance, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ired to under<U+017F>tand what it was; but not daring to di<U+017F>cover his curio<U+017F>ity too much unto <hi>Clindor,</hi> he conceived that their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e did give him a good occa<U+017F>ion to talk a little more of it. But dear friend, (<U+017F>aid he and interrupted him upon that point) what great action is that which is intended? For though I know Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> did not come thither for nothing; yet I cannot imagine what it <U+017F>hould be. The Action (replied <hi>Clindor</hi>) will be very great, for the Queen de<U+017F>ires that what<U+017F>oever the high Prie<U+017F>t and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Augu<U+017F>talians,</hi> <U+017F>hall command, may be exactly ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
               <p>About three or four dayes <U+017F>ince, a Lady who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Dorinde</hi> came unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> upon <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion, which truly I do not know; but <U+017F>o it was, that there came in her company <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who brought one with them who ran mad for love. The Nymph was de<U+017F>ired that a nail of bra<U+017F>s might be driven into the wall of the Temple for him, a Ceremony which they <U+017F>ay is a common cure for madne<U+017F>s. Now the high Prie<U+017F>t does tell her that for the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this nail <U+017F>he is to make choi<U+017F>e of a Soveraigne Magi<U+017F>trate, for it can be done by no other hand but his. Who do you think (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) <U+017F>he intends to chu<U+017F>e for that Ceremony? I think, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clindor,</hi> <U+017F>he is not yet re<U+017F>olved: but when you come unto her <U+017F>he will tell you, and I am confident <U+017F>he will do nothing without your advi<U+017F>e. <hi>Clindor,</hi> replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he intend utterly to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace me, <U+017F>he will not think upon any but me: For it belonging to my office <U+017F>he cannot without extream offence prefer any other; but I perceive <U+017F>he thinks her contempt of me not enough, unle<U+017F>s it be done to my face, and therefore <U+017F>he would have me pre<U+017F>ent at this publick Ceremony, that all the world may laugh at me. It is enough that I have <U+017F>pent my age and my e<U+017F>tate in her <U+017F>ervice, and not lo<U+017F>e that little reputation and credit that I have among<U+017F>t men. Tell her therefore, that as long as I can, I will conceal from every one that <U+017F>mall value which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ets upon my <U+017F>ervices, and that I had rather hear <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he <U+017F>lights me, then be witne<U+017F>s of it. <hi>Clindor</hi> per<U+017F>waded him all he could to divert him from this re<U+017F>olution, but he <U+017F>tood ob<U+017F>tinately upon this and beckning unto <hi>Ligonias, Pelidontes, Argoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>

and <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> to come unto him; he acquainted them with the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> coming, and with the an<U+017F>wer he had <U+017F>ent unto the Nymph: And all four did <U+017F>o approve of what he had done, with <U+017F>o many complaints and imaginary injuries, that at la<U+017F>t he was con<U+017F>trained to come away with this an<U+017F>wer, to wit, that if the Nymph would chu<U+017F>e him for this <U+017F>olemn Ceremony, and gave him the title of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Magi<U+017F>trate, he would come and <U+017F>erve her with a good troop of his friends: otherwi<U+017F>e, he would keep at a di<U+017F>tance, and rather hear what was done, then <U+017F>ee it with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>honour to him<U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>But in the interim, the Nymph as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had dined, carried Prince <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> unto a great plain, where <U+017F>caffolds were erected, and there in the pre<U+017F>ence of all the Druids, Prie<U+017F>ts, Flamins, Augu<U+017F>talians and others, as al<U+017F>o of all Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, Sherifs, and Majors of the Town, <U+017F>he declared him Soveraign Dictator in all her provinces, and in order thereunto gave him a Scepter. He afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an oath to govern the State with Ju<U+017F>tice and equity as long as his commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion la<U+017F>ted, and not to <U+017F>pare any pains, life, or limb, in defence thereof! Then the Trumpets <U+017F>ounded, and the people with <U+017F>houts of joy accompanied him back to the ca<U+017F>tle, and as they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through the <U+017F>treets, though it was night, yet it was as light as day, and not a door but had two Torches burning before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clindor</hi> returned when all the<U+017F>e lights were <U+017F>et out, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it to be for joy of this election, he hoped that the Nymph did it upon good con<U+017F>ideration, though he knew it would extremely incen<U+017F>e the <U+017F>pirit of yonder ambitious man, When he came before <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> he would have given her an account of his journey but <U+017F>he would not hear him until the Prince <hi>Godomar, Damon, Alcedon,</hi> and <hi>Adamas</hi> were pre<U+017F>ent, who hearing the re<U+017F>olution of <hi>Polemas</hi> did not wonder at it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well that he would find <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e or other for his not coming hither; but charged <hi>Clindor</hi> to be <U+017F>ecret in it, for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons which afterwards he <U+017F>hould know.</p>
               <p>But all the<U+017F>e Ceremonies were no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>olemniz'd, then <hi>Meronthes</hi> the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>ent his <U+017F>on to acquaint him with it, and the arival of the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> though he knew not her name; only let him know with what a Train <U+017F>he came, and how <U+017F>he was lodged in the Ca<U+017F>tle: All the<U+017F>e things did extremely trouble him; for being ignorant of the cau<U+017F>e which brought Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> thither, with the Cavaliers, which, troop after troop, followed him, and then the great number which belonged unto the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> (for the hundred <U+017F>ouldiers which <U+017F>he brought were reported to be three) he was the mo<U+017F>t confounded man in the world; and but for the hopes he had in the nimble wit of <hi>Climanthes,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he had ha<U+017F>tned his de<U+017F>ign, and attempted upon the Town: but the a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances he had from him, and the execution at hand, was the rea<U+017F>on of retarding the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>lacking his de<U+017F>ign wherein he had <U+017F>uch great hopes. And the rather, becau<U+017F>e tomorrow was the day appointed by <hi>Leonide</hi> for <hi>Galatheas</hi> re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: which the Nymph remembring very well, <U+017F>he appointed her and <hi>Silvia</hi> over night to go the next morning and know his re<U+017F>olution; which they failed not to do: and becau<U+017F>e they were very de<U+017F>irous to be at this <U+017F>olemn <U+017F>acrifice of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the nail (a Ceremony never <U+017F>een before, and therefore invited with the more curio<U+017F>ity) they got up <U+017F>o early in the morning, that they were almo<U+017F>t the fir<U+017F>t at the opening of the gates: and yet they found <hi>Climanthes</hi> already expecting them, at the door of his Temple, where <U+017F>eeming as if he <U+017F>aw them not; he began to adore the ri<U+017F>ing <U+017F>un, and the heavens, and endeavoured by <U+017F>uch counterfeit devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to get an opinion of his <U+017F>anctity. But when he perceived that they <U+017F>aw his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, he aro<U+017F>e up and came towards them. Nymphs (<U+017F>aid he unto them) the Divinity, who I adore, is plea<U+017F>ed with the prayers of <hi>Galathea</hi> and the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which I offered for her; and therefore have permitted me to go unto her, and render the Oracle which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires, and which is one of the greate<U+017F>t favours that ere was done unto any mortal. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you therefore that three dayes hence I will come about this time of the day unto the garden door which is under the Ca<U+017F>tle, not de<U+017F>iring to be <U+017F>een in the Town, or any places frequented, becau<U+017F>e they are not conformable unto my <U+017F>olitary cour<U+017F>e of life; and I do give her three dayes warning to the end <U+017F>he may prepare her <U+017F>elf with a re<U+017F>olution to ob<U+017F>erve the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53528:73"/>
commands of the Oracle: For otherwi<U+017F>e, that great Deity who<U+017F>e Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger and Interpreter I am, will be more incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t her, then I am able to expre<U+017F>s; and therefore let her be <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he arm her <U+017F>elf with <U+017F>trong re<U+017F>olution to obey his commandments. Sage Nymphs, I know you love her, and therefore I conjure you to adverti<U+017F>e her of it from me; and if by fortune you find her not inclineable thereunto, to give me notice of it, that I may not more aggravate her crime by my coming unto her. Nay, nay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> never retard that favour which the Gods intend her for that; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you <U+017F>he is fully re<U+017F>olved not to fail in any thing; and if any thing divert her from this her re<U+017F>olution, it will be only the delay of the<U+017F>e three days which you prefix, and which will <U+017F>eem very long unto her. That delay (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) proceeds not from me, but from the Deity which I adore; and I take it for a very good Angury; for the number of three is plea<U+017F>ing unto the Gods: and to tell you truly, the<U+017F>e are the three days in which that God is mute; <U+017F>o as though I would my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>peak as I was accu<U+017F>tomed unto her, yet I cannot. And for this cau<U+017F>e I do not carry you at this time into his holy Temple; knowing that during the<U+017F>e three days, neither Sacrifices nor Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are plea<U+017F>ing unto him: and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that if I offer to enter, as I am accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed, he will <U+017F>hut the door again<U+017F>t me: But fail not you to be both at the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den door upon the day I have appointed, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that contentment which heaven is preparing for her, as a reward of her obedience.</p>
               <p>Upon this he ha<U+017F>ted up the <U+017F>tairs towards his Temple, for he thought that if he <U+017F>tayed any longer, the door would <U+017F>hut of it <U+017F>elf: and it hapned as he thought; for he was no <U+017F>ooner ready to <U+017F>et his foot in the door, but it <U+017F>hut violently upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> did know very well that this man was an Impo<U+017F>tor, yet for all that, they were afraid; having an opinion, that under a colour of <U+017F>anctity, he dealt with the Divel: And, as if heaven took delight in augmenting their fears, it hapned that when they were near the gardens of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> through which they could pa<U+017F>s into the Ba<U+017F>e Court of the Ca<U+017F>tle, without coming into the Town, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently they <U+017F>pied a man, who knowing them a far off, came running to them; and as <U+017F>oon as he overtook them, fell down upon his knees before <hi>Silvia,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ki<U+017F>s her hand. The Nymph no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t her eye upon him, but <U+017F>he cryed out, Oh good Gods, See where the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is! <hi>Ligdamon</hi>! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Leonide</hi> (and was wor<U+017F>e affrighted then her Companion) oh Heavens! it is <U+017F>o, and began to run away as fa<U+017F>t as ever her legs could carry her to the Garden door, which by chance <U+017F>he found open; and <U+017F>he had run her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o out of breath, that as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was two paces within the door, <U+017F>he fell down, as if <U+017F>he had been half dead: <hi>Silvia</hi> in the mean time <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf alone, and held by this man, whom <U+017F>he thought to be a Gho<U+017F>t, was <U+017F>o extreamly affrighted, that <U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>woond. The man <U+017F>eeing her in this pitiful condition, he was <U+017F>truck al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t as dead as <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be; he fell down upon his knees, called unto her, and pinched her to bring her again unto her <U+017F>elf. She upon this opening her eyes, and <U+017F>till feeling him, cryed out, and fell into her fit again; he <U+017F>till called upon her, and <U+017F>till pinched her, but all would not do any good; for her fears this <U+017F>econd time were <U+017F>uch, as indeed did put her in danger of death. At which the man was <U+017F>o affrighted, that he ro<U+017F>e up, and ran to call for help, or at lea<U+017F>t, to fetch <U+017F>ome water to throw upon her; and <U+017F>eeing a hou<U+017F>e not far from thence, he ran thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But as good luck was, he was no <U+017F>ooner out of <U+017F>ight, but <hi>Silvia</hi> came to her <U+017F>elf; and not <U+017F>eeing this Gho<U+017F>t which put her into this fright, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up and ran as fa<U+017F>t as ever <U+017F>he could unto the Garden door, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw open, and as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>hutting the door, <U+017F>he <U+017F>pied the man running after her as fa<U+017F>t as he could, yet <U+017F>o far off, that <U+017F>he had time enough to make fa<U+017F>t the door, and get into the Ca<U+017F>tle, where <U+017F>he found <hi>Leonide</hi> in <U+017F>uch apprehen<U+017F>ions of fear, as <U+017F>he was not able to utter a word.</p>
               <p>But when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Silvia,</hi> Oh Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am very glad you are e<U+017F>caped out of the enchantments of this wicked man. <hi>Silvia</hi> half be<U+017F>ides her wits, Ah Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) would you run away, and leave me in <U+017F>o great a danger?

But for all their di<U+017F>order they would not tell, having this con<U+017F>ideration with them, that perhaps it might he prejudicial to the <U+017F>ervice of the Nymph.</p>

For my part, I ran away, and cannot tell how my companion e<U+017F>caped out of his hands.

All which the Nymph hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knowing it to be nothing but fancy <U+017F>he began to laugh at the fears where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were; and leaving them to re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>he went unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> unto whom <U+017F>he related all <U+017F>he heard; whereat <U+017F>he was not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed: And whil<U+017F>t they were in talk of the<U+017F>e things, one came to tell the Nymph that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was ready, and that the Nails of Bra<U+017F>s were wa<U+017F>hed clean and pure with the <hi>Lu<U+017F>tralian</hi> water: <U+017F>o as the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> expected only the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> who at la<U+017F>t came, holding the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> by the hand; who was <U+017F>o fair that day, as <U+017F>he ravi<U+017F>hed the eyes of all tho<U+017F>e that looked upon her; her Dre<U+017F>s was mode<U+017F>t, and by rea<U+017F>on of her affliction, rather too much, then too little; but <U+017F>o neat and hand<U+017F>ome, that envie it <U+017F>elf could not find the lea<U+017F>t fault: <U+017F>he leaned upon the arm of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> who<U+017F>e countenance was very <U+017F>ad, and his looks <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wilde, but by his walk and garb, and all the re<U+017F>t of his actions, appeared to be of no mean extraction.

               <p>After all this pomp, the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> came all alone, with a Crown upon his head, and a Scepter in his hand, and following him a great croud of Cavaliers and Souldiers.</p>
               <p>In this order they came unto the Temple, where the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> the Nymph, <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies were with <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi>: and every one having taken their places, Proclamation was made that all <U+017F>hould keep <U+017F>ilence upon pain of puni<U+017F>hment:</p>
               <p>Then the Flamin <hi>Diale,</hi> who was Sacrificer that day, called for the Lu<U+017F>tralian water, and after he had wa<U+017F>hed his hands, did <U+017F>prinkle it upon all that were to be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants at the Sacrifice; then falling down upon his knees, he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to be a man poluted with many <U+017F>ins, and begged a pardon of the Gods, not only for his own, but for the <U+017F>ins of all the A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants; then taking a Torch which was made of Virgins wax, which was lighted at a clear burning fire, he kindled the wood that was upon the Altar; and commanding the Victims to be brought near, he turned towards the ea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ide of the Altar: He fir<U+017F>t invoked <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Jupiter,</hi> calling him Father, Omnipotent, and Good; and after him he invoked all the re<U+017F>t of the Gods.

After the Victims were viewed, the fat of them was burned and con<U+017F>umed upon the Altars; and they poured out wine and oyl, and <U+017F>prinkled Incen<U+017F>e thereupon: The fire burned till all was con<U+017F>umed, but they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved the flame to be blew like brim<U+017F>tone, and not burning upwards like a waving Piramide, but as if it were depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with wind, which yet would <U+017F>ome times fla<U+017F>h out into extraordinary flames: The <U+017F>moak was thick, dusky, and ob<U+017F>cure, <U+017F>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering downwards, and not a<U+017F>cending as u<U+017F>ual.

               <p>The <U+017F>acrifice was no <U+017F>ooner ended, and the Flamin had no <U+017F>ooner pronounced the la<U+017F>t word, but the high Prie<U+017F>t taking the <U+017F>acred Nails, did wa<U+017F>h them anew with the Lu<U+017F>tralian water, and offered them unto <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi>: Then he pre<U+017F>ented them unto Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> who taking them with all reverence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, made <U+017F>ome private prayers; and afterwards touched the temples of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi>; which was a thing not ea<U+017F>ie to be done without the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Doris</hi>: But <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> did <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>pect the one, and <hi>Adro<U+017F>tes</hi> the other, that they dur<U+017F>t not di<U+017F>obey what<U+017F>oever they commanded. When the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> was going to drive the Nails, <hi>Palemon</hi> went to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Altar: For my part (<U+017F>aid he in a loud voice) I do make a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemn vow, that if it will plea<U+017F>e the great Gods to grant our reque<U+017F>t which now we ask, I will not deny the fir<U+017F>t thing which <U+017F>hall be asked of me, be it what it will, if it be within the compa<U+017F>s of my power. The Officer who recorded all <U+017F>olemn vows, did write down this of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and many ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> looked upon the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> as if <U+017F>he expected the like from her; which the Queen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o ro<U+017F>e up, and went unto the Altar: And I (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, as loud as <U+017F>he could <U+017F>peak) who am a Queen, and the Wife and Mother of Kings, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e and vow, oh great <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> that if you grant the petition which I now make unto you, I will employ all the power and forces of tho<U+017F>e King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which are in <U+017F>ubjection to me, my husband, and my <U+017F>on, in maintenance of the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and her Dominions, again<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall offer any injury unto them or her. The people hearing this Vow, and wondering at it, would have broke out into acclamations of joy, but their re<U+017F>pect unto the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hindred them. In the mean while, the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> holding the Nail in his left hand, and a hammer in his right, being directed by the high Prie<U+017F>t, and the Flamin <hi>Diale,</hi> he went towards the wall which was towards the Sanctuary of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>; and there calling thrice upon the names of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> he drove the Nails to the very head: But to <U+017F>ee the wonderous effects! upon the very fir<U+017F>t blows that were <U+017F>truck, <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> fell to the ground as if they were dead, and <U+017F>o continued until the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> came unto them, and till the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <U+017F>prinkled <U+017F>ome Lu<U+017F>tralian water upon them; then they came to them<U+017F>elves, as if they had waked out of a dead <U+017F>leep. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> opening his eyes, and <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many Flamins, and other people about him, did think him<U+017F>elf at fir<U+017F>t in a dream, for he had quite lo<U+017F>t the memory of all he had done, during the time of his di<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Polemas,</hi> who had his <U+017F>pies in every corner, was adverti<U+017F>ed of all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages concerning this Ceremony, as well of the election of Prince <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi> as the recovery of the two di<U+017F>tracted per<U+017F>ons; and al<U+017F>o of Queen <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giras</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of intere<U+017F>ting her <U+017F>elf in the Protection of the Nymph, when <U+017F>he declared her <U+017F>elf to be a Queen: He was adverti<U+017F>ed al<U+017F>o of one <hi>Dorinde,</hi> a Lady that fled into <hi>Marcelles</hi>; but though he heard of the combate about her, upon the banks of Lignon, yet he knew not the cau<U+017F>e: and when he was thinking <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon the<U+017F>e things, he was adverti<U+017F>ed of <U+017F>ome Cavaliers, <U+017F>trangers, who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with him, and who came as they <U+017F>aid, from King <hi>Gondebaut. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi> commanded they <U+017F>hould enter, and after a very honourable reception of them, the chief of them <U+017F>poke thus.</p>
               <p>The King my ma<U+017F>ter Sir, who loves you as well as any neighbour he hath, has <U+017F>ent me to acquaint you that he hath great occa<U+017F>ion to complain again<U+017F>t the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who values his friend<U+017F>hip at <U+017F>o low a rate, as that <U+017F>he harbours within her Dominions, tho<U+017F>e who have mo<U+017F>t traiterou<U+017F>ly a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inated <hi>Clorantes,</hi> the Captain of his Guard, who would have took out of their hands a woman which run away from the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Clotilda,</hi> after <U+017F>he had committed mo<U+017F>t foul crimes, which are unfit to be publi<U+017F>hed in re<U+017F>pect of the Prince<U+017F>s honour: And though the Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> whom he di<U+017F>claims for his <U+017F>on, be the chief of tho<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t whom he complains, yet he conceives the Nymph ought not to receive <U+017F>uch runagate <U+017F>ubjects of his without his con<U+017F>ent: he hath <U+017F>ent me to make the<U+017F>e complaints unto you, and commanded me to tell you that he would gladly live in peace with his friends, and that offences committed again<U+017F>t their wills, <U+017F>hall not make any <U+017F>eparation betwixt him and them; and therefore if you think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53528:76"/>
I will go unto <hi>Marcelles</hi>; and declare unto the Nymph how much the King my ma<U+017F>ter is offended; I will demand from her a re<U+017F>titution of Prince <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> and <hi>Dorinde,</hi> or el<U+017F>e declare open war: And in te<U+017F>timony that all I <U+017F>ay is true, here Sir, is a Letter from the King my Ma<U+017F>ter unto you. Upon this <hi>Polemas</hi> took the Letter: Cavalier, an<U+017F>wered he, I am very <U+017F>orry the Nymph has given any cau<U+017F>e of di<U+017F>content unto that great King: If <U+017F>he would be ruled by my advice, no <U+017F>uch complaints <U+017F>hould ever be; but truly the<U+017F>e new Councellours go upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes which are much contrary unto mine, and <U+017F>uch truly as I do not under<U+017F>tand; I pray god <U+017F>he do not repent of them when it is too late. Then opening the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he found to be a Letter of Credence. The King (<U+017F>aid he unto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier) tells me I may believe what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto me from him, and therefore <U+017F>peak freely your mind, for there is no Prince upon the earth whom I take to be my ma<U+017F>ter but yours. The <U+017F>tranger, upon this, thanked for his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able declaration, and be<U+017F>eeched that he might <U+017F>peak unto him in a place where there was fewer witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Polemas</hi> then taking him by the hand he carried him into a private clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, and <U+017F>hut the door.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>tranger then began to <U+017F>peak, and told him of the Kings affection unto <hi>Dorinde</hi> (yet in as favourable a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e for his Ma<U+017F>ter as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could) of the love of the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> unto the <U+017F>ame woman: of the Kings ju<U+017F>t anger, when he heard that the Prince intended to marry her; of the Kings de<U+017F>ign in marrying her unto <hi>Periander</hi> or <hi>Merindor,</hi> to divert that Prince: of the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Prince: of the Kings command unto <hi>Clorantes</hi> to follow her: of Prince <hi>Godomars</hi> going out of Lyons with many Cavaliers: of <hi>Ardilans</hi> death, whom the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> killed at the gate of the Town; and briefly, how <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes</hi> was killed with almo<U+017F>t all his company, as he was in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> whom he found in the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s upon the banks of Lignon. Now Sir (continued he) the King is informed that this <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> are fled into <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and that the Nymph hath promi<U+017F>ed to protect them: How? to protect them, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> hath <U+017F>he inve<U+017F>ted the Prince <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> with ab<U+017F>olute Authority in all her Dominions? Yes Sir, replied the <U+017F>tranger, and hath thereby <U+017F>o di<U+017F>obliged the King; that he is fully determined to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf and fetch him out of <hi>Marcelles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that you may know how much you are obliged unto the King, he lets you know that this is the nick of time to put your generous de<U+017F>ign into execution: for <hi>Clidamant</hi> is dead: How (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) is <hi>Clidamant</hi> dead? why Sir (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger) did you not know that before? It is long <U+017F>ince the King <U+017F>ent you word of it, but I verily believe the Letter which imported it, was intercepted by the death of <hi>Clorantes</hi>: but be plea<U+017F>ed to know that dead he is, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>o wounded, that there is no hopes of his life, al<U+017F>o all tho<U+017F>e that were under his conduct are <U+017F>quandered and gone.</p>
               <p>O heavens! (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) this is news beyond my hopes: now Sir, (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger) the King to te<U+017F>tifie his affection unto you, will under colour of Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> and <hi>Dorinde,</hi> rai<U+017F>e a great Army again<U+017F>t the Nymph, and will him<U+017F>elf in per<U+017F>on come and be<U+017F>iege <hi>Marcelles</hi>: he will inve<U+017F>t you with the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, make you Count of the Segu<U+017F>ians, and content him<U+017F>elf that you <U+017F>hould only hold it of him, as Duke and Earl of the Burgundians, thinking your merits and affection unto him alwayes expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, does de<U+017F>erve no le<U+017F>s then his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance upon this occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>The joyes and thanks of <hi>Polemas</hi> were great, and his promi<U+017F>es and prote<U+017F>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were greater: but indeed his joyes were extream, for <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> were two great rubs unto him, the one to his ambition, and the other to his affection: and they being thus removed, gave him a<U+017F><U+017F>ured hopes in his de<U+017F>igne. He de<U+017F>ired the <U+017F>tranger therefore, that he might impart this news unto four of his friends, who<U+017F>e advice he u<U+017F>ed in all affairs: and calling for <hi>Ligonias, Peledontes, Argonides,</hi> and <hi>Li<U+017F>tander,</hi> he related the whole matter unto them, whereat they <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o extremely tran<U+017F>ported with joy, that they were hardly them<U+017F>elves. At la<U+017F>t, it was re<U+017F>olved upon that this Cavalier <U+017F>hould go unto the Nymph, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> and <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not re<U+017F>tore them, as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53528:76"/>
they verily believed <U+017F>he would not, then to declare war from the King of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians; and le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould receive any harm either in going or coming <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>hould appoint him a Convoy of <U+017F>ix Troops of Hor<U+017F>e; So in this re<U+017F>olution they parted.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ame night <hi>Climanthes</hi> came to <hi>Polemas,</hi> to relate unto him all that he had <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia:</hi> But <hi>Polemas</hi> having not <U+017F>o much patience as to hear out all his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he embraced him: Oh my dear friend (<U+017F>aid he unto him) I have other kind of news to impart unto you: <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore</hi> are dead with all their men, and the King of the Burgundians will come him<U+017F>elf and make me Count of the Segu<U+017F>ians, contenting him<U+017F>elf that I <U+017F>hould only acknowledge him to be Lord Paramont, as Duke and Earl of the Burgundians. The death of <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Climanthes</hi> very faintly) falls out very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our de<U+017F>ign; but let me tell me, that in my opinion, <U+017F>o is not the coming of the Burgundian King; for Ambition is a mon<U+017F>trous glutton, and is never <U+017F>atisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Now objects will move new appetites: There is not in all Gaul a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant Province then this; <hi>Galathea</hi> is very fair, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> is of an amorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; moreover, he has two <U+017F>ons who are not married; The<U+017F>e Interviews are dangerous: for my part, I like of his <U+017F>ending aid, but not of his coming: Do you think that when he is once in <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and tryumphant, that he will then care for you? The Prize is yours already, Sir, <U+017F>ince <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore</hi> are dead, why then <U+017F>hould you let another <U+017F>hare with you? The enterprize may be done without him, who can re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t you? Therefore Sir, if you will be ruled by me, let him not come, unle<U+017F>s you have a mind to make your <U+017F>elf greater enemies then tho<U+017F>e you have lo<U+017F>t. This was the opinion of the crafty <hi>Climanthes,</hi> with whom the four Confidents concurred, when they were call to Councely and thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient by all means to hide their mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, and to find out <U+017F>ome hand<U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e for it: As that it was not honourable for <U+017F>o great a King to venture his per<U+017F>on for <U+017F>uch a trifle, no nor <U+017F>afe for his crown, it being to be feared, that in his ab<U+017F>en<U+017F>e his <U+017F>ons might rai<U+017F>e commotions in the State.</p>
               <p>After this cour<U+017F>e was re<U+017F>olved upon, and the Cavalier had declared war in the name of the King his ma<U+017F>ter, it was then time to <U+017F>cour up their Arms, and make all preparations without delay: <hi>Climanthes</hi> advi<U+017F>ed, that they <U+017F>hould give him leave to go and <U+017F>peak with the Nymph <hi>Galathea</hi>; for (<U+017F>aid he) if fair means will bring your de<U+017F>ires to pa<U+017F>s, why <U+017F>hould you ruine a Country by war, which is to be your own? I conceive it expedient indeed to have all things in readine<U+017F>s, and if any way take not effect, then within two days after to force tho<U+017F>e feeble walls, which I think will be ea<U+017F>ily done upon the fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault; for I cannot believe they are able to man them: be<U+017F>ides, the party in the Town that is for us, does promi<U+017F>e to open us a Port when we will: <hi>Polemas</hi> was very much again<U+017F>t the going of <hi>Climanthes</hi> unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> thinking it to be too dangerous for him; for (<U+017F>aid he) a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that <hi>Adamas</hi> hath <U+017F>een the Letter which King <hi>Gondebaut</hi> <U+017F>ent unto me, and which was lo<U+017F>t when <hi>Clorantes</hi> was killed; and you <U+017F>ee that they are more <U+017F>trict in their guard of their Town then they are wont to be; therefore I am in fear they know <U+017F>omthing of our de<U+017F>igne; and if they do, you run extream danger of ill treatment, which would be a mo<U+017F>t extream grief to my <U+017F>oul. But <hi>Climanthes</hi> who thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle that none could over-reach him; No, no Sir (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered he) never trouble your <U+017F>elf for me, but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf I <U+017F>hall be cunning enough for them all. The<U+017F>e Nymphs cannot catch me, I warrant you, and had you <U+017F>een and heard them, as I did, you would let that be the lea<U+017F>t of your fears: As for the Letters, I believe they may be intercepted; but though they be, they will not hurt us: If they do not know of the death of <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> I will acquaint them; for it will <U+017F>ooner bring them to our de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>eeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves deprived of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>upport: And if they did know of it, why did they not do me <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief all this while <U+017F>ince <hi>Clorantes</hi> was <U+017F>lain?</p>
               <p>Upon the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>ome others, they re<U+017F>olved to let him go; and if he failed, to fall upon the Town two days after. In order thereunto, <hi>Polemas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his four confidents to have all things in readine<U+017F>s, as well Foot Forces, as Hor<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially the Artillery, which was mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of a Town,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53528:77"/>
and with which they would begin: Al<U+017F>o intelligence was given unto <hi>Meronthes,</hi> who was within the Town, that when they began to compa<U+017F>s the Town about with their Army, he <U+017F>hould open unto them the Port that was towards Mount <hi>Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> which, with his friends he might ea<U+017F>ily do, becau<U+017F>e all the Town<U+017F>men would be <U+017F>o taken up in re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting the A<U+017F><U+017F>ault, as they would be all upon the walls.</p>
               <p>They were all ready to <U+017F>eparate, and take <U+017F>everal orders for all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when <hi>Climanthes</hi> <U+017F>tayed them; What will you <U+017F>ay (<U+017F>aid he unto them) if I make you all ma<U+017F>ters of what you de<U+017F>ire, without a blow? I will <U+017F>ay (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Polemas</hi>) that you are <hi>Climanthes,</hi> that is, the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t and be<U+017F>t contriver of things of any man alive. Then (<U+017F>aid the Impo<U+017F>tor) a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves that within the<U+017F>e three days I will make you po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ors of what you wi<U+017F>h. To day (<U+017F>aid he, and counted the days upon his fingers) King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Cavalier it talking unto <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is</hi>; to morrow I will go and act my part, and the day after <hi>Galathea</hi> is infallibly yours: And thus it will be brought to pa<U+017F>s. I have already told you how extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires to <U+017F>peak with me, to the end (as <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays) <U+017F>he may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her <U+017F>elf unto the Will of that God which <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak by my mouth: I know that what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay, will be mo<U+017F>t exactly ob<U+017F>erved; for I will threaten her with <U+017F>o many horrible puni<U+017F>hments in ca<U+017F>e of di<U+017F>obedience, that I dare lay my life <U+017F>he dares do no other; and my intention is to tell her, that at <U+017F>uch a time <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not fail to be at <hi>Termes,</hi> where the four ways meet, which is not above a mile from the Garden door, and that he whom the Gods have ordained <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould marry, <U+017F>hall be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hall pa<U+017F>s by her in the habit of a Hunter; doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he will come without any company but <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi>; and then, if you <U+017F>eem as if you rode that way to hunt, what will hinder you from taking that Fair Prize? When <hi>Galathea</hi> is in your hands, may you not marry her the next day? Is not your de<U+017F>igne then accompli<U+017F>hed, and the war ended in three days? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) that if you can do as you <U+017F>ay, the work is done; for <U+017F>he being my wife, as I am fully re<U+017F>olved to marry her that very hour, then who can di<U+017F>pute with me for the Seignory of this State? And I promi<U+017F>e you, if ever that happine<U+017F>s come to pa<U+017F>s, I will quickly aboli<U+017F>h that fooli<U+017F>h Law, which excludes males from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power.</p>
               <p>But on the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> were <U+017F>o pitifully affrighted, that they thought the Gho<U+017F>t of <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hunted them continually: <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing of it, went unto them, to put them out of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>imple fears; but for all that they were <U+017F>till <U+017F>o affrighted, that as oft as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was named, they trembled. This were a <U+017F>trange encounter (<U+017F>aid the Druide) if <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>hould turn mad, the <U+017F>ame day that <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> are cured. In the mean time, as they were talking of nothing but this Vi<U+017F>ion in the Ca<U+017F>tle, and many laughing at the Nymphs being <U+017F>o affrighted, a great noi<U+017F>e was heard below in the Court, and looking out, they <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome run one way, and <U+017F>ome another, and <U+017F>aying nothing but <hi>Ligdamon, Ligdamon.</hi> The Nymphs that were with <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> and laughing at them, hearing that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was there, they all fled away as fa<U+017F>t as they could, <U+017F>ome ran to <U+017F>ave them<U+017F>elves in <hi>Galatheas</hi> chamber, and <U+017F>ome into the chamber of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>: As the women were affrighted, <U+017F>o were <U+017F>ome of the men: and the Guard at the Ca<U+017F>tle Gates knowing <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing him to come towards them, whom they thought to be dead; they all ran away, and left the Gates open. <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>eeing every one to run in this manner, was afraid left this panique fear <U+017F>hould be the umbrage of <U+017F>ome Trea<U+017F>on; and therefore going as fa<U+017F>t as he could to the Gates, he found them open, and all the Guard fled, which did much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h him: But <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>ome of his own men coming from the Town, he beckned unto them to make ha<U+017F>te, to <U+017F>hut the Gates, and to guard them till the Souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>And becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>till heard the cry in the Ca<U+017F>tle, he went to <U+017F>ee what was the true cau<U+017F>e of it. In the mean time <hi>Ligdamon</hi> who had cau<U+017F>ed all this terror and confu<U+017F>ion, finding the Gates open, he entred, much wondering to <U+017F>ee every one fly from him, and cry out <U+017F>o pitifully. He knowing all the rooms in the Ca<U+017F>tle, being brought up in it from his Infancy, he went <U+017F>traight unto the chamber of the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>; and becau<U+017F>e the U<U+017F>hers of the Chamber had command to keep
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53528:77"/>
the door <U+017F>hut, they did not only lock it, but al<U+017F>o blocked it up with chairs and tables, <U+017F>o as when <hi>Ligdamon</hi> came he found all fa<U+017F>t, and not daring to be <U+017F>o bold as to knock, he waited until <U+017F>ome came out. The Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> and others, being adverti<U+017F>ed that he was at the door of the Antichamber, they trembled for fear, and one who was the <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t among<U+017F>t them, peeping through the key hole, and <U+017F>eeing it was he, they all fled away, crying it was he, it was he.</p>
               <p>The noi<U+017F>e continued <U+017F>o long, before any had the courage to go out, that <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> who had <U+017F>erved him a long while, and whom <hi>Silvia</hi> ever <U+017F>ince did keep with her, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing from the chamber of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s unto that of the Nymph, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the re<U+017F>t did, through the keyhole, he looked upon him: O good god (<U+017F>aid he) it is my dear Ma<U+017F>ter; and running pre<U+017F>ently out at another door, for they would not let him go out at that, he went unto him: <U+017F>ome of the affrighted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women would have hindred him, telling him his ma<U+017F>ter was dead: I know he is, an<U+017F>wered he, but no matter, I love his <U+017F>oul as well as his body, and am <U+017F>ure that nothing which is his will hurt me. In this re<U+017F>olution this faithful <U+017F>ervant ran to him, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his hand, with <U+017F>uch a flood of tears in his eyes, that he could not utter a word, but ah my dear ma<U+017F>ter: <hi>Ligdamon</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide embraced him with extream contentment, and when he could <U+017F>peak, <hi>Egides</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) what is the rea<U+017F>on that every one thus flies from me? O Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, who can chu<U+017F>e but be affrighted to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o unexpectedly, your death being publi<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me who <U+017F>aw you dead. Why then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> did<U+017F>t not thou <U+017F>hun me as well as the re<U+017F>t?

               <p>The Nymphs all this while, who looked upon them through the key hole and heard them talk, they began to take heart. <hi>Adamas</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time came al<U+017F>o to the door of the antichamber, where finding <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> he was a little <U+017F>uprized, yet <U+017F>till a per<U+017F>on of judgement and re<U+017F>olution: <hi>Ligdamon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) I charge thee in the name of Tautates, that if thou bee<U+017F>t a Gho<U+017F>t, to return unto thy eternal re<U+017F>t, and leave this place in quietne<U+017F>s: Sir (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and <U+017F>miled) I <U+017F>hould be glad to be a Gho<U+017F>t, to meet with that re<U+017F>t which yet I could never find: But know, that I am the very <U+017F>ame <hi>Ligdamon</hi> whom formerly you have <U+017F>een, and whom the great God hath rai<U+017F>ed from death to life, to <U+017F>hew, that as men come into the world by his appointment, <U+017F>o they cannot go out of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be his plea<U+017F>ure: upon this <hi>Adamas</hi> embraced him with open arms, and was extremely joyed, for <hi>Ligdamons</hi> virtue got him<U+017F>elf the love of all.</p>
               <p>At this great noi<U+017F>e, the Prince <hi>Godomar, Alcedon,</hi> and many other Cavaliers, came to the Nymphs chamber door to <U+017F>ee what the matter was: The Nymph hearing that the Prince <hi>Godomar, Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Alcedon,</hi> and many others had <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him, <U+017F>he took courage, and commanded the doors to be <U+017F>et open, but neither <U+017F>he nor <hi>Galathea</hi> would have <U+017F>uffered him to come near, if the Prince <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Adamas</hi> by the other, had not pre<U+017F>ented him unto them Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and humbly kneeled down) that I <U+017F>hould be here in this place taken for another, and not be known to be my <U+017F>elf?

Madam (replied <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) did I not fear I <U+017F>hould
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53528:78"/>
be over tedious, I could tell you how. Well; replied <U+017F>he, I will leave you with <hi>Galathea, Silvia,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies; they have not <U+017F>o much bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as I; pray tell them, and let them relate unto me at night. Upon this, the Nymph, Prince <hi>Godomar, Alcedon,</hi> and <hi>Adamas,</hi> went unto the Queen <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>: and in the mean time <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> after a thou<U+017F>and Care<U+017F><U+017F>es from the Nymphs, he was conducted by <hi>Galathea</hi> unto <hi>Damon,</hi> who was almo<U+017F>t well recovered, and began to walk up and down his chamber, and al<U+017F>o did pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him.</p>
               <p>After all civil complements and <U+017F>alutations, <hi>Galathea</hi> de<U+017F>ired him to tell the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Egides</hi> did fal<U+017F>ly report his death unto <hi>Silvia.</hi> Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, I de<U+017F>ire nothing more then to obey you, but I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly tell you the <U+017F>tory, before I <U+017F>ee her that is the cau<U+017F>e of it. Why? replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> have you not yet <U+017F>een <hi>Silvia</hi>? upon this <U+017F>he commanded <hi>Leonide</hi> to bring her thither: I believe, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> it will be as great a difficulty, as it was this morning to drive the <U+017F>acred nails: Alas (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) is it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to mollifie her obdurate heart, both living and dead? Do not complain (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> and <U+017F>miled) until you have <U+017F>een her: I am afraid Madam, replied he, that <U+017F>ight will make it wor<U+017F>e, and not only hinder me from complaining, but from living. Love, replied the Nymph, does allow that per<U+017F>on to love, who is loved: O Madam, cryed out <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that general does hold in any but in <hi>Silvia,</hi> for never was any more loved then <U+017F>he. Then, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, let it <U+017F>o continue: My affection, replied he, is no le<U+017F>s then an eternity, and I have loved her in the cradle, and in the grave: all this is not enough, replied the Nymph, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he knew as much: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible Madam, replied <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> <U+017F>he can be ignorant of it? both my life and my death hath told her of it. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> that if you do love her well, and that <U+017F>he does perfectly know it, <U+017F>he will pay unto you that tribute which love does exact from all true lovers, provided <U+017F>till you per<U+017F>evere, and be not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was ready to reply, <hi>Silvia</hi> came into the chamber with <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> and with <U+017F>uch a lively a<U+017F>pect, as made it apparent that the return of this Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her, yet with <U+017F>o much mode<U+017F>ty, that <U+017F>he was as much admired for it as for her beauty: for every one had heard that <U+017F>he did extremely grieve and lament his lo<U+017F>s, and at that very time did <U+017F>eem <U+017F>ilently to <U+017F>igh: but now, when again<U+017F>t all her hopes <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him returned, he <U+017F>eemed unto her as a per<U+017F>on only indifferent. When <U+017F>he came fir<U+017F>t into the room, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> looked upon <hi>Galathea,</hi> as if he had begged leave to <U+017F>alute her in her pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
               <p>The Nymph who under<U+017F>tood his looks, did <U+017F>ignifie unto him by her looks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that <U+017F>he would have it <U+017F>o; <U+017F>o as he went immediately unto her, and falling down upon his knees, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand: but <U+017F>he pulled back, as thinking it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility before the Nymph. No, no <hi>Silvia</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>) his return is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and <U+017F>o ought your reception of him to be. <hi>Sylvia</hi> then <U+017F>eeing it was the Nymphs plea<U+017F>ure to have it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he permitted <hi>Ligdamon</hi> to ki<U+017F>s her hand, but not without a blu<U+017F>h, and retiring pre<U+017F>ently among<U+017F>t her companions, did hardly give him time to expre<U+017F>s the continuation of his <U+017F>ervice, and becau<U+017F>e he followed her, <U+017F>eeming very de<U+017F>irous of <U+017F>ome conference, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him in a low voice; if you be the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ligdamon</hi> you were wont to be, take another opportunity of <U+017F>peech with me, and before all this company u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>cretion you were wont to do. Upon this hint, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> making an obedient legg, turned towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> but <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, at the <U+017F>ight of that beauty which was <U+017F>o dear unto him, that he could hardly retire from him: which <hi>Damon</hi> con<U+017F>idering, I believe Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Galathea</hi>) that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> thinks it a hard penance to <U+017F>atisfie your commands, before he has a little longer entertained this fair Nymph, and I perceive by his eyes that he would be di<U+017F>penced with all: if <U+017F>o (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered the Nymph) my curio<U+017F>ity is too great; Madam, replied <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) I have no greater de<U+017F>ire then to obey you in all things, only I be<U+017F>eech you be plea<U+017F>ed that I make as <U+017F>hort a relation as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I can, of <U+017F>uch things as you <U+017F>eem de<U+017F>irous to know: Then after a <U+017F>hort pau<U+017F>e, he began thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Silvia</hi> who all this while took particular notice of every word which <hi>Ligdamon</hi> <U+017F>poke, and every one ca<U+017F>ting their eyes upon her, not being able to endure it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>lipt among<U+017F>t her companions, and as well as <U+017F>he could, got to the door, un<U+017F>een by <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> till <U+017F>he was ju<U+017F>t entring into her chamber, where <U+017F>hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the door after her, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay un<U+017F>een, until this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was ended. In the mean while <hi>Ligdamon</hi> continued thus.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Egides</hi> has been <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>ervant of all my commands, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf Madam, he has related unto you, how I being a Pri<U+017F>oner among<U+017F>t the Neu<U+017F>trians, I was taken for a Cavalier named <hi>Lidias,</hi> whom certainly I did much re<U+017F>emble, <U+017F>ince his own Mother, and all the re<U+017F>t of his Kinred would not be per<U+017F>waded but that I was he. This <hi>Lidias</hi> had killed in a Duel his enemy called <hi>Orontes,</hi> and was condemned for it to lo<U+017F>e his life; and I being taken for him, mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>uffer for his Crime; but the Gods <U+017F>o guided my Sword, that being put into a Den of Lions, I killed two of them, rather by chance then <U+017F>trength. At the <U+017F>ame time, <U+017F>he for whom <hi>Lidias</hi> had fought with <hi>Orontes,</hi> taking me (as all the re<U+017F>t did) for him whom I <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>embled, <U+017F>he came and demanded me for her husband: for it was a cu<U+017F>tomary Law among<U+017F>t all the Gauls, that any woman might take any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned per<U+017F>on for her husband, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ave him.</p>
               <p>By vertue of this Law I was reprieved, and a few days after carried into the Temple to marry her. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s Madam, that my pri<U+017F>on, my <U+017F>entence of death, my combate with Lions, and all my misfortunes, were nothing <U+017F>o intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as this; and therefore when I came into the Temple, and <U+017F>eeing no way to avoid this unfortunate marriage, I re<U+017F>olved to live no longer. Not but that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merina</hi> (that was her name whom I was to marry) was very fair, very wi<U+017F>e, and no way deficient, but I could not violate that fidelity which I had vowed unto the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> without thinking my <U+017F>elf worthy of death. Some few days before, I had provided a certain kind of wine, <U+017F>o mixed, as might be a draught of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate death; I drunk a full gla<U+017F>s of this mortal potion, and before I was aware, <U+017F>o did <hi>Amerina</hi> al<U+017F>o: by force of which, with a firm opinion that it was poy<U+017F>on, I fell down as dead, and pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Amerina</hi> al<U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>I believe Madam, that <hi>Egides</hi> might relate my fortune thus far, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all afterwards was unknown unto him; for he went away immediately, as well to perform all my commands, as to be out of that place where he had received <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a lo<U+017F>s. Now you mu<U+017F>t know that this <hi>Amerina,</hi> and this <hi>Lideas,</hi> were of them of the be<U+017F>t Families among<U+017F>t all the Neu<U+017F>trians, and exceedingly beloved and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <U+017F>o as the noi<U+017F>e of this accident was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>pread through all <hi>Rothomagues,</hi> and the Temple was <U+017F>o full of people, that one could hardly <U+017F>tir in it: for it was an accident of <U+017F>uch admiration, as moved every one to come and <U+017F>ee us. They had laid us upon the ground one by another, and ca<U+017F>t a cloth over our faces, whil<U+017F>t all about us wept, <U+017F>ome for love, <U+017F>ome for pity, and many for company. They were ready to carry us into a Vault, where the Ance<U+017F>tors of <hi>Amerina</hi> and <hi>Lideas</hi> were entombed, when a Phy<U+017F>itian came thru<U+017F>ting through the croud, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto one that <U+017F>tood by us: Friend (<U+017F>aid he in a loud voice) is this <hi>Lidies</hi> who lies under that cloth? The <U+017F>ame, an<U+017F>wered the man. By what accident did

he die? asked the Phy<U+017F>itian: Alas (an<U+017F>wered he) both he, and this woman who lies by him, did voluntarily poy<U+017F>on them<U+017F>elves. No, no (<U+017F>aid the Phy<U+017F>itian) they are not dead; let <U+017F>ome water and vinegar be fetched, and by the help of <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> I <U+017F>hall recover them.</p>
               <p>Many were ready to run for the<U+017F>e remedies; and when they were brought, the Phy<U+017F>itian rubbed our Temples with Vinegar, and put <U+017F>ome into our No<U+017F>es, and afterwards threw water into our faces: This did awake us pre<U+017F>ently, as out of a deep <U+017F>leep, but <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, that we knew not where we were: the candles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us (for it was grown night) and the admiration of all the people who came to <U+017F>ee us, that for half an hour together we <U+017F>till <U+017F>eemed to be out of our wits: At la<U+017F>t we were carried to our Lodgings, where we under<U+017F>tood from the Phy<U+017F>itian, that it was he from whom I had the potion; and becau<U+017F>e he feared I intended <U+017F>ome hurt, in lieu of poy<U+017F>on, he gave this Dormative, for which he was much commended by all that heard him: But though this compo<U+017F>ition was not mortal, yet it made us very ill many days, and <hi>Anderina</hi> wor<U+017F>e then I, being of a weaker con<U+017F>titution.</p>
               <p>This <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s was a great contentment unto me; for it gave me time to think what I <U+017F>hould do. <hi>Amerinas</hi> kinred were all extreamly offended that I <U+017F>hould rather chu<U+017F>e death, then living with their Co<U+017F>in; conceiving that this di<U+017F>dain could proceed from no other cau<U+017F>e but from an ill opinion which I had of <hi>Amerina</hi>; <U+017F>o as addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves unto her, they asked her what occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had given me to hate her <U+017F>o extreamly? And told her, that our Qualities were equal, that <U+017F>he had given me my life, and that formerly I loved her <U+017F>o very pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, as they could not imagine that this alteration in me, proceeded from <U+017F>ome fault which I had di<U+017F>covered in her, and that it could be no le<U+017F>s then the lo<U+017F>s of her honour, if it were <U+017F>o; and that if they came to know of it, let her expect no le<U+017F>s then <U+017F>evere puni<U+017F>hment for being a <U+017F>tain unto a Family <U+017F>o noble: They added many other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, unto which <hi>Amerina</hi> an<U+017F>wered rather with tears then words, yet excu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf from all tho<U+017F>e imputations as well as <U+017F>he could, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her <U+017F>elf that her innocence would defend her again<U+017F>t all calumny; <U+017F>o as the next morning <U+017F>he came unto me, and acquainted me with all the<U+017F>e reproaches of her kinred: By fortune, my thoughts were at that time upon <hi>Silvia,</hi> and grieving at her ab<U+017F>en<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o loud, that when <U+017F>he came to the door, <U+017F>he heard me complain of my ab<U+017F>en<U+017F>e from her, and name <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>everal times.</p>

               <p>Several other promi<U+017F>es and vows did <U+017F>econd the fir<U+017F>t, after which we con<U+017F>ulted of the means how to take our journey <U+017F>ecretly.

               <p>But Madam, be plea<U+017F>ed to hear of a new di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, which to my <U+017F>orrow befell us. About the hight of the day, when the <U+017F>un was extremely hot, <hi>Amerina</hi> not u<U+017F>ed to travel grew very weary: <U+017F>o finding a hand<U+017F>ome <U+017F>hade by the way <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired me to let her re<U+017F>t: I, who did very much honour and e<U+017F>teem this Lady, did lay <U+017F>ome of my clothes under her, left <U+017F>itting upon the ground might cau<U+017F>e her to catch a cold, and <U+017F>haded her as well as I could with boughs, from the <U+017F>cortching heat of the <U+017F>un; and went a little di<U+017F>tance from her, to get <U+017F>ome more fre<U+017F>h branches. I was no <U+017F>ooner gone <U+017F>ome twenty paces from her, but a young Cavalier lighted from his hor<U+017F>e, near the place where <hi>Amarina</hi> was, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to re<U+017F>t there until the day was a little cooler: he tyed his hor<U+017F>e unto a tree, and <U+017F>o as he might gra<U+017F>e, but not without great need, for he looked to be <U+017F>o lank and faint, that one might ea<U+017F>ily judge his ma<U+017F>ter had rid him a long journey. In the mean time I returned unto <hi>Amerina,</hi> and never minding this young man, brought tho<U+017F>e branches which I had gotten, and went to get <U+017F>ome more: he in the mean time, after he had tied his hor<U+017F>e and looked about him, he <U+017F>pied <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> towards whom he went, and with a hand<U+017F>ome becoming civility, asked her if it would not be too great a trouble unto her, if he enjoyed part of that <U+017F>hade where <U+017F>he was. <hi>Amerina</hi> knew by his tone that he was a <U+017F>tranger, and finding much mode<U+017F>ty in his looks and garb, <U+017F>he offered him the conveniency of the place.</p>
               <p>He was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et upon the <U+017F>tump of an old tree, but I returned, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that as <U+017F>oon as he ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me, he changed colour, and was <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that he knew not what to do, but <U+017F>lunk away: but hearing him <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Amerina,</hi> I knew by his tongue he was neither Frank nor Gaul, and thought that he had an opinion, I would di<U+017F>like his intru<U+017F>ion <U+017F>o near <hi>Amerina</hi>; <U+017F>o as minding him no more, I talked unto <hi>Amerina,</hi> and asked her how <U+017F>he did, and whither <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>leep.

Then <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you <U+017F>hall be my Guardian <U+017F>o I made her a pillow of <U+017F>ome of my clothes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her face with my handkerchief, then <U+017F>et my <U+017F>elf down by her. Mean time, the young man was got a good di<U+017F>tance off: I took notice that he pulled his hat over his eyes, <U+017F>tamped upon the ground with his foot, cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed his arms, looked up towards heaven, and often ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me; then would he bite his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lay his hand upon his <U+017F>word, walk two or three paces towards us, and turn back upon a <U+017F>udden, u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch raptive ge<U+017F>tures, as I thought him either mad, or el<U+017F>e had <U+017F>ome que<U+017F>tions of quarrelling importance to ask me: yet I <U+017F>eemed to take no notice, but kept my <U+017F>elf clo<U+017F>e and ob<U+017F>erved what he did.</p>

and coming to him, asked him what he would have with me; but he without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning any an<U+017F>wer, looked earne<U+017F>tly upon me, and going back again, made a <U+017F>igne with his hand that I <U+017F>hould follow him; which I told him I would, but would not go far from that Lady: he looking upon me with eyes of fire, Does that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (<U+017F>aid he) hinder thee from re<U+017F>toring that which thou owe<U+017F>t unto me, thou wicked and perfideous man?

               <p>I ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>Amerina</hi> from time to time looked back unto the place from whence we came; and after a two hours walk, when we were almo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e to the Town of <hi>Neomagues,</hi> one of the prime Cities of the Ambarres, <U+017F>ix Souldiers upon full gallop overtook us, and carried us away pri<U+017F>oners: where <hi>Amerinas</hi> wit appeared to be mo<U+017F>t admirable; for undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained me to change clothes with her: for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if the man be not dead, when he <U+017F>ees me, doubtle<U+017F>s he will <U+017F>ay that it was not I who wounded him, and <U+017F>o we <U+017F>hall be relea<U+017F>ed. Now <U+017F>o it chanced, that a while after we had left this <U+017F>tranger, the Governour of that Province pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Place where this Duel was fought, and asking <U+017F>ome Shepherds which <U+017F>aw the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, who it was that committed this murder, he under<U+017F>tood that it was two per<U+017F>ons who went towards <hi>Neomagues,</hi> and on foot: The Governour being de<U+017F>irous to do Ju<U+017F>tice, di<U+017F>patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>ix of his Guard to <U+017F>eize upon us, as they did; and in the mean time, cau<U+017F>ed the Corps to be carried away, with intention to bury it: but being only in a <U+017F>woon, as <U+017F>oon as they began to undre<U+017F>s him, he revived; <U+017F>o as they bound up his wound, and <U+017F>et him upon his own hor<U+017F>e, with one to hold him, left he <U+017F>hould faint again, and fall.</p>
               <p>He was no <U+017F>ooner upon Hor<U+017F>eback, but <U+017F>eeing a young man riding fa<U+017F>t upon the way, oh (<U+017F>aid the young <U+017F>tranger) yonder's the man who did me the wrong. Some that heard the<U+017F>e words, acquainted the Governour, yet not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, but the young man, who had a very good hor<U+017F>e, and rid very fa<U+017F>t, was got a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance off; <U+017F>o as do what they could, they could not <U+017F>eize upon him, till he was entred the Town: but enquiring at the Gates where he lodged, he was no <U+017F>ooner alighted, but they took him, and brought him to the pri<U+017F>on where we were, yet into another chamber; and we were adverti<U+017F>ed of it by the Goaler, at night when he brought us our meat: But I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, I was never in all my life more grieved, then when I <U+017F>aw them fetter with Irons the feet and hands of the fair <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merina,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially when I con<U+017F>idered that it was for my <U+017F>ake <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered: yet <U+017F>he took them with incomparable courage, and ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch an eye upon me, as intimated

that all chains and fetters for my <U+017F>ake were welcome unto her: But indeed, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that they intended to <U+017F>eparate us, <U+017F>he began to be <U+017F>omthing troubled, as well becau<U+017F>e it grieved her to be ab<U+017F>ent from me, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was to <U+017F>tay alone in that place; which made me u<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible endeavours to prevent it: I u<U+017F>ed all my Rhethorique and Prayers that we might keep together, for we <U+017F>aid that we were man and wife: but the man was no more moved with any prayers, or tears, then if he had been a Rock: I offered him to put as many fetters upon my hands and feet as he plea<U+017F>ed, I kneeled unto him, held up my hands, would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his feet, but all would not do any good: At la<U+017F>t, remembring that gifts will <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <U+017F>trike a thunderbolt out of the hand of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> I took a very fair Diamond from off my finger, and pre<U+017F>ented it unto him, be<U+017F>eeching him to take that in part of what we intended to do for him: He took this te<U+017F>timony of our good will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly; and I pre<U+017F>ently perceived, that the lu<U+017F>ter of the <U+017F>tone did begin to mollifie his obdurate temper: And after he had looked well upon it, I perceive (<U+017F>aid he) that you de<U+017F>erve to have <U+017F>ome favour <U+017F>hewed unto you; I pity your condition, and am <U+017F>orry your affections to each other <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>eparated; but though I have command to <U+017F>ever you, yet I will not this night: yet do not think it is becau<U+017F>e of this ring which you have given me, but becau<U+017F>e I know by your faces that you are not guilty of this crime whereof you are accu<U+017F>ed; for we can tell at the very fir<U+017F>t fight who are criminal, and can read their faults in their very eyes. After this he went away, and pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ent us a good Feather-bed, and good Bed-clothes, with <U+017F>o many kind expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as we could not chu<U+017F>e but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that a heart which was as hard as any <U+017F>tone, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>oftned <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly by gifts. After the door was <U+017F>hut, and I think a hundred locks upon it, <hi>Amerina</hi> after a deep <U+017F>igh, Friend (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, for I lay upon a Matteras a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s;tant from her,) are you yet a<U+017F>leep?

But (replyed I) would you have me leave you alone in this condition? Friend (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) the condition wherein I am, would be plea<U+017F>ing unto me, were it not for my fears of you; and the<U+017F>e chains and fetters, <U+017F>ince for your <U+017F>ake, would be more <U+017F>weet and welcome to me, were I certain of your <U+017F>afety: in lieu of hating them, I would ki<U+017F>s them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and them, <U+017F>ince by them I can te<U+017F>tifie the extream affection which I bear unto you. But tell me, dear friend, when you are gone from hence, will you ever think upon <hi>Amerina?</hi> Will it not come into your thoughts that <hi>Silvia</hi> cannot love you <U+017F>o well as I? Oh how great would be my felicity if it <U+017F>hould? But Friend, I will not oblige you unto <U+017F>o much; only promi<U+017F>e me, that in the mid<U+017F>t of all your contentments, you will give me leave to love you, and that you will not call my affection trouble<U+017F>ome, nor be weary of it: Upon this condition go, and enjoy the felicities of that happy <hi>Silvia</hi>; and tell her amid<U+017F>t all the kind embraces which you receive from her, that it was poor <hi>Amerina</hi> which pre<U+017F>erved <hi>Lidias</hi> for her.</p>
               <p>She would have talked more, if tears and <U+017F>ighs would have <U+017F>uffered her; which moved me to <U+017F>o much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that to comfort her, I went nearer unto her; as well to oblige her by it, as to avoid being heard by any, having heard, that <U+017F>omtimes walls have ears. Fir<U+017F>t I fell upon my knees by her Bed-<U+017F>ide, and taking her hand, which I found fettered, I offered to ki<U+017F>s it; but <U+017F>he pulling it back, cau<U+017F>ed me to <U+017F>it down by her, and then I <U+017F>aid unto her.</p>

To be brief, I am fully re<U+017F>olved to imploy that life which you have given me, in giving you all the contentment you de<U+017F>ire, and never to think my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>atisfied and contended, until you be. Will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e me (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) to ob<U+017F>erve all the<U+017F>e conditions mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly? I <U+017F>wear it (<U+017F>aid I unto her) by all that's <U+017F>acred: and may all the cur<U+017F>es of heaven and earth fall upon me, if I be for<U+017F>worn. Then (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) give me your hand: I <U+017F>wear al<U+017F>o to receive your promi<U+017F>es, and declare, that until <U+017F>uch time as you can give full <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I will be contented, and think my <U+017F>elf well paid for what I have done: Nay more, I will for ever love you, and upon all occa<U+017F>ions what<U+017F>oever, oblige you more for the future then I have for the time pa<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Thus was the mind of <hi>Amerina</hi> calmed, which was no <U+017F>mall advantage to me, for I believe if I had left her in that rage, <U+017F>he might perhaps, out of <U+017F>pite, have di<U+017F>covered all that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>o have ruin'd me and her <U+017F>elf too. But on the contrary, after all the<U+017F>e conditions, <U+017F>he was urgent with me to be gone the next morning, and that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay for her in the fir<U+017F>t Town of the Segu<U+017F>ian Countrey. I urged my <U+017F>orrows to leave her in that condition, but <U+017F>he told me that as for her, <U+017F>he could not be in any great danger, for come the wor<U+017F>t that could, <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ay that I was her husband, and to help me away, <U+017F>he lent me her clothes: That be<U+017F>ides, there was another <U+017F>tranger already accu<U+017F>ed, and that when the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>aw her, he would know <U+017F>he was not the <U+017F>ame that wounded him: That <U+017F>he was not the fir<U+017F>t wife who helped her husband to e<U+017F>cape in her clothes.</p>
               <p>To be brief, <U+017F>he per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>o, that I re<U+017F>olved to be gone in the morning: So as in order thereunto, when the Goaler came to vi<U+017F>it us, I told him that I had a great de<U+017F>ire to provide <U+017F>ome good meat for my husband, al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>ired him to dine with us, and therefore prayed him to let me go into the market to buy it. He who was already well prepared with the diamond that I gave him, and hoped for more, you may go, <U+017F>aid he, whether you plea<U+017F>e; for it is not you that is accu<U+017F>ed for wounding the man, but it is your husband, and I have no warrant to keep you pri<U+017F>oner, but him only, <U+017F>o as the door <U+017F>hall be open unto you when you plea<U+017F>e: I thanked him for his courte<U+017F>y, and promi<U+017F>ed acknowledgment. I went then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Amerina,</hi> and under a pretence of asking her what <U+017F>he would have to dinner, I told her that I would <U+017F>tay at a private place upon the high way, called Pacodiere, near a Segu<U+017F>ian Town called <hi>Cro<U+017F><U+017F>et:</hi> that in the mid<U+017F>t of that Town there is ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a pillar which divides four wayes: that upon this pillar <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould find the fir<U+017F>t letter of my name, and the place where I lodged: And pre<U+017F>ently, without any ceremonious taking of leave, I went away; but I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears in my eyes. The Goaler opened the doores, and told me where I might buy any thing I de<U+017F>ired, <U+017F>o as I left him in expectation of a good dinner.</p>
               <p>I was no <U+017F>ooner at liberty, but leaving the way of Gergovia, I went towards De<U+017F>ires, up the river Loyre; and though I was in womans habit, yet I was <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee my native Countrey, and <U+017F>o fearful to be taken in the Dominions of of the King of Ambaries and Boyers, that the fourth day I came to Pacodiere. There I <U+017F>tayed ten dayes, in which time I changed my habit, and hearing no news of <hi>Amerina</hi> all that while, I de<U+017F>ired the good woman of the hou<U+017F>e where I lodged,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53528:82"/>
who entertained me very kindly, to watch when <hi>Amerina</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, and to give her tho<U+017F>e clothes which I wore; and al<U+017F>o to tell her, that <U+017F>uch urgent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s befel me, as I was forced to go unto the great City of <hi>Marcelles.</hi> And indeed Madam, the rea<U+017F>on why I <U+017F>tayed there no longer, was, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <U+017F>pread up and down all the Country of an en<U+017F>uing War, and I did <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>ome li<U+017F>ted Souldiers <U+017F>ecretly about <hi>Surcea,</hi> <U+017F>o as I thought it my duty to pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf unto you Madam, upon this occa<U+017F>ion, and employ my life in your <U+017F>ervice, as I was obliged.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Ligdamon</hi> relate his fortune, whil<U+017F>t the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Prince <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> went unto the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with the Nymph and the Prince, before <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved upon her journey. She told them, that for the favour which <U+017F>he had received from the Gods in the re<U+017F>titution of her Son to his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, <U+017F>he could never be thankful enough unto them, and all tho<U+017F>e that were in<U+017F>trumental in it: But <U+017F>he was afraid left <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilions</hi> malady being only a wounded imagination, he <U+017F>hould return into it again: And therefore (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I thought good to tell him, that it was cau<U+017F>ed by Inchantment, and that Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> di<U+017F>-enchanted him; for he did no more remember any thing that was pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince his di<U+017F>traction, then a childe in the cradle: I thought it therefore expedient, as well upon this con<U+017F>ideration, as for the pre<U+017F>ervation of his Reputation, not to let him be known here, but to carry him away <U+017F>ecretly, as he came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> then upon the Nymphs command, repre<U+017F>ented unto her the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> and <U+017F>he received at that <U+017F>atisfaction which <U+017F>he found in her journey: That it was very prudently con<U+017F>idered of her, to carry away the Prince <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>: But before her departure, it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the ob<U+017F>ervation of that <U+017F>olemn Vow which <U+017F>he had publiquely made, that <U+017F>he knew the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that State was, which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>worn to pre<U+017F>erve and defend. Upon this he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with the enterpri<U+017F>e of <hi>Polemas,</hi> with his corre<U+017F>pondencies with his Neighbour Princes, e<U+017F>pecially with the Burgundian King; with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that King had promi<U+017F>ed unto him; with his pretended offence again<U+017F>t Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> and <hi>Dorinde</hi>; with the death of Prince <hi>Clidemant,</hi> with the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Lindamore</hi> and his Forces: Briefly, the Druide omitted nothing that was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted unto her: <U+017F>o as Madam (concluded he) if you do not a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Nymph, as you have voluntarily obliged your <U+017F>elf by <U+017F>olemn vow, I know not what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her.</p>
               <p>The Queen then who gave a very attentive ear unto all this, turning towards the Nymph, I am very glad Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) to know all that this great Druide hath related unto me, that I may te<U+017F>tifie unto the Gods and you, how I can keep my promi<U+017F>e: It <U+017F>eems to be the will of heaven my <U+017F>on <U+017F>hould receive this favour from this place purpo<U+017F>ely to intere<U+017F>t him and me al<U+017F>o in your affairs. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that if you will give me but a moneths time, I will bring <U+017F>o many fighting armed men into the field, as though the King of the Burgundians be a great Prince, yet he <U+017F>hall not be able to hurt you.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the Nymph was returning thanks, and the Queen confirming her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e of pre<U+017F>ent aid, one came and acquainted the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> that a Boyen Cavalier was come unto her from King <hi>Policander.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as the Queen <U+017F>aw him; what News (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) do you bring me from the King? Not good (an<U+017F>wered he) but Madam, he does pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee you. Upon this he pre<U+017F>ented King <hi>Policanders</hi> Letter unto her. The Queen took it with a troubled hand, and with extream inquietude broke open the Seal; <U+017F>he read it, and then with tears in her eyes <U+017F>hewed it unto the Nymph, who read the<U+017F>e words.</p>

                     <p>DEath is a thing <U+017F>o natural and common, that it never troubles me; but to die before I <U+017F>ee you, does extreamly perplex my <U+017F>oul: becau<U+017F>e I would gladly di<U+017F>charge my <U+017F>elf of that Debt and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I owe unto you.

               <p>Oh Heavens! cryed out the Queen, great joys are commonly followed with great <U+017F>orrows. Then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf to the Cavalier, <U+017F>he enquired of the Kings <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, &amp; what the Phy<U+017F>itians thought of him: She under<U+017F>tood that they thought him in great danger of his life, and that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t make ha<U+017F>te, if <U+017F>he came time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <U+017F>ee him alive.</p>

Then (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) I <U+017F>hall talk with you after another fa<U+017F>hion: Tell therefore unto King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> that as for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> my Dominions <U+017F>hall be always free unto any that are oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: And as for Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> it is not he that is in my Dominions, but I that am in his, he being the ab<U+017F>olute Lord of all the Segu<U+017F>ians, and of all Forre<U+017F>ts. As for the war which he threatens upon me, tell him, that it is men indeed who begins wars, but it is the Gods only who gives victories, and in that confidence I fear not the inju<U+017F>tice of his Arms.</p>
               <p>Thus <U+017F>poke the Nymph, and all that heard her applauded her courage: when <hi>Godomar</hi> <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he had no more to <U+017F>ay; for my part (<U+017F>aid he) tell the King, that though he di<U+017F>-own me for his Son, yet I will never do any act that <U+017F>hall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Name; and to te<U+017F>tifie the truth of what I <U+017F>ay, tell him, that as long as this <U+017F>word will la<U+017F>t, I will defend the honour of <U+017F>uch Ladies as are unju<U+017F>tly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and maliciou<U+017F>ly a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Dorinde,</hi> whom I take into my protection, I will defend her with my <U+017F>word in my hand, again<U+017F>t any that will offer to wrong her: And if there be any that carries the Title of Cavalier, who will <U+017F>peak any ill of her, or maintain the words which you have <U+017F>poke again<U+017F>t her, or again<U+017F>t us, who have delivered her out of the hands of tho<U+017F>e who would injuriou<U+017F>ly have carried her away, here is a pawn (<U+017F>aid he, and gave him his Glove) which imports a challenge; I except again<U+017F>t none but the King my Father; knowing very well, that Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will arm him<U+017F>elf with me in the <U+017F>ame quarrel, if Paternal authority do not oppre<U+017F>s him.</p>
               <p>As for war, which he threatens upon this great Nymph; tell him, I be<U+017F>eech one thing from him, which is, that he will not come him<U+017F>elf, unle<U+017F>s he have a mind to <U+017F>ee his Army back'd in pieces before his face: but if he have a mind to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53528:84"/>
be rid of any bad <U+017F>ervants, he may <U+017F>end them hither, and we <U+017F>hall quickly di<U+017F>charge him of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alerantes</hi> turning towards the Nymph, Madam (<U+017F>aid he) Is this all the <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I mu<U+017F>t carry unto the King my Ma<U+017F>ter? If King <hi>Gondebaut</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) be not contented with the<U+017F>e an<U+017F>wers, tell him, he could expect no other from <U+017F>uch as he would oppre<U+017F>s, and who yet fears not the violence of his unju<U+017F>t Arms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he threatens a woman. I would not willingly (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alerantes</hi>) make this declaration; but <U+017F>ince you do <U+017F>o little e<U+017F>teem the grandeur of the King, my Lord, and <U+017F>o much <U+017F>light the clemency which he offers, I mu<U+017F>t let you know from him, that he is your mortal enemy; that he does defie you, and all that adhere unto you; that he declares the Segu<U+017F>ians, and all Forre<U+017F>ts, to be an enemies Country, and therefore liable to the plunder and inevitable fury of his Army. As he <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words, he broke a <U+017F>taff which he held in his hand in the mid<U+017F>t, and threw the pieces at the feet of the Nymph: Thus (<U+017F>aid he) in the pre<U+017F>ence of Gods and men, be all amity broke of betwixt you for ever. The Nymph enraged with anger, and <U+017F>etting her foot upon the broken <U+017F>taff; and thus (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do I trample upon this emblem of our broken alliance; I do not value any of his thundring threats, but hope that <hi>Tautates</hi> will bla<U+017F>t them all.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Alerantes</hi> without doing any reverence, or any action of re<U+017F>pect or honour, retired; when <hi>Godomar</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him, what an<U+017F>wer do you give unto the challenge which I offered? We <U+017F>hall come ere long (an<U+017F>wered he) with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of three<U+017F>core thou<U+017F>and men. That (<U+017F>aid the Prince) is either too many, or too few: Too many for a particular combate; and too few to fight again<U+017F>t the Ju<U+017F>tice of the Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alerantes</hi> returned him no an<U+017F>wer, but <U+017F>haking his head in a menacing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he went out of the Ca<U+017F>tle, and taking hor<U+017F>e, when he was <U+017F>ome twenty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the Town, he made a <U+017F>top, and turned about<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Oh ye titular Gods of the City of <hi>Marcelles</hi> (cryed he out in a loud voice) and all ye other Gods and Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es who are here adored, I be<U+017F>eech you be au<U+017F>picious unto the Arms of the King my Lord, and be plea<U+017F>ed to come into the Royal City of <hi>Lions</hi> where he vows to build you a Temple, to erect Altars, and adore you with all manner of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Honour. When he had repeated the<U+017F>e words thrice over, he took a Javelin, and ran with all his force again<U+017F>t the walls of the Town, then <U+017F>etting <U+017F>purs to his Hor<U+017F>e, he rid as fa<U+017F>t as he could unto the <U+017F>ix Troops which waited for him.</p>
               <p>This action incen<U+017F>ed the people extreamly; and had not <hi>Adamas</hi> re<U+017F>trained them, doubtle<U+017F>s they would have done him <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; but he told them, that Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors were no ways culpable of the me<U+017F><U+017F>age they brought, nor de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any puni<U+017F>hment; and that by the Law of Nations, they were to pa<U+017F>s freely. And <U+017F>eeing all the City much <U+017F>tartled at the noi<U+017F>e of this war, he advi<U+017F>ed the chief Magi<U+017F>trates to appea<U+017F>e this Tumult wi<U+017F>ely; and becau<U+017F>e it was now too late to a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble the whole Corporation of the Town together, the Nymph would to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row acquaint them with the cau<U+017F>es of all the<U+017F>e rumors. The<U+017F>e prudent promi<U+017F>es of the Druide, did a little calm their <U+017F>pirits; and doubling the Guards, he went unto the Ca<U+017F>tle, to advi<U+017F>e with the Nymph and Prince <hi>Godomar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He came thither ju<U+017F>t as <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> was upon his knees before that Prince to ki<U+017F>s his hand, in gratitude for the favour he received from him. <hi>Godomar</hi> took him up, and carried him unto <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Alcidon.</hi> Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Damon</hi>) Here is the Shepherd unto whom the Gods have been <U+017F>o favourable.

               <p>He uttered the<U+017F>e words, in <U+017F>uch an imperious tone, as if a god him<U+017F>elf had pronounced them: Then changing his behaviour and a<U+017F><U+017F>uming his accu<U+017F>tomed countenance and <U+017F>peech, he continued: Now, O great Nymph, you know the will of heaven, be more careful to ob<U+017F>erve it then formerly you have been, for otherwi<U+017F>e, the anger of this great God will overwhelme you.

               <p>The gravity wherewith he menaced them hitherto, began to be more mild and calm, and now he fell to prayers and <U+017F>upplications: Sirs (<U+017F>aid he unto them) what offences have I given unto you? why <U+017F>hould you be <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere again<U+017F>t me? what advantage will my ruine be unto you?

               <p>The chief of them in the mean time, and the mo<U+017F>t notable, did not remove until they heard all that <hi>Adamas</hi> had to <U+017F>ay unto them from the Nymph: And when <hi>Adamas</hi> had done, <hi>Clindor</hi> who for his Age, Quality, and Prudence, all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly made choice of to give the an<U+017F>wer, he <U+017F>poke in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>THe lo<U+017F>s Madam, which you have had, does not concern only one Per<U+017F>on, or one Family, but it is general, and not only all this Country has a <U+017F>hare in it, but al<U+017F>o all the Gauls, nay all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope may bewail the lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o great a Prince. You <U+017F>ee how our Tears and our Groans do accompany your grief, and how we give you this outward te<U+017F>timony of the inward re<U+017F>entment of our Souls: I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s all this is but a feeble remedy again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter; yet it may be <U+017F>ome comfort unto you to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>adly all your faithful Subjects do take unto them<U+017F>elves a <U+017F>hare in all your griefs and misfortunes. But Madam, we mu<U+017F>t all needs confe<U+017F>s, that this <U+017F>econd News which you have told us, does pierce us to the very heart, with more <U+017F>tinging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entments then the fir<U+017F>t: For the death of a Prince whom none of us did ever think mortal, unle<U+017F>s in his Reputation and Honour, is not <U+017F>o hard to be endured, as is the <U+017F>tain of Perfidie and Trea<U+017F>on upon this Country, which before was never <U+017F>een, nor <U+017F>o much as imagined. Oh Heavens! Madam, that <U+017F>uch Mon<U+017F>ters <U+017F>hould be found in Forre<U+017F>ts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t us, and in our days: I wonder our Earth (unaccu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch an ignominious burthen) does not <U+017F>wallow them up alive. We know not what to <U+017F>ay, nor think, unle<U+017F>s that Heaven being offended at us for our <U+017F>ins, will puni<U+017F>h us more grievou<U+017F>ly then all ages pa<U+017F>t. This <U+017F>tain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us does <U+017F>well us with <U+017F>o much grief, as we cannot lift up our eyes to weep, nor open our mouths to lament and <U+017F>igh for <U+017F>o great a <U+017F>hame. Yet <U+017F>ince the good ought not to be charged with the crimes of the wicked, we will lift up our eyes unto you, Madam, and <U+017F>peak in behalf of this Town, and we dare <U+017F>ay of all the Country, if we had time to confer with them. Madam, as becomes your faithful Subjects, we do offer unto you all that is within the<U+017F>e Walls, our E<U+017F>tates, our Children, our Blood, our Lives: Prote<U+017F>ting before</hi> He<U+017F>us, Belinus, Tharamis, <hi>our great</hi> Tautates, <hi>that as long as we live, and as long as you live, we will not have any Soveraign over us but</hi> Ama<U+017F>is: <hi>And we will as <U+017F>oon fail in our Duties to the Gods, as in our Fealty to you, not <U+017F>paring either E<U+017F>tates, Children, or Lives: And in te<U+017F>tification of this, let every one lift up his hand and his heart, and cry, Long live the Nymph</hi> Ama<U+017F>is.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the hands of all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly were <U+017F>een above their heads, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hout that it was heard further then all over the Town.</p>
               <p>As the Nymph was returning them hearty thanks for the demon<U+017F>trations of their good wills, <hi>Adamas</hi> was adverti<U+017F>ed that the <U+017F>ouldiers which had been levied in the province were very near the gates, which cau<U+017F>ed the Nymph to abreviate her <U+017F>peech, that <U+017F>he might view this welcome and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>uccour.

imagined that they came upon the Ceremony of the Mi<U+017F>leto, <U+017F>o as they had trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up them<U+017F>elves to the be<U+017F>t advantage. Thus all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly parted with <U+017F>uch extream forwardne<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve the Nymph, that <U+017F>he was exceedingly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> cau<U+017F>ing the gates to be opened, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in <U+017F>uch an excellent po<U+017F>ture, that all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw them, thought them to be men of very good <U+017F>ervice, all their caps were crowned with oak leaves, for <U+017F>o was the cu<U+017F>tome of all tho<U+017F>e that were called to the Ceremony, as they were. They were no <U+017F>ooner drawn up into a body, but they were appointed Captains, Lieutenants, and other military officers, unto whom they were to be obedient, pre<U+017F>ently after, they were di<U+017F>tributed into quarters, as well for the defence of the walls, as to guard the <U+017F>treets and pa<U+017F><U+017F>es in the Town. Then taking a view of all the hor<U+017F>e, counting tho<U+017F>e which the Queen <hi>Argira</hi> left, and tho<U+017F>e which Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> brought, the number was two hundred and fifty, which al<U+017F>o were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five troops, fifty in each; all the foot were put under charge of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who not being perfectly recovered of his wounds, could hardly wear arms or get on hor<U+017F>eback, yet he went into the Town, and vi<U+017F>ited the walls and works. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Alcedon</hi> had the charge of all the hor<U+017F>e, and put them into as good a po<U+017F>ture as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could be. In the mean time Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> who was general, did vi<U+017F>it the Magazines both in the Ca<U+017F>tle and Town, and by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent advice of <hi>Adamas,</hi> provided all things which he could fore<U+017F>ee nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occa<U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Polemas</hi> was <U+017F>o proud of his price, that he thought upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing le<U+017F>s already, then the <U+017F>ump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O how dead was he then <U+017F>truck? which <hi>Leonide</hi> perceiving, and de<U+017F>iring if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to deceive the deceiver, <U+017F>he took him by one hand and <hi>Silvia</hi> by another, O <hi>Polemas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you had committed the greate<U+017F>t errour that ever you did in all your life, and if he who carried me away behind him, would have <U+017F>uffered me to have <U+017F>poke unto you, as I de<U+017F>ired him a hundred times, I had prevented it. For this morning a Druide (if it be lawful to call <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred a per<U+017F>on by that name) came unto <hi>Galathea</hi> from his God, to command her to marry him, whom at <U+017F>even of the clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee pa<U+017F>s by the four wayes at <hi>Termes</hi>: and if <U+017F>he did not, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her <U+017F>elf that all the re<U+017F>t of her dayes <U+017F>hould be mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable, and <U+017F>he the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate woman in the world: The Nymph <U+017F>he made a full account to go, and be obedient unto this command, rather then be mi<U+017F>erable all her life; but when <U+017F>he was ju<U+017F>t ready to go out, <U+017F>he fell <U+017F>ick and was forced to go to bed: But yet being extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know him that was de<U+017F>tinied to be her husband, <U+017F>he commanded us to go thither, and tell her the name and quality of him that pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed by the fir<U+017F>t, thinking that him whom the gods did chu<U+017F>e for her to be her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was a better choi<U+017F>e then <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf could make. I <U+017F>ay therefore, that if you had not been <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>h in carrying, us away certainly upon our report, the Nymph would have <U+017F>ent unto you before night, and acquainted you with her mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polemas</hi> hearing this, and knowing what <hi>Climanthes</hi> had told her, he repented him<U+017F>elf of his carrying them away <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>tily; yet <U+017F>eeing <hi>Leonide</hi> in <hi>Galatheas</hi> clothes: but how comes it to pa<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, that you are in her clothes? As for that, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> when the Ceremony of driving the <U+017F>acred nails was, <U+017F>he gave unto me and <U+017F>everal others of my companions, this <U+017F>ute like unto her own: but, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> why were you <U+017F>o hudded that none could know you? becau<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>) many u<U+017F>ed to pa<U+017F>s by that way, and were de<U+017F>irous to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.

But, replied he, what was the meaning of tho<U+017F>e hor<U+017F>emen that pur<U+017F>ued us?

In this place <U+017F>he intended to <U+017F>tay until it was night: the length of the way had wearied her, her fears perplexed her, and hunger did much pre<U+017F>s her; yet <U+017F>leep being above all, it <U+017F>eized upon her eyes, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept until the evening; when a very young Shepherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>eeking for an Ewe that was <U+017F>tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. came by chance unto the place where <hi>Leonide</hi> was; and admiring to <U+017F>ee her in <U+017F>uch gli<U+017F>tering clothes, <U+017F>he began to run away, thinking her <U+017F>ome Godde<U+017F>s; but the Nymph beckning unto her with her hand, <U+017F>he came unto her; Sweetheart (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) have you either a Mother or an Aunt? My mother (an<U+017F>wered the wench and trembled) is in our hou<U+017F>e, but my Aunt and my Father are dead long <U+017F>ince. And what (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) are you looking for here? For an Ewe (an<U+017F>wered the wench) which is <U+017F>trayed, Well (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide</hi>) go unto thy mother, bid her come hither to me; but bid her be <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he bring none with her but thee nor tell any body; as for the Ewe which thou art looking for, I will give thee a <U+017F>core. The wench very glad of <U+017F>uch news to carry unto her mother, for they were very poor, <U+017F>he ran unto her, and told her, that yonder was a Godde<U+017F>s in the fine<U+017F>t clothes that ever was <U+017F>een, who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with her, and had promi<U+017F>ed her a <U+017F>core of Ewes. The mother who had more wit then the daughter, enquired the place where <U+017F>he was, and leaving her at home, with expre<U+017F>s charge to tell no body, <U+017F>he went unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw in that place, <U+017F>o clad, <U+017F>he knew her to be a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome great quality; therefore making her a low curte<U+017F>ie, Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what <U+017F>ervice is it your plea<U+017F>ure to command me? Good woman (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>) come hither into this thicket, that none may <U+017F>ee us, and tell me whether you <U+017F>aw any hor<U+017F>emen <U+017F>eeking for one? Oh Madam, it is not above an hour <U+017F>ince there was above a dozen <U+017F>uch who <U+017F>aid they had been riding up and down all the night long. And what (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) is become of them? I know not Madam (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) whether they be a<U+017F>leep in <U+017F>ome Country hou<U+017F>e,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53528:89"/>
for they <U+017F>eemed to be very weary. Good woman (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) pray <U+017F>ee if there be any of them yet, for they are enemies to the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and <U+017F>eek for me, de<U+017F>iring to do me <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief, becau<U+017F>e I belong to her. Madam (<U+017F>aid the Country woman) if <hi>Agis</hi> our Lord were here, I dare <U+017F>ay he would guard you from any harm, but he has been long out of the Country in the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Clide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.</hi> Well good woman (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) <hi>Agis</hi> is my Kin<U+017F>man, and one of the be<U+017F>t friends I have, and therefore for his <U+017F>ake help me upon this occa<U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>ee whether any of the<U+017F>e wicked men remain yet hereabouts. The good Country woman after a promi<U+017F>e to <U+017F>erve her with all fidelity, went and <U+017F>pied about all the Town, whether any of them were there; and found not only them, but many others enquiring for the Nymph, and promi<U+017F>ing large rewards to any that could inform them, with a menace of cruel puni<U+017F>hment to any that <U+017F>hould conceal her: The woman who was <U+017F>ubtle enough for one of her condition, and knew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne of the<U+017F>e men to be naught, <U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>he knew nothing of her, but went to her hou<U+017F>e, got an old tatter'd Petticoat and Wa<U+017F>tcoat, and when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw none within compa<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeing her, <U+017F>he went again to the Wood, related all that <U+017F>he had learned, and advi<U+017F>ed her to put off her own clothes, which would di<U+017F>cover her, and put on tho<U+017F>e. The Nymph was not all day undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the clothes of this Country woman; but becau<U+017F>e it was late, and the Nymph had an opinion they would look for her all the night, <U+017F>he had no mind to go unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> till it was time to carry <U+017F>omthing to the Market; and though <U+017F>he was much di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, yet her Beauty was but too vi<U+017F>ible; <U+017F>o as getting <U+017F>ome mud, <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o fully her face and her hands, as would indeed have <U+017F>ooner moved laughter then love: As for her own clothes, <U+017F>he hid them in a Bu<U+017F>h, and would not let the woman carry them, left they <U+017F>hould be found in her hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e a di<U+017F>covery: The woman obeyed her, though with much regret, for <U+017F>he thought they would have enriched her for ever: which <hi>Leonide</hi> perceiving, good woman (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) never trouble your <U+017F>elf for things of <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a value; if you can but get me into <hi>Marcelles,</hi> I will give you a hundred times more then they are worth. The Sun was already <U+017F>et, and the night began to be very dark, which might well invite the Nymph to go out of the Wood with confidence enough, which yet <U+017F>he did not without trembling; knowing that tho<U+017F>e from whom <U+017F>he fled, were in the Town: But the good woman, who undertook to be her guide, did hearten her as well as <U+017F>he could, and by the way, did bid her <U+017F>ay unto any that <U+017F>hould ask her who <U+017F>he was, that <U+017F>he was her daughter, and that <U+017F>he had lived three years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t the mountains, in a place called <hi>Viverois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This advice proved to be very good, for they were no <U+017F>ooner entred into her little hou<U+017F>e, but four or five Souldiers entred al<U+017F>o, who <U+017F>earched every corner in the Cottage; <U+017F>o as if her clothes had been there, all had been di<U+017F>covered: whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of them were very bu<U+017F>ie in <U+017F>earchings, others were as bu<U+017F>ie in que<U+017F>tioning and enquiring after <hi>Leonide</hi>: The little Wench who had <U+017F>een her in the Wood, not thinking any harm, you <U+017F>eek (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for a fair Godde<U+017F>s, all gold and <U+017F>ilver, and perhaps I can tell you where <U+017F>he is, for I <U+017F>aw her to day not far from hence. Oh heavens, how <hi>Leonide</hi> <U+017F>tarted when <U+017F>he heard this, and the good woman al<U+017F>o! yet to avoid <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, where (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the childe) did you <U+017F>ee her? Upon this all the Souldiers flocked about her, and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her to tell. Sirs (<U+017F>aid the mother very craftily) if my daughter do tell you, I pray let her have the reward that is promi<U+017F>ed, it will be a good portion for her, and will advance her marriage; then taking her by the hand, <U+017F>he went out of the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he would make her daughter conduct them unto the place where <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her, though indeed it was only to get the Souldiers out of the hou<U+017F>e: But <U+017F>he carried them to the very place, where they found <hi>Leonides</hi> clothes, and thought that the little wench <U+017F>aid true, but that they came too late: and as there are always <U+017F>ome more <U+017F>ubtle then others, <U+017F>o one of the Souldiers, whil<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t were <U+017F>earching about, did take the wench a<U+017F>ide, and with fair words got out of her, that her mother did know of her, for <U+017F>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with it as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her; <U+017F>o as it was pre<U+017F>ently concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t them, that this old woman had hid her in <U+017F>ome place or other; therefore threatning to kill her, and to burn her hou<U+017F>e if <U+017F>he did not tell them where <U+017F>he was,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53528:89"/>
the poor woman was forced to tell them, that it was <U+017F>he whom they <U+017F>aw in her hou<U+017F>e, but be<U+017F>eeched them to do her no harm, for <U+017F>he was cozen unto <hi>Agis</hi> who was Lord of the place, and <U+017F>hould he come to know of it he would ruine her. The Souldiers, as glad of this as if they had won a battel, ran all to the hou<U+017F>e: but <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi> doubting that this little wench might perhaps blab it out, that <U+017F>he had told her mother, no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw them out of the hou<U+017F>e, but taking a piece of bread which <U+017F>he found upon the table, <U+017F>he went out at the back door, and recomend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her <U+017F>elf unto Tautates, <U+017F>he ran into the open fields, not knowing which way <U+017F>he went, yet <U+017F>topping <U+017F>ometimes to take breath, and to hearken whether any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ouldiers in the mean time coming to the door, and finding it <U+017F>hut, did knock a while, thinking that <hi>Leonide</hi> had <U+017F>hut it for fear; but <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he would not an<U+017F>wer, they offered to break it open.</p>
               <p>The countrey woman, being very <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee her hou<U+017F>e thus broken, O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (cryed <U+017F>he out) they have promi<U+017F>ed to do you no harm, therefore I be<U+017F>eech open the door, and do not cau<U+017F>e my hou<U+017F>e to be thus hurt. But <U+017F>he might have cryed loud and long enough before <hi>Leonide</hi> heard her. In the mean time all the Town flocked together at this noi<U+017F>e, and after the <U+017F>ouldiers had broken open the doore, they entred, and <U+017F>earched it as if they had been looking for a needle: At la<U+017F>t, the Souldiers being out of hope, and vexed to the heart they could not find her, they <U+017F>et fire upon the hou<U+017F>e, and burnt it to a<U+017F>hes, with all the hou<U+017F>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tuff and e<U+017F>tate this poor woman had, who in her little Fortune may be example unto greater, <U+017F>ince there was but a moment betwixt her hopes of happine<U+017F>s, and her certainty of utter ruine.</p>

               <p>Upon this, <hi>Leonide</hi> making an humble reverence to the Nymph, <U+017F>he be<U+017F>eeched her to let her go and change her fine ve<U+017F>tments, <U+017F>o as <hi>Galathea</hi> went out al<U+017F>o with her.

               <p>O <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he as <U+017F>oon as he had read this Letter) O my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> how much cau<U+017F>e ha<U+017F>t thou to complain again<U+017F>t me? and how much cau<U+017F>e have I to complain again<U+017F>t my Fortune?

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53528:92"/>
what you will of me. I knew by this that no other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to be talked of, till all was di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of concerning <hi>Dorinde</hi>; and therefore I an<U+017F>wered him, I am not <U+017F>o ignorant of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion Sir, but that I know it to be one of the greate<U+017F>t, and one of the mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t: mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e nothing can be more rea<U+017F>onable then to love that which is lovely; and mo<U+017F>t great, becau<U+017F>e Nature and Will does mo<U+017F>t violently prompt us unto it. And therefore, I was not only charged with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> but I have al<U+017F>o a pre<U+017F>ent which the Prince your brother hath <U+017F>ent unto you, and which I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf will not be altogether unwelcome to you.</p>
               <p>Then going to the door, I fetched <hi>Dorindes</hi> picture, which I commanded one of my men to bring. When I opened it, he fixed his eyes <U+017F>o upon it, and was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed, that he <U+017F>eemed him<U+017F>elf a <U+017F>tatue.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, returning to him<U+017F>elf, and con<U+017F>idering the pains I took in holding it <U+017F>o long, he made <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>es unto me for it, yet <U+017F>till could not chu<U+017F>e but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it and admire: after a long contemplation he ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s habit wherein <U+017F>he was drawn, O (<U+017F>aid he) how this Shepherde<U+017F>s does <U+017F>well all tho<U+017F>e upon the banks of Lignon with envy?

Upon this he commanded me to relate unto him the whole Fortune of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and by what good Genius <U+017F>he was advi<U+017F>ed to retire her <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>: which to <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fie, I told him all that I had learned from her own mouth, from <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi>: I ob<U+017F>erved, that when I related unto him the frights wherein <U+017F>he was when <hi>Duriana</hi> left her, he <U+017F>ighed <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, as grieving that he was not with her; but when he heard what cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Clorantes</hi> would have <U+017F>hewed unto her, and in what a pitiful condition <U+017F>he was, when <hi>Merindor, Periander,</hi> and <hi>Bellimartes</hi> re<U+017F>cued her. O mo<U+017F>t cruel Father, <U+017F>aid he, could<U+017F>t thou have eyes, and <U+017F>ee <hi>Dorinde</hi> thus wronged by the appointment? And when he heard of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> his death in that quarrel: Dear friend, <U+017F>aid he, thou art a greater gainer in thy death then in thy life, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf we do all envy thee in the honour thou ha<U+017F>t got in be<U+017F>towing thy life <U+017F>o nobly: To be brief Madam, this Prince did <U+017F>o re<U+017F>ent every thing that concerned this fair Lady, that I verily believe never any was in<U+017F>pired with a more noble love then he. Having eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way <U+017F>atisfied his curio<U+017F>ity as well as I was able: he opened the re<U+017F>t of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and they being only Letters of credence, I acquainted him with every thing according to your commands, and particularly with your joyes to <U+017F>ee <hi>Dorinde</hi> in <U+017F>uch a place where you might <U+017F>erve her for his <U+017F>ake, which you a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him you would do, and hold her as dear in your e<U+017F>teem as <hi>Galathea</hi> her <U+017F>elf: afterwards I related unto him all that I had in commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion from the Prince his brother, and how deeply he re<U+017F>ented every thing that concerned him: to be brief, I omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which I had in command; unto which he an<U+017F>wered with <U+017F>uch abundance of thanks, as I plainly <U+017F>aw how much he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged unto you in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Dorinde.</hi> But when I acquainted him with the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Polemas,</hi> and of King <hi>Gondebaut</hi> to make him Lord of that <U+017F>tate, and with the Letters which he had written and <U+017F>ent by <hi>Clorantes,</hi> which imported the death of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and invited <hi>Polemas</hi> to take up arms, offering unto him all favour and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: I do <U+017F>olemnly prote<U+017F>t and <U+017F>wear (<U+017F>aid he) that laying a<U+017F>ide all re<U+017F>pects of a <U+017F>on to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will never as long as I live, <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch an injury to be done unto the Prince<U+017F>s: I have hitherto carried my <U+017F>elf with all humility and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s; but if he do arm, I will unvail my <U+017F>elf, and declare in behalf of the Nymph, with all my friends and confederates: for be<U+017F>ides the particular intere<U+017F>t which I have, the general title of a Cavaleir, does oblige me to this ju<U+017F>t defence. Upon this he acquainted me with the corre<U+017F>pondencies, which he held with the Dukes and Earls of high &amp; low Burgundy, for <U+017F>o he called all tho<U+017F>e Provinces which are on both <U+017F>ides the <hi>Ararri</hi> he told me what great forces he could have from the Hudeois and Allobrogians, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me that he <U+017F>hould draw after him the better half of the Souldiery that were in his Fathers Kingdome, and that tho<U+017F>e who did not follow him, would not take arms again<U+017F>t him: Afterwards I acquainted him with the Letters which for

               <p>As for <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) pray tell her, that I am much more hers then my own, and that ere long <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall receive all de<U+017F>ireable a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of it.

               <p>In the mean time tho<U+017F>e that were <U+017F>ent to the banks of Lignon to <U+017F>eiz upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi> were conducted by their guide into a little grove clo<U+017F>e by the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi>; where hiding them<U+017F>elves, they <U+017F>tayed till it was day.

Then being <U+017F>ilent a while, and thinking that <hi>Lidias</hi> <U+017F>pake very freely, <U+017F>he began to doubt of him whom <U+017F>he took for <hi>Lidias,</hi> and who had <U+017F>o much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her by his re<U+017F>emblance; then <U+017F>he asked him <U+017F>everal times, whether he was that <hi>Lidias</hi> who fought with <hi>Arontes,</hi> and he an<U+017F>wering that he was.

For you may remember, that flying unto your hou<U+017F>e, you <U+017F>topped the blood with your handkerchief, I having not time to <U+017F>tay the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, for fear I <U+017F>hould be taken: O heavens (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do remember very well: where was my eyes and my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that I <U+017F>hould not take notice of this mark before? Now am I to my great contentment convinced of my errour; and then embracing <hi>Lidias</hi> again, <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto him all that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt her and <hi>Ligdamon</hi>: at which <hi>Lidias</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and could not conceive it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that two per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o alike, as not to find <U+017F>ome difference either in face, voice, or ge<U+017F>ture.</p>
               <p>No, No, <hi>Lidias</hi> (replied <U+017F>he) a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf your mother, your kindred, and all your friends were deceived in him, although he <U+017F>till affirmed that he was not <hi>Lidias,</hi> but one <hi>Ligdamon</hi> of that countrey; and when I chid him for his change towards me (for I thought that all he <U+017F>aid proceeded only from the alteration in his affection) he an<U+017F>wered that he was not <hi>Lidias,</hi> but one <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who never loved any but one <hi>Silvia,</hi> nor <U+017F>hould he ever love any other: I was <U+017F>o deceived by his re<U+017F>emblance, that to be <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fied I re<U+017F>olved to come into this countrey, where he promi<U+017F>ed to verifie all he had <U+017F>aid: but when were near Neomages, a certain pa<U+017F><U+017F>enger and he fell out, and he whom I took for you, left him dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, for which we were both then pri<U+017F>oners, and had not I helped him to e<U+017F>cape by lending him my clothes, I know not what might have happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: for I taking his, I <U+017F>aid that I was his husband and he my wife: The next day I was carried before the Governour and other officers of ju<U+017F>tice: I did not deny the fact whereof I was accu<U+017F>ed. They carried me to the Chamber where this wounded man lay in bed; when he <U+017F>aw me, the<U+017F>e clothes (<U+017F>aid he) are his who wounded me, but to him who wears them I have nothing to <U+017F>ay.</p>
               <p>The Governer upon this looking better upon me, he knew by my hair &amp; by my bre<U+017F>ts that I was a woman: whereat, wondring, what is the rea<U+017F>on (<U+017F>aid he) you are di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed in a habit not pooper to your <U+017F>ex? Sir (<U+017F>aid I) though I know my husband to be innocent, yet fearing the <U+017F>everity of ju<U+017F>tice, I con<U+017F>trained him to change habits with me, and <U+017F>o he e<U+017F>caped: I <U+017F>ay I con<U+017F>trained him, becau<U+017F>e he would rather have died then left me in that condition; but at la<U+017F>t my prayers, my <U+017F>ighs, and my tears, forced him away. As fortune was, this Governour had a wife who was both fair and young, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately loved her husband, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he heard of my trick to <U+017F>ave my husband, <U+017F>he came where we were to <U+017F>ee me; and came time enough to plead and defend my cau<U+017F>e: for the Governour <U+017F>ent for the Gaoler; asked him what was become of the man who was committed to his charge, and when he an<U+017F>wered that it was I, no, <U+017F>aid the Governour, this is his wife. Sir, <U+017F>aid he, if it be, then they were both women, for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you the other was as fair and as young as this; and this whom I here pre<U+017F>ent unto you, was delivered unto me in the <U+017F>ame habits you <U+017F>ee: Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, the man <U+017F>peaks truth; for before we were committed unto his cu<U+017F>tody we had changed habits,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53528:97"/>
and therefore the fault is not in him. Well (<U+017F>aid the Governour) do you think you <U+017F>hall not be puni<U+017F>hed in the habit which you wear? If my husband have done any injury, an<U+017F>wered I, I will willingly receive the puni<U+017F>hment for him; but, replied he, do you not know what puni<U+017F>hment they incur, who thus delude ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice. Be the puni<U+017F>hment what it will, replied I, I am <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame, and ready to receive it, <U+017F>o my husband may go free. The Governours wife coming in upon this, and hearing me <U+017F>peak thus: Sir, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her husband) the action of this woman is worthy of all honour and recompence; and all tho<U+017F>e that have hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ought to take example by her, to honour her and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her, and I our of my affection unto you, become a Petitioner in her behalf.</p>
               <p>The Governour upon this <U+017F>miled; my deare<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he unto her) you need not petition where you may command, and you may command not only this, but my life: hereupon he commanded I <U+017F>hould be relea<U+017F>ed into her hands, and <U+017F>he carried me to her hou<U+017F>e, where <U+017F>he gave me this habit which now I wear, <U+017F>he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>ed me beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and do what I could, would not <U+017F>uffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of four or five dayes; and I believe if I had not told her that my husband <U+017F>tayed for me at an appointed place, and perhaps would return to <U+017F>eek me, <U+017F>he would not have <U+017F>uffered me to departed <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing was my action unto her. But the be<U+017F>t was, that when I was out of the Town, and would go unto the place where this man <U+017F>aid he would <U+017F>tay for me, I had forgotten the name of the Town; yet knowing that it was in Forre<U+017F>ts, I took towards that countrey, where ever <U+017F>ince I have wandred from one Town to another, not knowing whether to go, nor what place to enquire after. <hi>Lidias</hi> hearkened very attentively unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merina,</hi> and when <U+017F>he had done, fair, and dear <hi>Amerina</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge my <U+017F>elf infinitely obliged unto you, for I <U+017F>ee that all you did unto <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was intended unto me, and it is my part to do you <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as <U+017F>uch favours merit; but as you have acquainted me with your adventures, <U+017F>o it is but rea<U+017F>onable I acquaint you with mine: wherein, if any thing di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, or <U+017F>eem in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to cro<U+017F><U+017F>e that affection which I promi<U+017F>ed unto you, yet I believe when you have <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>idered upon it, you will find, that to <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie obligations received, I was con<U+017F>trained unto it.</p>
               <p>Upon this, he related all that he had done in great Brittain: the courte<U+017F>ies of <hi>Melanders</hi> kindred, the <U+017F>hew that he made of loving her, the manner of his leaving her without telling her, his impri<U+017F>onment at <hi>Callice,</hi> the re<U+017F>olution of <hi>Melander</hi> to fight for him again<U+017F>t <hi>Lipandas,</hi> how <U+017F>he was taken pri<U+017F>oner by the troops of Prince <hi>Clidemont,</hi> the favour that Prince <U+017F>hewed in <U+017F>etting her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: briefly, he acquainted her with his enterprize upon <hi>Callice,</hi> and the taking of that place.</p>
               <p>But (continued he) we were no <U+017F>ooner ma<U+017F>ters of the place, but I ran to the Ca<U+017F>tle, and as he that was wonderous well acquainted with the pri<U+017F>ons, I went thither with an earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing <hi>Melander,</hi> and re<U+017F>toring her that liberty which <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t for my <U+017F>ake: but fortune which <U+017F>eemed to cro<U+017F>s me in all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, denied me this among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t: for I found the pri<U+017F>on doors broken open, and nothing within but fetters and <U+017F>hakkles: I <U+017F>ought every corner of the Ca<U+017F>tle in hopes of finding her, afterwards went into the Town, and enquired of her in every hou<U+017F>e: at la<U+017F>t in the evening (for I <U+017F>pent all the night and all the next day till <U+017F>un<U+017F>et in <U+017F>eeking her) I under<U+017F>tood by <U+017F>ome who came from Rotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magues, that <U+017F>he was gone thitherward; and though I thought the friends of <hi>Arontes</hi> might procure me <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief, if they knew me, yet <U+017F>o much did I think my <U+017F>elf obliged unto that woman, as I re<U+017F>olved to go thither; but when I was near Rothomagues, by chance, I met with a hor<U+017F>man who diverted my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne.</p>
               <p>This man came from the Town, and rid upon a tired hor<U+017F>e: it being my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tome to ask what news of all I met, <U+017F>o I did of him: Sir, <U+017F>aid I, can you tell me any tidings of a young man, <U+017F>tranger, habited after the mode of great Brittain, who went towards Rothomagues, and happily you might meet him? Sir, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, if I be not mi<U+017F>taken, he whom you are in que<U+017F>t of, is called the <U+017F>ad Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier; the very <U+017F>ame (replied I very joyful): None Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, can give
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53528:97"/>
you a better accompt of him then my <U+017F>elf, for I have accompanied him from the pri<U+017F>on of <hi>Callice,</hi> as far as the next Town: we were both fellow pri<U+017F>oners toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when the Franks took the Town, and the pri<U+017F>ons all <U+017F>et open, this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, with whom I had intimate friend<U+017F>hip, de<U+017F>ired me to <U+017F>how him the way unto Rothomagues; for, <U+017F>aid he, I have very earne<U+017F>t bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e there, and <U+017F>uch as does much import my contentment. I an<U+017F>wered, that I would not only <U+017F>hew him the way, but accompany him to the very gates, yet would not enter in, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome great enemies I had there: <U+017F>o we mounted upon the fir<U+017F>t hor<U+017F>es we met, for all was lawful prize, and in the confu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>lipt out of the Town un<U+017F>een. Then by the way I undert<U+017F>tood, that the rea<U+017F>on why he made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te, was, to forbid the banes of a marriage betwixt one <hi>Lidias</hi> and a Lady, which was of great importance unto him; but he no <U+017F>ooner left me, then I <U+017F>aw him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of the Town again in all ha<U+017F>te, and asking the rea<U+017F>on of it; do not <U+017F>tay me (<U+017F>aid he) for I under<U+017F>tand that this <hi>Lidias</hi> whom I look for, is gone with her whom he intends to marry, and its thought unto a hou<U+017F>e not far from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that woman: upon this, he <U+017F>et <U+017F>purs to his hor<U+017F>e, not <U+017F>aying a word more unto me. Which way (<U+017F>aid I unto him) did he take? I cannot tell, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered he, but I believe, towards <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we parted, and ever <U+017F>ince I have been following, hearing news of him almo<U+017F>t every day, until I came to the Town which you named unto me, where a <U+017F>trange accident happened unto me: I came thither about the time that you were there, and as I alighted to re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf (for indeed I had rid a long journey that day) a company of <U+017F>ouldiers <U+017F>eized upon me, and carried me to pri<U+017F>on, accu<U+017F>ing me for wounding a certain pa<U+017F><U+017F>enger; and by what you have told me, I believe it was him whom that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> with whom you were, had wounded: heavens do know that I was altogether innocent of the fact, yet was I very <U+017F>harply u<U+017F>ed; I lay that night with my hands and my feet fettered with iron, and the next day towards night, they carried me to the Governour of the place, who after examination, thinking me to be innocent, would have relea<U+017F>ed me, when an officer of Ju<U+017F>tice de<U+017F>ired that before my enlargement, I might be brought before the wounded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who had accu<U+017F>ed me: thither was I immediately carried, and I took notice, that as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw me, he fetched a deep <U+017F>igh, and turned him<U+017F>elf the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way in his bed: Every one thought, (and I among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t) that this <U+017F>igh proceeded from the pain of his wound; yet now I think that he took me for <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon</hi> who wounded him, and that he would not accu<U+017F>e me, but that perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generous, he would, like a brave Cavalier, call me to an<U+017F>wer him in the way of arms and not of Law: but <U+017F>o it was, that when they asked him whether it was I who wounded him, he an<U+017F>wered no; and when they told him that yet it was I whom he had accu<U+017F>ed, he replied, I cry both you and him mercy, for it is not he. Upon this ju<U+017F>tification the Governour relea<U+017F>ed me; but my hor<U+017F>e, and the be<U+017F>t things I had then about me, were then in the hands of the Gaoler and tho<U+017F>e that took me: I do believe, that if I had made complaint, perhaps I <U+017F>hould have got them again; but I thought it better to go away quietly, having heard that <U+017F>uch kind of <U+017F>uits do often co<U+017F>t more then they are worth: be<U+017F>ides, de<U+017F>iring mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately to overtake her whom I followed, I directed my cour<U+017F>e towards Forre<U+017F>ts, becau<U+017F>e I under<U+017F>tood that <U+017F>he enquired the way into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Lidias</hi> and <hi>Amerina</hi> were talking thus together, <hi>Silvia</hi> was at every turn peeping out at the window, and as clo<U+017F>ely as ever <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>pying and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving their action: for not being able to hear what they <U+017F>aid, only <U+017F>ome words when they <U+017F>poke loud, <U+017F>he took notice only of their ge<U+017F>tures, and the carre<U+017F><U+017F>es which they u<U+017F>ed the one to the other, which <U+017F>tung her <U+017F>o to the heart, that <U+017F>he was divers times ready to cry out and exclaim again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e injuries. But as <U+017F>he was in the<U+017F>e thoughts, tho<U+017F>e whom <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>ent, came unto her with intentions to carry her away as privately as they could, telling her that it was to carry her back unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>he was put then into a coach, and when <U+017F>he came to the place were <hi>Lidias</hi> was talking with <hi>Amerina,</hi> he did not <U+017F>o much as move when he looked upon her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by; which troubled her <U+017F>o much, that <U+017F>he thought

At the <U+017F>ame time you came with <U+017F>ome boughs to make the place more <U+017F>hady: As <U+017F>oon as ever I ca<U+017F>t my eye upon you, I took you, as I did now, for <hi>Lidias</hi> whom I looked for, and thought that woman to be <hi>Amerina:</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that I was moved with <U+017F>everal pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; for once I was in a mind to fall upon <hi>Amerina</hi> whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept, and fir<U+017F>t to run a ponyard into her brea<U+017F>t, and then into my own, before your face: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time I de<U+017F>ign'd to let the innocent woman alone and to open my own brea<U+017F>t, and as I was dying, to take <U+017F>ome of my blood, and throw it in your face, upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with your infidelity: But <U+017F>ome good genius diverted me from tho<U+017F>e cruel re<U+017F>olutions, and con<U+017F>training me to go a little further off, after a hundred differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conceptions, I thought it be<U+017F>t to die by your own hand, and not by my own; to the end you might the more lament my death.</p>
               <p>This being my de<U+017F>ign, you know what <U+017F>igns I made unto you to <U+017F>eparate you from <hi>Amerina,</hi> and how violently I ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf upon your <U+017F>word, with which indeed I was wounded in my arm, but I know not how it mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed my heart, for there was my intention to receive it; and I had <U+017F>uch an opinion of receiving it there, that when I felt the point of the <U+017F>word, I fancied that it had reached my heart; <U+017F>o as having heard that all wounds of the heart were mortal, I fancied my <U+017F>elf to be dead; and when I returned to my <U+017F>elf again, I found that I was in the hands of the Governour of Neomague. I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince, that he finding me in a <U+017F>woon, he cau<U+017F>ed me to be taken up as dead, but the motion of tho<U+017F>e who carried me, did revive me; <U+017F>o <U+017F>etting me upon a hor<U+017F>e, they carried me away; when, to my thinking, I <U+017F>aw you pa<U+017F>s by my hor<U+017F>e, very well mounted. Certainly (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and interrupted) it was <U+017F>ome other, for I was on foot, and never left <hi>Amerina</hi> till we were both taken together. If <U+017F>o, replyed <hi>Melander,</hi> either it was <hi>Lidias,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other who re<U+017F>embles him, as you do: But <U+017F>o it was, that I told the Governour with a deep <U+017F>igh, it was he who had put me into that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as <U+017F>oon as the Governour heard it, he cau<U+017F>ed him to be pur<U+017F>ued and brought to pri<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>When night came, I began to think how I <U+017F>hould be a cau<U+017F>e of puni<U+017F>hing <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> and therefore was very <U+017F>orry for what I had <U+017F>aid: And as I was in bed the next morning, they brought me a woman in your clothes, to <U+017F>ee if it was <U+017F>he who hurt me, and I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he was not: But I was extreamly a<U+017F>tonished when they brought him whom I accu<U+017F>ed, for truly, I took him for you, I mean <hi>Lidias.</hi> And left he <U+017F>hould know me, I turned my face the other way, as I lay in my bed: and though I knew I had rea<U+017F>on enough to wi<U+017F>h him ill, yet I could not find in my heart to do him any harm: <U+017F>o as altering my voice, I declared that it was not he, but <U+017F>ome other, who had taken the habit of that woman. Upon this di<U+017F>charge he was relea<U+017F>ed. I be<U+017F>eech you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) what became of the woman, for it was <U+017F>he who <U+017F>aved me? The Governours wife (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) took her off from all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment, and is <U+017F>o far from all harm, that to morrow I believe <U+017F>he will return home. But to continue that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of my mi<U+017F>erable fortune; In the night time when I could not <U+017F>leep, by rea<U+017F>on of the wound, not in my arm, but in my heart, I made a hundred propo<U+017F>itions to my <U+017F>elf: one while I would write unto <hi>Lidias,</hi> and let him know what wrong he had done me; but I was pre<U+017F>ently off that, thinking he would but mock at my Letter, and with his <hi>Amerina,</hi> laugh at it:

Another while I would <U+017F>end for him, not telling who I was, and in the pre<U+017F>ence of the Governours wife, who was of a <U+017F>weet and pitiful di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, upbraid him with his per<U+017F>idie and ingratitude, as thinking, that <U+017F>hame perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this de<U+017F>ign I <U+017F>lept, with a re<U+017F>olution to put it in execution the next morning; but I was di<U+017F>appointed, for that very night, as <U+017F>oon as ever he was <U+017F>et at liberty, he went privately out of the Town, none knowing which way he went,</p>
               <p>When I heard of his departure, I was almo<U+017F>t even mad again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <U+017F>uch an opportunity <U+017F>o imprudently <U+017F>lip; for (<U+017F>aid I) had I accu<U+017F>ed him, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s he had been <U+017F>tayed, and I might have executed my de<U+017F>ign in <U+017F>peaking unto him before the Governours wife: And as for my fond fears of doing him any harm by way of Ju<U+017F>tice, what greater puni<U+017F>hment could he in Ju<U+017F>tice receive, then a while of Impri<U+017F>onment, <U+017F>ince my wound was not neer mortal? But all this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oning with my <U+017F>elf was in vain; and after a long debate, and vexing at my <U+017F>elf, Patience was my only remedy; and as <U+017F>oon as I could (which was within <U+017F>even or eight days) to <U+017F>et forward towards Forre<U+017F>ts, where I heard you were; and as Fortune was, I came into this place where all the<U+017F>e Forces did rendezvouz to <U+017F>torm this Town: I <U+017F>earched every rank and file to <U+017F>ee if I could find you; and by chance being next him that leaped into the ditch with intention to kill you, as <U+017F>oon as ever I ca<U+017F>t my eye upon you, and taking you for <hi>Lidias,</hi> I ran in to defend you, making it to appear, that nothing is <U+017F>tronger then Love, <U+017F>ince neither any <U+017F>corns, or offences, nor injuries, nor any thing, could keep me from expo<U+017F>ing my life for <hi>Lidias,</hi> whom I thought that I had rea<U+017F>on to hate even to death.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Melander</hi> conclude the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of her travels and pains; and <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon</hi> pre<U+017F>enting his hand unto her, Fair and Generous woman (<U+017F>aid he unto her) the life which you have this day pre<U+017F>erved, <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>pent in your <U+017F>ervice; I hope you will not depart out of this Country, before you have found a full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>Upon this, the corporal untyed him, and he went with <hi>Ligdamon</hi> unto his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he was put into good clothes, for his own were plundered from him by tho<U+017F>e who took him, and tho<U+017F>e which remained upon him, he had torn to pieces in his rage: afterwards <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> cau<U+017F>ing him to <U+017F>it down, and they two being alone in the chamber, he began thus.</p>

               <p>THo<U+017F>e who never knew the Grandure and Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ance of that god which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Love, ought to learn by my example, how to honour and reverence him, unle<U+017F>s they will incur the <U+017F>ame puni<U+017F>hments which I have, for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e who did adore him, and for not doing <U+017F>o great reverence unto that great Deity as is due: for know Sir, that as <U+017F>oon as I left my Nur<U+017F>e, I began <U+017F>o much to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e love, and all that followed him, that to tell me one was a lover, was enough to make me <U+017F>corn him, when at any time I chanced to hear of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effect of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I u<U+017F>ed by way of mockery to <U+017F>ay, that they changed the name of things, and that this which they called love, was indeed madne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>o ought to be called. When I was at any meetings, where I <U+017F>aw many idolizing a fair face, and were <U+017F>o tyed by the eyes that they could not move out of the pre<U+017F>ence of tho<U+017F>e fair ones, I was wont to <U+017F>ay, that the men did but mock the women, and the women the men; when <U+017F>ome would needs prove, that he was forced to a beauty, and that her charms were inevitable, I pre<U+017F>ently concluded him to be only a Sophi<U+017F>ter, that to <U+017F>hew his wit would argue for, or again<U+017F>t any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that was propounded. Nay more then al this, from my very infancy, to the Autumn of my age, I could never find in any of tho<U+017F>e who were cryed up for <U+017F>uch high beauties, any thing more amiable then in other women: So as I may <U+017F>ay, that as there are <U+017F>ome who are born blind, others deaf, others without a ta<U+017F>te, or at lea<U+017F>t a ta<U+017F>te different from others: <U+017F>o was I born without any <U+017F>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love or beauty, and all my delectation at that time was in hunting, or in wars, which I followed where<U+017F>oever I could <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>eat was. Now Sir, I lived in this contempt of love and beauty until of very late, when that God, who would not <U+017F>uffer any mortal to trample his honour and his laws <U+017F>o under foot, did make me know his power, by a way as extraordinary as my crime.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e who knew me, called me by the name of <hi>Lipandas,</hi> born in a city of the Neu<U+017F>trians called Rothomagues, and of Parents, who there held the prime rank. And whereas, my countrey maintained great wars again<U+017F>t the Romans, and they again<U+017F>t the Franks, I had occa<U+017F>ions enough of <U+017F>hewing my valour without <U+017F>tirring out of the Neu<U+017F>trian limits, or at lea<U+017F>t out of our Army: and therefore<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> a place of great concernment being in the power of our Lords, which was called <hi>Callice,</hi> the government of it was committed unto me, and I kept it <U+017F>everal years.

Content your <U+017F>elf (replyed <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that I know what you tell me, and more, that a young woman of great Britain, called <hi>Melander,</hi> armed like a Cavalier, did fight with you about the liberty of that <hi>Lidias</hi>; afterwards to deliver him, did put her <U+017F>elf into pri<U+017F>on, and when the Franks <U+017F>urprized <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> was delivered out of your hands.</p>
               <p>I perceive (replyed the <U+017F>tranger) that you do know almo<U+017F>t all I have to tell you, and therefore my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e will be <U+017F>horter then I intended: Then looking upon him a little better, Oh heavens! cryed he out; why do I make any relations of it unto you? for if I be not much mi<U+017F>taken, it is <hi>Lidias</hi> unto whom I <U+017F>peak: To <hi>Lidias</hi>! an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> No; but to one that has paid very dear for his re<U+017F>emblance unto that <hi>Lidias,</hi> as you <U+017F>hall under<U+017F>tand when you have done your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. The credit which I give to your words (replyed the <U+017F>tranger) makes me give my eyes the lye, for I dur<U+017F>t have <U+017F>worn you had been <hi>Lidias</hi>; but <U+017F>ince you do deny it, I will return from whence I digre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and then he replyed thus. Oh Sir, <U+017F>ince you are acquainted with the<U+017F>e accidents, perhaps you know al<U+017F>o, that this <hi>Melander</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner out of my pri<U+017F>on, but <U+017F>he went after that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Lidias,</hi> who having forgotten all tho<U+017F>e extraordinary favours which he had received from that generous woman, went unto <hi>Rothomagues</hi> to marry <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> her for whom he had killed <hi>Arontes,</hi> my neer Kin<U+017F>man: As for me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Pri<U+017F>oner in the hands of one <hi>Lindamore,</hi> a Cavalier of Gaul the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed that ever came into Neu<U+017F>tria; and the cau<U+017F>e of it, as afterwards I under<U+017F>tood, was this fair <hi>Melander,</hi> whom I retained Pri<U+017F>oner: for <hi>Lindamore</hi> hearing, I know not how, what te<U+017F>timonies of genero<U+017F>ity and affection this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto <hi>Lidias,</hi> and being informed that <U+017F>he was a pri<U+017F>oner in the Ca<U+017F>tle, as <U+017F>oon as the Ca<U+017F>tle was taken, he ran to deliver her: But not finding her (for the doors were <U+017F>et open, and <U+017F>he, with many others, e<U+017F>caped) I think there was not any corner or hole which he did not <U+017F>eek, continually asking me where <U+017F>he was: I who could not tell him, nor knew <hi>Melander</hi> but under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <U+017F>ad Cavalier, I knew not what to an<U+017F>wer him: At la<U+017F>t, making me under<U+017F>tand that he <U+017F>ought for a woman in the habit of a Cavalier, who fought with me for <hi>Lidias,</hi> and was afterwards impri<U+017F>oned: As for the <U+017F>ad Cavalier, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered I, he indeed was my pri<U+017F>oner, but as for any woman, there was none in my hands. Well, replyed <hi>Lindamore,</hi> that <U+017F>ad Cavalier is the woman I mean: How? replyed I, the <U+017F>ad Cavalier a woman! Why? <U+017F>aid <hi>Lindamore,</hi> was <U+017F>he <U+017F>o long in your hands, and you not know it? Why it was <U+017F>he who loved <hi>Lidias,</hi> and in defence of him, armed her <U+017F>elf, and vanqui<U+017F>hed you, and afterwards with a mo<U+017F>t heroique courage, bought the liberty of <hi>Lidias</hi> by the lo<U+017F>s of her own.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, you <U+017F>hall hear how that pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant God of Love was revenged upon me; I who always mocked at his power, and de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed his Laws, no <U+017F>ooner heard that this <U+017F>ad Cavalier was a woman, but I fell into mo<U+017F>t extream admiration: this admiration bringing into my memory the genero<U+017F>ity of that woman, I began to e<U+017F>teem her; and at la<U+017F>t, contemplating upon the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of her face and a<U+017F>pect, her mode<U+017F>t behaviour, her admirable patience, and her unparallell'd affection, I fell from e<U+017F>teem, to love her; a thing which I ever thought impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible: But learn O all ye mortals! to reverence the <U+017F>upreme Deities: for I not re<U+017F>ting in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection, Love had <U+017F>tuck his arrows <U+017F>o deep in my heart, that I became all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate flame, <U+017F>o as I may <U+017F>erve for an example unto all <U+017F>uch Athei<U+017F>ts as do not acknowled the pui<U+017F><U+017F>ance of this great God, who above all the re<U+017F>t, ought to be called <hi>He<U+017F>us,</hi> that is, <U+017F>trong and pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant. In the mean time, <hi>Lindamore</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood that <hi>Melander</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner at liberty, but <U+017F>he ha<U+017F>ted after <hi>Lidias,</hi> who was gone to <hi>Rothomagues</hi>: and the very truth is, had I been free, as <hi>Melander</hi> went after <hi>Lidias,</hi> I had gone after <hi>Melander</hi>; but having pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed my word unto that Cavalier, not to <U+017F>tir out of his hou<U+017F>e, I was able to do nothing but langui<U+017F>h, and think my <U+017F>elf worthy of that puni<U+017F>hment which I endured, for having <U+017F>o fair,

and <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a woman <U+017F>o long in my hands, and never knowing it. I found then that this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion made me have a different opinion of things, and was forced to <U+017F>ay, that none was able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the god of Love: I that was wont to laugh at tho<U+017F>e that begged any trivial favour from her they loved, could now be contented to ki<U+017F>s and adore the very chains which touched the fair hand of my Saint <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander.</hi> And therefore I de<U+017F>ired one of <hi>Lindamors</hi> men to go with me into the pri<U+017F>on where <U+017F>he was wont to be: The man like the ma<U+017F>ter, being all Courte<U+017F>ie, went with me, and not being well able to di<U+017F>cern which chains had fettered her, I de<U+017F>ired him to put them all upon me: as <U+017F>oon as I had them upon me; O chains, <U+017F>aid I, which once fettered the hands of her who now has fettered my heart, yet le<U+017F>s cruel then I, <U+017F>ince you were broken to let her go at liberty, whom I <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily kept in my pri<U+017F>on; you may with abundance of rea<U+017F>on upbraid me with the crime which I have committed; for I was the cau<U+017F>e and the Authour, but you more in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then I was, had <U+017F>ome pity upon her, and knew that <U+017F>he to whom the liberty of all hearts is due, did not de<U+017F>erve to be <U+017F>o impri<U+017F>oned. O you mo<U+017F>t happy bonds (<U+017F>aid I and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed them) happy in the touch of her fair hands, <U+017F>hew me in what place you received that honour, that by ki<U+017F><U+017F>iing it, I may expre<U+017F>s the devotion which I bear unto them: upon this I ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed them again, and be<U+017F>eeched tho<U+017F>e that were about me to fetter my arms and my hands with all the <U+017F>hakkles in the pri<U+017F>on, and becau<U+017F>e out of pity, they refu<U+017F>ed to do me that office, O good gods (cryed I out) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that he who had no compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the faire<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t generous woman upon earth, <U+017F>hould find any <U+017F>o compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate unto me? Upon this their denial, I <U+017F>poke and did many things that were ridiculous, <U+017F>ome could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and others <U+017F>eeing a man <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t in love, did re<U+017F>ent my condition.</p>
               <p>All the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages were reported unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Lindamor</hi> related them unto <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and both out of curio<U+017F>ity would needs come and <U+017F>ee me. The condition wherein they found me, was <U+017F>uch, that any that <U+017F>aw me would <U+017F>ay I was out of my wits: I had fettered both my feet with as many chains as covered them, and one hand was tying the other as well as it could: as many chains were about my neck as could hang; and thus hardly able to <U+017F>tir, I ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e that my mouth could reach, reverencing the re<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e they had touched that fair one. Although I <U+017F>aw them enter, yet I continued my devotion of ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, as if I <U+017F>aw them not, which held them a while admiration: at la<U+017F>t <hi>Clidemant</hi> came nearer unto me: Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he) what are you doing with all the<U+017F>e chains? and why are you thus fettered with them? Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, I do not only de<U+017F>ire them to be continually upon me, but I wi<U+017F>h I could hang them about my heart. About your heart? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Clidemant</hi>) you know that then they would kill you: for any thing that touches the heart is mortal. O Sir, replied he, that rule is fal<U+017F>e. For <hi>Melander</hi> doth not only touch my heart, but has pierced it with a hundred ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; yes, has pull'd it out of my bre<U+017F>t, and yet I do hot die. That touch of your heart, replied <hi>Clidemant,</hi> is only in imagination; but if the<U+017F>e chains <U+017F>hould touch it doubtle<U+017F>s you would die: No Sir, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) for do you not know that Iron touched with a Load<U+017F>tone, does participate of the quality of the <U+017F>ame Load<U+017F>tone, and will draw Iron al<U+017F>o? I know it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and have <U+017F>een it; but what's that to the purpo<U+017F>e? Why this (an<U+017F>wered I) the<U+017F>e chains though of Iron, yet having touched the fair hands of <hi>Melander,</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a certain virtue and quality, as they can touch hearts and not make them die, as the fair <hi>Melander</hi> can do her <U+017F>elf. Upon this <hi>Clidemant</hi> <U+017F>hrugg'd his <U+017F>houlders, and went away; but <hi>Lindamor</hi> very <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tracted, he came unto me, and did all he could to divert me from <U+017F>uch thoughts; and by little and little, his kind words, and the pains I <U+017F>aw him take to reduce me to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding, did <U+017F>o operate with me, that I was per<U+017F>waded by him: for though the<U+017F>e actions did make me <U+017F>eem as if I were mad, yet I was not <U+017F>o; but the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of this new pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as the <U+017F>plendour of the Sun does dim the Stars, <U+017F>o this at the fir<U+017F>t did dim me from the <U+017F>ight of all other things, or at lea<U+017F>t made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pi<U+017F>e them.</p>
               <p>Eight dayes did I continue in this <U+017F>ort; at la<U+017F>t the kinde<U+017F>s of <hi>Lindamor</hi> was

<U+017F>uch, that <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>o unmea<U+017F>urably <U+017F>ad and melancholy, and that I grew wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e every day, he took pity upon my affliction, and drawing me a<U+017F>ide, did u<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible arguments and con<U+017F>iderations that could comfort an afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, and afterwards offered me <U+017F>o many favours as have created me his <U+017F>ervant as long as I live. Unto all which, I returned no other an<U+017F>wer at the fir<U+017F>t but <U+017F>ighs; yet at la<U+017F>t, being pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto it, I let him under<U+017F>tand in the be<U+017F>t language I had, how deeply I re<U+017F>ented his extraordinary kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and told him, that my griefs did not proceed from my impri<U+017F>onment, or my lo<U+017F><U+017F>es, but only becau<U+017F>e I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood that <hi>Melander</hi> was gone after <hi>Lidias,</hi> and I not able to follow her; and that love had <U+017F>o wholly devoted me unto her, that if in this que<U+017F>t <U+017F>he received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harm, it would mo<U+017F>t infallibly co<U+017F>t me my life; becau<U+017F>e I thought my <U+017F>elf the cau<U+017F>e of all the harm <U+017F>he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who I believe was not ignorant of loves power, went the <U+017F>ame hour to procure my enlargement, and did <U+017F>o <U+017F>olicite <hi>Clidemant,</hi> that he obtained it of the <hi>Childerick,</hi> who was newly arived at that place. Upon this <hi>Lindamor</hi> returned unto me with a <U+017F>miling a<U+017F>pect, Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he) leave off all your <U+017F>orrows and any afflicting your <U+017F>elf, for the Prince <hi>Clidemant,</hi> at my reque<U+017F>t, hath obtained your liberty, and I come to bring you the news, to the end that before you go away you may promi<U+017F>e me one thing, which is not at all prejudicial unto your affection, but on the contrary it will oblige you to ob<U+017F>erve it. Upon that condition (<U+017F>aid I unto him) I <U+017F>hall thankfully receive the favour you have done me. Then promi<U+017F>e me (<U+017F>aid he) that you will never bear Arms again<U+017F>t the King of the Franks nor again<U+017F>t <hi>Clidemant:</hi> and you are obliged unto it by the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie which you now receive, but much more by the affection which you bear unto <hi>Melander,</hi> who is <U+017F>o affectionately devoted unto <hi>Clidemant,</hi> for the favours which in good time you may know <U+017F>he hath received from him, that certainly if <U+017F>he have any power over you, it will be one of the fir<U+017F>t commands <U+017F>he will enjoyn you.</p>
               <p>Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, I am extreamly glad the ob<U+017F>ervance of your de<U+017F>ires will <U+017F>ute <U+017F>o well with <hi>Melanders,</hi> for I <U+017F>hall with more courage make a promi<U+017F>e of it unto you. But a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, Sir, that though <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tand but as indifferent, and not po<U+017F>itively enjoy the contrary, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man that ever wore a <U+017F>word, did I not mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erve it. Upon this promi<U+017F>e (replied <hi>Lindamor</hi>) I give you your enlargement. I did admire at this kindne<U+017F>s and magnanimity, for avarice does often choke tho<U+017F>e virtues in many men. I took his hand, and by force would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it by way of thanks; and becau<U+017F>e he would not <U+017F>uffer it, you know Sir, <U+017F>aid I, that this is the lea<U+017F>t te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my gratitude I can pay, and it <U+017F>hould be greater if I were able, but at this time I be<U+017F>eech you receive it with a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that as long as I live I <U+017F>hall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my great obligations unto you: and going along with him, I made the <U+017F>ame prote<U+017F>tations unto <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Childerick</hi>; and after I had taken my humble leave of them all, I went in que<U+017F>t of that fair one.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t I went towards Rhothomagues, but not being willing to enter in, becau<U+017F>e I knew not how the Lords would take the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Callice</hi>; and therefore went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kin<U+017F>mans hou<U+017F>e, not far from the Town, where enquiring how all <U+017F>quares went, I under<U+017F>tood that every one was well <U+017F>atisfied concerning me, though the lo<U+017F>s of that place was of great con<U+017F>equence: for they all knew I was betrayed, and that there is no guarding of ones <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t a Traytour. But that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which brought me thither, I fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning <hi>Lidias</hi>; and then he told me, how he would have poy<U+017F>oned him<U+017F>elf to prevent his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with <hi>Amerina</hi>; then did I conclude with my <U+017F>elf, that his love unto <hi>Melander</hi> was the cau<U+017F>e: in this opinion, I asked him what was become of <hi>Lidias,</hi> and he an<U+017F>wered that both he and <hi>Amerina</hi> were lo<U+017F>t, and that it was reported they were gone into Forre<U+017F>ts, none knowing the cau<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>I thought that I knew enough for that time: <U+017F>o as the next morning pretending that I de<U+017F>ired to know more particularly what the Lords did think of me, I would go as <U+017F>ecretly as I could unto one of them that was my profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed friend, but I went quite another way, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elf that <hi>Melander</hi> was infallibly followed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53528:103"/>
after <hi>Lidias.</hi> And ye<U+017F>terday by fortune I came into this Army, where curio<U+017F>ity invited me to <U+017F>tay, and <U+017F>ee the di<U+017F>cipline of that Country; and finding that the General of the Army did think to carry that Town at the very fir<U+017F>t on<U+017F>et. I had a de<U+017F>ire to be there, and at the la<U+017F>t Salley, I <U+017F>tood upon the <U+017F>ide of a ditch, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the valour of your men, and the flight of the A<U+017F><U+017F>ailants, having no di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition to draw my <U+017F>word on either <U+017F>ide: But I know not how, ca<U+017F>ting my eye upon you, I thought I <U+017F>aw the generous <hi>Melander,</hi> whom you held by the Neck, and ready to run your <U+017F>word into her Brea<U+017F>t. Oh heavens! Cavalier, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely was I <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the <U+017F>ight? I lept into the Ditch, with full intention to be killed in killing you; and I know not what had hapned, if the voice of <U+017F>ome who ran after me, had not warned you of my intention; for upon it you guarded your <U+017F>elf. But now I thank the Gods that my intention took no effect, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e of that vertue and merit which I find in you, as becau<U+017F>e I am yet pre<U+017F>erved, to <U+017F>erve that generous woman.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Lipandas</hi>; and <hi>Ligdamon</hi> with a <U+017F>mile and an<U+017F>wered, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s Cavalier, that Love, above all the re<U+017F>t of the Gods, takes mo<U+017F>t delight in entangling the <U+017F>pirits of men, and in producing wonderful effects: And that you your <U+017F>elf may confe<U+017F>s as much, know that this <hi>Lidias,</hi> who was reported would have poy<U+017F>oned him<U+017F>elf, becau<U+017F>e he would not marry <hi>Amerina,</hi> and who <U+017F>ince came into this Country, was my <U+017F>elf, who am <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and who having a great re<U+017F>emblance of that <hi>Lidias,</hi> was like to be devoured by Lyons, and <U+017F>ince being con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>eem as if I would marry <hi>Amerina,</hi> who could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded but I was him whom I re<U+017F>embled and therefore to undeceive her, I brought her hither, where by a <U+017F>trange misfortune we parted. But that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>ee how that God delights in the<U+017F>e confu<U+017F>ions, I be<U+017F>eech you follow me, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee how far your eyes deceived you, when you thought you <U+017F>aw <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in the ditch. Then taking him by the hand, he carried him into <hi>Melanders</hi> chamber. Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I come to let you <U+017F>ee one of our pri<U+017F>oners, who will not tell us his name, and to <U+017F>ee whether haply you know him. At the fir<U+017F>t, her thoughts were <U+017F>o far from <hi>Lipandas,</hi> that <U+017F>he knew him not. But the poor Cavalier being extreamly <U+017F>urprized at this encounter, as <U+017F>oon as ever he ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon her, Oh heavens! cryed he out: Upon this word he fell at her feet, and would have uttered <U+017F>ome words, which he was not able to pronounce.</p>
               <p>It was happy that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> brought him alone, for otherwi<U+017F>e certainly <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> had been known to be a woman; for <U+017F>he not being able to endure a man <U+017F>hould lie <U+017F>o pro<U+017F>trate before her, did (out of her natural curte<U+017F>ie) offer to rai<U+017F>e him up; and he at the la<U+017F>t cryed out. O <hi>Melander!</hi> Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible your fair hand <U+017F>hould daign to touch <U+017F>uch a worthle<U+017F>s per<U+017F>on, and one whom you have <U+017F>o much cau<U+017F>e to hate? Though the voice was not altogether unknown unto her, yet <U+017F>he knew him not; but <U+017F>till offering to rai<U+017F>e him up, Oh mo<U+017F>t fair and generous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I will never ri<U+017F>e from your feet, until you have either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or puni<U+017F>hed the errour which I have ignorantly and innocently committed again<U+017F>t you. <hi>Melander</hi> who did not yet know him, as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <U+017F>een him when <U+017F>he was in pri<U+017F>on, as becau<U+017F>e it was now dark, the candle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the other end of the chamber, <U+017F>he knew not what to an<U+017F>wer, unle<U+017F>s in words of civility, and actions which expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her good will; yet <U+017F>till <U+017F>he continued to rai<U+017F>e him up. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> who perceived <U+017F>he did not know him.

Yes Madam (an<U+017F>wered that Cavalier) I am the <U+017F>ame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <hi>Lipandas,</hi> who when he did not know you, did <U+017F>o unworthily treat you, and who now knowing you, does admire your vertue, and beg a pardon for his innocent ignorance. She looked a while upon him, and gave no an<U+017F>wer; at la<U+017F>t, taking him by the hand, yes, yes <hi>Lipandas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do with all my heart par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all the injuries I received from you; and the more willingly, becau<U+017F>e by this means you have given me an occa<U+017F>ion of making my love to <hi>Lidias</hi> appear. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, rai<U+017F>ing him up with more care<U+017F><U+017F>es then ever he expected, <U+017F>he asked him what fortune brought him to that place?

the cau<U+017F>e of his being taken, and that it was he who would have killed <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> out of an opinion that he <U+017F>aw her in danger, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but wonder at this happy encounter: And to let you <U+017F>ee <hi>Lipandas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) that I do not only pardon, but al<U+017F>o forget all the ill u<U+017F>age I received from you, I be<U+017F>eech you Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) to be<U+017F>tow this pri<U+017F>oner upon me. I will not only be<U+017F>tow him (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ligdamon</hi>) but all that I have upon you, but one thing I <U+017F>hall humbly beg of you in exchange, which is, to make him as much my friend, as I am a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Lindamore</hi> and <hi>Clidemant,</hi> unto whom he is <U+017F>o much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I do not know (replyed <hi>Melander</hi>) what acquaintance he has with tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers, but if he have any mind to oblige me, he <U+017F>hall make it appear, in loving and <U+017F>erving all tho<U+017F>e that love them, or have any dependency upon them: For I am as much obliged unto them for their curte<U+017F>ies, as unto him that <U+017F>aved my life, <U+017F>ince being by fortune of War their pri<U+017F>oner, they did not only give me my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but <U+017F>hewed me <U+017F>o many favours, that I was in a capacity to <U+017F>ave the life of <hi>Lidias,</hi> by taking his impri<U+017F>onment upon me. Fair and generous <hi>Melander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Lipandas</hi>) the<U+017F>e words, which are to me inviolable commands, <U+017F>hall be for ever engraved in my memory: and I do profe<U+017F>s and vow my <U+017F>elf as long as I live, a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and all tho<U+017F>e who are lovers of <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore.</hi> Upon this <hi>Ligdamon</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him, I do receive this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of your amity, and do acquaint you, that you are obliged by your vow to <U+017F>erve the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>; as the mother of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> as his Si<U+017F>ter.

Then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) I will <U+017F>pring another Mine as neer yours as I can, that both may meet; in this I <U+017F>ee no difficulty but one, which is, that our Works may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>treight, that they may meet each other: Sir (<U+017F>aid the young man, to morrow about three of the clock in the morning, <U+017F>et a light upon the place where you intend to begin your work, and we will <U+017F>et another upon our hou<U+017F>e, towards which you may work and <U+017F>o we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee which way to direct our cour<U+017F>es.

               <p>Yet Sir, (<U+017F>aid the young man) I am to adverti<U+017F>e you of two things; the one concerns your life, and the other the welfare of your affairs: As for the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath vowed your death, unle<U+017F>s you <U+017F>peedily relea<U+017F>e <hi>Silvia</hi>: This advice Sir, is not to be <U+017F>lighted; for you know he is de<U+017F>perately in love with her: and he that contemns his own life, is ma<U+017F>ter of his enemies.</p>
               <p>The other is Sir, That there are many who yet <U+017F>tand neutral, and are neither for, nor again<U+017F>t you, who are ready to fall unto your enemies <U+017F>ide, becau<U+017F>e they think the war you undertake again<U+017F>t your Soveraign, is unlawful, and without good ground: Now <hi>Meronthes</hi> your faithful <U+017F>ervant thinks it expedient to retain many who yet waver, that you <U+017F>eek out for a <U+017F>pecious pretence, and a hand<U+017F>ome colour for your War; which though it be not altogether true, yet it may have a face and probability of truth: And therefore he thinks it not ami<U+017F>s for you to give it ont. that <hi>Adamas</hi> a<U+017F>pires at the Soveraign Authority and detains the two Nymphs Pri<U+017F>oners; in order to which, he has procured the Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> unto whom he has made mountainous promi<U+017F>es of reward if he compa<U+017F>s his de<U+017F>ign: That likewi<U+017F>e he hath held <U+017F>ecret corre<U+017F>pondencies with Neighbour Princes; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s an unknown Queen that came into <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and left in it many <U+017F>ouldiers. Briefly, by this cour<U+017F>e many things will be imputed unto him, which though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they appear fal<U+017F>e, yet no matter, <U+017F>ince they will <U+017F>erve to blind the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who take only the fir<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of things, and will <U+017F>o declare them<U+017F>elves thereupon, that they cannot afterwards change, though they would.</p>

               <p>Thus <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>ighed away all the night, in giving new a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of the affection which they bore unto each other; and though it was upon a <U+017F>ad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion, yet Love did draw, even out of their mo<U+017F>t bitter tears, mo<U+017F>t incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble con<U+017F>olations. <hi>Alexis</hi> at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing his Shepherde<U+017F>s would not be diverted from the re<U+017F>olution which <U+017F>he had taken, did often think it now time to declare who he was, and to undeceive her in the opinion which <U+017F>he had of his being the daughter of <hi>Adamas</hi>; but yet <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>ideration re<U+017F>trained him: Somtimes he would <U+017F>ay unto him<U+017F>elf, why <U+017F>hould I any longer conceal my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince now we are both at the very brink of death?

For the knowledge of it will either plea<U+017F>e or di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her: If it plea<U+017F>e her, will not her death be more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her? And if it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, why <U+017F>hould I add more grief unto her, when we are both going to die? Thus was he long di<U+017F>puting with him<U+017F>elf; at la<U+017F>t he thought it the fitte<U+017F>t time to declare him<U+017F>elf as he was falling at her feet, thinking that if the tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her commands did offend her, he would wa<U+017F>h away the crime with his blood.</p>

The<U+017F>e fell furiou<U+017F>ly upon them, and they had inevitably been all lo<U+017F>t, if the Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time had not commanded <hi>Damon</hi> to relieve them, <U+017F>allying out with three hundred Archers, and as many Pikes, over a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, by which they might pa<U+017F>s un<U+017F>een as far as the Counter<U+017F>carp. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they came but in time; for all <U+017F>ix were <U+017F>o wounded, that they had nothing but courage to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain them: yet <U+017F>eeing this relief coming, their <U+017F>trengths renewed, and they did not feel their wounds: Every one admired their valour, and were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee what <hi>Celadon</hi> did; for the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s made all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more admirable: His Buckler was <U+017F>tuck <U+017F>o full of arrows, that there was not room for one more; his Sword <U+017F>anguin'd from point to pomel, and him<U+017F>elf wounded in two or three places, e<U+017F>pecially in his right <U+017F>houlder with a <U+017F>pear, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53528:107"/>
which had made a very deep wound: yet for all that, his extream de<U+017F>ire of being revenged for the wrong that was done to <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>port him, that he hardly ever felt it: But all this re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance had been in vain, but for relief which <hi>Damon</hi> brought; which being conducted by <hi>Cera<U+017F>tes</hi> and <hi>Merindor,</hi> did give them time to take a little breath, but not long; for <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>ent a party of a thou<U+017F>and men more, they were forced to retreat to the ditch in a little di<U+017F>order; and <hi>Semires</hi> being wounded in two places with a Pike, he was like to have cau<U+017F>ed the lo<U+017F>s of many, for he could not go, and <hi>Celadon</hi> loth to leave him, the fight renewed in that place more hotly, and more dangerous then all the time before; <U+017F>o as the multitude of enemies were very near giving a total defeat unto all this relief. But <hi>Damon</hi> keeping the enemy off with a <U+017F>tand of Pikes, and they upon the Walls <U+017F>hooting abundance of arrows, and throwing of <U+017F>tones, did keep the enemy <U+017F>o in play; that <hi>Celadon</hi> took <hi>Semires</hi> by one arm, and his brother took him the other, and got him over the ditch, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and <hi>Lipandas</hi> did the <U+017F>ame to <hi>Lidias,</hi> who could not <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain him<U+017F>elf; and they were pre<U+017F>ently after both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto the place where <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was accu<U+017F>tomed to lodge.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who were pulled up the Walls, and in the Town, they were no <U+017F>ooner come to the next Court of Guard, but <hi>Leonide</hi> who had beeen a <U+017F>pectator of all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, came running unto them, as well to embrace her companion, as to know whether that Druide was <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> or <hi>Alexis.</hi> As <U+017F>he went, by chance <U+017F>he met <hi>Adamas,</hi> who for all the great affairs that he had in hand, came to take <U+017F>uch order that <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hould not be known, thinking that if <hi>Galathea</hi> came to <U+017F>ee him, <U+017F>he would enter into <U+017F>ome ill opinion of him: The ha<U+017F>te wherein he was, would not permit him any long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but only told her, he would have the Druide carried pre<U+017F>ently unto his Lodging, and let none <U+017F>peak with her, and afterwards all fitting orders <U+017F>hould be taken.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>aw <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>he embraced her with abundance of joy, and <hi>Leonide</hi> was glad to <U+017F>ee her out of the hands of <hi>Polemas</hi>: But <hi>Leonide</hi> having an earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire to talk with the Druide; my dear companion (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>) <hi>Galathea</hi> has a mo<U+017F>t longing de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>peak with you; go therefore unto her, whil<U+017F>t I wait upon this woman unto my Uncles lodging; for I perceive <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o affrighted, that I would not have <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>ee her in this condition: Upon this taking <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by the hand, <U+017F>he carried her almo<U+017F>t by force unto the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Adamas</hi>; for <U+017F>he had no mind to be from the Wall, until <U+017F>he knew what was become of <hi>Alexis</hi>: But <hi>Leonide</hi> made her believe, that <U+017F>he was already in the Town, being come in at the Sally port, out of which the Relief went. In the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> being told that all tho<U+017F>e who went out, wete return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, he ran unto the Port to receive <hi>Celadon</hi>; and he came ju<U+017F>t in the nick of time; for that Shepherd was no <U+017F>ooner entred into the Town, but his lo<U+017F>s of blood made him fall into a <U+017F>woon, with <hi>Semires,</hi> who was in a wor<U+017F>e condition then he<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> commanded he <U+017F>hould be pre<U+017F>ently carried unto his Lodging: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no notice of carrying <hi>Semires</hi> with <hi>Celadon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he knew him not; Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Semires</hi> unto him with much pain) it was I that <U+017F>aved <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you let me be carried where he is, that I may die neer them. <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing him name <hi>Celadon,</hi> and fearing left he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover who <hi>Alexis</hi> was, he pre<U+017F>ently commanded they <U+017F>hould be both carried together unto his Lodgings. It was well that at the <U+017F>ame time a hot Alarm was given on all <U+017F>ides; for upon it, <hi>Damon,</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t, ran as fa<U+017F>t as they could to make defence, never minding what <hi>Semires</hi> <U+017F>aid.</p>
               <p>The Alarm was no fal<U+017F>e one, for <hi>Polemas</hi> being almo<U+017F>t out of his wits at the lo<U+017F>s of his pri<U+017F>oners, he gave the <U+017F>igne to make a general A<U+017F><U+017F>ault, as he did the day precedent, and which was <U+017F>o hotly pur<U+017F>ued, that nothing would make them retreat but night, which then he did, with the lo<U+017F>t of many men for which much he cared not, <U+017F>o he could but at la<U+017F>t find revenge: But the darkne<U+017F>s of the night cau<U+017F>ing him to <U+017F>ound a retreat, every one retired to his Quarter, finding now that the Town was not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily entred as <hi>Polemas</hi> ra<U+017F>hly imagined, never con<U+017F>idering that the weakne<U+017F>s of the Walls were <U+017F>trongly fortified by the valour and courage of <U+017F>o many brave men as were within.

               <p>Upon this <hi>Diana</hi> broke out again into <U+017F>ighs and tears, which moved <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>o much, that he re<U+017F>olved immediately either to die or recover <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>: and in order thereunto, he went unto the Shepherds, who were pre<U+017F>ent at the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Fle, fle, ye cowards (<U+017F>aid he unto them) could you <U+017F>uffer this injury in your <U+017F>ight? would you not defend <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> as long as there was one drop of blood in your bodies: Shepherd (<U+017F>aid one of the company unto him) it was done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to help it. The number of tho<U+017F>e that carried her away, was treble ours; and they were upon hor<U+017F>es and armed, but we on foot without any arms but our <U+017F>heep-hooks, Was not that enough?

                  <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing that <hi>Alexis</hi> did run her <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>o much danger to relieve this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, their <U+017F>orrows redoubled, out of their apprehen<U+017F>ions of <U+017F>ome harm that might happen unto her: Mean time, <hi>Silvander</hi> in an audible voice that all the Shepherds might hear him: Come, <U+017F>aid he, mu<U+017F>t we <U+017F>it <U+017F>till samely, and put up this affront without re<U+017F>entment? For my part, I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved, either to die or be revenged upon the<U+017F>e Rogues. Such a <U+017F>tain <U+017F>hall not lie upon me, and my reputation: He had no <U+017F>ooner uttered the<U+017F>e words. but all the Shepherds, who being de<U+017F>cended from generous Ance<U+017F>tours, had courages much above their quality, they all cried out in a loud voice, that they would lo<U+017F>e their lives in the quarrel. <hi>Silvander</hi> was extreamly glad to hear their re<U+017F>olutions, and more when one of them de<U+017F>ired him in the name of all the company, that he would be their Captain, telling him that they had great confidence in his courage and conduct, and that they <U+017F>tood in need of <U+017F>uch a one to teach them what to do in <U+017F>uch an imployment. <hi>Silvander</hi> at fir<U+017F>t refu<U+017F>ed, but being earne<U+017F>tly <U+017F>olicited, he took upon him the honour and charge of being their commander.</p>
               <p>When he was ready to depart and follow after tho<U+017F>e who had carried away <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strea,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elf he <U+017F>hould by <U+017F>ome means or other hear of their retreat; and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es (<U+017F>aid he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them and <U+017F>hewed them tho<U+017F>e Shepherds) here are brave <U+017F>pirits that are re<U+017F>olv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repair that <U+017F>hame that might be imputed to us, for <U+017F>uffering your compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be thus carried away: we will follow our de<U+017F>tinies; and if heaven favour our de<U+017F>ign, you will <U+017F>hortly turn your tears into joyes, at <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> liberty. <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing this, <U+017F>he could not enough admire <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a Metamorpho<U+017F>is, which in a moment turned a company of Shepherds into a company of Souldiers, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the judgement of her companion upon it, <U+017F>he perceived her to look pale, and doubted that it did trouble her <U+017F>o as giving her the opportunity of telling him her mind concerning his <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty departure, <U+017F>he withdrew two or three paces: And then<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                  <hi>Diana</hi> thinking that none could hear her, <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) what do you intend to do?

Then <U+017F>ervant (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) pray tell me what your de<U+017F>ign is? You that have <U+017F>o often condemned ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e in another, can you be <U+017F>o guilty of it your <U+017F>elf?

Methinks <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, you <U+017F>hould more <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly weigh the<U+017F>e things, and <U+017F>omething <U+017F>atisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire that I have, you <U+017F>hould not attempt things impertinently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> hearkened unto <hi>Diana</hi> with abundance of contentment, yet being a little too impatient, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, though my ruine were inevitable, and though I were <U+017F>ure my de<U+017F>igne would find no favourable <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e; yet would it be much glory to <U+017F>pend my blood and my life<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in endeavouring to re<U+017F>tore that contentment unto you, which is <U+017F>o unfortunately ravi<U+017F>hed away. And therefore without thinking whether it be pertinent or no, I ought to fall upon it: for I know, that though the execution prove not pro<U+017F>perous, yet the de<U+017F>igne at lea<U+017F>t is honourable, <U+017F>ince it aims at re<U+017F>toring unto you your companion<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> without whom I know you cannot enjoy any contentment in the world. Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> then) you force me to make a <U+017F>trange confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay I do love <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and were I out of hopes ever to <U+017F>ee her again, I <U+017F>hould grieve extreamly; but withall, con<U+017F>ider <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I do not hate you, and perhaps if you and <U+017F>he were weighed together, in the <U+017F>cales of my affection, you would out bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance her.

               <p>The Shepherd thought <hi>Dianas</hi> judgement to be good, and that there was no rea<U+017F>on for him to follow <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> before he had communicated it unto <hi>Phocion,</hi> who was her Uncle, It was then re<U+017F>olved upon to go unto his hou<U+017F>e, and by the way, they met with all tho<U+017F>e Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es who accompanied <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi> to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and returned not in three or four days; After the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they were told of the accident that had hapned unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi> followed her; at which they were all extreamly grieved: For <U+017F>uch was the beauty and goodne<U+017F>s of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that never any <U+017F>aw her, but loved her beyond mea<U+017F>ure. But <hi>Licidas</hi> who was one among<U+017F>t them, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Phillis</hi>: I verily believe (<U+017F>aid he unto her in a low voice) that the Gods have puni<U+017F>hed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for the wrong which <U+017F>he did unto <hi>Celadon</hi>: For I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider it well, Was ever <U+017F>uch an accident as this heard of in this Country before now? It is to be pre<U+017F>umed, that it is a revenge ab<U+017F>olutely determined by Fate; for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> or you might as well have been carried away as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>; and yet the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has only fallen upon her, as mo<U+017F>t culpable. Certainly (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis</hi>) the Gods did pardon my companion for the death of <hi>Celadon,</hi> when (for the Re<U+017F>t of his <U+017F>oul) <U+017F>he erected an empty Tomb for him; and mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly there is <U+017F>ome other hidden my<U+017F>terie in the action of the<U+017F>e Thieves. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they came unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Phocion,</hi> whom they found in a melancholy <U+017F>tudy, walking before his hou<U+017F>e; and his wonder was not a little, when he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o great a company coming towards him: At fir<U+017F>t he received them as kindly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, compo<U+017F>ing his countenance <U+017F>o, as he did not <U+017F>hew the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s of his <U+017F>oul: But when he had <U+017F>aluted <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and did not <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t thing he asked, was, where <U+017F>he was? None dur<U+017F>t give him any an<U+017F>wer; But <hi>Sylvander</hi> con<U+017F>idering that he mu<U+017F>t know of the accident, and that it was as good to acquaint him betimes with it, as to defer it any longer; he took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide, and de<U+017F>iring <hi>Thamires</hi> to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him in the office, he related unto him in few words, the di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter that had hapned unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea. Phocion</hi> who loved her as his own <U+017F>oul, received this news like an arre<U+017F>t of death; but <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Sylvander</hi> gave him <U+017F>uch cordials, that at length he recollected him<U+017F>elf, and like a man of a <U+017F>ound and perfect judgment, did think it better to employ the time in remedy, then in complaints. And all <U+017F>etting them<U+017F>elves to con<U+017F>ult what cour<U+017F>e was be<U+017F>t, a way was no <U+017F>ooner propounded, but they <U+017F>aw a Shepherd running towards them as fa<U+017F>t as he could; and when he was come within ken, his countenance <U+017F>eemed as if he had <U+017F>ome me<U+017F><U+017F>age of great concernment; which cau<U+017F>ed them all to keep <U+017F>ilence, and look upon him: At la<U+017F>t <hi>Licidas</hi> went to meet him, and returning, told <hi>Phocion,</hi> that this Shepherd was come to <U+017F>peak with him. The aged Pa<U+017F>tor took him a<U+017F>ide, and asked the man his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and what it was which brought him thither in that ha<U+017F>te. Unto which the Shepherd an<U+017F>wered in the<U+017F>e terms: Father (for <U+017F>o every one called him by rea<U+017F>on of his age) I have been at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> our grand Druide, but not finding him at home, I thought you the fitte<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on in all our parts, to be acquainted with what I have <U+017F>een, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becau<U+017F>e it being nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to look unto the pre<U+017F>ervation of our Towns, Hou<U+017F>es, and Families, there is none better able to do it then you. I mu<U+017F>t acquaint you therefore, that as I was looking to my Flock near Mount <hi>Verdune,</hi> I <U+017F>aw all the Plain of <hi>Marcelles</hi> covered with armed men, who <U+017F>hot whole clouds of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows into the Town, and have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it about on all <U+017F>ides: I <U+017F>aw al<U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e within the Town did come forth, and meeting with the enemy, made a long fight: I not having <U+017F>o much patience as to <U+017F>tay to <U+017F>ee the difference ended, I thought it better for us to look to our <U+017F>elves, and therefore came as fa<U+017F>t as ever

I could to acquaint you, in hopes that your prudence would direct us in the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to prevent <U+017F>uch misfortunes as may fall upon us and our flocks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phocion</hi> was a little <U+017F>urprized at the report of this Shepherd, yet having heard <U+017F>ome few dayes before that <hi>Polemas</hi> did <U+017F>ecretly levy all the men he could, he pre<U+017F>ently concluded that his rebellion was broken forth, and that he had made an attempt upon <hi>Marcelles</hi>; but being unwilling to declare his thoughts before the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him with many thanks for his care, and a promi<U+017F>e to be very vigilant in the prevention of any di<U+017F>orders which <U+017F>eemed to menace them. The Shepherd being gone, <hi>Phocion</hi> turned towards <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and taking them by each hand, he began to walk in the middle, and to <U+017F>ay thus unto them. I need not now ask who were the ravi<U+017F>hers of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> nor where <U+017F>he is detained: for this Shepherd hath a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that <hi>Marcelles</hi> is be<U+017F>ieged, and none being able to offer this violence but <hi>Polemas,</hi> I believe none but he would haue been the Authour of this wicked action committed again<U+017F>t this young Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e; but this that hath hapned unto her is a warning to us all, and bids us look unto our <U+017F>elves: and in lieu of delivering <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to recommend her unto the tuition of Tautates, and to <U+017F>eek out for <U+017F>ome place of <U+017F>afety for our <U+017F>elves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t this rebellious Cavalier.</p>
               <p>This was the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Phocion,</hi> unto which <hi>Thamires</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that the report of this Shepherd was very probable, and <U+017F>uited with the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions they had of <hi>Polemas</hi>; that he had heard <U+017F>ome whi<U+017F>pers of it in <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it be<U+017F>t to recommend all unto <hi>He<U+017F>us</hi> the Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant God, and get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trong hou<U+017F>e or Ca<U+017F>tle, to defend them<U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch violences as might be offered unto their per<U+017F>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> began then to <U+017F>peak: if we retire our <U+017F>elves into any place (<U+017F>aid he) it ought not to be unto any other place but <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where we may be <U+017F>ervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and imploy our courages in defending her again<U+017F>t the injuries of her enemies: For my part (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phocion</hi>) I think it to be the mo<U+017F>t honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cour<U+017F>e we can take, and then if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> be in the hands of <hi>Polemas,</hi> I will <U+017F>ummon him, either to re<U+017F>tore her unto me, or to fight with me: though I have long di<U+017F>continued the exerci<U+017F>e of arms, I have not yet quite forgot the u<U+017F>e of them; and though age have a little abated me of my younger <U+017F>trength, yet will my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <U+017F>upply that fault.</p>

Amid<U+017F>t all their <U+017F>orrows, it was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port to <U+017F>ee <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> <U+017F>cour up his old ru<U+017F>ty arms, that had not <U+017F>een day of at lea<U+017F>t an age before. <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> were afflicted with a certain fear of <U+017F>ome misfortunes that might befall <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Licidas</hi>; but when they con<U+017F>idered, that there was no other means to prevent their carrying away as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was, they patienty <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them<U+017F>elves unto <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity as could not be avoided. When the Sun was at the hight of the day, the Shepherds who were appointed to Rendezvous at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Phocion,</hi> began to flock from all <U+017F>ides: before night they were all a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embled, and the number of them appeared to be a hundred and fifty: This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced <hi>Silvander,</hi> and particularly <hi>Phocion,</hi> who now thought him<U+017F>elf able, if need were, to make a very con<U+017F>iderable defence.

               <p>In a little <U+017F>pace, <hi>Phocion</hi> perceived the Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and though the place which they were to de<U+017F>cend, was very rough and difficult; yet they got o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the little river without any harm, for the night was not <U+017F>o dark but they could find the paths, and <U+017F>ee where to tread and hold them<U+017F>elves upon the rocks, over which they were to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. As <U+017F>oon as they came to the place from whence <hi>Phocion</hi> <U+017F>aid they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hoot in the Letters; <hi>Silvander, Hylas, Thamires,</hi> and <hi>Licidas,</hi> did take the bows which they had given unto <hi>Diana, Phillis, Stella,</hi> and <hi>Celidea,</hi> they tye<U+017F>t the Letters unto the piles of the arrows, and <U+017F>hot them into the Town <U+017F>everal wayes.

               <p>The Druide pre<U+017F>ently found out the ingenuity of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and knew that <U+017F>o many Letters to one purpo<U+017F>e, was only for fear left any <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>carry: <U+017F>o as de<U+017F>iring to <U+017F>end them all <U+017F>peedy relief, he went unto the Nymph as fa<U+017F>t as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, to communicate the Letter unto the Nymph, and found her preparing her <U+017F>elf to go and vi<U+017F>it <hi>Alexis,</hi> but he diverted her, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he deferred her vi<U+017F>it until the next morning. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> thought it very fit to receive <hi>Phocion,</hi> and told <hi>Adamas,</hi> that if he wanted any Forces, he <U+017F>hould acquaint Prince <hi>Godomar</hi> with his de<U+017F>ires, which he did; and the Prince hearing that <hi>Phocion</hi> was there, and enquiring who he, and all that came with him were, he was very glad of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would go him<U+017F>elf to bring them into the Town. Mo<U+017F>t of the Souldiers were either wounded, or weary with fighting; but as <U+017F>oon as ever they heard of <hi>Phocions</hi> de<U+017F>igne, they offered to obey the Prince in what<U+017F>oever he would plea<U+017F>e to command them. <hi>Godomar</hi> mounted <hi>Alcander</hi> with tho<U+017F>e that followed the Queen <hi>Argira,</hi> and were left with the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> only to di<U+017F>cover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any Trea<U+017F>on in the de<U+017F>igne: But it being told him that <hi>Polemas</hi> was quite retired, and that there appeared no enemy near the Town, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alcander</hi> to go unto the place where <hi>Phocion</hi> was, and Guad him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into the Town: <hi>Alcander</hi> obeyed the Princes order, and turning a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the left hand, he went down as far as the little River; he had not gone forty paces, but he e<U+017F>pied the Troop which he was to Guard; and left he <U+017F>hould give them too terrible an Alarm, he <U+017F>ent two Hor<U+017F>emen to adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Phocion</hi> of his coming: The good old man no <U+017F>ooner heard that <hi>Alcander</hi> was come to guard them, but he acquainted <hi>Hylas, Licidas,</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and afterwards all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went to meet him. <hi>Alcander</hi> alighted to <U+017F>alute <hi>Phocion,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently taking hor<U+017F>e again, he commanded half of his Troop to march towards the Town; then de<U+017F>iring <hi>Phocion</hi> to follow, he would bring up the Arrear him<U+017F>elf with the other half. Thus they came to the Town; <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>tayed at the Gate in expectation of them; and the one half of <hi>Alcanders</hi> Troop being entred, <hi>Phocion</hi> appeared, whom the Druide received with cordial care<U+017F><U+017F>es. But <U+017F>ince al this could not be done <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, and with <U+017F>o little noi<U+017F>e, but <hi>Polemas</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be adverti<U+017F>ed of it: <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner entred with the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es &amp; that fifty which he conducted, but they heard <hi>Alcander</hi> engaged with the enemy. <hi>Sylvander</hi> faced about with his company, and went immediately to relieve the Cavalier: <hi>Alcidon</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>allyed out with two hundred Archers; <hi>Phocion,</hi> do what <hi>Adamas</hi> could, would

needs do the like: but all this needed not, for the noi<U+017F>e immediately cea<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alcander</hi> had taken <hi>Peledontes</hi> pri<U+017F>oner, and tho<U+017F>e that followed him, who were not above thirty Hor<U+017F>e, fled all away, when they <U+017F>aw the inequality of the number.

               <p>After the Druide had <U+017F>een the Gates of the Town <U+017F>hut, he carried away his new gue<U+017F>ts; and <hi>Alcander</hi> committed <hi>Pelidontes</hi> to a place of <U+017F>ecurity, intending to pre<U+017F>ent him unto the Nymph in the morning. <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> having now nothing in their minds but the lo<U+017F>s of their companion, they asked <hi>Adamas</hi> by the way. whether he heard any thing of <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi>: To which he an<U+017F>wered in <U+017F>o faint a manner, as made them think he knew nothing that was good concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: He told them, that the la<U+017F>t news he heard of them was, that they were pri<U+017F>oners unto <hi>Polimas,</hi> and that they received very har<U+017F>h entertainment from him.

Whil<U+017F>t they were in the mid<U+017F>t of their mutual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>es, the Druide left them, with a promi<U+017F>e of returning pre<U+017F>ently again, and he went unto the chamber of <hi>Alexis,</hi> where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was; for <U+017F>ay what the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions would, <hi>Celadon</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to part from him: And after he had been a while with them, he told them of the arrival of <hi>Phocion, Sylvander, Hylas, Licidas, Thamires,</hi> and at la<U+017F>t, of <hi>Diana, Phillis,</hi> and other Shepherde<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es of Forre<U+017F>t: at which <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be very glad, but e<U+017F>pecially <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who hearing that <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> were in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> be<U+017F>eeched her Mi<U+017F>tris to let her go and bid them welcome. <hi>Alexis</hi> con<U+017F>ented, upon condition <U+017F>he would bring them into her chamber; and though <hi>Adamas</hi> was at fir<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t it, by rea<U+017F>on of his wounds, yet at la<U+017F>t he con<U+017F>ented<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> upon condition al<U+017F>o they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay but a while, and that they <U+017F>hould be in another chamber, <U+017F>ince it was not hand<U+017F>ome they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of his wounds which he received in the fight. <hi>Celadan</hi> obeyed what<U+017F>oever <hi>Adamas</hi> de<U+017F>ired, and then the Druide taking <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by the hand, he carried her to the chamber door where her companions were; and de<U+017F>iring her not to enter until a while after him, as <U+017F>oon as he was come to <hi>Diana,</hi> You <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee here one (<U+017F>aid he unto her) whom you little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to meet, and one who perhaps you will love when you know her: Upon this <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> entred, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>al did <U+017F>o amuze them, that they could hardly <U+017F>alute each other.

               <p>Then he carried <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> unto the chamber where <hi>Alexis</hi> was; and though <U+017F>he was full of pain, e<U+017F>pecially by rea<U+017F>on of a wound which <U+017F>he received in her <U+017F>houlder, yet <U+017F>he received them with <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F>pect, as te<U+017F>tified abundance of joy to <U+017F>ee them. Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was not long, for it was late, and their <U+017F>tay

might have been prejudicial to the health of <hi>Celadon</hi>; therefore <hi>Leonide</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into their chamber, they all <U+017F>ate down upon the bed, where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> made a punctual relation of every pa<U+017F><U+017F>age that had hapned unto her <U+017F>ince the time of her taking away.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Phocion, Licidas,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, whom <hi>Clindor</hi> entertained, all heard what brave exploits <hi>Alexis</hi> had done in the habit of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>: and <hi>Phocion</hi> was <U+017F>o joyed to hear of his Neeces deliverance, that had it not been very late, and un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to trouble <hi>Adamas</hi> at that time of the night, he would have gone to <U+017F>ee her that very hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had already vi<U+017F>ited almo<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e who were wounded in the la<U+017F>t a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ault; and among<U+017F>t all the di<U+017F>contents which <U+017F>he received at the in<U+017F>olency of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas,</hi> it was no <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>olation unto her, to con<U+017F>ider how many brave men were armed in her defence. But <hi>Polemas</hi> was almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tark mad, as well at the lo<U+017F>s which he had received in the two a<U+017F><U+017F>aults, as at the taking of <hi>Pelidontes</hi>; being come into his chamber, and unwilling that any <U+017F>hould be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of his de<U+017F>pair; as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf alone, he threw his hat upon the Table, <U+017F>cratched his head with one hand, and thumped his brea<U+017F>t with the other, then walked up and down the room a great pace; at la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>topped upon a <U+017F>udden, and <U+017F>tamped upon the floor with his foot. Will ye alwaies be my enemies, Oh ye Gods! who di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of Scepters and Crowns (<U+017F>aid he) Is my ambition to have <U+017F>ome Empiredome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <U+017F>pirit of that Beauty <U+017F>o great a crime, that Love, and the perfections of <hi>Galathea</hi> will never pardon it? Though there be a Law which forbids what I have done, and renders my Arms unju<U+017F>t; yet, Am I the fir<U+017F>t that has violated that Law, Or, whom you have let go unpuni<U+017F>hed? Then beginning to walk again: But (<U+017F>aid he) this Nymph does not love me, <hi>Lindamore</hi> is Lord of her thoughts, as <U+017F>he is Lady of his liberty: Mo<U+017F>t of my men are murdred, burned, and defeated, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> perhaps will not a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me, <hi>Alexis</hi> is e<U+017F>caped, <hi>Pelidontes</hi> is pri<U+017F>oner, Oh mo<U+017F>t cruel Gods!

How wilt thou compo<U+017F>e into order this Chaos of thy affairs? Upon this, ca<U+017F>ting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf upon his bed, he called for him that waited in his chamber, and commanded him to go for <hi>Ligonias</hi>; who as <U+017F>oon as he entred, was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee <hi>Polemas</hi> in that po<U+017F>ture wherein he found him; one leg lay a cro<U+017F>s over one knee, one hand upon his bre<U+017F>t, and the other with a handkerchief wiping his eyes, which the <U+017F>ire of his love and anger together had made extreamly red; and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>poke not a word unto <hi>Ligonias,</hi> but lay <U+017F>adly in this manner a long while; Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> unto him) perhaps you have a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to take <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t. So I have (<U+017F>aid he, and turned towards him) I do <U+017F>eek for re<U+017F>t, and would buy it at the price of my blood: but I fear it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to find it, unle<U+017F>s in my grave. Upon this <hi>Polemas</hi> fetched a profound <U+017F>igh, and <hi>Ligonias</hi> with a cold countenance <U+017F>aid thus unto him.</p>
               <p>The truth is Sir, you have to do with <U+017F>tronger enemies then ever you imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet with: Is it not a miracle that a Prince<U+017F>s whom we thought de<U+017F>titute of all humane a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>hould in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time have her Town <U+017F>o full of valiant men, as it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to take it without the favour of <U+017F>ome Forrain help? Ah <hi>Ligonias</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) 'Tis true indeed, I have very potent enemies; but tho<U+017F>e whom I mo<U+017F>t fear, are the Gods, and <hi>Galathea.</hi> I am not <U+017F>o well read in the book of Fate (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ligonias</hi>) as to know what de<U+017F>tiny the Gods have ordained you, but the very truth is, <hi>Galathea</hi> has no great cau<U+017F>e to love you; for can you think to oblige her, by doing the very <U+017F>ame things that are proper to make a mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Does <U+017F>laves u<U+017F>e to hold their Lords in captivity? Why, you do kill her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <U+017F>trike at her, and are as carele<U+017F>s in ob<U+017F>erving her Laws as any Satyre: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s (and I be<U+017F>eech you pardon the freedom of my language) that this de<U+017F>igne has too geat a tincture of tyrannie; and your cau<U+017F>e having no pillars of Ju<U+017F>tice to underprop it, you had need be very careful that it fall not upon your head, and ruine you. Upon this <hi>Ligonias</hi> held his peace, and <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>poke. I <U+017F>hould think (<U+017F>aid he) that I have greatly offended the Gods, if the greate<U+017F>t of them all had not connfe<U+017F><U+017F>ed me to u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e violences again<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>: Love is the only Author of

               <p>As concerning the <U+017F>trength of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I have re<U+017F>olved upon your departure to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow with <hi>Alerantes,</hi> to conjure and <U+017F>olicite <hi>Gondebaut</hi> about ha<U+017F>ting away tho<U+017F>e Auxiliaries which he hath promi<U+017F>ed: for if they come in time, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t us; perhaps we <U+017F>hall do <U+017F>omething in the mean time, for if my de<U+017F>igne with <hi>Meronthes</hi> hit hand<U+017F>omly, doubtle<U+017F>s before your return I <U+017F>hall be ma<U+017F>ter of the place, and of <hi>Galathea</hi> al<U+017F>o: Nothing goes <U+017F>o near my heart as the taking of <hi>Peledon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and certainly it had been better if he had been le<U+017F>s valiant and more prudent; for he was much to blame in fighting with the enemy, when I <U+017F>ent him only to di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, e<U+017F>pecially having not above thirty or fourty hor<U+017F>e, and the enemy doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ix times the number.

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was in her chamber with <hi>Godomar, Damon, Alcidon,</hi> and almo<U+017F>t all the Nymphs and Ladies that were then in <hi>Marcelles:</hi> and becau<U+017F>e it was yet too <U+017F>oon to go to bed, the Nymph commanded <hi>Silvia</hi> to relate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of her impri<U+017F>onment, and how <U+017F>he liked the entertainment of <hi>Polemas.</hi> The young Nymphs interceded to excu<U+017F>e her, becau<U+017F>e they thought <U+017F>he could not make a right relation, without interweaving the cau<U+017F>es of her complaint again<U+017F>t <hi>Ligdamon.</hi> But being obliged to obey the command of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and <U+017F>olicited by <hi>Godomar</hi> <U+017F>he made a relation of it unto them, yet with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion as <U+017F>he did not at all touch upon her relation to <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> but that Cavalier by chance coming in to do his reverence unto her, for he had not yet <U+017F>een her <U+017F>ince the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of her liberty, <U+017F>he changed colour two or three times, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her <U+017F>elf into another room, none taking any notice of her but <hi>Leonide:</hi> for the eyes of all the company were wholly upon <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who<U+017F>e hand<U+017F>ome grace, and becoming carriage, did where<U+017F>oever he came beget e<U+017F>teem and admiration.

As <U+017F>oon as ever he was over the ditch, he began to walk as if both his legs

were broken, and the night being already far <U+017F>pent, and the affairs of <hi>Polemas</hi> were in great di<U+017F>order, as well by rea<U+017F>on of his repul<U+017F>e, as the taking of <hi>Pelidon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> it was long before any of the Army took any notice of him: At la<U+017F>t, he was met by ten or twelve Souldiers very well mounted, whom <hi>Polemas</hi> had <U+017F>ent out to <U+017F>cout, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed by a Salley: As <U+017F>oon as ever they <U+017F>aw him, they <U+017F>et him behind one on hor<U+017F>eback, and intended to carry him unto <hi>Polemas.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as the crafty <hi>Philiander</hi> <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf in this condition, By th' Faith of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (<U+017F>aid he) I thank you with all my heart; for, but for your kindne<U+017F>s to me, I could not have gotten thither in two days: as he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he leaned fir<U+017F>t on one <U+017F>ide, and then on another, as if he had never been on hor<U+017F>eback before: he was <U+017F>o very trouble<U+017F>ome unto him that carried him, that after he had bid him hold fa<U+017F>t a hundred times, and <U+017F>eeing that he could not, he let him <U+017F>lide off the hor<U+017F>e, to the ground, on which he fell all along, as if he had been dead. What <U+017F>hould we do with this <U+017F>illy fellow (<U+017F>aid he that let him fall) who takes that for a curte<U+017F>ie which were enough to affright any other to death, that is not as innocent as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf? No matter (an<U+017F>wered one of his companions) <U+017F>ince we have taken him, we mu<U+017F>t carry him; and though he be never <U+017F>o innocent, we <U+017F>hould be to blame, and perhaps <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected of trea<U+017F>on, if we do not carry him to <hi>Polemas</hi> Upon this, three of the company alighted, and lifted up <hi>Phliiander</hi> behind a fourth; then taking two gyrths, they tied the legs under the belly of the Hor<U+017F>e with one, and tied his arms about him behind whom he rid, with the other.</p>
               <p>He was no <U+017F>onner brought before <hi>Polemas,</hi> but <U+017F>eeing many velvet chairs in the chamber, he claps him down upon one, and counterfeiting him<U+017F>elf full of pain and wearine<U+017F>s, This great ill favoured bea<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he in a doleful tone) has jogged all my bones in pieces, but they have made me amends in bringing me among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many fine <U+017F>oft chairs; by my <U+017F>ay, would all our oxen could go as fa<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he, and dried his eyes upon his <U+017F>leeve, and looked upon <hi>Polemas</hi> with an innocent <U+017F>imple look) for if they could, our lond would be <U+017F>ooner tilled, and <U+017F>ave us mickle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Polemas,</hi> as little cau<U+017F>e as he had to laugh, yet could not forbear, when he <U+017F>aw how innocently the man did <U+017F>it him down in the chair, and being moved to pity him, commanded that none <U+017F>hould do him any harm; but de<U+017F>iring to make him<U+017F>elf a little merry with him, he called for a candle, and went neerer unto him, then looking a while upon him, he asked from whence he came? From whence do I come? <U+017F>aid <hi>Philiander,</hi> why, I came from <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where I have been put to more pain in two days, then ever I was in all my life; for they tied a <U+017F>word to my <U+017F>ide, and made me hold a long piece of iron in my hand, that was fuller of nails then my <U+017F>hooes. Well, well (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) what news in <hi>Marcelles</hi>: I know not (an<U+017F>wered he) but as long as I was there, it <U+017F>tood in the <U+017F>ame place it was wont to do. I mean (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) what are they doing there, and how <U+017F>quares go? For ought I <U+017F>aw (<U+017F>aid <hi>Philiander</hi>) they do there as they do here; every one goes upon their legs. But (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> and laughed heartily) how did you get out? I'll tell you all I know (an<U+017F>wered the Pe<U+017F>ant) they put me into a little round hou<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>tands among<U+017F>t many <U+017F>tones that are on the walls, and are made like windows; and he that put me there, bade me look about me on every <U+017F>ide, and if I <U+017F>aw any coming, that I <U+017F>hould make a <U+017F>igne to him; when he was gone, and left me there with that great piece of iron in my hand, I fell fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep: Now I know not what they did after, nor how I got out of the place where they put me; but as <U+017F>oon as ever I waked, I found my <U+017F>elf under the walls, with my legs, and my arms, and all my body brui<U+017F>ed to pieces, pox on't, I feel it yet: <hi>Philiander</hi> did act all the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>o to the life, <U+017F>omtimes rowling up the brims of an old hat that he wore, <U+017F>omtimes putting his fingers into a hole that was in it, and <U+017F>till keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chair, as if he had taken eternal po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of it, that <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>eeing and ob<U+017F>erving all this, he broke out into <U+017F>uch extremity of laughter, that he made all about him do the like. And knowing what belonged unto war, he very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood all that <hi>Philiander</hi> <U+017F>aid, he ea<U+017F>ily knew that the round hou<U+017F>e whereof he <U+017F>poke was a Tower, and that the windows were Battlements, and that he being placed there as a Sentinel, they threw him over the walls when they found him a<U+017F>leep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:53528:114"/>That which mo<U+017F>t helped <hi>Polemas</hi> to deceive him<U+017F>elf was his knowledge that there was abundance of Pe<U+017F>ants went at fir<U+017F>t into <hi>Marcelles,</hi> many of which being very <U+017F>illy and ignorant in <U+017F>uch matters, might be well capable of <U+017F>uch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>takes. This made him more apt to pity the <U+017F>illine<U+017F><U+017F>e of this <U+017F>imple fellow; <U+017F>o as cau<U+017F>ing a piece of money to be given unto him, he fell upon <U+017F>erious thoughts, and commanded they <U+017F>hould let him go. <hi>Philiander</hi> was very glad to <U+017F>ee his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting thrive <U+017F>o well, made two or three leggs according to the countrey mode, and went unto the next Town, where he furni<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elf with all things requi<U+017F>ite for his journey. All this while <hi>Fleurial</hi> was making all the ha<U+017F>t he could, for he travelled both night and day without any <U+017F>leep: by fortune, when he was beyond <hi>Moulins,</hi> he met many Souldiers upon the way, and enquiring of one whether they went, he under<U+017F>tood they came from the Army of <hi>Childerick,</hi> where they had born Arms under the commands of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and that now they were returning into the countrey of the Sebu<U+017F>tans, the place of their birth. As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Fleurial</hi> heard the name of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he was joyed at heart, and hoped for good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e in his journey; and enquiring further where that Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier was; he was an<U+017F>wered that he would be at <hi>Moulins</hi> within two dayes: This an<U+017F>wer was good news to <hi>Fleurial,</hi> and made him turn back to <hi>Moulins</hi> where <hi>Lindamor</hi> came according to appointment. As <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw <hi>Fleurial</hi> he asked him the cau<U+017F>e of his voyage: and <hi>Fleurial</hi> pre<U+017F>enting unto him the Letters from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi>; Sir, <U+017F>aid he, I believe the<U+017F>e papers will give you a better accompt then I can: <hi>Lindamor</hi> took them, and retiring apart, he opened that from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and found it thus written.</p>

               <p>The Cavalier thought this to be the be<U+017F>t expedient he could chu<U+017F>e: <U+017F>o as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paid all his Souldiers, and asked them whether they would continue <U+017F>till un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, there was not one who thought it not an honour to <U+017F>erve him: And therefore he re<U+017F>olved to go and relieve <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te, and vowed not to take any re<U+017F>t until he had done that Prince<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice worthy of his valour; but his had been very <U+017F>mall if it did not <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>e that of <hi>Polemas</hi> all that while, and particularly that night wherein <hi>Peledontes</hi> was taken: for though he lay upon the bed with endeavour to <U+017F>leey, yet could he not reconcile his eyes, and before he could compo<U+017F>e the ingratitude of his mind, the night was gone.</p>
               <p>The Moon <U+017F>hined very clear, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> waking in the middle of the night, and having no mind to <U+017F>leep again, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e out of her bed and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was there <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>tudy a little, at la<U+017F>t upon a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, as this night will not be long, <U+017F>o mine methinks ought not to be eternal, and then I <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>olation. But, what a de<U+017F>perate condition is mine? for my <U+017F>un once <U+017F>et will never ri<U+017F>e again: afterwards fetching a mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <U+017F>igh. Ah <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) is it a <U+017F>igne of love or hatred, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer my <U+017F>elf to live <U+017F>o long after I have been the cau<U+017F>e of thy death? Alas I am afraid it is a te<U+017F>timony of hatred in thee, <U+017F>ince thou do<U+017F>t now want the company of her in the Elizian fields, whom thou did<U+017F>t court in this world with <U+017F>o much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but al<U+017F>o it is an argument of thy love, <U+017F>ince thou do<U+017F>t <U+017F>till <U+017F>uffer her to love thee, and in her tears to wa<U+017F>h away that crime which <U+017F>he committed again<U+017F>t thy fidelity: upon this, tears flowing in great abundance down her cheeks, and dropping upon the window where <U+017F>he leaned: Alas poor tears (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) why do you not the <U+017F>ame unto me that Lignon did unto my dear Shepherd, and drown'd me; but I know the cau<U+017F>e, you are dryed up too <U+017F>oon by the fire of my love.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch thoughts as the<U+017F>e <U+017F>he entertained the memory of her Shepherd, and the window where <U+017F>he was, being towards the place where <hi>Polemas</hi> gave the la<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault upon the Town, the good office which <hi>Semires</hi> had done her came al<U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her mind: Poor <hi>Semires</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) thy death has well repaired the wrong which formerly thou did<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t me; and pre<U+017F>ently remembring the la<U+017F>t words he uttered: but why (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) did<U+017F>t thou pray heaven to keep <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> for her happy <hi>Celadon?</hi> Did<U+017F>t thou imagine that Shepherd to be <U+017F>till alive, <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>o? thou had<U+017F>t indeed <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on for thy thought, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Celadon</hi> does <U+017F>till live in me, or wa<U+017F>t thou deceived by the re<U+017F>emblance of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and took her for him?

But alas, alas, I know too well that <hi>Celadon</hi> is dead; and I have not <U+017F>o much forgotten his favour unto me, but I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how I <U+017F>aw his Gho<U+017F>t. Why then <hi>Simires,</hi> who in this I mu<U+017F>t call cruel, <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t thou offer to torment me thus?

Death pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf unto him in a thou<U+017F>and forms, and <U+017F>o dumped him, that he was de<U+017F>perate: he did nothing but cur<U+017F>e <hi>Polemas,</hi> who had drawn him into that unju<U+017F>t quarrel: In the mid<U+017F>t of all his horrour, he began to think which way it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to <U+017F>ave his life: At la<U+017F>t, the hatred which he had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas,</hi> or perhaps the gods, who were not willing he <U+017F>hould end his dayes <U+017F>o ignominiou<U+017F>ly, did help him with an invention, which he had <U+017F>uch hopes would teke, that he extreamly de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Adamas</hi>; and the Druide was no <U+017F>ooner come unto him, but <hi>Peledontes</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto him.

               <p>Father (replied <hi>Peledontes</hi>) I am able to do her the greate<U+017F>t piece of <U+017F>ervice that ever was done: for if I <U+017F>hould not prevent it, the Town of <hi>Marcelles</hi> will

All former con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her voyage, which <U+017F>hould have been con<U+017F>olations unto her, were quite forgotten, and not one thought could keep her from a pre<U+017F>ent de<U+017F>pair; one would have thought that <U+017F>he had drowned her rea<U+017F>on in her tears, and that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ought for the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Policander,</hi> in the roots of that hair which <U+017F>he pulled from her head. The wrong <hi>Celiodantes</hi> was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf; and though the death of the King did leave him an Empire, yet he te<U+017F>tified, that he thought the lo<U+017F>s of his per<U+017F>on made him no gainer. <hi>Cephi<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> were no le<U+017F>s afflicted; and all the Cavaliers pre<U+017F>ent, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed abundance of grief for the lo<U+017F>s of their Prince: They came all unto the Queen, and <U+017F>wore fidelity unto her and <hi>Celio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantes</hi>; but <U+017F>he was not in a condition to hear what they <U+017F>aid unto her; and if the Ladies had not got her into bed, perhaps <U+017F>he had died.</p>
               <p>Thus they all retired, almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>ad for the <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s of the Queen, as for the lo<U+017F>s of the King.

               <p>The gods be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, fair <hi>Amerina,</hi> I am extreamly grieved that I cannot ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you this contentment which you ask: for pities <U+017F>ake put your <U+017F>elf into my room, and tell me what you would do if I <U+017F>hould make the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>upplication un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you? If you do love <hi>Lidias</hi> above your own life, would you not rather die then <U+017F>uffer another to enjoy him? but alas, I am extreamly afraid left that misfortune befal me, and that his judgement will be advantageous unto you: for I mu<U+017F>t yield unto you in all tho<U+017F>e qualities, wherein you think I have the advantage above you. But however this is my de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>age <hi>Amerina,</hi> to wait upon that judgement which he <U+017F>hall pronounce: do not think it is any want of affection unto you, which moves me not to yield that happine<U+017F>s which you de<U+017F>ire: for command me to attempt things even impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, nay even to die for your contentment, and I prote<U+017F>t I will do it, <U+017F>o my love unto <hi>Lidias</hi> may be excu<U+017F>ed.</p>

by any. The Druido would hardly con<U+017F>ent unto it; yet to <U+017F>atisfie her importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he permitted her to do as <U+017F>he would.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lidias</hi> for his part was as much di<U+017F>quieted as they; all his obligations unto <hi>Melandre</hi> came into his memory, and <U+017F>welled his <U+017F>oul with <U+017F>uch lively apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of them, as he thought he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>atisfie her de<U+017F>ires, unle<U+017F>s he <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf to be branded with extream ingratitude.

               <p>The hour when they were all to appear before <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner come, but all the Court a<U+017F><U+017F>embled there, e<U+017F>pecially the Lovers, but with very different thoughts and re<U+017F>olutions: <hi>Lidias</hi> endeavoured to oblige <hi>Amerina</hi> without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Melandre; Amerina</hi> was afraid that <hi>Lidias</hi> would not be favourable unto her, and therefore prepared to execute her di<U+017F>mal de<U+017F>igne: But <hi>Melandre</hi> being more confident then any of the re<U+017F>t, before <hi>Lidias</hi> was commanded to <U+017F>peak, did ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf at the feet of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> with the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions.

               <p>At the fir<U+017F>t Madam, I was in hopes to enjoy <hi>Lidias</hi> without any prejudice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Amerina,</hi> who<U+017F>e affection does merit to be pre<U+017F>erved; but now if I do volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily yield unto her an advantage which perhaps <U+017F>he may obtain in <U+017F>pite of me, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o oblige her, as I believe that her affection unto me will be for ever immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: And <U+017F>ince Madam, though <hi>Lidias</hi> <U+017F>hould give his judgement in favour of me, he would <U+017F>till be guilty of breaking tho<U+017F>e oaths which he hath <U+017F>worn unto this fair one; and though he <U+017F>hould be favourable unto her, he could never clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf of infidelity unto me; <U+017F>o as Madam, either <hi>Amerina</hi> or <hi>Melandre</hi> mu<U+017F>t of their own motion quit the intere<U+017F>t which they have in this affection: Therefore <U+017F>ince the Gods have in<U+017F>pired me with the de<U+017F>ire of it, and have now given me the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, I do intend never to give <hi>Lidias</hi> any cau<U+017F>e to hate me, but will for ever love him only in the degree of a Brother.

Upon this <hi>Melandre</hi> was <U+017F>ilent, and made an humble reverence unto the Nymph.</p>
               <p>All the company admired to hear this language proceed from her; but above all, <hi>Lidias</hi> and <hi>Amerina</hi>; who <U+017F>eeing them<U+017F>elves at a higher pitch of felicity then ere they expected, made an humble reverence unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>; and after they had asked leave to thank <hi>Melandre,</hi> they expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves unto her with all te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of acknowledgement and affection.</p>

               <p>Whil<U+017F>t affairs went thus, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> had but a very dull time of it; <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had locked him up in a <U+017F>trong Tower, the better to <U+017F>ecure his per<U+017F>on, it being doubted, that if he were at liberty, he would not have <U+017F>uffered any de<U+017F>igns to be again<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is, Godomar,</hi> or <hi>Dorinde,</hi> without oppo<U+017F>ing it with all his Intere<U+017F>t. Thus this Prince thought his detention in<U+017F>upportable; for hearing of this Armies departure, he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the danger wherein his Brother was; he was <U+017F>o extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed that he was not able to help him<U+017F>elf, that all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw him, might read in his countenance the marks of a mo<U+017F>t violent <U+017F>orrow: At la<U+017F>t, heaven who re<U+017F>erved him for a more glorious end then to langui<U+017F>h in pri<U+017F>on, did permit him to make an e<U+017F>cape in this manner.</p>

He made the overture of it unto him, the <U+017F>ame morning that the Army was drawn into the field; and <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> being confident of his fidelity, <U+017F>ince (<U+017F>aid he unto him) you do offer me your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and your own good will hath prevented my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>ts,

Upon this the Prince began to walk up and down the chamber, and the young <hi>Ardilan</hi> fearing le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hould hearken at the door, he came nearer and <U+017F>aid unto him in a low voice: You never need Sir to doubt either of my affection or my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and I will contrive the matter with <U+017F>o much prudence, as if it <U+017F>hall not mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.

As <U+017F>oon as they were down, <hi>Ardilan</hi> carried him to the boat, and throwing their nets into the water with more fear of being taken then de<U+017F>ire to take, they came unto the chains which cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the water ju<U+017F>t as day began to dawn, and they <U+017F>tayed not long before they were opened unto them; <U+017F>o as rowing as fa<U+017F>t as ever they could they entred pre<U+017F>ently into the Rho<U+017F>ne, who<U+017F>e impetuous current was <U+017F>uch, that it carried them to Vienna in le<U+017F><U+017F>e then three hours.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ardilans</hi> companion awaked, and did not <U+017F>ee his Comrade, he ran pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently to the Princes bed, and not finding him neither, he went to the window, where finding the rope, he concluded that they were e<U+017F>cape, and di<U+017F>puted with him<U+017F>elf whether it was not his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to e<U+017F>cape al<U+017F>o: at la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>idering, that if he <U+017F>hould be taken, he <U+017F>hould be puni<U+017F>hed as a complice, he cho<U+017F>e rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his innocency, then run the hazard of being thought culpable: he began therefore to cry out as loud as he could, and <U+017F>hewed unto the fir<U+017F>t that came unto him the marks of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> flight. <hi>Gondebaut</hi> was quickly adverti<U+017F>ed of it, and coming him<U+017F>elf unto the place, he <U+017F>aw the Princes and <hi>Ardilans</hi> clothes lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the bed; but this made no excu<U+017F>e for him who<U+017F>e office it was to watch them, and he <U+017F>wore that he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently be hanged; but when he <U+017F>aw the rope, and con<U+017F>idered that if the man had been culpable, he might ea<U+017F>ily have e<U+017F>caped al<U+017F>o, he turned all his anger again<U+017F>t the young <hi>Ardilan,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently proclaimed throughout the Town, that if any one could bring him either alive or dead, he would give unto him a large pention for his life; but all inqui<U+017F>ition was to no purpo<U+017F>e, for they were already got into Vienna, and it fell out very happily for them, that <hi>Lindamare</hi> came thither that morning.</p>
               <p>Their entrance into the Town was after a plea<U+017F>ant manner, for having left their boat at the port, they came into the fir<U+017F>t hou<U+017F>e they found open, and asked for <U+017F>omething to eat; and being thought to be Fi<U+017F>her-men, very homely victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als was <U+017F>et before them, <U+017F>uch as were enough to turn the <U+017F>tomach of the Prince: but <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who had rowed very hard, and never <U+017F>lept all the night, did fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>harp appetite, that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> after his example did ta<U+017F>te <U+017F>uch cour<U+017F>e food as he found. During their repa<U+017F>t the Prince was very inqui<U+017F>itive after the news of the Town, and left their ho<U+017F>t <U+017F>hould think it <U+017F>trange, that any in <U+017F>uch habits as they <U+017F>hould enquire after news, the Prince told him that they came from Lions to <U+017F>ell their fi<U+017F>h in Vienna: for <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Souldiers took up all provi<U+017F>ions in their countrey, and never payed the owners for them; and therefore they came away with their boat, to <U+017F>ee what money they could get for their fi<U+017F>h in that place: The Ho<U+017F>t told him that they were come in a very good time: for there was newly come to Town one <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who<U+017F>e valour was very famous, and

brought with him four or five hundred Noble men, be<U+017F>ides four thou<U+017F>and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. I have (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) three or four fi<U+017F>hes of a <U+017F>trange bigne<U+017F>s, and I believe they would very willingly buy them, if I knew how to let them know as much. Alas poor fellow (an<U+017F>wered the Ho<U+017F>t) do<U+017F>t thou think <U+017F>uch men as they u<U+017F>e to go unto the Market as we do? No, no, they have <U+017F>ervants and officers that take care for <U+017F>uch things, and thy fi<U+017F>h, perhaps, <U+017F>hall be bought and <U+017F>old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ever <U+017F>ee any of them, or they know any thing of them. So I have money for my fi<U+017F>h (replied <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <U+017F>miled) I do not care, and <U+017F>ilver is as good from the hand of a <U+017F>ervant as from the Ma<U+017F>ter: Well (<U+017F>aid the Ho<U+017F>t) I will carry thee to their hou<U+017F>e where thou mai<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak with <U+017F>ome of their <U+017F>ervants, and to tell thee truly, I have a great de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee this man they call <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for I have heard tell <U+017F>uch wonders of him, that I can hardly believe he is like unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at the conceit of this man, and calling to memory all that he had heard of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I had a conceit that his return from <hi>Childerick,</hi> was purpo<U+017F>ely to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> again<U+017F>t the attempts of <hi>Polemas.</hi> Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e was to joyn with him, he and <hi>Ardilan</hi> de<U+017F>ired the Ho<U+017F>t to conduct them unto his lodging. As <U+017F>oon as they came there, the Prince de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw they made <U+017F>ome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it, he told them that he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of importance to impart, which <hi>Lindamor</hi> would be very glad to know. This man unto whom he addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, finding more in the a<U+017F>pect of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> then u<U+017F>ually is in the common <U+017F>ort of people, and thinking him better then his clothes promi<U+017F>ed, al<U+017F>o remembring how <hi>Philiander</hi> got out of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> he did imagine that happily he might be one that came from the Nymph; <U+017F>o as without any more ceremony he carried him up a back <U+017F>tairs towards the chamber of <hi>Lindamor</hi>; and leaving him there at the <U+017F>tair head with <hi>Ardilan,</hi> who knew not what would be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of this vi<U+017F>it, he went and told <hi>Lindamor</hi> that there was two men in the habit of Fi<U+017F>hermen, the one of which <U+017F>aid that he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of con<U+017F>equence to impart. <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> pretending <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>patches in his clo<U+017F>et, he left the company and came to the place where <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>tayed. As <U+017F>oon as ever the Prince <U+017F>aw him he liked his countenance and behaviour, as indeed, <hi>Lindamor</hi> had a very charming way &amp; mind to win love; and <U+017F>aluting the Prince very affably, he returned the <U+017F>alute in a way more <U+017F>utable to his quality then habit, Sir (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Lindamor</hi>) I come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with an accident which happened in Lions of which we have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort Complices: which is, that the Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> hath e<U+017F>caped out of that pri<U+017F>on where his father detained him, and we have brought him away in our little boat, without any other company but one man who e<U+017F>caped with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindamor</hi> had hardly patience to let him <U+017F>peak out the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, for clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his hands together, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed be the great gods of heaven (<U+017F>aid he) for delivering him from <U+017F>uch great inju<U+017F>tice: In <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome tears of joy e<U+017F>caped from his eyes, which plea<U+017F>ed the Prince <U+017F>o well, that he was ready to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf immediatly: yet deferring it a little longer, Sir (continued he) we heard him often by the way name you, yet not knowing (as I think) that you were <U+017F>o near him: <U+017F>o as at our arival here, hearing of your return and where you lodged, we thought it would be welcome news unto you, to the end, that whether he be your friend or your enemy, you might make what u<U+017F>e you plea<U+017F>dd of it.</p>

               <p>This picture (<U+017F>aid he, and opened a ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>et with very rich <U+017F>tone, which he wore about his Neck) will tell you that <hi>Dorinde</hi> is partly the cau<U+017F>e of all <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauts</hi> disorders: That fair one who<U+017F>e Image you <U+017F>ee, and who<U+017F>e perfections are <U+017F>o great, as no Painter in the Univer<U+017F>e is able to imitate, hath <U+017F>o captivated the mind of my father, that he is fallen into <U+017F>uch extravagancies, as indeed are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a man of his quality: When his affection was fir<U+017F>t known unto me, I was in <U+017F>uch fears that he would marry her, that I re<U+017F>olved to be as great an ob<U+017F>tacle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as I could. The fir<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e that came into my fancy was, to <U+017F>eem as if I were in Love with her; but oh how dangerous a thing it is to je<U+017F>t with matters of Love! for a little after I became <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately lo<U+017F>t in a real Love of her, that I cannot believe ever any pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was <U+017F>o violent as mine; but however, my fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igne of ruining the preten<U+017F>ions of my father, did prevail; for whether that fair one did think my age more <U+017F>utable unto hers, and found more <U+017F>ympathy in our humours, or whether <U+017F>he thought the Kings intention was not <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>t as he pretended; but <U+017F>o it was, that I gained her affection, and after the death of her father, I per<U+017F>waded her to go into Forre<U+017F>ts, where I intended to follow: but I was <U+017F>o much interrupted, that all I could do, was, to <U+017F>end my brother thither; who after <U+017F>everal encounters, carried her into <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where now they are. Now the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of <hi>Polemas,</hi> who promi<U+017F>ed to hold that e<U+017F>tate meerly of my father, and my fathers de<U+017F>ire to be revenged upon <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who took them into her protection, has cau<U+017F>ed him to declare war again<U+017F>t that Prince<U+017F>s, and no longer <U+017F>ince then ye<U+017F>terday, <U+017F>ent above thirty thou<U+017F>and men unto <hi>Polemas</hi>: But le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould engage my <U+017F>elf in this quarrel, which was partly begun upon my <U+017F>core, the King <U+017F>hut me up in a Tower, out of which I e<U+017F>caped by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of this man, whom you <U+017F>ee di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as I am, and now am come unto you, to act <U+017F>omthing that is glorious unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Dorinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindamore</hi> was joyed beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and prote<U+017F>ting that he could not better employ his arms; then in defence of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s, he be<U+017F>eeched him to make all the ha<U+017F>te he could to do her that favour: Fir<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid the Prince) I conceive one thing is expedient to be done, which is, that we employ four of your men who are lea<U+017F>t known, two of them to go and divulge it in <hi>Lions,</hi> that I am in <hi>Viena,</hi> and the other two to get into that Army which <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debaut</hi> <U+017F>ends unto <hi>Polemas:</hi> and this will be the con<U+017F>equence of it; I have many friends in <hi>Lions,</hi> who will not value the Kings di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, <U+017F>o they can but <U+017F>erve me, and follow my fortune; and I dare confidently ever, that almo<U+017F>t all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53528:127"/>
are for me: Mo<U+017F>t certain it is, that as <U+017F>oon as ever they know where I am, they will make preparations to <U+017F>erve me, and will follow me: As for tho<U+017F>e who are in the Army which my father hath <U+017F>ent unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> certainly <U+017F>ome are for me, and tho<U+017F>e that are, will draw others, <U+017F>o as I expect a good party will revolt, and come unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindamore</hi> approved of this de<U+017F>igne, and that very hour di<U+017F>patched away four <U+017F>uch as he mo<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>ted, and giving them all requi<U+017F>ite in<U+017F>tructions, he returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and <U+017F>aid thus unto him, I do verily believe Sir, that the Gods do intend to be very favourable unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and are re<U+017F>olved to free her very <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from all manner of oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>ince they proceed by ways that are even miraculous: For in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>ome extraordinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages: As the flight of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> the voyage of Prince <hi>Godomar,</hi> and the intere<U+017F>t which you have both in him and her, makes much for the advantage of that afflicted Prince<U+017F>s. <hi>Philander</hi> <U+017F>poke of a certain Queen called <hi>Argira,</hi> who came not long <U+017F>ince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cure of a Cavalier called <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>; he told me al<U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he left behind her a daughter very fair, with a promi<U+017F>e to <U+017F>end for her by an Army <U+017F>trong enough to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t all the power of any enemies. For my part, I thought that I could not die more gloriou<U+017F>ly, then in the <U+017F>ervice of her, unto whom I owe my life, and all I have, and therefore re<U+017F>olved to force my way into the Town, with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that I brought with me, and afterwards defend it to the la<U+017F>t. Your re<U+017F>oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is mo<U+017F>t commendable (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf, you might effect it, for there is no greater danger in it, then formerly your valour hath encountred withal, and gloriou<U+017F>ly executed; but you mu<U+017F>t know, that as the <U+017F>tate of the Town is at the pre<U+017F>ent, it is not in any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of either your or my being there: My brother writ me word at the beginning of the <U+017F>iege, that there are <U+017F>o many brave Cavaliers in it, and I believe <hi>Philander</hi> told me as much, that without any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, they could defend it for two moneths; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>o, it is much better for us to make up a Body wherewith we may keep the field, and as we <U+017F>ee occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either give battel, or enter into the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lindamore</hi> thought this advice <U+017F>o good, that he re<U+017F>olved to follow it; the only difficulty that he found in it, was, left <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Army joyning with <hi>Polemas,</hi> before they had formed a con<U+017F>iderable body, <U+017F>hould violently fall upon them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propounded it unto the Prince, whether it was not be<U+017F>t to advance a little forward with tho<U+017F>e men he had, to amu<U+017F>e the enemy, whil<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tayed in <hi>Vienna,</hi> to receive tho<U+017F>e men who came to take his part. The Prince an<U+017F>wered, that it was very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>o to do: And upon this re<U+017F>olution, <hi>Lindamore</hi> <U+017F>pent the re<U+017F>t of the day in giving orders for their departure, as in the morning he did, with all his forces.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ame day, tho<U+017F>e that <hi>Lindamore</hi> <U+017F>ent unto <hi>Lions,</hi> arrived there; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told unto five or <U+017F>ix per<U+017F>ons that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> was in <hi>Vienna</hi> all the Town knew of it before it was night. <hi>Gondebaut</hi> was vexed at it to the very <U+017F>oul; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s if he had not <U+017F>ent away all his Forces, he would have be<U+017F>ieged him there: for his humour was barbarous enough to prompt unto any violent re<U+017F>olution. But on the other <U+017F>ide, mo<U+017F>t of the Nobility and Cavalry of the Town were <U+017F>o joyed at the news, that they <U+017F>pent all the night in nothing but preparing them<U+017F>elves to go unto the Prince in the morning. The King, who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had blinded his judgement, and who never feared any harm could happen unto him, did permit the Gates of the Town to be opened, for they had been <U+017F>hut ever <U+017F>ince he heard of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> flight; <U+017F>o as there went out <U+017F>everal ways no le<U+017F>s, then five thou<U+017F>and men, who the <U+017F>ame day came unto the Prince. The next day after he went to joyn with <hi>Lindamore,</hi> who had appointed <hi>Boen</hi> for his Rendezvouz.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Army was advanced within a little of <U+017F>eeing the walls of <hi>Marcelles: Polemas</hi> who was <U+017F>welled with joy, and proud with the title of General over <U+017F>uch a pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Army, did promi<U+017F>e unto him<U+017F>elf no le<U+017F>s then the conque<U+017F>t of <hi>Galathea,</hi> and went half a days journey to meet the<U+017F>e Auxiliaries: There he received <hi>Gondebauts</hi> letter, which he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed two or three times; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the oath of Fidelity from all the Captains, he <U+017F>wore that the greate<U+017F>t intere<U+017F>t that he had in this war, was only for the glory of <hi>Gondebaut.</hi> After this
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53528:127"/>
he made a <U+017F>peech unto the Souldiers, in which he omitted nothing that might move them to fight valiantly; and got <U+017F>o much credit and authority among<U+017F>t them, that there was not one among<U+017F>t them all which was not very glad to be under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And la<U+017F>tly, being de<U+017F>irous to know certainly of what number this new come Army con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, he wondered to find of thirty two thou<U+017F>and not above four or five and twenty thou<U+017F>and; for the re<U+017F>t had disbanded them<U+017F>elves as <U+017F>oon as ever they heard of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> intention.</p>
               <p>As this was prejudicial unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>o it was <U+017F>erviceable unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who in le<U+017F>s then three days, found him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ixteen or <U+017F>eventeen thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>trong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e which <hi>Lindamore</hi> brought from <hi>Childerick.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> on his <U+017F>ide, he made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could; for his love unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> was <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pur unto him, that he could not re<U+017F>t until he had given <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal te<U+017F>timony of his valour; <U+017F>o as he was within a days march as near <hi>Marcelles</hi> as the Burgundian Troops.</p>
               <p>The Truce was to end the next morning; <U+017F>o as the retardment of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> the arrival of the<U+017F>e forces unto <hi>Polemas</hi>; and no intelligence of <hi>Lindamores</hi> return, did put <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> into a mo<U+017F>t extream perplexity: <U+017F>he knew nothing of <hi>Fleurial</hi> and <hi>Philianders</hi> <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he grew even de<U+017F>perate of all relief, and was exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted: <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed her as <U+017F>he was almo<U+017F>t drowned in <U+017F>orrows; and though he knew them to be but ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o little hopes of any remedy, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a firm belief that the Gods would never abandon <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t a cau<U+017F>e, he candemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive <U+017F>orrows, as out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on: Which the Prince<U+017F>s not being able to reli<U+017F>h; Alas <hi>Adamas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) how can I chu<U+017F>e but be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad accidents which are even ready to ruine me: every thing contributes unto it; Strangers deceive me; my Neighbours a<U+017F><U+017F>ault me, and my own Subjects betray me. Upon this <U+017F>he pulled out he handkerchief and wiped her eyes, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding the Grandure of her courage, did <U+017F>end forth a flood of tears: which the Druide perceiving, and de<U+017F>iring to comfort her: Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that you have <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>es to fear, but pardon me if I tell you, that you have no cau<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>pair: A high born <U+017F>oul as yours is, cannot be culpable of <U+017F>uch a crime, which is a mark of a ba<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirit that is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, Madam, you mu<U+017F>t know, that the eye of man is too weak to <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ecrets of the gods, nor can our <U+017F>hallow thoughts reach the <U+017F>ublimity of theirs; and it is a thing mo<U+017F>t difficult to find out the cau<U+017F>es of the good or the bad which they do <U+017F>end unto us: <U+017F>ometimes they are plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>uffer the good to be overwhelmed with mi<U+017F>eries and calamities, whil<U+017F>t the bad do <U+017F>wim in good Fortune and pro<U+017F>perity; but alas, Madam, it is becau<U+017F>e they think that the pro<U+017F>perity of this world is not recompence good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the good, and therefore their reward is referred unto the next world. But <hi>Adamas</hi> (replied the Nymph) admit all this true, yet in the mean time this Traytour <hi>Polemas</hi> will triumph over my daughter and my dominions: If the gods have <U+017F>o ordained it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas</hi>) all humane power is not able to hinder it; but the be<U+017F>t way is to <U+017F>uffer patiently without murmure.

               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>pent their time thus in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Clindor,</hi> and had no other perplexities, but <U+017F>uch as were common to all the State, <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>eldome ever le<U+017F>t each other, and had united them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>uch terms of amity, as it was very hard to meet with two who<U+017F>e affections were more inviolable.

After <hi>Galathea</hi> had given many thanks for her good will, if heaven and <hi>Polemas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) did not hate me wor<U+017F>e then you do, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> would never have been reduced unto the<U+017F>e extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which afflict her and make me de<U+017F>pair, becau<U+017F>e I look upon my <U+017F>elf as the only cau<U+017F>e of all the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>orders: if heaven (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi>) would hearken unto my prayers, or if <hi>Polemas</hi> would hearken unto rea<U+017F>on or equity, all your mi<U+017F>eries <U+017F>hould end this hour, but to my grief, both are deaf: Ah, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Galathea,</hi> it was a fatal minute when fir<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas</hi> looked upon me with the eyes of liking: for had he never loved me, or had I at the fir<U+017F>t given, a check un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his vanity in pretending love to me, doubtle<U+017F>s I had <U+017F>topped all the<U+017F>e misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in their very beginning, and all our <U+017F>orrows had died with tho<U+017F>e hopes which have <U+017F>ince nouri<U+017F>hed his pre<U+017F>umption.</p>
               <p>It was not in your power, replied <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> to keep your <U+017F>elf from appearing fair in his eyes, becau<U+017F>e you are really <U+017F>o in the eyes of all the world; but indeed, you might have kept him at <U+017F>uch an humble di<U+017F>tance, that the effects of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption <U+017F>hould never have dared to appear: And indeed, I cannot comprehend within the compa<U+017F>s of my knowledge, what intere<U+017F>t he has to pretend unto you; for if he do love you, how dare he be <U+017F>o bold as to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you? and if he do not love you, what makes him <U+017F>o eager to overcome you? Madam (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) believe it, he is the mo<U+017F>t per<U+017F>idious and dangerous <U+017F>pirit that breathes upon earth: He loves me only for <U+017F>ome ends; and if the State were to de<U+017F>cend unto any other but me, I believe he would not <U+017F>o much as look upon me: You mu<U+017F>t know, that his ambition <U+017F>oars higher then the thoughts of any mortal man could ever reach: Be<U+017F>ides, he is of <U+017F>uch a jealous and envious nature, that the happine<U+017F>s of another puts him into a burning Feaver, What has he not attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Damon?</hi> he has <U+017F>everal times indeavoured to murder him, and takes tho<U+017F>e honours which my mother renders unto his merit <U+017F>o impatiently, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is one of the main cau<U+017F>es of his di<U+017F>content; he has al<U+017F>o had <U+017F>ome bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who was a very brave Cavalier; and when he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf forced to yield unto the valour of his enemy, there was no trea<U+017F>on nor trick which he did not invent to ruine him: At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing all his pernicious <U+017F>ubtilties turned to his own <U+017F>hame and confu<U+017F>ion; he openly took up arms, and takes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my brothers death, and of the ab<U+017F>ence of all our be<U+017F>t Cavalry to ruine us, under pretence of a de<U+017F>ire to marry me.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Galathea</hi> condemn <hi>Polemas,</hi> who<U+017F>e undertakings were indeed mo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>t; and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> for a better information of her life, de<U+017F>ired her to tell her more concerning tho<U+017F>e two Rivals, which the Nymph was very willing to do: <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he related all the Trea<U+017F>ons of <hi>Polemas,</hi> the Juglings of <hi>Climanthes,</hi> the <U+017F>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

It is not you, replied the young Prince<U+017F>s, that would be the cau<U+017F>e of it, but his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or, perhaps, his infidelity: with <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they entertained each other upon a <U+017F>ubject of <U+017F>orrow which was common unto them both.</p>

                  <hi>Silvander</hi> in the mean time kept clo<U+017F>e by <hi>Diana,</hi> and by good fortune he found a fit opportunity of talking unto her, not out of the pre<U+017F>ence of other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, but <U+017F>o as they could not hear him; and becau<U+017F>e he would not <U+017F>it idle whil<U+017F>t othert were labouring for the defence of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> he be<U+017F>eech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Diana</hi> to let him get <U+017F>ome honour as others did in dangers: Not Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid he) that I <U+017F>tand in any need of your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to whet my courage, but becau<U+017F>e I am certain that all I attempt will pro<U+017F>per if it be done by the con<U+017F>ent of faire<U+017F>t <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Shepherde<U+017F>s who did infinitly love him, and who could not any longer conceal her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, was a little <U+017F>urprived at this reque<U+017F>t, and her fears of lo<U+017F>ing him made her begin to look pale; but fearing withal that notice <U+017F>hould be taken of it, <U+017F>he recollected her <U+017F>elf as well as <U+017F>he could, and an<U+017F>wered him in the<U+017F>e terms: Servant (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what need you ask me any leave to do that which your humour is <U+017F>o prompt unto that nothing in the world is able to divert you from it? If you hope that it would give good fortune unto your arms, you may con<U+017F>ider it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould give that which I have not my <U+017F>elf, and that being the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable woman that lives, I can impart nothing unto you but my mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
               <p>It is no matter (replied the Shepherd) what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e my Arms have, I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf abundantly happy, if imploying them in the defence of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I can but plea<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi>; and therefore I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to expre<U+017F>s your approbation of my de<U+017F>igne, to the end that if I die, it may be with this <U+017F>atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I did not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you.

               <p>Actions (an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd) which may be condemned of ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, are not <U+017F>uch as I think worthy of a man of courage; and therefore you may believe, that I will be as wary as becomes my honour, and will not <U+017F>o carele<U+017F>ly expo<U+017F>e my life, but that if I do peri<U+017F>h, it <U+017F>hall be honourable unto me, and profitable to the Nymph: But Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s (continued he) <U+017F>ince <hi>Paris</hi> mu<U+017F>t enjoy you, and <U+017F>ince you have not re<U+017F>olution enough to defend your <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t him, can I de<U+017F>ire to die more gloriou<U+017F>ly then in the<U+017F>e wars, or in a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on more advantageous unto me then this? <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>eem to pity my misfortune?

As <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <hi>Silvander</hi> would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand; but <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erving that <U+017F>ome eyes were upon him, <U+017F>he withdrew it, and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed his very hand, which was the greate<U+017F>t favour that ever he received: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was afraid, that if <U+017F>he pur<U+017F>ued this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e it would move too much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, therefore <U+017F>he li<U+017F>tned unto what others <U+017F>aid, and then <U+017F>he heard <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>ay thus unto <hi>Tyrcis.</hi>

               <p>I cannot imagine <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> what object thou ha<U+017F>t for thy courage, nor for whom thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t fight, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ince the death of thy dear <hi>Cleon,</hi> who lives <U+017F>till in thy excellent memory, all things are meerly indifferent unto thee, methinks an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> that your imagination is very <U+017F>hallow, and that thou ha<U+017F>t a wrong opinion of me, when thou thinke<U+017F>t, that to fight I <U+017F>tand in need to propo<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my <U+017F>elf any private intere<U+017F>t: as if all actions which have <U+017F>uch objects, as to be e<U+017F>teemed valiant, to become rich, or <U+017F>uch like, were not fal<U+017F>e Images of true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: It is enough for me if I can <U+017F>erve <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> as I ought, without the thought of any other recompence, but the <U+017F>atisfaction of doing <U+017F>o; for virtue is a <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reward unto it <U+017F>elf: Lord how wi<U+017F>e you are (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) but for all that I have rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect thy courage, <U+017F>ince <hi>Laonice</hi> could make thee afraid: If I did fear the <U+017F>ubtilties of that woman (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Tyrcis</hi>) it was not for want of any courage, but rather a horrour that I had again<U+017F>t her wickedne<U+017F>s; and if I be not much mi<U+017F>taken (continued he looking upon <hi>Hylas</hi> and afterwards upon <hi>Silvander</hi>) thou oughte<U+017F>t to put a great difference between that kind of fear which is directly oppo<U+017F>ite unto courage, and tho<U+017F>e apprehen<U+017F>ions which makes us fear a per<U+017F>on only out of a knowledge we have of <U+017F>ome ill qualities in her. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) that thy eyes require <U+017F>ome help from <hi>Silvander,</hi> but we will at this time defer our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto another; only con<U+017F>ider, I de<U+017F>ire thee, that if I had lea<U+017F>ure, I would make thee know that this Shepherde<U+017F>s is not <U+017F>o much to blame as you imagine her: Upon this he ro<U+017F>e up, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clindor</hi> began alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to walk out of the Arbour, and <hi>Tyrcis</hi> had not time to make any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer, but that he believed all the eloquence in the world was not able to per<U+017F>wade him, but that <U+017F>he was unworthy, not only of his amity, but of the meane<U+017F>t Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds upon earth.</p>
               <p>This was the opinion which <hi>Tyrcis</hi> had of the love and beauty of <hi>Laonice,</hi> who being not <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant as he imagined, did pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away her dayes and nights in her <U+017F>olitude, without any our thoughts, but upon the ingratitude of this Shepherd. Upon that day <U+017F>he was walked up to the top of a rock, which being very high, <U+017F>urveyed all the plain of Forre<U+017F>ts; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he could perceive every thing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hrub, <U+017F>he quickly <U+017F>pied the Army from which <hi>Polemas</hi> expected the e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hment of his Fortune. At the fir<U+017F>t it put her into a fright; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thinking it a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible they could do her any hurt in that clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, unto which the gods and <hi>Tyrcis</hi> had confined her, her fears reflected only upon her Shepherd; and though <U+017F>he was well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that he loved not her; yet <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but wi<U+017F>h his <U+017F>afety, and fear le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome harm <U+017F>hould happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations made her wet the very rock with her tears, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to dry up tho<U+017F>e tears again with the wind of her <U+017F>ighs; and thus <U+017F>he continued until night, which invited her to retire, and left her only as much light as to find out the way unto her cell: into which entring, <U+017F>he fell into her con<U+017F>tant exerci<U+017F>e, which was to pray unto the gods, and to think upon the ingratitude of <hi>Tyrcis.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Polemas</hi> had <U+017F>lept but a very little, by rea<U+017F>on of his longing de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the Truce ended: <U+017F>o as being awake very early in the morning, day did no <U+017F>ooner dawn, but the received intelligence of this Armies arrival: his wonder was <U+017F>o much the greater, by how much it was beyond his expectation; yet finding it to be upon equal terms, he believed the lo<U+017F>s or the winning of a battel would decide the difference. He commanded therefore all the Officers of his Army to be in readine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and did not draw any line about <hi>Marcelles,</hi> nor erected any of his Engines, le<U+017F>t the <U+017F>eparation of his forces <U+017F>hould weaken him too much for a field fight.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who knew to a very man the <U+017F>trength of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> did conceive it a very hard task for this Rebel to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the valour and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>; and though he made no que<U+017F>tion of giving him a defeat, yet it grieved him extreamly to think that <U+017F>o many men <U+017F>hould be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the intere<U+017F>t of one <U+017F>ingle man, and thought it a thou<U+017F>and pities, that for the crime of this one <U+017F>ingle man, fifteen or twenty thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>hould be puni<U+017F>hed with death. This con<U+017F>ideration made him think upon a remedy again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; and finding none better then to move <hi>Polemas</hi> unto a de<U+017F>ci<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the controver<U+017F>ie by <U+017F>ingle combate, he re<U+017F>olved to u<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible incitations that might <U+017F>pur him up unto it. Yet being unwilling to attempt any thing without the con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> he did communicate his intention unto them in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sirs, (<U+017F>aid he unto them) I make no doubt but you do know as well as my <U+017F>elf, that all the<U+017F>e violencies of <hi>Polemas</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> do aim at no other end but the u<U+017F>urpation of her E<U+017F>tate.

After this intreating him afre<U+017F>h to imploy his wi<U+017F>dome in order thereunto, and embracing very affectionately, we took hor<U+017F>e, being accompanied with <U+017F>ome Segu<U+017F>ian Cavaliers which then I had with me, and within a few dayes after we came to the city of Rhemois, by which <hi>Childerick</hi> would pa<U+017F><U+017F>e to acquaint the Queen his mother with his exile.

Upon this the Queen <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting the misfortune which had hapned unto him: O <hi>Childerick,</hi> cryed <U+017F>he out, what is this you <U+017F>ay? In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e up with a <U+017F>tream of tears in her eyes, and the Prince being retreated back two or three paces, <U+017F>he went unto him, and taking his hand, <U+017F>he carried him into her clo<U+017F>et.</p>
               <p>She then <U+017F>ent pre<U+017F>ently for me, and as <U+017F>oon as I entred I offered to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her feet; but <U+017F>he embracing me, ah <hi>Lindamor</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) how truly did <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovens</hi> Prophecy, and how unfortunate am I to <U+017F>ee the effects of that which that poor King <U+017F>o much feared?

               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Silviana</hi> was gone from Paris in the habit of one of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenecks</hi> children, and had with her only the wife of that good man, and one that was <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Andrimartes:</hi> It hapned, that being gone from under the hedge where they lay all the night, and being in the high way towards Gandelu, <U+017F>he had not gone above half a mile, but <U+017F>he heard a great noi<U+017F>e of men and hor<U+017F>es coming towards her: Her fears, by rea<U+017F>on of the danger which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the day before, did make her pre<U+017F>ently look about: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw they gallopped very fa<U+017F>t, and heard them cry, <U+017F>tay, <U+017F>tay: O God (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the wife of <hi>Andreneck</hi>) yonders the Tyrant <U+017F>till pur<U+017F>uing me; but (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if you e<U+017F>cape with your life, I command you to tell my <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that I will die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <U+017F>hall do any injury unto my honour or his: in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o <U+017F>he drew her <U+017F>word, and looking for no <U+017F>afety by flying, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till, and expected the <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e of her Fortune.</p>
               <p>Mean time, tho<U+017F>e that pur<U+017F>ued her came <U+017F>o near as to ob<U+017F>erve her po<U+017F>ture, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her for a Cavalier, they wondered what <U+017F>hould move him to <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture of defence: thinking it fit to ask the rea<U+017F>on of it, they made a <U+017F>tand <U+017F>ome fourty or fifty paces di<U+017F>tant, and <U+017F>ent one of their company to ask why he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o with his <U+017F>word drawn. <hi>Silviana,</hi> <U+017F>till <U+017F>eeming a Cavalier, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered boldly, that about two dayes <U+017F>ince, a Traytour had made <U+017F>ome attempts again<U+017F>t his honour, and thinking that he was now come to execute his murderous de<U+017F>ign, was the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>tanding in the po<U+017F>ture of a man that would <U+017F>ell his life at a dear rate: Then the man a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that tho<U+017F>e whom he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, would alwayes be more ready to <U+017F>erve, then to hurt him, and the rea<U+017F>on why they rid after him, was, becau<U+017F>e they took him for one of their friends, who went from their hou<U+017F>e not above an hour <U+017F>ince, and hearing that a Hart was to be cour<U+017F>ed, they called him to be a partaker of their <U+017F>port. <hi>Silviana,</hi> very glad of her mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take did put her <U+017F>word, and began to prepare her <U+017F>elf for the continuance of her voyage; but the man de<U+017F>iring to know her name: My name (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) is <hi>Cephindres,</hi> who <U+017F>hall think him<U+017F>elf very happy in any occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>erve you. Upon this, <U+017F>he rid away, and going towards Gandelu, <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved that tho<U+017F>e who had followed her, did go into a thick wood which was upon the right hand. In the mean time, <hi>Andrenecks</hi> wife <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf out of that danger which <U+017F>o af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted her, <U+017F>he began to be a little angry, but <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly, that the brave <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phindres</hi> could not forbear laughing: Madam (<U+017F>aid the good woman unto her) if you be <U+017F>o forward to draw your <U+017F>word, and defie all you meet, I be<U+017F>eech you make it your profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to be a Knight errant, and maintain my beauty again<U+017F>t all the world; but to tell you truly, I think your courage was not very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable: Good mother (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silviana</hi>) what I did was not <U+017F>o much out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on as you imagine; for con<U+017F>ider what abundance of rea<U+017F>on I have to fear: <hi>Childerick,</hi> <U+017F>eeks my ruine, and perhaps at this very hour is lying in ambu<U+017F>h for me, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ending after me. <hi>Childerick</hi> (replied the good old woman) hath now other matters in his head; and let him u<U+017F>e what endeavours to get you he can, I believe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53528:137"/>
it is out of his power; this habit does <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e you, that you can never be known, and therefore, I <U+017F>ay, you were too much <U+017F>tartled at the arrival of the<U+017F>e Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, and <U+017F>hould have tru<U+017F>ted more to your di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e then your valour. Alas, replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> you do not know what an exa<U+017F>perated <U+017F>pirit may do; and I am in <U+017F>uch a great di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, that I think fidelity it <U+017F>elf may deceive me: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <U+017F>o cruel, but I have rea<U+017F>on to expect it from the malice of <hi>Childerick,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Tyrant will put <hi>Andreneck</hi> to <U+017F>uch torments, as will force him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e the truth, and know from him, what the boy which was our guide did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him of our de<U+017F>igne. For heavens <U+017F>ake, Madam (<U+017F>aid the woman) do not entertain any <U+017F>uch thoughts, but believe that he will <U+017F>ooner peri<U+017F>h then do any thing which <U+017F>hall be prejudicial unto you or <hi>Andrimartes:</hi> Good woman (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana</hi>) when we feel no pain, we are per<U+017F>waded the mo<U+017F>t cruel torments are not able to force any <U+017F>ecret from us, but in the extremity of pain, it is a mo<U+017F>t hard matter to continue con<U+017F>tant; and therefore imagining that <hi>Childerick</hi> will put him to the rack, I am afraid he will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that which I would not have him di<U+017F>cover unto any.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch like di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they beguiled the length of the way, and <hi>Silviana,</hi> who longed with abundance of impatiency, for a <U+017F>ight of her dear <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> <U+017F>he imagined every man that appeared to be him: yet for all her eager de<U+017F>ire of it, <U+017F>he found her <U+017F>elf mi<U+017F>taken, and all that journey could not hear any news of him. The wife of <hi>Andreneck</hi> did comfort her as well as <U+017F>he could, and <U+017F>till the young man that guided them, affirmed that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could not come any other way but this which they went: after this <U+017F>ort <U+017F>he came to Gandelu, where indeed <U+017F>he lay, but did not re<U+017F>t; for her eager de<U+017F>ire of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did invite to ri<U+017F>e before Aurora; and as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was on hor<U+017F>eback <U+017F>he took the way of Coucye.</p>
               <p>I, <U+017F>hould tyer you, Madam, if I <U+017F>hould relate unto you all the thoughts which afflicted her during her voyage: for <U+017F>he was in a perpetual re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e; and from the time <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t fancied that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> had taken <U+017F>ome other way, <U+017F>he was almo<U+017F>t quite de<U+017F>perate; but all the<U+017F>e fears were nothing in compari<U+017F>on of that which <U+017F>he apprehended, that <hi>Childerick</hi> had procured <U+017F>ome to be his a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inates: when this came into her fancy <U+017F>he changed colour, afterwards would <U+017F>igh, and la<U+017F>tly, her eyes gu<U+017F>h out with tears: ah mother (would <U+017F>he <U+017F>ay unto the wife of <hi>Andreneck</hi>) I am afraid all our labour in this journey is but lo<U+017F>t. The good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who wondered at this change, why (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) have you that opinion? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I fear (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silviana</hi>) that yonder Barbarian hath murdered <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes.</hi> Good God, <U+017F>aid the woman, why <U+017F>ay you <U+017F>o? the very <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of <U+017F>uch a thing makes me to tremble: for God <U+017F>ake do not imagine any <U+017F>uch thing can be, for <U+017F>uch misfortunes <U+017F>eldome happen, but I u<U+017F>e to have <U+017F>ome pre<U+017F>ages of it beforehand: The likelyhood of it, replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> makes me fear it; for reckon from the time of his departure, and judge whether he <U+017F>hould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before this. <hi>Andrenecks</hi> wife began to think with her <U+017F>elf, and to count the dayes upon her fingers; truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, according to my weak judgement, let him make what ha<U+017F>t he could, he could not be returned thus far before this time: the boy who guided them, ca<U+017F>ting up his account al<U+017F>o; a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (<U+017F>aid he upon a <U+017F>udden) the woman is in the right; for her account and mine do perfectly agree.</p>
               <p>Upon this they came to the top of a little hill, which <U+017F>urveying all the plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, permitted <hi>Silviana</hi> to <U+017F>pie <U+017F>ome hor<U+017F>emen afar off, who came in great ha<U+017F>t towards them; at the fir<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>he could not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h neither the per<U+017F>ons nor the number; but <U+017F>hewing them unto <hi>Andrenecks</hi> wife, Mother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do you not perceive <U+017F>ome men coming towards us? I have a conceit that it is <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>: The good old woman who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ight was <U+017F>omthing dim, I do not <U+017F>ee any <U+017F>uch, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; but if it prove <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> as I pray heaven it may, what then will you do?

Alas, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, it is long <U+017F>ince he overcame me; in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he fixed her eyes <U+017F>till upon the men which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, and as <U+017F>oon as ever
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53528:138"/>
<U+017F>he perceived one with a plume of white feathers in his hat, <U+017F>he clapped her hands together: O mother<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, yonder is <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> I know him both by his feather and his habit. Madam (an<U+017F>wered the woman) if it be he, I would advi<U+017F>e you keep your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>till to your di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, and try if he will know us: Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> he will know us; for his <U+017F>ervant is not di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as we are: As for that, replied the woman, there is a remedy, for he may hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf until we call him. Upon this, <hi>Silviana</hi> commanded the young man to <U+017F>tand behind a tree, which he did accordingly; but <hi>Silviana,</hi> who in the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of her joyes minded not what <U+017F>he did, <U+017F>he never heeded her bridle, and her hor<U+017F>e being almo<U+017F>t tired, did <U+017F>tumble <U+017F>o downright, that <hi>Cephindres,</hi> who was none of the be<U+017F>t hor<U+017F>emen, did fall three or four lengths before the hor<U+017F>e: This fall did much harm in the pre<U+017F>ence of her husband; but <U+017F>he got up pre<U+017F>ently, and told the good woman, that all the harm <U+017F>he had was a little hurt upon her no<U+017F>e; which, indeed, did fall <U+017F>o again<U+017F>t the ground, that blood gu<U+017F>hed out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was already <U+017F>o near, that he <U+017F>aw <hi>Cephindres</hi> fall, and therefore to help him he galopped as fa<U+017F>t as he could, and came unto him ju<U+017F>t as he was got up upon his feet; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silviana</hi> did pre<U+017F>ently take out her handkerchief, and held it unto her no<U+017F>e to receive the blood, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly know her; yet thinking him<U+017F>elf obliged by the laws of civility to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething to him, Sir, <U+017F>aid he, I made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could to help you, but now I <U+017F>ee you do not <U+017F>tand in any need of my <U+017F>ervice: <hi>Silviana</hi> blu<U+017F>hed when <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>peak, and could hardly forbear revealing her <U+017F>elf; yet de<U+017F>iring to make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port in this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and altered her voice, your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the <U+017F>ame, and does infinitly oblige me in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he looked upon him with the <U+017F>ame eyes which had long <U+017F>ince inflamed him, and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> ob<U+017F>erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>ome glances, which formerly made him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of loves power, he had a confu<U+017F>ed fancy, that he had formerly <U+017F>een that Cavalier in <U+017F>ome other place; and as he was ready to <U+017F>peak unto her, he ob<U+017F>erved that her hor<U+017F>e was broke loo<U+017F>e, and ran up and down the fields; and therefore he commanded tho<U+017F>e that waited upon him to run after the hor<U+017F>e, and bring him back: In the interim he alighted from his hor<U+017F>e, and entreated this unknown Cavalier to <U+017F>it down upon the point of a rock which was in the high way; which <hi>Silviana</hi> did not refu<U+017F>e, for indeed <U+017F>he was nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated unto it; and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> knowing the name of <hi>Cephindres,</hi> he be<U+017F>eeched her to tell him what news was <U+017F>tirring in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silviana</hi> being re<U+017F>olved to perplex him as much as <U+017F>he could, to make him think the meeting with her more <U+017F>weet: The news (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) which I do know, will fill you fuller of horrour then delight when you hear it; for being (as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you are) a Frank by Nation, as I my <U+017F>elf am, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but you mu<U+017F>t needs abhor to hear of <U+017F>o many, and <U+017F>o great crimes in a Monarch, who may boa<U+017F>t that he has the mo<U+017F>t glorious Empire in the Univer<U+017F>e under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet <U+017F>ince your civility would tax me with a crime if I did di<U+017F>obey you, I will tell you, that <hi>Childerick</hi> has <U+017F>tained his honour, by committing the mo<U+017F>t foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t and wicked act, that ever any Tyrant was guilty of. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> trembled at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which <hi>Silviana</hi> perceived, and continued thus: His impiety is <U+017F>o high, that it has emboldned him to di<U+017F>honour a woman, who<U+017F>e merit and virtue was as high as her beauty; and it is probable that you having been at Court have <U+017F>een her with eyes of admiration; for <hi>Silviana</hi> (that's her name) was never looked upon by any eye, but <U+017F>he won the heart of him that owned it. At the name of <hi>Silviana, Andrimartes</hi> was da<U+017F>h'd quite out of countenance, and ri<U+017F>ing up as if he were tran<U+017F>ported: O Heavens (<U+017F>aid he in a loud voice) has that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Tyrant <U+017F>atisfied his bruti<U+017F>h fury? has he triumphed over the virtue of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viana,</hi> and the honour of <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> Indeed, replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> he did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, but the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of that young woman, did fru<U+017F>trate the de<U+017F>ign of that Luxurious Tyrant; and her virtue made her have recour<U+017F>e unto a remedy, which was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary then violent.</p>
               <p>The la<U+017F>t words did a little calme the <U+017F>pirit of the Cavalier, and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Cephindres,</hi> who kept her handkerchief <U+017F>till before her face:

But <hi>Silviana</hi> <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o near death, was <U+017F>o frighted, that <U+017F>he knew not what <U+017F>he did; and her eyes twinkling, <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>tagger, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had fallen, if <U+017F>ome that <U+017F>tood by her had not taken her by the arm, and held her up as long as her <U+017F>wound continued: yet they not knowing the true cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>orrows, they thought it had been only remor<U+017F>e of con<U+017F>cience for the crime which they thought <U+017F>he had committed. The wife of <hi>Andreneck</hi> al<U+017F>o looked as pale as death, and amid<U+017F>t her <U+017F>ighs and tears, letting the word Madam <U+017F>ometimes e<U+017F>cape her tongue, <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e that looked upon her to think that fear of puni<U+017F>hment had already di<U+017F>tracted.</p>
               <p>In this manner they carried them into the Town of Fi<U+017F>me, which is not far from the City of Rhemois, and there they <U+017F>hut up in a mo<U+017F>t na<U+017F>ty pri<U+017F>on, where the Sun was a<U+017F>hamed ever to <U+017F>hine.

In order to the effecting of this re<U+017F>olution, he wended his way towards that City, and there re<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf as long as the night la<U+017F>ted, he came unto the Pallace of the Queen <hi>Methina,</hi> as <U+017F>he was going unto the Temple to offer a Sacrifice in the behalf of <hi>Childerick.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as be perceived her he <U+017F>tepped forward, and hit upon his opportunity <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly, that he had ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at her feet, before any came to give him the <U+017F>top: The Queen, who is the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e that evere bore a Scepter, did pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>tand <U+017F>till, and ca<U+017F>ting her eye upon this Shepherd, did ask him what he would have?

as among<U+017F>t Courtiers? This habit, Madam, which you <U+017F>ee me wear (<U+017F>aid he) is not <U+017F>utable unto my quality; but I did a<U+017F><U+017F>ume it only as a means to bring me in <U+017F>afety unto your pre<U+017F>ence. The Queen apprehending <U+017F>ome my<U+017F>tery in the matter, which de<U+017F>erved better examination: Well (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) at my return from the Temple, I will hear your rea<U+017F>ons and do you Ju<U+017F>tice. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o <U+017F>he went on, and the <U+017F>tranger was no <U+017F>ooner ri<U+017F>en up, but he was compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about with a great number of Cavaliers, who would not leave him until they knew his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Sacrifice being ended, the <U+017F>tranger was conducted into the Pallace, and from thence into the Queens chamber, who no <U+017F>ooner commanded him to <U+017F>peak, but he faithfully related the offence which he had received from <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus:</hi> He told her how in Lions they had both been rivals in the <U+017F>ervice of a great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and how <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus,</hi> prompted unto it by the motions of his jealou<U+017F>ie, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to ruine his reputation<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> In order unto this, <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> had a<U+017F><U+017F>embled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his friends together, and meeting him as he was <U+017F>ingle by him<U+017F>elf, he <U+017F>truck him three times with a ba<U+017F>tinado, before he could have time to defend him<U+017F>elf: afterwards all his friends fell upon him at once, and u<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o ill, that they left him for dead in the <U+017F>treet: after this he related how he recovered, and how the flight of <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> made him to <U+017F>eek him out in another Countrey, where having found him, he challenged him the field, where he did let out <U+017F>o much of his blood, as to wa<U+017F>h off the di<U+017F>honour that had <U+017F>tained his reputation. But Madam (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) <U+017F>ince this, has hapned an accident, which doth extreamly perplex me: Two Cavaliers who came to part <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> and me, are, as I am informed, seized upon as culpable of this homicide: and becau<U+017F>e they are put into a pri<U+017F>on in Fi<U+017F>mes, I am afraid their innocence will not <U+017F>ufficiently appear, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion do clear it: and therefore though I could have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away without being either taken or known, yet I re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ubmit my <U+017F>elf unto the mercy of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty, and do mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to <U+017F>tay all violent proceedings again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e innocent pri<U+017F>oners.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the <U+017F>tranger; and the Queen being inclinable to <U+017F>hew him favour, did for <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>iderations promi<U+017F>e him a pardon, upon condition he could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifle all that he had <U+017F>aid to be true, and at that very in<U+017F>tant commanded to <U+017F>end unto Fi<U+017F>me, and to bring before her tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons whom the father of <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> had taken pri<U+017F>oners. This command was executed with <U+017F>o much diligence that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> and <hi>Silviana</hi> were the very <U+017F>ame day conducted unto the Pallace; and as <U+017F>oon as ever the Queen <U+017F>aw <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> <U+017F>he entertained him with <U+017F>uch extraordinary Carre<U+017F><U+017F>es, that the father of <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed; yet being extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of his <U+017F>on, he ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at the feet of <hi>Methina,</hi> and demanded ju<U+017F>tice again<U+017F>t the Cavalier whom he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to be the A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of his <U+017F>on. But the Queen cau<U+017F>ing them to enter into her clo<U+017F>et, did u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch arguments unto the old man, in ju<U+017F>tification of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that he was quite convinced of the bad opinion which he entertained of him. The Father of <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>atisfied, but <hi>Andrimartes</hi> under<U+017F>tanding from the Queen what the <U+017F>tranger had done, he began to relate the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between him and <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus,</hi> and did <U+017F>o faithfully report the la<U+017F>t words of that dying man, that after the example of the <U+017F>on, the father was forced to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Conquerour.</p>
               <p>This accident was the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Court, until it began to be late, and the Queen di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing the father of <hi>Cle<U+017F>iodorus,</hi> <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner alone with <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi> but the memory of the misfortune, or rather the debauchery of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> did cau<U+017F>e her to fall into a <U+017F>tream of tears. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> did exceedingly pity her; and notwith<U+017F>tanding the great cau<U+017F>e he had to be revenged of <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> he was even forced to grant unto the tears and the prayers of the Queen, that pardon which <U+017F>he begged for her <U+017F>on. After this <U+017F>he enquired where <hi>Silvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was; unto which <hi>Andrimartes</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that he heard <U+017F>he was returned into Gaul Armorique, and that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent her brother to give him an accompt of what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. The Queen commanded pre<U+017F>ently that he <U+017F>hould enter, and as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Silviana</hi> did obey<U+017F>ance unto her, truly (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>) he is the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t young man that ever I <U+017F>aw, and has many of tho<U+017F>e fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

Some few hours before their departure, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> hearing that I was in the Pallace, retained there by my wounds, he was plea<U+017F>ed to honour me with a vi<U+017F>it, and there, after he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood from me all the particulars of the Combate wherein I had been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he related unto me all that you have heard.</p>

               <p>All this great troop, to whom was added the brothers of <hi>Circinea, Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> were not long before they arrived at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> who intending to receive them very well, did carry them into a very noble room, where they found a collation ready: After which, carrying them into his gallery, unto <U+017F>ome he expounded the Pictures; he made others admire the excellency of the work; all being very plea<U+017F>ingly diverted, they were in the conclu<U+017F>ion di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>it down. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did all that <U+017F>he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could to treat the Princes with all magnificence, and her endeavours were not lo<U+017F>t: for though the <U+017F>iege might excu<U+017F>e many defects, yet <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o very careful in entertaining them well, as they confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that the <U+017F>umptuo<U+017F>ity of her banquets was not inferiour to the expences of the greate<U+017F>t Monarchs.</p>
               <p>That day after the repa<U+017F>t was done, <U+017F>he acquainted them with her fears, that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> would Arm anew again<U+017F>t her. But <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond, Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> and <hi>Godomar,</hi> did promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o often never to for<U+017F>ake her until <U+017F>he was in a condition free from all manner of fears, her mind was <U+017F>atisfied. Giving them therefore mo<U+017F>t hearty thanks, for the te<U+017F>timonies of good will which they had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, <U+017F>he be<U+017F>eeched them not to live in any way of con<U+017F>traint, but to command freely any manner of thing that was in her power. After this, <U+017F>he went unto her clo<U+017F>et, and took order for her Dome<U+017F>tick affairs; and the Princes going into a chamber where mo<U+017F>t of the Nymphs, Ladies, and Cavaliers were, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> drew <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi> a little a<U+017F>ide, and held this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with her.</p>
               <p>What cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>oever you have, my faire<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to think all men incon<U+017F>tant, I am confident that what I have done is enough to make you change that opinion, or at the lea<U+017F>t make you confe<U+017F>s, that my fidelity de<U+017F>erves an exception from the common <U+017F>ort of men, as well as doth my birth. Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that you have done much more, then I know how to merit, is without all manner of doubt: but that your fidelity is above the <U+017F>train of other men, pardon me, I be<U+017F>eech you, if I do not ab<U+017F>olutely confe<U+017F>s it, <U+017F>ince it is alwayes the end that crowns any work, and <U+017F>ince I cannot tell whether you will be as con<U+017F>tant for the future, as you have been hitherto. This diffidence, <U+017F>aid the Prince, is no <U+017F>mall argument of your <U+017F>mall affection: It is an argument, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility which I have of my own imperfections, which are more like to quench affection then to inflame it. The only imperfection whereof I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) is that you do not love me enough; and yet you are in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort excu<U+017F>able, <U+017F>ince it is a very hard matter to finde one man among<U+017F>t mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, that is worthy of <U+017F>o great an honour and happine<U+017F><U+017F>e as to enjoy you. The<U+017F>e flattering expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde</hi>) do <U+017F>mell too much of artifice and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>imulation, and are unworthy of a man that makes profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of loving rightly: If you intend to u<U+017F>e no other language but this, I will not <U+017F>ay that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unfaithful, but will think you are <U+017F>o already. What thoughts <U+017F>oever you have of me (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till e<U+017F>teem you above all the women in the world; and if you do not think that tho<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies which I have given of my <U+017F>elf, do not proceed from a clear heart and <U+017F>oul, I be<U+017F>eech you appoint me Laws, and tell me how you would have me behave my <U+017F>elf, for I prote<U+017F>t I will mo<U+017F>t invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably ob<U+017F>erve them: It becomes not me, Sir, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to give Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; and <U+017F>ince your rank and quality is not to receive them from any but the Gods, if you do love me, let the God of love pre<U+017F>cribe them unto you. It is love, my faire<U+017F>t, an<U+017F>wered the Prince, which commands me to think that all the beauties in the world are inferiour unto yours; and that all merits are too little, if compared unto your high perfections.</p>
               <p>Love then, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> is like unto tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pectacles which deceive the eyes, and makes all objects <U+017F>eem greater then they are: No, no, my bright Star, <U+017F>aid the Prince, I do look upon you as you are, and let me peri<U+017F>h if I do not think, that envy it <U+017F>elf is not able to find the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of any defect in you:

                  </gap> good Sir, continued <U+017F>he, let us talk no more of my beauty; for if you do, you will but anger me, <U+017F>ince I am in the lea<U+017F>t degree owner of what you pre<U+017F>cribe unto me; but I wi<U+017F>h I were, that I might be more plea<U+017F>ing unto you: All I can <U+017F>ay is, that <U+017F>uch as I am, have a perfect inclination to honour you: Then all I can <U+017F>ay (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and interrupted her) is, that I am the mo<U+017F>t happy man alive, and that the love which I bear unto you, joyned with the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which you give me of your affection, is a thou<U+017F>and times more dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me then my Fathers Scepter: O heavens (<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) the Scepter of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debaut,</hi> and the affection you bear unto me, are two things which will <U+017F>ute very ill together: For the one will no <U+017F>ooner come into your hands, but the other will go out of your heart.</p>
               <p>All my oaths, vows, and prote<U+017F>tations (an<U+017F>wered the Prince) <U+017F>hould methinks remove all <U+017F>uch <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions out of your mind, and believe it, my faire<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> the effects of my fidelity may well make you cea<U+017F>e doubting of my faith, if you would but plea<U+017F>e to call them into your memory; but to my great happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, you do not judge rightly upon my humour, and are per<U+017F>waded that the name of King can exclude that of Lover: but, No, no, my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde,</hi> the di<U+017F>cretion which you have <U+017F>een in all my actions, is a mo<U+017F>t evident demon<U+017F>tration that I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto any thing which can offend you, and that entertaining no pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion but what is legitimate, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erve it as pure and <U+017F>acred when I have an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as now when I am only in hopes of it: I wi<U+017F>h I were more free then I am, that I might be able to give you a better a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of it; but <U+017F>ince I do ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the power of a father, and a Father incen<U+017F>ed, I cannot at this time do any more then make a mo<U+017F>t faithful promi<U+017F>e to marry you, as <U+017F>oon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I am at liberty.</p>

Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>hould I refu<U+017F>e to give you that <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which you expect from me, I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t worthy of puni<U+017F>hment, as being guilty of an unpardonable <U+017F>in; But I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to con<U+017F>ider, that your <U+017F>atisfaction do not wholly depend upon me, but that there are two per<U+017F>ons more who are al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily required, and whom I believe we cannot ea<U+017F>ily meet withal; yet I do mo<U+017F>t faithfully promi<U+017F>e to endeavour, with all my power, the <U+017F>atisfaction of your de<U+017F>ires. Upon this <U+017F>he embraced them all three; and <hi>Adamas</hi> not being able to imagine the meaning of all this, he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Phillis</hi> to tell him why the<U+017F>e fair ones made this reque<U+017F>t unto him? Father (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) <U+017F>ince you do know, that the Decrees of the gods are unalterable, you will not wonder at the relation which I <U+017F>hall make unto you: The<U+017F>e three fair ones not long <U+017F>ince received an Oracle, which commanded them to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Forre<U+017F>ts, and there to <U+017F>eek for a remedy again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries which love had bred among<U+017F>t them: and that you may know from whom it is, they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, I <U+017F>hall repeat unto you the <U+017F>ame Oracle which they received.</p>

               <p>This was the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e that <hi>Palanice</hi> and I had of it together, by which I was fully informed of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Sileines,</hi> and of her inclination to entertain his court<U+017F>hip: <U+017F>o as having in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort found out her humour, I <U+017F>olicited in his behalf, that after removal of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall difficulties, <U+017F>he permitted him to <U+017F>erve her; upon condition he would behave him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly, that his very thoughts could not be condemned: which <hi>Sileines</hi> promi<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>o many prote<U+017F>tations, that I believe the earth would have opned and <U+017F>wallowed him up, if he had been perjured.</p>
               <p>Ever <U+017F>ince that time, he continued his court<U+017F>hip, with <U+017F>o much love and a<U+017F><U+017F>idui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the heart of <hi>Palanice</hi> had been a hundred times harder then Marble, if <U+017F>he had not been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: I remember one day he de<U+017F>ired her to give him a favour; <U+017F>he, de<U+017F>iring time to con<U+017F>ider of it, came unto me the very <U+017F>ame day, and entreated me to tell her, whether it were ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he would give him <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timonies of her affection: to which I an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did really love him, and knew his di<U+017F>cretion <U+017F>o great as might a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her of his love, <U+017F>he might well let him know, that <U+017F>he e<U+017F>teemed him above any other; but yet I advi<U+017F>ed her to make triall upon <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion, whether his love was an<U+017F>werable to his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions.</p>

                  <hi>Palanice</hi> hearkned unto my advice, and fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he gave him a favour, which was a bracelet of her hair, woven with gold thred into letters, which made the<U+017F>e words; <hi>Better the Heart then the Arm:</hi> The fir<U+017F>t time <hi>Sileines</hi> <U+017F>aw her, he begg'd again for a favour; I will (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) give you a te<U+017F>timony of my amity, but withal, I would have you give me in exchange a te<U+017F>timony of your obedience. <hi>Sileines,</hi> who to obtain this honour, would have promi<U+017F>ed impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, did <U+017F>wear wha<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired.

As to the fir<U+017F>t of your commands, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sileines</hi>) there is no great difficulty, Madam, in obtaining it; for nothing can come from you. but is more worthy of admiration then laughter: But, Madam, as for the <U+017F>econd, pardon me I be<U+017F>eech you, if I do not promi<U+017F>e more then I am able to perform: for I am <U+017F>o infinitly de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee that which is a te<U+017F>timony of your affection, as I dare not <U+017F>wear I will ab<U+017F>tain a day from the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o dear a favour: Well, replied <hi>Palanice,</hi> then promi<U+017F>e me you will not look upon it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you be come unto your own chamber: I will Madam (replied <hi>Sileines</hi>) <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire it.</p>

               <p>Fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> it would be <U+017F>uperfluous to relate all his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, upon this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing <U+017F>ubject: it is <U+017F>ufficient I tell you, that he <U+017F>tayed in his clo<U+017F>et above two howers, and would have <U+017F>tayed there much longer, if <hi>Lucindor</hi> had not called him, who came to invite him from <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> to a cour<U+017F>e at the ring, which was to be held within two or three dayes by the Queens command. It was not long before I knew from <hi>Palanice</hi> her <U+017F>elf, that <hi>Sileines</hi> had this bracelet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told her that <U+017F>he had already done much at the reque<U+017F>t of this young Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier; and that I thought it expedient for her to try by <U+017F>ome artifice or other, whether he did really love her. <hi>Palanice</hi> told me that <U+017F>he would, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eight dayes were over, <U+017F>he would tell me what <U+017F>he had done: but it it fit I <U+017F>hould tell you how <U+017F>he went to work, that you may <U+017F>ee the quickne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her wit.</p>
               <p>I told you before, that within two or three dayes after <hi>Sileines</hi> had the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the Queen was to be<U+017F>tow a ring, at which <U+017F>he would have <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> to run, and with him all the Cavalry of the Court; and <hi>Sileines</hi> being one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Gallants in it, he was invited unto it by this young Prince. The next morning, then he went to acquaint <hi>Palanice</hi>; and <U+017F>he, who was very glad of that occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to execute her de<U+017F>ign; as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Sileines</hi> began to <U+017F>peak of it, and <U+017F>ay that he thought none was able to di<U+017F>pute with him for this ring, <U+017F>ince he ran at it for the love of her: You (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Palanice</hi>) <U+017F>hall not di<U+017F>pute for it with any, for you <U+017F>hall not run at all. Pardon me, Madam, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid the Cavalier: for <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> commanded me unto it by <hi>Lucindor.</hi> And I, replied <hi>Palanice,</hi> do forbid you. I hope, replied <hi>Sileines,</hi> you are more ju<U+017F>t, and a greater friend unto my reputation, then to forbid me the performance of what I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed: Ah <hi>Sileines</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palanice</hi>) this is but a <U+017F>lender argument of any power that I have over you. Why, Madam, (replied the Cavalier) were it that your <U+017F>ervice called me another way, I prote<U+017F>t I would excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, and had rather di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> then you; or if you do po<U+017F>itively command it <U+017F>o, I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; Then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palanice</hi>) di<U+017F>engage your <U+017F>elf from your promi<U+017F>e; for if you do love, or will obey me, do not run, but <U+017F>tay with me all that day whil<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t are at the <U+017F>port. <hi>Sileines</hi> was a little importunate to know the rea<U+017F>ons which moved her unto this; but <hi>Palanice</hi> her <U+017F>elf knowing none, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give him any. The very <U+017F>ame night, he went unto the chamber of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and being not able to think upon any thing but the commands of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, he took his opportunity <U+017F>o fitly, that as he was coming to this young Prince, his foot <U+017F>lipt, and he fell down to the ground: At the fir<U+017F>t, none thought he had received any hurt, but <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> him<U+017F>elf began to laugh; but when they <U+017F>aw him get up, with much pain, and that he complained, every one came to him to know how he did; he told them that his ancle was out of joint, and the young Prince believing it, cau<U+017F>ed a coach to be immediatly made ready to carry him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber: afterwards <U+017F>ent <U+017F>everal Chirurgeons with <U+017F>pecial charge to have care of his cure; but <hi>Sileines</hi> who would not be vi<U+017F>ited, le<U+017F>t a report <U+017F>hould be made of his heart, contrary to his intention, he told them he had <U+017F>ent for a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon of his own, in who<U+017F>e experience he had a great confidence.</p>
               <p>The noi<U+017F>e of this mi<U+017F>hap which was believed to befall <hi>Sileines,</hi> was quickly <U+017F>pred all over the Town, and <hi>Palanice</hi> was not the la<U+017F>t that heard of it: yet <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ignorant of the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he entreated <hi>Cerintes</hi> to go and <U+017F>ee him; but <hi>Sileines</hi> hearing that <hi>Palanice</hi> was plea<U+017F>ed to have any care of him, I be<U+017F>eech you Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Cerintes,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Palanice,</hi> that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to pity my mi<U+017F>hap, I feel no pain: and were I freed from my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, that I cannot wait upon <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> at the Cour<U+017F>e, there is nothing now that would trouble me: which <hi>Cerintes</hi> having told unto his <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently under<U+017F>tood his meaning, <U+017F>o apt are Lovers to expound the words and actions which do any thing concern them.</p>
               <p>The day a<U+017F><U+017F>igned for the Cour<U+017F>e at the ring came, and <hi>Sileines</hi> with a <U+017F>taff in his hand, as if he could not go without it, coming to the lodging of <hi>Palanice,</hi>

he waited upon her unto a friends hou<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e windows looked towards the place where the Cour<U+017F>e was to be: It was not long after before <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> came, and with him a great number of Cavaliers, all whom, after a long di<U+017F>pute, yielded the prai<U+017F>e unto the agility of that young Prince, who carried it away, to the great contentment of all the Court.

As long as I have done nothing (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sileines</hi>) which renders me unworthy to enjoy it, is it not extream inju<U+017F>tice to ravi<U+017F>h it from me: tell me no more of inju<U+017F>tice (replied <hi>Palanice</hi>) all the rea<U+017F>on in the world allows me to take my own where ere I find it: I am afraid, replied <hi>Sileines,</hi> that you will have much ado to unty it; for there are a thou<U+017F>and knots upon it: No matter, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Palanice</hi>) I have a pair of Sci<U+017F><U+017F>ers which will do that office excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well, if you will but hold out your arm. Well, well, per<U+017F>idious woman (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sileines</hi> in a rage and holding out his arm) <U+017F>atisfie your fury, and take your fill in ruining me, I will not give you <U+017F>o much advantage, as to <U+017F>ay hereafter, that ever I oppo<U+017F>ed your will in any thing: Upon this <hi>Palanice</hi> did cut the ribband which tyed it together, and having put it into her pocket: Go now (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) even whether you plea<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ay that you are beholding unto me for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your chains and <U+017F>etting you at liberty: in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, not <U+017F>o much as ca<U+017F>ting a look upon him; and poor <hi>Sileines,</hi> <U+017F>unk in <U+017F>orrow, went away; but quite cured of his lamene<U+017F><U+017F>e, for his rage had made him forget his <U+017F>taffe, and to counterfeit a cripple, as he did when he came.</p>
               <p>His humour (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who <U+017F>at and <U+017F>aid not a word till now) point blank contrary unto mine: could I with any patience ever endure <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould call me trouble<U+017F>ome, and accu<U+017F>e me of too little merit for her? Let me dy if I would not have given her, not only the bracelet, but dublet, <U+017F>hirt, and all, to be delivered from the Tyranny of <U+017F>uch a peevi<U+017F>h piece. <hi>Sileines</hi> did not <U+017F>o, replied <hi>Florice,</hi> but being enraged at <U+017F>uch treatment from that fair one, he re<U+017F>olved to come no more where <U+017F>he was; and began to prepare him<U+017F>elf for travel, <U+017F>o find <U+017F>ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy again<U+017F>t his <U+017F>orrows.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the running at the ring was ended, <hi>Palanice</hi> came to give me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of all <U+017F>he had done; and becau<U+017F>e I knew by her looks and <U+017F>peech, that <U+017F>he repented of it, I advi<U+017F>ed her to think upon a remedy.

Though we had known nothing of what had hapned unto her brother, yet we might well have imagined it by the di<U+017F>order in the hou<U+017F>e: for the inquietude wherein <hi>Cercinea</hi> was, and tho<U+017F>e tears which <U+017F>omtimes fell from her eyes did give us <U+017F>ufficient knowledg of it: yet <U+017F>eeming to be ignorant of all, we be<U+017F>eeched her not to conceal from us the cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>orrow. She was not at all <U+017F>hie in telling us all very freely; how about two hours ago <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een her brother <U+017F>o extreamly troubled and offended, that it greived her very heart; for, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he asked <U+017F>ome money of me, which he gave me to keep, he cau<U+017F>ed all his clothes to be packed up, he commanded his hor<U+017F>es to be made ready, and I <U+017F>aw him in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>order, as it troubled my very <U+017F>oul: I wi<U+017F>h (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palanice</hi>) that he were here, for he would not hide from me the cau<U+017F>e of his di<U+017F>content: Alas, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea</hi> innocently, never believe that; I think he loves me very well, and that I have as much power with him as any in the world, but all my prayers and de<U+017F>ires could not get one word from him.

               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know, fair and ju<U+017F>t Judge, that of the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers, to wit, <hi>Lucindor</hi> the brother of <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Cerintes</hi> the brother of <hi>Palanice, Lucin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed love unto me.

But however, thus it began: <hi>Lucindor</hi> hapned one day to come into a great deal of good company, where they fell into talk of me, and to lament the death of a young Cavalier, who they <U+017F>ay <U+017F>erved me, and who <U+017F>ome five or <U+017F>ix months before was <U+017F>lain by a man whom he loved. This Cavalier was called <hi>Meli<U+017F>eor</hi>; a man of an excellent wit, and one who though very young, yet e<U+017F>teemed one of the be<U+017F>t Schollers of all Gaul-Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one<U+017F><U+017F>e. Now after many a <U+017F>igh at the remembrance of this lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, they a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Lucindor,</hi> that there was an extream re<U+017F>emblance betwixt him and <hi>Meli<U+017F>eor,</hi> and that they found the very <U+017F>ame features in both their faces: which <hi>Lucindor</hi> being very glad of, and proud of that re<U+017F>emblance, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee me, and to try whether he <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ame inclination unto me which the <U+017F>aid <hi>Meli<U+017F>eor</hi> had; but <U+017F>ee the power of Sympathy, or rather De<U+017F>tiny: <hi>Lucindor</hi> being brought by <hi>Cercinea,</hi> unto a place where I was in company, he no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me but he was ravi<U+017F>ht; and <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be captivated by that appearance of beauty which he <U+017F>aw in my face, he made a <U+017F>ecret Sacrifice of his liberty unto me. For my part, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, his hand<U+017F>ome mind <U+017F>o charmed me, that I pre<U+017F>ently began to have a de<U+017F>ign upon him, and to <U+017F>pruce up my <U+017F>elf to catch him; but it was not long before I <U+017F>aw, that the place which I intended to be<U+017F>iege was already rendred unto me: for <hi>Lucindor,</hi> after <U+017F>ome amorous <U+017F>quints had pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed between us' coming nearer me: Did you know, fair <hi>Florice</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me, an encounter that is befallen me, it would make you laugh: and you may make it <U+017F>ad or plea<U+017F>ant unto me, as you plea<U+017F>e. I an<U+017F>wered only with a <U+017F>mile which told him, that his fir<U+017F>t acco<U+017F>t was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto me, and this made him the more confident and bold to go on, and relate unto me what they had told him of the re<U+017F>emblance he had with <hi>Meli<U+017F>eor</hi>; and truly (<U+017F>aid he) I do verily believe it, <U+017F>ince they told me at the <U+017F>ame time that he loved you, and <U+017F>ince the fir<U+017F>t time my eyes had the honour to <U+017F>ee you, I was never able to defend my <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e overcoming charms wherewith you have captivated me.

that I yielded unto his importunity, and permiting him to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in writing, I received almo<U+017F>t every day a Letter from him for a long while together, all which he gave unto me him<U+017F>elf; for want of a per<U+017F>on whom I dur<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t with the intere<U+017F>t which I had in him.

This did not put me to a little pains; and the more, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lucindor,</hi> having <U+017F>ome touch of a jealous nature, did evidently make it appear unto me, that he could not brook his Rival without abundance of impatiencience; yet I carried my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o <U+017F>wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, both to the one and the other, that they both went away without any rea<U+017F>on to boa<U+017F>t of any particular <U+017F>atisfaction. Yet I had a <U+017F>tronger inclination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Lucindor</hi> then <hi>Cerintes</hi>; and the greate<U+017F>t light that ever he had of it was one night when we were at the table, and je<U+017F>ting with one another, my Father gave a book unto us, out of which we might draw our fortunes; either for war, or for riches, or for love, or marriage, or many other <U+017F>everal things: <hi>Cerintes</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t who ca<U+017F>t the dice, to know whether or no, he <U+017F>hould obtain his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and met with a very favourable lot which gave him great contentment. <hi>Lucindor</hi> on the contrary, he was <U+017F>o unfortunate, as he met with the mo<U+017F>t unkind an<U+017F>wer in all the book; at which <U+017F>eeing him a little troubled, ca<U+017F>t the dice again (<U+017F>aid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) for to be more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of the truth, one mu<U+017F>t try more then once: to which <hi>Lucindor</hi> con<U+017F>enting, he threw the dice the <U+017F>econd time; but meeting with the very <U+017F>ame fortune, he fell into a mo<U+017F>t furious cha<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>wore he would eat the dice if he met with the <U+017F>ame lot again; but he might well be angry with his Fortune, for it changed not; for throwing the dice again he was as unhappy as before. Let me die, if it did not extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h me, for though I gave no credit unto <U+017F>uch fooleries, yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that our affection would meet with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter event. Being no le<U+017F><U+017F>e damped at this chance then he, I took up the dice; but <hi>Lucindor</hi> laid his hand upon mine to take them from me, and eat them according to his oath; and <U+017F>eeing I re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him, he prayed me to give them unto him: but I <U+017F>aid unto him in a low voice, I fear <hi>Lucindor,</hi> that you will u<U+017F>e them ill, if I <U+017F>ubmit them to your mercy: I will u<U+017F>e them (<U+017F>aid he) as an enemy, that has robb'd me of all my hopes, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will be plea<U+017F>ed to make my De<U+017F>tiny more kind unto me then they have: your welfare <hi>Lucindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) depends upon your merit, and not upon chance; and therefore, if you have any good opinion of your <U+017F>elf, let me advi<U+017F>e you to hope well. You mu<U+017F>t peremptorily command me <U+017F>o to do (replied he) if it be your plea<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould live. Well (<U+017F>aid I unto him in a low voice) I do then command you, and be confident you <U+017F>hall be as happy as I can make you. Upon this, I threw the dice upon the Table, and we continued in our rallary, until it was my Fathers plea<U+017F>ure to retire.</p>
               <p>It was not the latter end of Winter, and as ill luck was, an Aunt of mine who lived in the countrey, fell <U+017F>ick, and <U+017F>ent to entreat my Father that I might come and <U+017F>tay with her. Upon this I went, and being well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that both <hi>Lucindor</hi> and <hi>Cerintes</hi> would come and vi<U+017F>it me, I was afraid, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome fits of jealou<U+017F>ie <U+017F>hould make them fall foul upon each other, as they met upon the way; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charged them both, upon pain of my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, not to <U+017F>tir out of Lions: <hi>Cerintes</hi> was obedient, and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e his obedience did much plea<U+017F>e me, But <hi>Lucindor,</hi> after he had endured this ab<U+017F>ence, with as much grief as a man that loves well could do, and imagining, that what crime <U+017F>oever he committed, I loved him <U+017F>o well as to pardon it, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee me, and began to con<U+017F>ider upon the way how.</p>
               <p>Fortune pre<U+017F>ently after favoured his de<U+017F>ires: for my Aunt <U+017F>ending a young man to acquaint my Father with her recovery, <hi>Lucindor</hi> chanced to meet with him, and knew <U+017F>o well how to tickle the fellow with fair words, that he made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e to bring him unto my chamber, when I was ready to go into bed. So as when the young man was returned, and told us how glad my Father was to hear
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53528:150"/>
of his Si<U+017F>ters recovery, he began to think upon the promi<U+017F>e which he made unto <hi>Lucindor,</hi> who according to appointment, was to come that night: The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier in the interim forgot not his time; but before I tell you how I received him, I will tell you what befel him by the way.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>et out of Lions in the evening, none taking any notice of him; and becau<U+017F>e the gates of the Town did u<U+017F>e alwayes to be <U+017F>hut very timely, he went out al<U+017F>o betimes, and <U+017F>tayed in the <U+017F>uburbs until it was a fit time for him to <U+017F>et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The air was very muddy, and much di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto rain: <U+017F>o as he was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et forward, but the clouds began to open, and <U+017F>hower down in <U+017F>uch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that though he had a very thick cloak, yet was he as wet, as if he had been thrown into a river: The Moon lent no light at all; and thus accompanied with rain and ob<U+017F>curity, he went on his journey; yet chearing up him<U+017F>elf in hopes of enjoying two or three <U+017F>weet hours with me. He had not gone above the third part of a mile, but mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing his way, and galloping through woods and bu<U+017F>hes, he hit his head again<U+017F>t <U+017F>omething which <U+017F>truct off his hat: at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant he <U+017F>pied a man, who, as he thought, had an intention to pull him off from his hor<U+017F>e: At the fir<U+017F>t, he apprehended him to be <U+017F>ome thief who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way for a prize; therefore <U+017F>purring on his hor<U+017F>e, he galloped <U+017F>ome four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fifty paces, afterwards he <U+017F>topped, and drew his <U+017F>word, ready to defend him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t any that followed him: He <U+017F>tood a while in this po<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>till en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during all the rain, which powred down fa<U+017F>ter and fa<U+017F>ter. Seeing none came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, he li<U+017F>tned with his ear, to try whether he could hear any noi<U+017F>e; and then he thought he heard <U+017F>ome laugh near the place where he <U+017F>aw the man; but not thinking it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find his hat again, he put his cloak over his head, and in this equipage he came to my Aunts hou<U+017F>e, and at the gate, he found the fellow that had promi<U+017F>ed to let him enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucindor</hi> was <U+017F>o pitifully wet, that his clothes made a <U+017F>tream of water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever he came, yet being <U+017F>hewed which was my chamber, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Yet imagining, that perhaps <U+017F>ome grand rea<U+017F>on had induced him unto this di<U+017F>obedience, I asked him with a trembling voice, if my Father was well, and he an<U+017F>wered, yes. What is it then (<U+017F>aid I unto him) which makes you <U+017F>o bold as to come out of Lions and de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e my commands? My love, replied he, which would not let me live and not <U+017F>ee you. How? (<U+017F>aid I) will <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter move you to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me? Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, do you think the life of a man that loves you above all the world, <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter? very well, <hi>Lucindor,</hi> replied I, and <U+017F>eemed to be extreamly angry, <U+017F>ince you do love your life <U+017F>o well, and <U+017F>ince it concerns me to have a care of my reputation, <U+017F>tay not a jot longer in this place, where neither of us both can be in <U+017F>afety. He offered to reply <U+017F>omething, but I interrupted him, go, go, <U+017F>aid I, ha<U+017F>te away as fa<U+017F>t as ever you can, upon pain of eternal di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. Upon this I ran into my Wardrobe and <U+017F>hut the door, re<U+017F>olved not to come out till he was gone out of the chamber: But <hi>Lucindor,</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till, as if he were immovable; but at la<U+017F>t, enraged at my cold entertainment of him, he went out in a mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate mood, and took hor<U+017F>e without a hat, though the fellow which gave him entrance did offer to lend him one.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as he was gone, I would needs know by what trick he had thus <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me; and the young fellow confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing that it was by his means, al<U+017F>o that <hi>Lucindor</hi> told him, he came upon bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e that was very <U+017F>erviceable to me; though I fir<U+017F>t threat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lucindor</hi> in the mean time returned homewards, the mo<U+017F>t afflicted man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received any ill treatment from his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; but as if the weather were more kind unto him then I: the clouds cleared up, and the Moon <U+017F>hined upon him as if it were a new day; and therefore riding on, he e<U+017F>pied upon his left hand, a gibbet, rai<U+017F>ed up above the ground, about eight or nine foot, and <U+017F>ome three or
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53528:151"/>
four paces further, a corps lying upon the ground, he began to think it the body of <U+017F>ome Fellon, but he could not imagine why the corps that <U+017F>hould have been upon the gibbet, <U+017F>hould be under it. At la<U+017F>t, con<U+017F>idering upon it, he remembred what adventure he met withal about that <U+017F>ame place and imagining, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps riding under this gibbet, he light upon the corps and threw it down, and then believed that this was the theif whom he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected; and to confirm him in this belief, as he rode a little further he found his hat, which he took up, and continued in his way: the only thing wherein he was not <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fied, was, that he thought he heard <U+017F>ome laugh; but hearing upon a <U+017F>udden, the cry of <U+017F>ome Owl or night Raven, which u<U+017F>ed to feed upon that corps, he found his mi<U+017F>take, and that his fears at that time had in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort di<U+017F>ordered his judgement: <hi>Lucindor</hi> hath <U+017F>ince confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto me, that he could laugh heartily at this adventure, if the condition wherein he was would permit him to entertain any other thoughts, but <U+017F>uch as bore the image of de<U+017F>pair: and if it was true which he told me, his <U+017F>oul was <U+017F>o <U+017F>unk in <U+017F>orrows, that nothing in the world was able to rai<U+017F>e it unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pitch of mirth. Thinking therefore upon the cold entertainment which I gave him, he began to <U+017F>igh out <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ad complaints again<U+017F>t me, that his journey ended <U+017F>ooner then his <U+017F>orrows. Yet night not being done, he called at the hou<U+017F>e from whence he departed, and <U+017F>taying there till the gates of the Town were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he went unto his own hou<U+017F>e; in which he was no <U+017F>ooner entred but a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>eized upon him, and in a <U+017F>hort time grew <U+017F>o violent, that every one de<U+017F>paired of his recovery.</p>
               <p>My Aunt was now perfectly recovered; and my Father <U+017F>ending for me home. I was no <U+017F>ooner returned, but I heard <hi>Lucindor</hi> was ready to die.

All the Phy<U+017F>icians of <hi>Gondebaut</hi> were imployed about him; but as he told me, I had better Phy<U+017F>ick for his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e then all they: for indeed, as <U+017F>oon as ever he heard that I had pardoned his di<U+017F>obedience, he began to mend, and within twelve dayes after left his bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cerintes</hi> in the mean time had entirely gotten the good will of my Father, and yet being unwilling to marry an enemy, he did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to make me a friend; but <U+017F>till finding that <hi>Lucindor</hi> was highly in my favour, and that I looked upon him with a more favourable eye then upon him<U+017F>elf, he began to be almo<U+017F>t furious. He intended therefore to te<U+017F>tifie his re<U+017F>entments to the height; and thus he went to work. One evening, when <hi>Lucindor</hi> and he did come to keep my Father company, after <U+017F>ome ordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I entreated <hi>Cerintes</hi> to <U+017F>ing: he taking my Lute, mu<U+017F>ick Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto me) does not <U+017F>ympathize with my <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e; yet <U+017F>ince you command me, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ing you a very new air, which one of my be<U+017F>t friends compo<U+017F>ed, and none but my <U+017F>elf ever heard as yet: upon this he <U+017F>ate down, tuned the Lute, looked upon me, and <U+017F>ung certain ver<U+017F>es which extreamly reflected upon his Rival.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, he laid the Lute down upon the Table, and <U+017F>at <U+017F>ilent: I blu<U+017F>h'd; but on the contrary, <hi>Lucindor</hi> grew pale; and I ob<U+017F>erved, that he had an itching de<U+017F>ire to call him to an accompt for the words of his <U+017F>ong. Yet being in a place where re<U+017F>pect tyed him to the good behaviour, he contented him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ay this unto him: Your <U+017F>ong, <hi>Cerintes,</hi> is very fine, and I believe, that if he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ing it before any that was concerned in it, it would beget a quarrel: Perhaps (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cerintes</hi>) it was <U+017F>o intended: Then they looked upon each other in <U+017F>uch a manner, as made my Father plainly perceive the cau<U+017F>e of their quarrel: and therefore intending to <U+017F>top the cour<U+017F>e, he carryed them both into his clo<U+017F>et, and u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive arguments as made them friends; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

At the name of <hi>Adrastes,</hi> all the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es came about him; and <hi>Doris</hi> not imagining he would ever return without <hi>Palemon,</hi> <U+017F>he began at the fir<U+017F>t to be much troubled, and to fear <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>ee him again: following therefore the <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>tion of her fears, <U+017F>he approached unto him, and as <U+017F>oon as he had returned an an<U+017F>wer unto the Druide, good <hi>Adrastes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) what news of <hi>Palemon?</hi> The Shepherd then looking upon her with a kind of <U+017F>mile which was mixed with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, better news of him, fair <hi>Doris</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) then you expect, if at the lea<U+017F>t I may judge of your thoughts by the palene<U+017F><U+017F>e in your cheeks.

Sometimes (<U+017F>aid <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the mo<U+017F>t faithful are not the mo<U+017F>t happy: No, no, <U+017F>aid I unto my <U+017F>elf, for if they were, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>hould be as happy as <hi>Palemon,</hi> for he is as faithful, and yet <hi>Doris</hi> is none of mine: afterwards I replied aloud, the fault may be in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of the ma<U+017F>ters, which is a thing whereof <hi>Halladine</hi> cannot accu<U+017F>e <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>; for he has more judgement then not to acknowledge his <U+017F>ervices according to their merits.</p>

For my part, I ended the night as I begun it which was without ever clo<U+017F>ing an eye, or finding any ea<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e fretting thoughts, which the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and misfortune of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> infu<U+017F>ed into me: Then did I experimentally find, that of all di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es there is none that hath <U+017F>o few remedies as love; but this experience did nothing el<U+017F>e but fe<U+017F>ter my wound, and the more, becau<U+017F>e being out of all hopes ever to be cured, I never dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much as pretend unto, or look for any comfort.

If any memory of the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ad accident which hapned unto you be the cau<U+017F>e of it, and if that thought do nouri<U+017F>h a <U+017F>orrow in it, for not being alwayes in your perfect <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider, that <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ought not to trouble your mind, by rea<U+017F>on of your joyes at your perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: be<U+017F>ides, that were to grumble at the will of heaven, which was plea<U+017F>ed to deprive you of your rea<U+017F>on only for a time, to render you afterwards a more eminent mea<U+017F>ure of it: I heartily be<U+017F>eech you my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> to tell me what it is which troubles you: I do conjure you unto it, by the torments which I <U+017F>uffer to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly afflicted; by the affection which I bear unto you, and which I de<U+017F>ire you <U+017F>hould bear unto me, I be<U+017F>eech you do not hide the cau<U+017F>e of it from me, and to believe, that if it do lie within the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of my power to apply any remedy unto it, I will not <U+017F>pare my own contentment, or my life, to procure it.

I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Father, that at the name of <hi>Doris</hi> all my blood did ri<U+017F>e, and now thinking it a crime again<U+017F>t her not to <U+017F>atisfie the de<U+017F>ires of <hi>Palemon,</hi> being conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto it by her name: Dear <hi>Palemon</hi> (replied I) you have <U+017F>uch a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence over me, that you may obtain any thing in my power; and you not u<U+017F>e any other a<U+017F><U+017F>everations by your command, and therefore I will no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <U+017F>atisfaction of your de<U+017F>ires; for I know that it were a crime puni<U+017F>hable to oppo<U+017F>e what<U+017F>oever you de<U+017F>ire.

               <p>I would it had plea<U+017F>ed God (continued I) that the fir<U+017F>t day my eye ever <U+017F>aw her, had been the la<U+017F>t of my life, as it was of all my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and tranquillity: then <U+017F>hould I have avoided a thou<U+017F>and deaths by <U+017F>uffering one, and <U+017F>hould not, as now I do, be forced to nouri<U+017F>h a flame, which burns, but does not con<U+017F>ume me: Believe it <hi>Palemon,</hi> the arrow that fir<U+017F>t wounded me, was <U+017F>hot from the fair eyes of <hi>Doris</hi>; but it was <U+017F>hot by the hand of a God, which did communicate part of his own Nature into it, and made my wound immortal: and therefore it is, that though I do de<U+017F>pair of any cure, yet mu<U+017F>t I needs love the hand that gave me the blow, and do know, that it is much ea<U+017F>ier to cea<U+017F>e living, then not to love that dear cau<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Fair <hi>Doris</hi> (continued <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> and turned towards her) your dear <hi>Palemon</hi> heard all this without any interruption, and without taking his eyes off mine; and when I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>till look and not <U+017F>ay a word, I perceive (<U+017F>aid I upon a <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) that my love, as much tempered as it is with di<U+017F>cretion, does make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in you, and that you cannot endure the continuation of it without very great impatience; and therefore, to <U+017F>top your jealou<U+017F>ie and my own torments both at once, it is mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t I do ruine my <U+017F>elf, and betimes rid you of a man, who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence will be alwayes a heart-burning unto you. Upon this, I leaped off the bed where I <U+017F>at, and ran to take my <U+017F>word which lay upon the table, my intention being to go out of the hou<U+017F>e, and afterwards to end my <U+017F>ad dayes in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olitary place, where the Sun <U+017F>hould never daign to look upon me: But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> who <U+017F>aw me in <U+017F>uch a fury, and feared le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould do my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome harm, he fell upon me, and took my <U+017F>word out of my hands, I making no great re<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, for I was <U+017F>o very weak, as I was hardly able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain my <U+017F>elf.

Upon this, he took me about the neck: Come, come (<U+017F>aid he) love her <U+017F>till, perhaps heaven will have pity upon you, and will one day permit you to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e that place, which I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I have in a manner tyrannically u<U+017F>urped from you: I wi<U+017F>h to heaven it were now in my power to transfer her unto you; if it were, I <U+017F>wear the condition wherein you are, and have been for her <U+017F>ake, does move me unto <U+017F>o much pity, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be the wife of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> and the <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter of <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> As he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o he embraced me mo<U+017F>t kindly, and bedewing my cheeks with his tears: Not but deare<U+017F>t brother (continued he) my love unto her is infinitly

O Heavens, dear <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me) why will you bla<U+017F>t me to death with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad news; have you not courage enough to overcome the violence of a feaver, which will la<U+017F>t no longer then you harbour <U+017F>ome ill humour in your body to nouri<U+017F>h it? Though I had the means to cure it, an<U+017F>wered I, yet I have no will unto it, for I am <U+017F>o extreamly weary of living, that a doom of death is the mo<U+017F>t welcome news unto me.</p>
               <p>But, Father, why <U+017F>hould I trouble you any longer with a tedious relation, it is <U+017F>ufficient <hi>Doris</hi> knows, how <hi>Palemon</hi> per<U+017F>waded me <U+017F>o far, as to promi<U+017F>e him two things: The fir<U+017F>t, that I would do all I could for the recovery of my health; and the other, that as <U+017F>oon as I was recovered, I would return unto our flocks, and give <hi>Doris</hi> a Letter which he left with me. Thus <hi>Halladine</hi> and he, after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and embraces, <U+017F>ighs, tears, and adieus, did take <U+017F>ea; and left me in the hands of a Phy<U+017F>ician, who <U+017F>ince their departure, never left me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e when upon extream nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, he went to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on. My feavor continued above a fortnight, after which, it was not <U+017F>o violent; and though I <U+017F>tood not in need of any more Phy<U+017F>ick, yet my Phy<U+017F>ician <U+017F>aw me every day, until I was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and in a condition to return back: every time he came to vi<U+017F>it me, he brought me <U+017F>ome news; it was he that fir<U+017F>t told me of the <U+017F>iege of Marcelles, and of the flight of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>; by him I under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had <U+017F>ent an army unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> which troubled me <U+017F>o much, that had I been able to travel, I had gone then unto <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who was then in Vienna, and as they <U+017F>aid, rai<U+017F>ing an Army to relieve <hi>Godomar</hi> his brother. The la<U+017F>t time he took the pains to <U+017F>ee me, he told me that the <U+017F>iege was rai<U+017F>ed, and that <hi>Lindamor</hi> had killed <hi>Polemas</hi>; at which I was <U+017F>o exceedingly rejoyced, as I believe it did perfectly recover me. And indeed, after I had taken my leave of my Phy<U+017F>ician, and thanked him for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of me, I went from Lions, and by the way found all his relations true, for I met a party of tho<U+017F>e Souldiers which <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had <U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is.</hi>

               <p>The<U+017F>e words, together with that e<U+017F>teem which <hi>Doris</hi> had of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> had <U+017F>uch an influence upon her humour, that <U+017F>he permitted him to love her as his <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, promi<U+017F>ing him to value him in the degree of a brother. Upon this, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> ro<U+017F>e up to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand, by way of thanks, for that favour; but he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the coming in of a very fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who at the <U+017F>ame time came into the room, took him about the neck and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him.

I <U+017F>ate thus the <U+017F>pace of an hour, and every time I ca<U+017F>t my eye upon my gla<U+017F><U+017F>e I found <U+017F>ome change in my <U+017F>elf. In fine, <U+017F>eeing my <U+017F>elf in a better condition then ever I was before, and thinking it a mo<U+017F>t arrogant pre<U+017F>umption if I <U+017F>hould expect to be better, <U+017F>ince I had already obtained more then ever I hoped for, I fini<U+017F>hed the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of my <U+017F>elf, and going down the <U+017F>tairs, I no <U+017F>ooner heard that <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> was returned, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even ravi<U+017F>hed with joy to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, I could not chu<U+017F>e but come

               <p>Thus <hi>Celidea</hi> related all that <U+017F>he knew concerning her cure, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> was talking with <hi>Doris:</hi> Deare<U+017F>t <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he unto her) you need not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any further concerning <hi>Palemons</hi> journey: the face of <hi>Celidea</hi> tells you, that hitherto it hath been pro<U+017F>perous, and that all we have to do, is to wi<U+017F>h him a <U+017F>afe return. Truly (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) there is a great probability in what you <U+017F>ay: yet for all that I cannot chu<U+017F>e but be full of faint fears, becau<U+017F>e he is to return by <U+017F>ea, which as they <U+017F>ay, is a mo<U+017F>t cruel and mercile<U+017F><U+017F>e element. Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, replied <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> Fortune will look upon with a <U+017F>miling eye, and will never <U+017F>uffer him to feel the effects of her incon<U+017F>tancy, the glory that he has to enjoy you, is a mo<U+017F>t evident argument of it. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he <U+017F>ighed very loud: which <hi>Doris</hi> ob<U+017F>erving, and doubting that his <U+017F>ighs were <U+017F>parks of the fire which he entertained in his <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>he was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort moved not unto love but pity.

then that of loving you: Life is not <U+017F>o dear unto me as my honour, and were it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to leave the one and not the other, <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>hould nere triumph over <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> nor would I ever be forced to receive any other husband then you: Believe this <hi>Silvander,</hi> for a mo<U+017F>t certain truth; I do invoke the gods to be witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it; and let heaven never pardon me, if I would not execute that de<U+017F>ign with as much courage as now I do mention it. I perceive for all this (replied <hi>Silvander</hi> deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that all you <U+017F>ay, is only to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me that I mu<U+017F>t not pretend any more unto you; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>o, can you think that I can ever receive any comfort after <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e? O my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> do not injure me <U+017F>o much, as to think I can live in this world after all hopes of you is gone: Let what arguments be alledged that will or can, I will not <U+017F>tay in it; nor do I think any can be found <U+017F>trong enough to condemn my de<U+017F>pair.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Belinde</hi> entred into the room, which did not a little <U+017F>urprize <hi>Diana,</hi> who being infinitly afraid to lo<U+017F>e <hi>Silvander,</hi> was very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>weeten in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort, tho<U+017F>e bitter di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him re<U+017F>ent. She ha<U+017F>ted therefore to <U+017F>ay unto him in a low voice: Servant, if I have any power over you, I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to live, at the lea<U+017F>t until you hear for certain, that my marriage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ummated: upon this word, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up to go unto her mother, who made a <U+017F>ign unto her, <U+017F>o to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexis, Leonide,</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who had al<U+017F>o di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed upon their affairs, did ri<U+017F>e up at the <U+017F>ame time, and joyning them<U+017F>elves with <hi>Diana,</hi> went altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Belinde</hi>; who carrying them into the garden, de<U+017F>ired that <U+017F>he might have <U+017F>ome privacy with <hi>Diana,</hi> to tell her of <U+017F>ome particular bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which <U+017F>he had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto her. Upon this they <U+017F>evered them<U+017F>elves: <hi>Leonide, Astrea,</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> went into the thick of the Grove, whil<U+017F>t poor <hi>Silvander,</hi> not knowing which way to go, went out of the hou<U+017F>e, and took the fir<U+017F>t way that his foot <U+017F>tep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into.</p>
               <p>He came by Fortune unto the place, where formerly he had taken delight in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing unto the rocks concerning the beginning of his Love; and leaning him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t the trunk of an old willow, which the river had in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, he <U+017F>topped a while to look upon the roots of it; and finding them to be almo<U+017F>t all quite bare and out of the earth, he compared the <U+017F>tate of that tree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of his love.</p>
               <p>Poor <U+017F>tump (<U+017F>ai<U+017F>t he) upon how <U+017F>mall a thred does thy life and mine now hang? thou art <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained only by two or three <U+017F>mall <U+017F>trings of a root, which the <U+017F>welling of the river Lignon will loo<U+017F>en from the earth, and carry thee away. So likewi<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>erable I, who only do <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t by one bare command of <hi>Dianas,</hi> and cannot live any longer, until the anger of heaven do put me out of all hopes to enjoy her: Afterwards, ca<U+017F>ting his eyes upon the little waves which da<U+017F>hed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the banks, and pre<U+017F>ently retired back: Clear waves (<U+017F>aid he) is it not me whom ye call unto you? and do not you invite me to follow you? This <U+017F>weet murmure wherewith you flatter my griefs, does it not a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me, that you will be more kind unto me then <hi>Diana</hi>? do you not tell me, that you are <U+017F>o pitiful, that you will mo<U+017F>t willingly receive me into your bo<U+017F>ome? Ah <hi>Celadon</hi> (continued he) how happy thou art, in finding among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e waves a remedy to all thy <U+017F>orrows? For let them talk what they will, in lieu of falling into the water to help <hi>Astrea,</hi> I believe thou did<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t in thy <U+017F>elf, only to help thy <U+017F>elf, and be <U+017F>afe from tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>torms which her anger, or perhaps jealou<U+017F>ie, had rai<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t thee. O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! O <hi>Celadon</hi>? why <U+017F>hould not I do the <U+017F>ame? Lignon does offer me the <U+017F>ame help; <hi>Diana</hi> does give me the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e; but cruel woman that <U+017F>he is, <U+017F>he takes away from me the power of doing it, and mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>tly does oblige me unto the ob<U+017F>ervation of a vow which I have made to obey her. After this, leaving unto his thoughts the liberty of wandering whither they would, he <U+017F>tood near an hower <U+017F>tudying upon the <U+017F>everal accidents of his life; but after a thou<U+017F>and thoughts, he fixed them all upon his love: and comparing all the plea<U+017F>ures that ever he received with his pre<U+017F>ent pains, he found <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>proportion, as he had much ado to remember that ever he enjoyed any contentment; this made him cur<U+017F>e his fir<U+017F>t flames, and not being able to check the fir<U+017F>t motion, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53528:162"/>
that ever he lived; yet calling to memory the perfections of <hi>Diana,</hi> and con<U+017F>idering, that <U+017F>ince it was his Fate to die, he could not lo<U+017F>e his life in a better cau<U+017F>e: he condemned his fir<U+017F>t thoughts; and as if he would profe<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf an enemy unto him<U+017F>elf, in loving this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>till, he wi<U+017F>hed more mi<U+017F>ery upon him<U+017F>elf, that he might be the more her Martyr.</p>
               <p>Probably he had <U+017F>pent all the re<U+017F>t of the day in the<U+017F>e imaginations, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e by Fortune he had coughed, and a neighbouring Eccho returned the noi<U+017F>e back again unto him; and though he knew well enough from whence that hollow voice came, yet would he needs con<U+017F>ult with it upon the pre<U+017F>ent condition of his life; and therefore he fell to interrogatories with the Eccho, which <U+017F>till an<U+017F>wered him, that the heart of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e was as hard as any Rock.</p>
               <p>After he had di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed thus a long while, he held his peace; and then broke out again in the<U+017F>e terms: Cea<U+017F>e, cea<U+017F>e, poor mi<U+017F>erable wretch, cea<U+017F>e for ever all complaints, and without con<U+017F>uming thy <U+017F>elf in unprofitable <U+017F>orrows, begin to think, that perhaps this is the fatal day, in which <hi>Paris</hi> mu<U+017F>t triumph over <hi>Diana:</hi> O mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>mal day, wherein I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e a <U+017F>ubject unto my Rival; or rather a day of Jubile, wherein I will deliver my freeborn <U+017F>oul from the pri<U+017F>on of this wretched body: Thou <U+017F>halt be unto me the mo<U+017F>t joyful day of all my life, and I will mark thee in my Almanack with the red Letters of my blood.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Silvander</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his grief for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Diana</hi>; and <U+017F>o great was his de<U+017F>pair, as he <U+017F>wore that he would never enter into the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he certainly knew what was re<U+017F>olved upon, concerning the marriage of this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e: and whil<U+017F>t he was thus di<U+017F>puting with him<U+017F>elf, he retired him<U+017F>elf into his own Town, and there he would lo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olitude or other; but then, he began to think upon the fault which he had committed again<U+017F>t the Druide, in going from his hou<U+017F>e without any return of thanks for his favours, or <U+017F>o much as bidding him adieu: yet he followed his fir<U+017F>t thoughts, and re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee him no more until he heard the doom of death or life pronounced upon him. I know very well (<U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf) that <hi>Adamas</hi> has cau<U+017F>e to complain again<U+017F>t my ingratitude, and to have an ill opinion of my humour; but I do find the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which may happen unto me upon it, much le<U+017F>s which I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer, if I <U+017F>hould give him the opportunity of u<U+017F>ing that authority which he hath over me, and if he <U+017F>hould command me not to depart from his hou<U+017F>e until I were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent at the marriage of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he does not think would be <U+017F>o fatal unto me, as it would. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he <U+017F>till wandred on; and at la<U+017F>t, never <U+017F>o much as minding which way he went, he came unto his own Cabine: where not finding his flock, becau<U+017F>e the boy which kept them, had driven them out very early, he <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>o little a time there, as did apparently <U+017F>hew, that the cares of his Love did much more bu<U+017F>ie his mind, then the cares of his e<U+017F>tate. So leaving his own home, to plea<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf in his inquietudes, he took the fir<U+017F>t way his foot light upon, not <U+017F>o much as minding or knowing which way it would conduct him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belinde,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, being alone with <hi>Diana,</hi> and wanting nothing but her con<U+017F>ent to marry her unto <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>he began this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: <hi>Diana</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) the authority which I may ju<U+017F>tly clame over your will, would allow me to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of you without con<U+017F>ulting with any but my <U+017F>elf: yet being unwilling to make u<U+017F>e of that power which Nature hath <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely given me over you, I conceive it requi<U+017F>ite to communicate unto you, my de<U+017F>ign of marrying you. I am <U+017F>ure you cannot be ignorant that <hi>Paris</hi> loves you, and I make no doubt but you love him al<U+017F>o: The journey that he took unto me, makes me <U+017F>o well knowing in it, that had it not been for the <U+017F>iege of Marcelles, I had been here <U+017F>ooner to give him that contentment which I <U+017F>ee he courts with <U+017F>o much zeal and <U+017F>incerity: now his affection aiming at no other end but marriage, and <U+017F>ince you can never meet with a more advantageous match, I was very de<U+017F>irous to know your mind, and to tell you mine, that you may <U+017F>ee how great a care I have of your good. My de<U+017F>ign is, not to let him langui<U+017F>h any longer in his que<U+017F>t; but to con<U+017F>ummate the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as <U+017F>oon as may be: Delay in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es does often prove prejudicial; and it is as gro<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>implicity not to take a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e when it is offered, as it is to bewail

Though (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) they will not plea<U+017F>e me, yet they cannot hinder me from complaining: Afterwards, con<U+017F>idering the abundance of tears which flowed from her eyes, and down her Ro<U+017F>ie cheeks, like rivers: alas, poor feeble tears (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) why will you attempt a thing <U+017F>o full of difficulty? Alas, you can only bedew and make grow tho<U+017F>e flowers which the earth brings forth, whil<U+017F>t you drown and wither tho<U+017F>e that Nature has placed in my cheeks: Alas, they require <U+017F>ome nouri<U+017F>hment that is a little more mild and <U+017F>weet; you, cruel tears, are too <U+017F>harp and bitter for them; you do proceed from a cau<U+017F>e too <U+017F>ad, and would, in any other then my <U+017F>elf, be a cau<U+017F>e rather of death then life. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he <U+017F>topt a little, and afterwards broke out again: Alas (continued <U+017F>he) you are arguments of my faint courage, <U+017F>ince I dare not have recour<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no other remedies then you, as if Nature did not offer unto me other arms, wherewith to revenge my <U+017F>elf upon the injuries of Fortune. For what u<U+017F>e were poy<U+017F>ons created? what are <U+017F>words for? what Precipices? what flames? what waters? but to be imployed in the relief of mi<U+017F>erable wretches: Courage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Diana</hi>; make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome one of the<U+017F>e remedies to ea<U+017F>e thee of thy mi<U+017F>ery: make choice of the mo<U+017F>t violent, that the act may be the <U+017F>ooner done, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent this very minute which is to bla<U+017F>t all thy hopes of any joy. Upon this, <U+017F>he went out of the Garden, not to go into the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> for that was odious unto her, but to go into the wood, in hopes to meet with <U+017F>ome of her companions, to whom <U+017F>he might without fear, <U+017F>igh out the cau<U+017F>e of her grief: She was almo<U+017F>t at the very banks of Lignon, before <U+017F>he met with any; but at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>pied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was <U+017F>et under an old oak, holding a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in one hand, and leaning her head upon the other: <hi>Diana</hi> much wondered to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf out of the company of <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew they went out together, and knowing that <U+017F>he would never have parted from them without <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he was very de<U+017F>irous to know the cau<U+017F>e, and made <U+017F>o lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le noi<U+017F>e in coming to her, as <U+017F>he was within four or five paces of the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e and was never perceived.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ighs and groans which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>ent forth, made <hi>Diana</hi> believe that <U+017F>he had received <U+017F>ome extraordinary di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, e<U+017F>pecially when <U+017F>he heard her <U+017F>ay with a deep <U+017F>igh, traiterous and per<U+017F>ideous wretch, dur<U+017F>t thou be <U+017F>o bold as to offend me <U+017F>o extreamly?

               <p>Upon this, flowing with tears again, and <U+017F>till lifting her handkerchief to her eyes, <U+017F>he fell into a deep <U+017F>tudy, and that <U+017F>o deep, as <hi>Diana</hi> came and <U+017F>it down by her, and <U+017F>tayed a long while before <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> ever perceived her; at la<U+017F>t, <hi>Diana</hi> being de<U+017F>irous to apply <U+017F>ome remedy to her troubled mind, though <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood in as great need her <U+017F>elf: Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and pulled her gently) what new affliction is this that is fallen upon you? <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> then row<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf, as out of a deep <U+017F>leep, and <U+017F>eeing one <U+017F>o near her whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed, yet never an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Dianas</hi> que<U+017F>tion; for <U+017F>he no <U+017F>ooner heard her voice, but we embraced her, and fell into <U+017F>uch a flow of tears, that <hi>Diana</hi> was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e afflicted then <U+017F>he, and finding <U+017F>uch an object of pity could not re<U+017F>train her tears neither: <U+017F>o being both

Ah me, dear Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and interrupted her) you know not what cau<U+017F>e I have to weep: I would to God when he threw him<U+017F>elf into the River, I had been drown'd with him, then <U+017F>hould I not at this hour be <U+017F>o grieved as I am, nor <U+017F>hould I have been the common talk of all the world, as now I mu<U+017F>t: <hi>Diana,</hi> not being able to under<U+017F>tand her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Believe it Si<U+017F>ter, replied <U+017F>he, I <U+017F>hall be long ignorant, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you do better inform me, but I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>peak freely unto me, and let me know the cau<U+017F>e of your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring your <U+017F>elf, that I <U+017F>hall as freely di<U+017F>cover a thing unto you which troubles me extreamly, and the more, becau<U+017F>e I am out of all hopes to find any remedy.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what it is which troubles me (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> beginning to wipe her eyes and <U+017F>it down in her place again) for though I would not render that duty unto the affection which is common betwixt us, yet <U+017F>hould I do it out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other prevalent con<U+017F>ideration, which is, that we two having been almo<U+017F>t all one, and our very thoughts no more hid from one another, then our actions, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary that you <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer for my deportment, and that tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hall make any doubt of my virtue, may cea<U+017F>e to entertain any ill opinion of me, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which you will make in my advantage: I do not think (replied <hi>Diana</hi>) any man can be <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple as to blame you for any thing you ever did; but if there <U+017F>hould, I promi<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t faithfully to vindicate you, and to <U+017F>peak in your behalf as I ought to do. And therefore, my dear companion, I conjure you to conceal nothing from me, but freely open your <U+017F>oul unto me, with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that I will never deny any thing you <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire of me. Then <hi>Astrea</hi> having dryed her eyes: I ever thought (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) that your affection unto me was as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as I could de<U+017F>ire, nay more then I could de<U+017F>erve: and to the end you <U+017F>hould not exceed me in love, I will make a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which none but you or <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>hould ever get out of me: Know therefore, my dear companion, that whil<U+017F>t <hi>Paris</hi> was talking with you, <hi>Leonide</hi> came unto <hi>Alexis</hi> and me, and after <U+017F>he had asked what was the <U+017F>ubject of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me, what will you give me <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> if I do tell you as good news as you can po<U+017F><U+017F>ible de<U+017F>ire. Fair Nymph (an<U+017F>wered I) I have nothing that I can di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of; for all that I have is this day transferred into the power of my deare<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; but I <U+017F>hall be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto you, if you will tell me any thing which imports either her content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or mine: what I have to tell you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) does equally relate unto you both; and to hold you no longer in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, <hi>Adamas</hi> came to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me, that it <U+017F>hould be only your fault, if you did not tye <U+017F>uch a knot, as death only could unloo<U+017F>e: Then he knows (an<U+017F>wered I unto her) that I <U+017F>hall obtain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t the Carnates, that place which I de<U+017F>ired. He is mo<U+017F>t certain of it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) for he commanded me to bring you the news of it, that you might betimes prepare your <U+017F>elf for it, and rejoyce: I have <U+017F>o long di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf for it, an<U+017F>wered I, that I am ready at an in<U+017F>tant, but I dur<U+017F>t never build any certain hopes of it until now; and therefore I will with a mo<U+017F>t joyful heart go unto him, and thank him for the remembrance he had of my Fortune. Thus we went on talking together, when <hi>Leonide,</hi> after a while of <U+017F>ilence, whi<U+017F>pered me in the ear, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) tell me truly; will not the company of <hi>Celadon</hi> be as plea<U+017F>ing unto you, as the company of <hi>Alexis?</hi> Sage Nymyh (an<U+017F>wered I) why do you ask me that que<U+017F>tion?

I being then alone with the Nymph: <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) was a Shepherd unto whom I ought to have no great inclination, by rea<U+017F>on of the enmity that was betwixt our Parents; and <hi>Alexis</hi> is a Druides daughter, whom all things do oblige me mo<U+017F>t perfectly to love: and therefore in all probability, I <U+017F>hall be more delighted in her company, then in that Shepherds, who can never be, in my opinion, more then in a condition of indifferency.</p>

None of all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) is <U+017F>atisfaction to my mind: I would gladly know where <hi>Celadon</hi> is: and therefore, good <hi>Leonide,</hi> tell me. Do you know then (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>) that <hi>Celadon</hi> is alive?

If the horrour of this <U+017F>olitude do beget any fears in my <U+017F>oul, I hope the gods will enable me to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</p>
               <p>In this you are much mi<U+017F>taken, an<U+017F>wered he pre<U+017F>ently, for the be<U+017F>t office that you can do unto me, is to let me do as the ju<U+017F>tice of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hath commanded: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it <hi>Leonide,</hi> that Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e never was, nor never <U+017F>hall be, di<U+017F>obeyed by me: give me leave therefore to do as <U+017F>he did bid me, and give her no cau<U+017F>e to hate you for hindering me.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t he was u<U+017F>ing all the<U+017F>e per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive arguments unto me, I called into my memory the words which you <U+017F>poke unto him in the heat of your anger, and conceiving I had found out a good invention to comfort him: <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) I will not hinder you from rendring unto your Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e all that obedience which you do ow unto her; but withal, I would not have you go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, nor to afflict your <U+017F>elf in imagining <U+017F>uch things as never were: I pray let us <U+017F>ee what it was which <U+017F>he commanded, and if we con<U+017F>ider well upon it, we <U+017F>hall find no great cau<U+017F>e of complaint: nor (<U+017F>aid he) will I <U+017F>o much as murmure again<U+017F>t it: it is <U+017F>ufficient I know, <U+017F>he would have me out of the world; and death being the only way, I mu<U+017F>t, I ought, and I will take it. I do not think (<U+017F>aid I unto him) <U+017F>he ever had any <U+017F>uch thought, for if <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>he would have otherwi<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf. I do believe indeed, her intention was to <U+017F>hew you how much <U+017F>he was a<U+017F>hamed at her being <U+017F>o deceived, and at her affording you <U+017F>ome, perhaps, over particular privacies; but when any matter of pennance came into que<U+017F>tion, believe it <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>he never intended any unto you: To whom then (<U+017F>aid he) to <hi>Alexis,</hi> an<U+017F>wered I: ah <hi>Leonide</hi> (replied he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently) you are much mi<U+017F>taken, I did <U+017F>o clearly read in the face of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> her de<U+017F>ires and intention to ruine me, that if <U+017F>he did name <hi>Alexis</hi> in lieu of <hi>Celadon,</hi> it was only becau<U+017F>e that name was more frequent in her mouth then mine; but however it was, I am <U+017F>ure it was unto me <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke, it was me that <U+017F>he condemned by the fury of her looks, and it was from me <U+017F>he broke away with more hatred then if I had been <U+017F>ome Tiger or <U+017F>ome Satyr.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions as the<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>till went further from me; and I <U+017F>eeing the night coming on, and knowing that as good a face as I <U+017F>et upon it, yet I was not able to undergo the horrours of the night; but good <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) what is it that you re<U+017F>olve upon? to conform my <U+017F>elf, an<U+017F>wered he, unto that

which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hath commanded me. Then, <U+017F>aid I, you mu<U+017F>t not attempt any thing again<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf: for though <U+017F>he did command you to die; yet <U+017F>he did not command you to kill your <U+017F>elf. Upon this, he began to con<U+017F>ider a little; and when I <U+017F>aw, he did not an<U+017F>wer me: I cannot conceive, <U+017F>aid I, that this command of hers ought to trouble you, no more then that command which Nature gave when you came into the world; for Nature, as <U+017F>oon as you began to live, did command you to die; and certainly, <U+017F>ince <hi>Astrea</hi> did not a<U+017F><U+017F>ign you any time, you ought to <U+017F>tay till <U+017F>he prefix it, or till the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your humanity, does exact from you that tribute which all creatures pay.</p>
               <p>Fair Nymph, <U+017F>aid he then unto me, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did not a<U+017F><U+017F>ign me any time, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew I ought to be as ready to execute her commands, as <U+017F>he to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them: que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he meant the <U+017F>ame day whereon <U+017F>he let me know my fault, <U+017F>hould be the day whereon I <U+017F>hould be puni<U+017F>hed: I do therefore conjure you not to cro<U+017F><U+017F>e my de<U+017F>ires any longer: tell that unthankful fair one (for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e you will find her full of joy at my misfortune) that I dare not <U+017F>o much as grieve at my death, le<U+017F>t my <U+017F>orrows <U+017F>hould provoke hers unto the like: a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her that of all the favours <U+017F>he ever <U+017F>hewed me, I hold this for the greate<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince in a moment <U+017F>he has delivered me from all the torments <U+017F>he was able to make me <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: for when I am dead, that fair one will not be angry at me; but if by ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her mind be not enough revenged, even for pities <U+017F>ake move her to pardon the <U+017F>urplus of my crime. I would willingly come and do my pennance before her, but not having time, nor knowing how to do it better then in the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my life: Tell her, fair Nymph, that I am going to fini<U+017F>h it for the love of her; and that as there is none but <U+017F>he for whom I would live, <U+017F>o there is none but <U+017F>he for whom I would dy.</p>

Why do I re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the will of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who would have a fre<U+017F>h cau<U+017F>e to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, did <U+017F>he know how I delay the plea<U+017F>ure which <U+017F>he will take in my death: Adieu fair Nymph, adieu <U+017F>age <hi>Leonide</hi>; be not, as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is, in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible unto the motions of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.

At la<U+017F>t, in this confu<U+017F>ion of thoughts, one while apprehending the harm that might happen unto him, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while blaming your too <U+017F>udden rigour, I <U+017F>aw the day did bid farewel to the world: <U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing no po<U+017F><U+017F>ible remedy again<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, I returned back, <U+017F>till calling <hi>Alexis, Alexis, Celadon, Celadon</hi>; but hearing none return any an<U+017F>wer unto my call, my <U+017F>orrows began to be almo<U+017F>t intollerable, and imprinted in my face <U+017F>uch <U+017F>igns of death, as doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you <U+017F>aw, when fir<U+017F>t I came unto you.</p>

Daughter, replied <hi>Adamas,</hi> the<U+017F>e faults whereof you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e him, are the perfections which might well make him hope for a better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment then he hath received from you; but he never failed either in his re<U+017F>pect or in his love: and were you well acquainted with the actions of his life, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e your opinion would concur with mine.

I do not know any thing in the world that <U+017F>hould be more dear unto you then her pre<U+017F>ence; and the rather, becau<U+017F>e if you love me, you know it is <U+017F>he only from whom you are to expect the accompli<U+017F>hment of your de<U+017F>ires and mine: My faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> the de<U+017F>ign which carries me unto <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> perhaps, is greater then you imagine: you know how pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant that Prince is, and how much his amity is to be <U+017F>ought after: Now I do hope by that inviolable contract of friend<U+017F>hip which is betwixt <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond, Godomar,</hi> and me, to gain <U+017F>omething upon the good will of the Father; and to make him my Allie. I do not enquire, replied <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> after the cau<U+017F>e which moves you to go, but I do only <U+017F>olicite you to a certain the time of your return. I know all you propo<U+017F>itions and de<U+017F>igns, have <U+017F>ome legal and noble object for their end; but I fearmdash;upon this <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> <U+017F>topt; and <hi>Ro<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> ob<U+017F>erving by her countenance <U+017F>ome impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of fears; what does my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e fear? (<U+017F>aid he unto her) is it that I <U+017F>hall die of tho<U+017F>e torments I <U+017F>hall endure when I am out of your <U+017F>ight? No (replied <U+017F>he very dejectedly) I rather fear, that when you <U+017F>ee <hi>Clotilda,</hi> you will die for love of her. Jealous Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, replied <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> your <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions wound me to the <U+017F>oul, but I will not go; and though I did conceive <U+017F>ome nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity in making this voyage, yet I will <U+017F>light it for your <U+017F>ake, and will let you <U+017F>ee, that the con<U+017F>ervation of your amity is more dear and con<U+017F>iderable unto me, then the <U+017F>afety of that e<U+017F>tate which is to fall unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> then quitting her fir<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ions, and looking upon <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> with a <U+017F>miling eye: pray Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, excu<U+017F>e my fears, which ought to be arguments unto you of my love, <U+017F>ince I do fear the lo<U+017F>ing of you; but for all that, do not alter your intentions of going with <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond:</hi> for I do promi<U+017F>e to endure your ab<U+017F>ence, rather with longing impatience of your return, then any fears of <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing your <U+017F>elf unto another: Me thinks (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>) that my <U+017F>ervices may merit that belief from you; and if there do remain in you any doubts of my fidelity, I have as much love as ever I had, and can begin new a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of my <U+017F>elf: believe it fair <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> I can be none but yours; and things ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>hall become ea<U+017F>ie to all the world, before I cea<U+017F>e loving you with the <U+017F>ame zeal I fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>ented when I made profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of it unto you. I do believe it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and do vow, never to doubt it any more, provided dear <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> that you will al<U+017F>o believe my faith to be inviolable. After this, <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> asking her whether <U+017F>he would honour him with any <U+017F>ervice: All that I de<U+017F>ire from you (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) is to return <U+017F>oon again, and not to let the lu<U+017F>ter of Lions Court, make you forget that which will make you Lord of many Provinces, as you are already of my inclination.</p>

This, replied <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> does make the tyranny of Fathers mo<U+017F>t odious unto me, who under a pretence of that authority which Nature hath conferred upon them, do con<U+017F>train the will of their children, and force them with intollerable violence, to deny their own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, only to follow <U+017F>uch motions as their ambition or avarice does prompt them unto; as if it were not rea<U+017F>onable we <U+017F>hould enjoy the <U+017F>ame priviledges that is allowed unto other animals, who in their harmle<U+017F><U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions do without any con<U+017F>traint follow that party which they be<U+017F>t like<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Let me not live (continued he) if I have not ever, <U+017F>ince I knew the merits of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> extreamly envyed all tho<U+017F>e, who in condition far inferiour unto mine, yet may do what they will with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, and are not forced to comply and plea<U+017F>e any but their own de<U+017F>ires. Such (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>) do meet with ob<U+017F>tacles that are wor<U+017F>e, and which hinder them from a perfect gu<U+017F>t of <U+017F>uch contentments as men do enjoy; therefore we ought all to remain contented in the Sphaere of our own conditions, without any envy unto any: for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, even tho<U+017F>e whom we do envy, would, were it in their Liberties to chu<U+017F>e, mo<U+017F>t willingly cea<U+017F>e being what they are, to become what we are.</p>

Do you think then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> and <U+017F>miled) that it is <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a matter to obtain my con<U+017F>ent?

Truly it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>) you are full of vanity, but fuller of love (an<U+017F>wered he) and of <U+017F>uch hopes as you have given me; but I <U+017F>hall be extreamly <U+017F>orry that it does di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you: Upon this word <hi>Galathea</hi> interrupted him, and fearing that <U+017F>he had angred him; my Cavalier (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) you cannot anger me, and what<U+017F>oever you de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>hall not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me; and to <U+017F>hew you, that how great <U+017F>oever your de<U+017F>ires are to enjoy me, they are not greater then mine to be yours; know that I am already wholly devoted to be yours, and if by cro<U+017F><U+017F>e Fate my mothers will <U+017F>hould thwart ours, I will die before <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall give me unto any other but <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor:</hi> in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> was a little parted from <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> and went to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and therefore <U+017F>he left <hi>Lindamor</hi> to go and put the Princes in memory of their promi<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> came out of her clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, with eyes which indeed were <U+017F>omething watry; for <U+017F>he <U+017F>till grieved to think <U+017F>he was to lo<U+017F>e them, unto whom <U+017F>he was obliged for her life and liberty: and <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given order to make all things ready, he came unto her to bid her adieu.

King my Father, and how earne<U+017F>tly he de<U+017F>ires my return unto him.

               <p>Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> you need not doubt but your departure will much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, and make me <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of that lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, as of the e<U+017F>tate which I am obliged unto you for pre<U+017F>erving. Not but that I think it mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould obey the commands of <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> <U+017F>ince he intends only to deliver you from the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which you receive here, and to re<U+017F>tore you unto the fir<U+017F>t lu<U+017F>ter an magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of his Court; but I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, it grieves me extreamly to part with you, and to know, that being in no degree able to requite <U+017F>o many good offices done, I am con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>eem ungrateful towards you. Methinks, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>) that you ought not to take any care how to recompence us, <U+017F>ince we have rea<U+017F>on to think our <U+017F>elves infinitly obliged unto you, for furni<U+017F>hing us with the means of acquiring glory, and given us an honourable <U+017F>ubject wherin to exerci<U+017F>e our arms lawfully.</p>
               <p>Sir, replied the Nymph, your reputations were before at as high a pitch as they could attain unto, and this la<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion wherein you have made your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages to appear, can be nothing el<U+017F>e but arguments of that pity which you had of me: the truth is, I am <U+017F>he that only reaps the benefit of it, and am mo<U+017F>t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto you; and when I con<U+017F>ider, that after <U+017F>o many benefits and favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, I mu<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>e you, and <U+017F>uffer you to depart without any te<U+017F>timonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment, it does grieve me <U+017F>o to the heart, as I do hardly enjoy that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and well being which you have gotten me: And your departure is almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>ad unto me, as all tho<U+017F>e fears which the in<U+017F>olence of <hi>Polemas</hi> did cau<U+017F>e unto me. Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Godomar</hi>) probably our departure does a little trouble you, becau<U+017F>e it takes out of your pre<U+017F>ence two per<U+017F>ons over whom your merit gives you a mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>olute power; but there is no rea<U+017F>on in the world it <U+017F>hould grieve you, becau<U+017F>e in what parts of the world <U+017F>oever we live, our affections and <U+017F>ervices <U+017F>hall alwaies te<U+017F>tifie that we are mo<U+017F>t perfectly yours: The truth is (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies of your good will, as I have no rea<U+017F>on to doubt but you imploy it for me, upon all occa<U+017F>ions wherein your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite; but this does not comfort me in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>orrows which this <U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation cau<U+017F>es in me: for I would have you depart better <U+017F>atisfied from me, and would gladly acquit my <U+017F>elf, in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure, of tho<U+017F>e obligations wherein I am bound unto your valour.</p>

Yet, Madam (continued he) if it be your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould attribute this unto your civilitie, and that I <U+017F>hould think what I have done for you, de<U+017F>erves <U+017F>ome kind of recompence, I will believe it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure, and to the end I may have <U+017F>ome kind of right to hope, that you will be plea<U+017F>ed to grant two humble reque<U+017F>ts which I have unto you: Sir, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> (with a countenance le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ad then before) no greater plea<U+017F>ure can come unto me in all the world, then to do any thing you <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire, I be<U+017F>eech you therefore, and conjure you unto it, to command me what<U+017F>oever you de<U+017F>ire, that I may te<U+017F>tifie how great a de<U+017F>ire I have to obey you.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing then that I de<U+017F>ire, Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi>) relates unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> whom I be<U+017F>eech you permit to <U+017F>tay a while with you: I think there is no need I <U+017F>hould tell you my rea<U+017F>ons; for you knowing both her life and

                  <hi>Galathea,</hi> who<U+017F>e age u<U+017F>ed not to entertain any <U+017F>uch holy con<U+017F>iderations, began to think upon a hundred <U+017F>ports wherein to divert her <U+017F>elf, till <hi>Lindamor</hi> returned with the re<U+017F>t of the Cavaliers; but finding none that could <U+017F>urmount tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which their departure had cau<U+017F>ed, at la<U+017F>t after a little <U+017F>tudy, <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her. You can judge, Madam, upon what I am now thinking: It is very true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira,</hi> for my eyes are not good enough to <U+017F>ee into your <U+017F>oul: Truly, replied the Nymph, I am thinking upon the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Thamires</hi> had ye<U+017F>terday concerning the cure of <hi>Celidea</hi>; and I believe it would be much plea<U+017F>ure unto us to <U+017F>ee her now: for before <U+017F>he had disfigured her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he was reputed for one of the faire<U+017F>t women that ever came upon the Banks of Lignon. I believe (replied the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e) that the lea<U+017F>t inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of your de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> would be enough to make her come hither: I do indeed believe, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <U+017F>he would not deny me that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire it, but I conceive it better to <U+017F>ee her where <U+017F>he is, if you would but do as I would contrive it: <hi>Galathea</hi> then de<U+017F>iring to be plea<U+017F>ant, and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> de<U+017F>iring to tell her how <U+017F>he would contrive it; I would have us (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e our <U+017F>elves like Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and go and <U+017F>urprize <hi>Adamas</hi> in his hou<U+017F>e; there we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>Celidea; A<U+017F>trea</hi> perhaps will be there al<U+017F>o, unto whom I <U+017F>hall be very glad to impart a <U+017F>ecret which I know will be welcome unto her: <hi>Silvander</hi> likewi<U+017F>e, is doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e there, and if we chance to find <hi>Hylas</hi> there al<U+017F>o, we <U+017F>hall not want diver<U+017F>ion enough.</p>

               <p>Upon this, <U+017F>he went very confidently into the clo<U+017F><U+017F>et of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> whom <U+017F>he found very pen<U+017F>ive and <U+017F>ad; and having propounded the motion unto her, <U+017F>he approved of it, and re<U+017F>olved to go her <U+017F>elf unto Mountbri<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>pend her time there, whil<U+017F>t they were merry at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas: Galathea</hi> having made an humble Coage unto her, <U+017F>he would have gone away, but the Nymph called her back again; and after <U+017F>he had looked a little <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon her, <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, tell me truly: If <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>hould take part with <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> and for<U+017F>ake my <U+017F>ervice as he intends, would you not accu<U+017F>e him of extream ingratitude?

No matter for that, Madam (replied the Nymph) it is enough he once <U+017F>erved you, to make him never <U+017F>erve <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you do expre<U+017F>ly command him; you think <U+017F>o very well of him (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) that I do believe you bear <U+017F>ome good will unto him: Truth is Madam (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea</hi> and blu<U+017F>ht a little).

               <p>As <U+017F>he went out, <hi>Thamires</hi> came to the clo<U+017F><U+017F>et dore, and <hi>Galathea</hi> taking him by the hand, carried him to the Nymph, who knowing that he came purpo<U+017F>ly to receive her commands, charged him to tell the grand Druide, that <U+017F>he was very <U+017F>orry <U+017F>he had not his pre<U+017F>ence at the conclu<U+017F>ion of peace; yet if any news of con<U+017F>equence fell out, <U+017F>he would adverti<U+017F>e him: <hi>Thamires</hi> humbly bowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf promi<U+017F>ed to do all her commands and after he had bid adieu unto the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies, he went to <U+017F>ee his dear <hi>Celedea,</hi> who thought one dayes ab<U+017F>ence from him, an age.</p>
               <p>He was no <U+017F>ooner come within a hundred paces of the Druides hou<U+017F>e, but he met her, yet with <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a countenance, that he was exceedingly troubled at it and de<U+017F>ired to know the cau<U+017F>e.

In <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e did, by little and little, dre<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf; and as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was ready, <U+017F>he went down the <U+017F>tairs, and went into the Hall; but finding no body, <U+017F>he ran into the gallery: afterwards going into the Court, and not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one of the dome<U+017F>tiques, <U+017F>he was even at deaths door; and not knowing what cour<U+017F>e to take in that extremity, <U+017F>he returned into her chamber, and waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Leonide:</hi> Pardon me fair Nymph, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for interrupting your re<U+017F>t; I am undone, if you do not help me unto <U+017F>ome remedie again<U+017F>t my perplexities. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> are not here, and I fear, <U+017F>ince they conceal their flight from me, that they are gone to do <U+017F>ome violence upon them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>ome place or other. <hi>Leonide</hi> extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this, for <U+017F>he knew the <U+017F>tate of their <U+017F>ouls and their loves, <U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf as fa<U+017F>t as ever <U+017F>he could; and afterwards both went together unto him who kept the gates, to know of him whether any went out. The fellow <U+017F>wore unto them, that he opened not the door unto any: True it was, he heard the doggs barks a little before day; but ri<U+017F>ing up and <U+017F>eeing no body, he went to bed again, and <U+017F>lept ever <U+017F>ince without hearing any noi<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> in a great amazement went to the gates, and finding the Key in the door, they knew then the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed out that way. They conceived the be<U+017F>t way was to acquaint the Druide, and waiting till he was up, they went into the gallery; in which they no <U+017F>ooner were, but <hi>Phillis</hi> being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withold her tears any longer: Alas Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, my heart foretold me all this; and to my grief, I was but too true a Prophet of that which falls our. I have been tormented all the night long with <U+017F>trange inquietudes, and troubled with <U+017F>o many melancholly imaginations, as I never <U+017F>lept wor<U+017F>e in all my life. Dreams, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> are only illu<U+017F>ions and Fancies, and no truth or credit is to be grounded upon them.</p>
               <p>Ah, <U+017F>age Nymph, replied the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf they are not <U+017F>o at this time, for I <U+017F>aw every thing as perfectly, as if I had been awake: For, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that after I was a<U+017F>leep, and thought it about midnight, me thought I <U+017F>aw the gho<U+017F>ts of <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> approch unto the bed of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>; and that of <hi>Celadon</hi> being more offended then the other, it <U+017F>aid unto my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, in a tone mixed both of love and anger, ungrateful Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Celadon</hi> is dead, and indeed in obedience to your unju<U+017F>t command; and it is your duty al<U+017F>o to die at his mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t reque<U+017F>t: behold here his gho<U+017F>t which waits

to conduct you into the Elizian fields, and which will never cea<U+017F>e tormenting you, until the very la<U+017F>t minute of your life.</p>
               <p>Then the other, me thought, began to <U+017F>peak; and you <hi>Diana</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) who by the power of your charms has triumphed over me, if you retain any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my fidelity, keep con<U+017F>tant unto the affection which you promi<U+017F>ed me; and after my example rather re<U+017F>olve to die, then live under the reproach of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delite. After this, the gho<U+017F>t was <U+017F>ilent, as I think, to harken unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who in an<U+017F>were to the fir<U+017F>t, yes, yes <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I will <U+017F>atisfie thy reque<U+017F>t; I will with all my heart lay off the burthen of this body and accompany thy <U+017F>oul whither <U+017F>oever thou wilt conduct me.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Diana</hi> in an<U+017F>were, and you <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) be <U+017F>ure thou do<U+017F>t not depart from me, I will make my <U+017F>elf in<U+017F>eperable from thy ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>o as though we could not unite our <U+017F>elves during our lives, yet we will after our deaths. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o they dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves, and afterwards following the<U+017F>e two gho<U+017F>ts who were their guides, they are gone to ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves into the armes of love, who having <U+017F>ome compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon them, has given them that contentment which they asked. I remember well, that I did what I could to keep them from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I wept, I was angrey, I cryed out <U+017F>ometimes again<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes again<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> telling them they ought not to attempt any thing without me: but the<U+017F>e ungratfull Companions <U+017F>lighted me, and went away without <U+017F>o much as bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me adieu. Tho<U+017F>e accidents which hapned ye<U+017F>terday (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide</hi>) are the cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e imaginations: for they <U+017F>ay, it is the qualitie of dreams to fill our fancies in the night time, with <U+017F>uch things as entertained it in the day: And the<U+017F>e gho<U+017F>ts of <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Silvander:</hi> their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, their an<U+017F>wers and re<U+017F>olutions, all the<U+017F>e are drawn from the de<U+017F>ign which <hi>Celadon</hi> re<U+017F>olved upon to die, from the complaints which he made again<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and from the rea<U+017F>on which <hi>Silvander</hi> had to hinder <hi>Diana,</hi> from marrying <hi>Paris.</hi> However it be, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> you <U+017F>ee, <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> are gone, and you <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome part of my dream is more then fancy. That, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, is rather from <U+017F>ome other accident: for it may be, that tho<U+017F>e two fair ones waking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning they went to divert them<U+017F>elves without any <U+017F>uch de<U+017F>igns as you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, no no Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) they would never have gone without telling me, unle<U+017F>s they had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olution to execute: but (continued <U+017F>he) I will follow them whether they will or no, and as cunning as they are to hide them<U+017F>elves from me, It <U+017F>hall go heard, but I will find them out:</p>
               <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, they went out of the Gallery; and hearing that <hi>Adamas</hi> was out of bed, <hi>Phillis</hi> went unto him to acquaint him with the flight of her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: At the fir<U+017F>t, the Druide laughed at it: for he thought it to be only <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of merriment: but when he heard and con<U+017F>idered all circum<U+017F>tances, and examined the porter, he thought what <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>aid was not without <U+017F>ome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. Then began he to call into memory the la<U+017F>t command which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> laid upon <hi>Celadon,</hi> and that to make him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>he might attempt <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>perate act; Then did he think the apprehen<U+017F>ions of <hi>Phillis</hi> to be ju<U+017F>t: but <U+017F>earching into the cau<U+017F>e why <hi>Diana</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hould fly away, he thought that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of friend<U+017F>hip which was between her and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> might perhaps make her forget her duty unto the commands of <hi>Bellinde</hi>: <U+017F>o being confirmed in his fears that the<U+017F>e fair ones might make <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>perate attempts upon them<U+017F>elves he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired all the <U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es in the hou<U+017F>e, to run after them, which they did: For, <hi>Hylas, Stella, Celadon, Phillis, Adra<U+017F>tes, Doris, Leonide</hi> al<U+017F>o, and others, they all went imediatly in que<U+017F>t after them, and none was left behind but <hi>Celedea,</hi> who <U+017F>tayed for the return of <hi>Thamires,</hi> to oblige him al<U+017F>o to go with her, after them.</p>
               <p>Every one that went in this que<U+017F>t took a <U+017F>everall way: <U+017F>ome went into the woods; others into the plaines, and <hi>Phillis</hi> guided by a better genius, took all along the river Lignon: <U+017F>he had not walked much above half an hower, before <U+017F>he <U+017F>pide <hi>Lycidas</hi> lying all along upon the gra<U+017F>s, by the river <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>o neer the water that he dipped his hand in the little waves which the wind did gently da<U+017F>h again<U+017F>t the bankes; this encounter did infinitely joy her, for <U+017F>he longed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly

               <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he went out, to the great contentment of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> who feared extreamly, that <U+017F>he would find them out, which certainly <U+017F>he had done, if <U+017F>he had <U+017F>tayed never <U+017F>o little longer: for then her eyes would have been accu<U+017F>tomed unto the gloomine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the place, which at the fir<U+017F>t coming out of the Suns brightne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>eemed there to be blind. As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was out, <hi>Licidas</hi> and <U+017F>he went unto the place where they <U+017F>ate before; and the Shepherd beginning di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t: But my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hould undertake any de<U+017F>ign without acquainting you? believe it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>) it angers me <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould; and if ever I do <U+017F>ee her again, I <U+017F>hall chide her more then perhaps <U+017F>he imagines I will. But not with <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on as I have (<U+017F>aid <hi>Licidas</hi>) for abu<U+017F>ing <hi>Celadon</hi> as <U+017F>he hath. However, replied the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I will let her <U+017F>ee how ill <U+017F>he has ob<U+017F>erved tho<U+017F>e Laws that were e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t us. Alas, alas, replied the Shepherd: how <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erve the Laws of friend<U+017F>hip, when <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o cruelly offended again<U+017F>t the Laws of Love? We have the greater cau<U+017F>e to complain again<U+017F>t her (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) and that it were only to puni<U+017F>h her for it, I will continue on my voyage, and will not <U+017F>pare any pains of care to find out this ungrateful woman. Well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Licidas,</hi> I am <U+017F>ure you have more pity and care of her, then <U+017F>he hath of us; and <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire it, I do wi<U+017F>h you as much contentment in your que<U+017F>t of that cruel one, us I do unto my <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>eeking <hi>Celadon.</hi>

               <p>After <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e they parted: and <hi>Phillis</hi> taking her way, <hi>Licidas</hi> <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>till by the <U+017F>ide of the river, where a plump of Willows, made a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable <U+017F>hade; and after he had <U+017F>pent a good part of the day under it (for he was very weary with looking up and down) he <U+017F>aid him<U+017F>elf all along upon the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, not being able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a heavy inclination to <U+017F>leep which <U+017F>urprized him, for he had neither <U+017F>lept nor re<U+017F>ted all the night before.</p>
               <p>But how great <U+017F>oever the inquietudes of <hi>Licidas</hi> were, yet were they nothing comparable to the re<U+017F>tle<U+017F><U+017F>e cares and cold fears of <hi>Silvander:</hi> For this amorous Shepherd having lo<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in the thick of the wood, and being <U+017F>urprized by the ob<U+017F>curity of the night, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay and enjoy the fre<U+017F>h air, although it was nothing able to allay or cool the flame which con<U+017F>umed him. He <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elf therefore upon the ground, and leaning his head again<U+017F>t the bulk of an ancient and <U+017F>hady oak, there was not one accident of all his life, which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf into his memory, not to comfort him, but to make him think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereunto he was reduced the more intollerable: He continued in the<U+017F>e re<U+017F>tle<U+017F><U+017F>e thoughts very near two hours; but when he <U+017F>aw the Moon appear, then did his <U+017F>orrows encrea<U+017F>e, as if it were fatal unto him to have his fury take beginning from her: yet taking this Planet for a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his misfortunes, fair <hi>Cinthia</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) who by the lu<U+017F>ter of thy radiant beams <U+017F>eems to di<U+017F>pute with thy brother, the Sun, for <U+017F>upremacy of brightne<U+017F><U+017F>e: Glorious light, which in thy cour<U+017F>e about the world, is plea<U+017F>ed to make another day where ere thou <U+017F>hewe<U+017F>t thy <U+017F>elf: Clear Planet, which does di<U+017F>cover and <U+017F>ee all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ecrets which are taught in the Schools of Love, tell me, for pities <U+017F>ake, if ever thou did<U+017F>t hear any complaints more ju<U+017F>t then the<U+017F>e I make, and whether it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible any mortal <U+017F>hould be a more real Lover, or more afflicted then my <U+017F>elf: then <U+017F>taying, and mu<U+017F>ing a while, and afterwards breaking out again: O thou delightful flame,

glorious Moon, <U+017F>halt thou never <U+017F>ee me contented? Wilt thou never ble<U+017F><U+017F>e me with any kind influence? I conjure the by my love, to <U+017F>hower down <U+017F>ome <U+017F>weet influences upon my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e: Move her heart: <U+017F>he is fair, and <U+017F>he is <hi>Diana,</hi> as thou art. Upon this <hi>Silvander</hi> was <U+017F>ilent, and in his <U+017F>ilence giving his greifes their full liberty, he wi<U+017F>ht for death a hundred times, and complained again<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> the Huntere<U+017F>s, who formely did dwell in forre<U+017F>ts, that <U+017F>he and her Nymph had di<U+017F>troyed all the Lyons and Tigers in the Countrey, and not left one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him. After this, con<U+017F>idering what little or no hopes he had ever to enjoy <hi>Diana,</hi> he did <U+017F>o abundon him<U+017F>elf unto greif, that is probable he had been for ever lo<U+017F>t, if <U+017F>leep more kind unto him then him<U+017F>elf, had not in <U+017F>ome for, allayed the bitterne<U+017F>s of it and made him find <U+017F>ome ea<U+017F>e in his inquietudes. But as if this re<U+017F>t were only to enable him for the enduring of more mi<U+017F>eryes, he no <U+017F>ooner waked and <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>un a good height, he re<U+017F>olved to enquire of <U+017F>ome or other what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s the de<U+017F>ign had of marrying <hi>Diana</hi>: Up therefore he got, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a path way, he followed it yet not knowing which way it would lead him: he had not walked above a quarter of an hower or there abouts, but he heard very near him the <U+017F>ound of a flute; and turning that way, he e<U+017F>pied <U+017F>ome <U+017F>heep pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing a long, and after them a young boy dancing and playing both togeather.

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the young fellow <U+017F>aw his Ma<U+017F>ter, he ran unto him, and <U+017F>eemed to wonder that he was not among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepherds. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times took delight in talking with him, becau<U+017F>e of his pritty innocent an<U+017F>weres, where would<U+017F>t thou have me be but with my flocks (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi>) ah Ma<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid the boy) it is <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince you u<U+017F>ed to have <U+017F>o much care as to vi<U+017F>it them, as I cannot beleive any thoughts of them brought you unto them now.

               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide: <hi>Alexis</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner e<U+017F>caped out of <hi>Leonides</hi> hands but he began to prepare him<U+017F>elf for the execution of <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> command, and as if the gods were minded to make his fortune, in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort, equall unto <hi>Silvanders,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was at libertie, and among<U+017F>t the horrors of darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>puted whether the night or her <U+017F>orrows were the blacker, or whether both were <U+017F>o di<U+017F>mall as the cruelty of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>; <U+017F>he began to con<U+017F>ult with her <U+017F>oul which way <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take to find a <U+017F>uddain death. There was no invention to make one <U+017F>elf away which came not into her fancy. But a good genius, and perhaps the very <U+017F>ame which in<U+017F>pired <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did per<U+017F>wade him, that he could not lo<U+017F>e his life more gloriou<U+017F>ly then in helping to di<U+017F>enchant the fountain of loves veritie: <U+017F>o he fixed upon this re<U+017F>olution: The only ob<U+017F>tacle in her di<U+017F>ign was, <U+017F>he knew not where to find a female lover <U+017F>o faithfull as to attempt the <U+017F>ame: for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elf) <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e does love her life too well, and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he who is to die, mu<U+017F>t be one that has lived in a mo<U+017F>t inviolable fidelitie what know I but that ungratful Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e is <U+017F>tained with the crime of <U+017F>ome new change? <hi>Diana</hi> me thinks al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hould not be accepted off for <U+017F>he has burned in two <U+017F>everall flames through thee love of two Shepherds who <U+017F>erved her: and <hi>Phillis</hi> who has to her very hearts de<U+017F>ire gu<U+017F>ted all the delight of a pure and holy amitie, <U+017F>he will not for<U+017F>ake <hi>Lycidas</hi> upon any termes in the world: yet <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) it is not for the to prye too narrowly into the <U+017F>ecrets of the gods: Content thy <U+017F>elf, with this, that thou mu<U+017F>t die: never <U+017F>tay therefore untill di<U+017F>pair have driven <U+017F>ome femal lover to be the Companion of thy fate: it is <U+017F>ufficient for thee to <U+017F>hew the way, and to make it known unto po<U+017F>teritie, that never any love was more pure and holy then thine. Then did he lift up his eyes to heaven, and ob<U+017F>erving that darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e did begin to vani<U+017F>h by rea<U+017F>on of the moones new light, he <U+017F>ate down upon the ground untill it was a little lighter: but being very weary with walking, he was no <U+017F>ooner upon the green gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, but being overcome with <U+017F>leep, he <U+017F>lept till morning.</p>

                  <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner heard <hi>Licidus</hi> <U+017F>ay, that the Grotto wherein they were was the very <U+017F>ame which formerly harboured <hi>Celadon,</hi> but <U+017F>he was all amazement, and from that time thought that very rock it <U+017F>elf did tell her of that Shepherds love: all the objects which pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves unto her <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, did treat her in the <U+017F>ame manner: for when <U+017F>he heard the hollow murmure of the river Lignon, or the noi<U+017F>e which <hi>Zepherus</hi> made at the entrance of her Cavern, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till thought them compo<U+017F>ed of nothing but tho<U+017F>e amorous <U+017F>ighs, wherewith <hi>Celadon</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the rigour of his voluntary bani<U+017F>hment. <hi>Diana</hi> did very well ob<U+017F>erve this a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, but not being able to imagine that it did proceed from any other cau<U+017F>e then her fears that <hi>Phillis</hi> would <U+017F>urprize her, <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>peak unto her, but only waited with a little impatience to <U+017F>ee what would become of the de<U+017F>ign which <hi>Phillis</hi> had to look into the Grotto.

               <q>Judge, fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> unto what point my De<U+017F>tinies have brought me: I know very well that death is a remedy again<U+017F>t all mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and yet I will not have recour<U+017F>e unto it: not that I find it hard to die, but out of fear that being dead, I <U+017F>hall not love you any longer.</q>
               <p>The<U+017F>e words made her apprehend, that he had at that time a mind to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way him<U+017F>elf, but that <U+017F>ome good genius had diverted him, by putting this con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration into his thoughts. All tho<U+017F>e objects were <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad unto her apprehen<U+017F>ions, as they did <U+017F>teal from her eyes many a tear; but as <U+017F>ad as her <U+017F>oul was, yet <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but look upon the te<U+017F>timonies of her Shepherds inviolable love: At la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>he had looked all over, and had left no place un<U+017F>earched, <U+017F>he found in one of the corners, a bottle wherein <hi>Celadon</hi> kept this ink, and al<U+017F>o finding a pen near it: Alas (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>ighed) here doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e is the very <U+017F>ame pen, wherewith he u<U+017F>ed to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his amorous thoughts and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions: This is the faithful pen which has <U+017F>o often received all his <U+017F>ecrets, and which hath been partly a cau<U+017F>e of my knowing the de<U+017F>pair of my dear Shepherd: Without thee dear pen (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it) I had never known in what part of the world he had been; and in that ignorance, I <U+017F>hould never have found out the means to recal him.

               <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e la<U+017F>ted until it was dinner time: after which <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> having a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the Gallery, <hi>Adamas</hi> conducted all the company thither; and they had not been there above a quarter of an hour, but word was brought unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that there was three men at the gates which de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with him: He pre<U+017F>ently commanded they <U+017F>hould be let enter: and the fir<U+017F>t that appeared was <hi>Halladine,</hi> whom <hi>Adamas</hi> and others did pre<U+017F>ently know. <hi>Halladine</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aluted the Druide, but he did his reverence unto <hi>Madonthe</hi>: and hearing that <hi>Damon</hi> was at Lions, he be<U+017F>eeched their leave to go thither; but <hi>Madonthe</hi> telling him how <U+017F>hort a time <hi>Damon</hi> would <U+017F>tay: I had rather (continued <U+017F>he) that you would give us an accompt of your journey, and tell us how <hi>Celidea</hi> was cured. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Halladine,</hi> to tell it exactly unto you, requires a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wit then mine; but here is a man come with me, who is able to relate every circum<U+017F>tance unto you: Upon this, he told them that tho<U+017F>e two who came in with him, the one was the great <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> the African, and Authour of <hi>Celideas</hi> cure: The other was <hi>Azahides,</hi> and that no man in the world was better able to tell her what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to know, then he.</p>
               <p>Upon this, all the company fixed their looks upon the<U+017F>e two men: one of which was <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is,</hi> who<U+017F>e habit, <U+017F>tature, and deportment, was no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>ubject of a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment unto them. <hi>Adamas</hi> went unto them, and knowing by <hi>Damons</hi> report how con<U+017F>iderable this old man was, for his rare and admirable qualities, he received them with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible demon<U+017F>trations of kindne<U+017F>s: and <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is,</hi> who though a Barbarian by birth, yet not <U+017F>o by humour, he thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o obliged by the kind expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Druide, as from thence forward he began to have a mo<U+017F>t particular affection unto him.</p>
               <p>After the fir<U+017F>t complements were performed, the Druide de<U+017F>ired them to <U+017F>it down with all that good company; and by Fortune, <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time, did ca<U+017F>t his eye upon <U+017F>ome Pictures, wherewith that Gallery was admirably well furni<U+017F>hed: and chancing to know one of them, I think (<U+017F>aid he) that yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Piece is the Picture of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> whom <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> brought into Africa, after he had triumphed over Rome and Sicilie: Mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> and all the principal accidents which befel that Prince<U+017F>s from her birth, until that time, have been related unto us by <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons as were mo<U+017F>t irreproachable witne<U+017F><U+017F>es; but <U+017F>ince <hi>

Yet, fir<U+017F>t being willing to allow <U+017F>ome time unto that re<U+017F>t which he thought he had de<U+017F>erved, he intended, till all things was in readine<U+017F>s for his <U+017F>econd voyage, to enjoy all tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ures and delights that his heart could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire: and the fir<U+017F>t that he propo<U+017F>ed unto him<U+017F>elf, was, to triumph over the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tity of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> as he had already over her Empire. The memory of tho<U+017F>e ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which he had unto this Prince<U+017F>s, did not at all move him; but on the contrary in<U+017F>pired him with a <U+017F>ecret fear; that as <U+017F>he had called him out of Africa into Italy to deliver her from the Tyranny of <hi>Maximus,</hi> and to revenge the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide committed on the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>he might draw the <hi>odium</hi> of every one upon him, and in the end become the ruine of him and his E<U+017F>tates. This apprehen<U+017F>ion was a cau<U+017F>e that he kept her up very carefully in a Pallace, where leaving her without any company but her two daughters, he ordained that none who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hould come unto her without <U+017F>pecial permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion from him, upon pain of death. Some Eunuchs only were appointed to wait upon her; and that but at <U+017F>ome certain hours neither, when <U+017F>he eat her meat. The re<U+017F>entments which this Prince<U+017F>s had of her captivity, and her grief for the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>aces,</hi> who only <U+017F>he loved, did bring her in a few dayes to <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad and mi<U+017F>erable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that tho<U+017F>e who waited upon her thought fit to make report of it unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick.</hi>

               <p>This barbarous King being moved at the news, yet only to keep her alive, that he might act his impious de<U+017F>igne, he <U+017F>ent for me; and adding mountains of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es unto his earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ires and commands, he appointed me to vi<U+017F>it her, and to u<U+017F>e my utmo<U+017F>t endeavours to cure her. He knew before by many experiences, what I was able to do in the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the life which I re<U+017F>tored unto <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> his <U+017F>on, after all Phy<U+017F>icians had given him over, was a <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timony unto him, that I could do what<U+017F>oever it plea<U+017F>ed me to undertake.</p>
               <p>This good opinion which he had of my skill did <U+017F>o prejudicate his mind, that he imployed me; and I who did not de<U+017F>ire any thing with more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion then to <U+017F>ee that Prince<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e Ance<U+017F>tors I knew, I accepted of this commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as the greate<U+017F>t advantage that fortune could offer me.

               <p>Se had heard what a <U+017F>trickt command was given concerning her: <U+017F>o as <U+017F>eeing me in another kind of habit then comonly was worn, <U+017F>he was exceedingly <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed, and I cannot tell whether it was with fear, or with de<U+017F>ire of death: but <U+017F>o it was, that when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me put my foot into her chamber, <U+017F>he came to meet me, well (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) how does <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> intend to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my life?

And has he commanded you to bring me the news, that I may prepare my <U+017F>elf for it. She looked upon me all this while with a fixed eye, and I ob<U+017F>erving that <U+017F>he expected my an<U+017F>were: Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) if the King <U+017F>hould have any ill de<U+017F>ignes again<U+017F>t you, it is more then I do know, nor would I ever be the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of any <U+017F>ad news unto you; He <U+017F>eemed unto me to be very indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent over you, and to have a care of your health, and therefore commanded me to <U+017F>ee you, and to contribute all that was in me to pre<U+017F>erve your health; The<U+017F>e few wordes were enough to let this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e know, what my profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion was: <U+017F>o as laying a<U+017F>ide her fir<U+017F>t opinion of me; Alas (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me with a deep <U+017F>igh) my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is not any of tho<U+017F>e with in the compa<U+017F>s of Phi<U+017F>ique; If that Barbarous Prince who keeps me a per<U+017F>oner has any mind to put me out of my mi<U+017F>eryes, let him make ha<U+017F>t and take away my life, which after the lo<U+017F>s of my dominions and liberty cannot be plea<U+017F>ing unto me: we are three victimes heere, and I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay four, which that tyrant may <U+017F>acrifice unto his fury when he will: good gods? Why <U+017F>hould he <U+017F>pare us, after he ruined the <U+017F>tately temples of Rome? After this, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> began to walk again, and the teares <U+017F>he <U+017F>hed, did ea<U+017F>ily make me know that in the re<U+017F>entment of her great lo<U+017F><U+017F>es, her <U+017F>oul <U+017F>tood more in need of remedies then her body: and <U+017F>ee how much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion may work upon a <U+017F>pirit which is not altogeather void of re<U+017F>entment; I prote<U+017F>t I was <U+017F>o much moved at her mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, that I would have attempted any thing in the world to <U+017F>erve her.</p>
               <p>I gave her all the te<U+017F>timonies of it that I could, but I perceived that her fears of being deceived was a cau<U+017F>e, that at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he did not much value what I <U+017F>aid: yet <U+017F>he thanked me, but in <U+017F>uch a cold manner as made me judge <U+017F>he doubted my fidelity. After <U+017F>he had commanded me to report unto the King a thou<U+017F>and complaints which her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t unto her, <U+017F>he gave me leave to retire; And <hi>Gen<U+017F>ericke</hi> who waited for my return with much impatiency, to know how <hi>Eudoxe</hi> did, he knew no more by me then was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for his tranquility.</p>
               <p>I did not tell him what the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e commanded me, but only made a faithfull relation of the condition wherin I found her; and <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o highly of tho<U+017F>e charmes which I ob<U+017F>erved in her, as I did innocently <U+017F>et an edge upon that <U+017F>word, which <U+017F>ince, had like to have killed us all.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> then knowing that <hi>Eudoxes</hi> malady was mo<U+017F>t in her mind, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the <U+017F>olitude wherin he detained her, would never be a remedy again<U+017F>t it, he commanded me to go and vi<U+017F>it her often, and gave a me permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to go as often as I plea<U+017F>ed; and therefore, after many vi<U+017F>its, having at la<U+017F>t made known unto that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, the great de<U+017F>ire which I had to do her any <U+017F>ervice<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I did oblige her to put <U+017F>ome confidence in me, and to prote<U+017F>t that <U+017F>he would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate even her very heart and thoughts unto me.</p>

Truth is, <U+017F>he fell into my armes in a <U+017F>wound, and I had much a do to recover her. At la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>he had gathered <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trength, <U+017F>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with the affection which <hi>Olimbres</hi> had unto <hi>Placidia,</hi> and told me that this was the fourth per<U+017F>on of whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her <U+017F>elf that he would not <U+017F>urvive his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, if by fortune any perticular con<U+017F>ideration had kept him alive after the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Vrca<U+017F>es.</hi> She had no <U+017F>ooner done relating her fortunes, but I u<U+017F>ed my be<U+017F>t endeavours to comfort her: I did not omit any argument which I thought would per<U+017F>wade her unto what I de<U+017F>ired; and in conclu<U+017F>ion I offered her all the <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>he could expect from a man of my condition. I told her that my age, and the qualities wherwith heaven had endued me, had given me <U+017F>o much credit with the King; that I hoped to obtain any thing I <U+017F>hould aske him; That it was true, as for her liberty, it was above my reach, and I dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o much as think of it; But as for any thing which conduced unto the mitigation of her greif or feares from her detention, I did not think he would deny me any thing. This Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e accepted of my offers with <U+017F>uch a charming <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s, that I did prote<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I would not <U+017F>pare my very life to procure her contentment; and I cannot tell whether my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions infu<U+017F>ed any hopes into her: but <U+017F>o it was, <U+017F>he appeared not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad nor <U+017F>o dejected as before, and in a <U+017F>hort time became as plump and fre<U+017F>h and fair as ever <U+017F>he was.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:53528:189"/>But to return unto my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner left <hi>Eudoxe</hi> alone, but by fortune I came in; and finding her all in tears, I wondered at <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden a change; but when I knew the cau<U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, I found <U+017F>he had mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e for it. Now did I begin to <U+017F>ee clearly what the drift of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> was, which was before unknown unto me; but now I found all his compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this Prince<U+017F>s was meerly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which made him wi<U+017F>h for her recovery: <U+017F>he told me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <U+017F>yllable he <U+017F>aid unto her, and when <U+017F>he told me what term of time <U+017F>he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was only to acquaint me with her misfortune, and to pray me that I would apply the be<U+017F>t remedy I could. Madam (an<U+017F>wered I) tomorrow I will take the honour to talk with you more particularly, and do promi<U+017F>e you to think upon it all the night: Mean time, be of good comfort, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that if my life and blood will deliver you from the<U+017F>e fears that afflict you, you <U+017F>hall not be long before you be delivered.</p>
               <p>Upon this, I went out of her chamber, and retired home, where, according to my promi<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>pent all the night in thinking which way I <U+017F>hould be<U+017F>t <U+017F>erve this <U+017F>age Prince<U+017F>s; but after I had <U+017F>tretched my brains, and turned every <U+017F>tone, I could not hit upon one expedient, the execution whereof <U+017F>eemed po<U+017F><U+017F>ible unto me: for if I thought of getting her out of captivity by flight, I <U+017F>aw that we had not time enough to gain the guards, nor to furni<U+017F>h our <U+017F>elves with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our enlargement: To divert the King from this amorous fury, I <U+017F>aw but little likelyhood: for very well knowing his vicious Nature, I know that nothing but death would quench his lu<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>To kill him, be<U+017F>ides the enormity of the crime, and the inevitable danger that would fall upon my <U+017F>elf, I did fore<U+017F>ee this perhaps was not the way to deliver <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> <U+017F>ince he would leave two <U+017F>ons, who doubtle<U+017F>s would <U+017F>ucceed him in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as well as his Empire. Thus, not being able to invent any thing that would do her good, as <U+017F>oon as night was pa<U+017F>t, and her chamber door open in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I went to give her an accompt of my thoughts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and this Prince<U+017F>s finding what difficulties I met withal: but <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) there is one remedy which you have not thought upon, and which is a very ea<U+017F>ie one.

Upon this, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> held her peace, <U+017F>hewing by her countenance that this re<U+017F>olution was plea<U+017F>ing unto her, and that <U+017F>he wanted not courage to execute it. And therefore I told her, that indeed this remedy was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure of all, but yet I did not think it fit <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have recour<U+017F>e unto it, until the utmo<U+017F>t extremity: I told her, that I would fir<U+017F>t talk with <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> and try whether I could divert him from his vicious de<U+017F>ign, and after that, I would not be again<U+017F>t that expedient which <U+017F>he had propounded unto me, but on the contrary would help her the be<U+017F>t I could, and if need were, I would <U+017F>erve her as a guide through that di<U+017F>mal pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>e her rather to die then lo<U+017F>e her reputation. I pre<U+017F>ently found, that my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e did plea<U+017F>e her humour: for taking my hand, go dear <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) the mo<U+017F>t generous per<U+017F>on alive; go, and if you can bend the <U+017F>oul of yonder Tyrant do: Remember what you have promi<U+017F>ed unto me; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I will die a Prince<U+017F>s.

               <p>The knowledge which <hi>Eudoxe</hi> had of <hi>Thra<U+017F>imonds</hi> love, did put her into great hopes, imagining that <U+017F>he could make him do great matters: and therefore <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf came with the two young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es to give an an<U+017F>wer unto this welcome me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, and to tell him, that <U+017F>he received the affection of his Ma<U+017F>ter, as a mo<U+017F>t high honour; that for want of paper and ink, they could not thank him any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but by voice; and if he expected any other an<U+017F>wer from them, they <U+017F>hould be glad to give it unto him<U+017F>elf, the next time he honoured them with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>it. The young man told them, that he was gone abroad and would not return till night, but as <U+017F>oon as he did, he would obey their commands: After this, he went out.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, as I told you before, I went unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <U+017F>ubject whereupon I intended to talk with him, I told him in what a <U+017F>ad and mi<U+017F>erable condition I found <hi>Eudoxe</hi> after he left her: I told him al<U+017F>o what inventions I u<U+017F>ed to make her tell me the cau<U+017F>e of her grief; and that when I knew it, I came expre<U+017F>ly from her, mo<U+017F>t humbly to be<U+017F>eech him once more not to make any attempts again<U+017F>t her: I laid before him how ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y the gods would be at <U+017F>uch ingratitude, and that he rendred him<U+017F>elf culpable of a mo<U+017F>t horrid crime, if after the <U+017F>poils, over which <U+017F>he had made him triumph, he <U+017F>hould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>h away her honour. I put him in mind of the Ance<U+017F>tors from whom that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e was de<U+017F>cended, and of <U+017F>uch men unto whom <U+017F>he had the honour to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied: That it was abominable, <U+017F>he who is the daughter and wife of Emperours, <U+017F>hould be treated as a <U+017F>lave, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince he had never thought upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t of Rome, if <U+017F>he had not invited him: I told him al<U+017F>o, that he was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto her for the glory wherewith hi<U+017F>tory would honour his life, and that it was not ju<U+017F>t, but <U+017F>hamefully, he <U+017F>hould eclip<U+017F>e the lu<U+017F>ter of it, by an act.

him; but in lieu of lending any ear to rea<U+017F>on, became all rage, and mixing jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie with his fury, he began, unhappily for me, to fear that I had <U+017F>ome thoughts to enjoy the <U+017F>ame happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, over which he was re<U+017F>olved to triumph. This blind pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did <U+017F>o di<U+017F>order his judgement, as without any thoughts of <hi>Eudoxes</hi> virtue, he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected me to be guilty of that crime, from which I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him; and therefore with a fury that <U+017F>parkled in his eyes, he <U+017F>wore he would that very night have his fill either of love or revenge: and forbidding me ever to <U+017F>ee her again, he commanded me to retire unto my own hou<U+017F>e, where my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was to be my pri<U+017F>on, upon pain of the greate<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hments his anger could invent.</p>
               <p>I mu<U+017F>t tell you, it was not the fear of death that made me obey him; but being re<U+017F>olved to give unto that wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F>s, the remedy which <U+017F>he intended to imploy when all things were in de<U+017F>peration, I went and confined my <U+017F>elf to my chamber, hoping my captivity would not continue long, <U+017F>ince it would end by the death of <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and my <U+017F>elf. I no <U+017F>ooner came into my chamber, but I went into my clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, where I kept all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ecrets and wonders in Nature, which I had been in collecting above fourty years: and becau<U+017F>e, with abundance of <U+017F>tudy, I had knowledge in all rare and admirable <U+017F>ecrets, it was not long before I found <U+017F>uch ingredients, as would compound a poy<U+017F>on <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil, as would quickly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h my de<U+017F>ign: fir<U+017F>t I took black Agarick, which I had pounded into powder, and having incorporated it with the juice of <hi>Thap<U+017F>is,</hi> I mingled an e<U+017F><U+017F>ence with it which was extracted from the leaves of Lethale, commonly called deadly Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hade; and the leaves of Texo, which the Gauls call, If, or Ewe: afterwards I put into it Aconite, or Wolf-bane; and of all the<U+017F>e together, having made an extract, I put in a little <U+017F>cumm of the deaf A<U+017F>pick: and as <U+017F>oon as I had put the one half of this into a little gla<U+017F>s, I took ink and paper, and writ this note unto <hi>Eudoxe.</hi>

               <p>All things being ready, I called a <U+017F>lave which waited upon me, and who u<U+017F>ed to follow me when I went to vi<U+017F>it the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e: with one hand I gave him the little gla<U+017F>s, telling him it was a Medicine which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired of me, and indeed I did not lie: with my other hand I gave him the Note, which I pretended to be a direction how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e it; but above all, I charged him to be very <U+017F>ecret, and to make as much ha<U+017F>te back as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could.</p>
               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that becau<U+017F>e I would be out of the dinn and trouble of the people, I lodged in the mo<U+017F>t dark and private corner of the Town I could chu<U+017F>e; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch places are commonly the receptacles of Thieves and Rogues, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <U+017F>tudents, it chanced that three or four young men that were con<U+017F>cious of <U+017F>ome robberies &amp; murders, were come for a refuge into a lodging very near mine. Ju<U+017F>tices were pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>ed of their coming, and intended to <U+017F>urprize them in the beginning of the night: The<U+017F>e Thieves were <U+017F>tout and de<U+017F>perate, and by con<U+017F>equence terrible unto almo<U+017F>t every one: <U+017F>o as to run the le<U+017F><U+017F>e danger, it was contrived to catch them in <U+017F>nares; and in order thereunto, they laid in the <U+017F>treets <U+017F>everal cords, about a foot from the ground; and di<U+017F>tant one from another about five or <U+017F>ix paces. After this, all the neighbours were commanded to <U+017F>tand ready in their Arms, to fall upon them when they were caught in the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53528:191"/>
<U+017F>nares; The <U+017F>tratagem did take according to their de<U+017F>ires: but harke I be<U+017F>eech you what hapned before: my <U+017F>lave, who as I told you, was gone upon his errand, and as fortune was, went through this <U+017F>treet; And had not gone above twenty or thirty paces, but running very fa<U+017F>t, his foot was catched in a <U+017F>nare and down fell he with his no<U+017F>e next the ground: now as it is naturall upon <U+017F>uch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to <U+017F>ave the face with the hands as much as one can, he broke the gla<U+017F>s in a hundred peices, and had like to have broak his neck. At the noi<U+017F>e and out-cry which he made upon his fall, <U+017F>ome neighbours opened their dores, who as I told you had command to fall upon tho<U+017F>e theeves and thought that it was now their time to fall on; But when they <U+017F>aw only the poor <U+017F>lave who<U+017F>e blood gu<U+017F>hed out at his no<U+017F>e they came gently to him, and without farther enquiry whither he went would have lent him a light, to pa<U+017F>s the <U+017F>treet with more <U+017F>afty: but he who <U+017F>aw the cau<U+017F>e of his voyage broken, he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till lamenting and complaining, whil<U+017F>t as ill luck was, two great dogges wherewith one of the neighbours u<U+017F>ed to bait, bulls, at Publique <U+017F>hews, did come into the <U+017F>treets: and being greedy of blood, they pre<U+017F>ently began to licke that which the <U+017F>lave had innocently mingled with the poy<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>They had not lapped with their tongues above three times, but they tumbled with their feet upwards and died imediately: at which the owner of them was <U+017F>o extreamly angry, that needs would he kill my <U+017F>lave the very <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant: and to know the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddain and <U+017F>trange an end, he <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed him to his hou<U+017F>e: where the poor <U+017F>lave having given him an accompt of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s wherin I imployed him he gave him the paper al<U+017F>o, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elf, that it would <U+017F>erve for his ju<U+017F>tification. The man did quickly find out my de<U+017F>ign, and conceiving it mo<U+017F>t fit to acquaint the King, he went pre<U+017F>ently to adverti<U+017F>e him of it. I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince that <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> was ready to fall down at the <U+017F>ight of my letter: but at la<U+017F>t recollecting him<U+017F>elf, and turning all his fury again<U+017F>t me, he commanded twelve or fifteen of his guard to go imediatly to my hou<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e upon me, and to put me in that pri<U+017F>on where traytors u<U+017F>ed to be locked up: which command was pre<U+017F>ently obayed; And I being prepared to die, <U+017F>taying only for the return of my <U+017F>lave, they found my dores open, and a gla<U+017F>s upon the table full of the <U+017F>ame poi<U+017F>on, which I thought <hi>Eudoxe</hi> had received. I will not tell you in what a condition I was when I <U+017F>aw this ob<U+017F>tacle unto, my re<U+017F>olution it will <U+017F>uffice you know that imagining the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e to be dead I did exceedingly rejoice at all tho<U+017F>e tortures which I conceived were preparing for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> was returned from hunting a little before: and being extreamly impatient to <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e that he might know what effect his letter produced, he went unto the Palace where <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was, and telling her all the <U+017F>torye which you have heard, he made the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e think that her re<U+017F>olution was not unknown unto him no more then the wicked de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick.</hi>

Since Sir you know what intentions <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> has upon me it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but you <U+017F>hould approve of the de<U+017F>ign which I have to prevent by my death that <U+017F>hamefull <U+017F>taine wherewith he would <U+017F>ully my honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Though nature had not made me the Daughter unto <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi>: and though fortune had not twice <U+017F>ubmitted the Emperedom of the Ea<U+017F>t unto me, yet it is enough that I do know what a wife and a woman does owe unto virtue, never to con<U+017F>ent unto the lo<U+017F>s of a thing the price whereof is beyond all value; And certainly what tiranny <U+017F>oever <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> is re<U+017F>olved to u<U+017F>e unto me, his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hall <U+017F>till find re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance.

If, as our la<U+017F>t refuge, the love which you profe<U+017F>s unto young <hi>Eudoxe</hi> be grounded upon honour, certainly you will be her Protector, and will be a<U+017F>hamed to marry her, after her Mother has lo<U+017F>t that only thing which will be a glory unto her in the match: <U+017F>hall it be ever recorded to future ages in hi<U+017F>tory, that <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> would glut his bruti<U+017F>h lu<U+017F>t upon <hi>Eudoxe</hi> the captive, and that <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> the glory of his time, <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till and would never offer to be an ob<U+017F>tacle unto <U+017F>uch a blacke de<U+017F>ign?

In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he fell down at the feet of <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> and cla<U+017F>ped about the leggs of that Prince with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as he was not able to ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he would: at this, he was <U+017F>o milted into pity, and <hi>Eudoxes</hi> de<U+017F>ires to pre<U+017F>erve her honour did plea<U+017F>e him <U+017F>o well, that his love encrea<U+017F>ed, and made him think that no greater advantage could be unto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then to marry the Daughter of <U+017F>o virtuous a Mother; Be<U+017F>ides this, the glory to <U+017F>ee at his feet a Prince<U+017F>s whom <U+017F>o many millions of people had obeyed, did <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ingly flatter him that from thence forward he re<U+017F>olved to u<U+017F>e his very utmo<U+017F>t endeavours for her delivery out of tho<U+017F>e paines which her feares had infu<U+017F>ed into her: and therefore unloo<U+017F>ing <hi>Eudoxes</hi> armes as well as he could, he pre<U+017F>ently kneeled down upon the ground, and helping her up, Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) hope well in the goodne<U+017F>s of heaven and in my love: <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> <U+017F>hall joyn my death unto yours; or if his pity pre<U+017F>erve me, his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hall never hurt you.</p>
               <p>Upon this, he left her to go unto the King: but he found him not in the Ca<U+017F>tle: for that Barbarian having no thoughts in his mind but the ruine of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> and fearing that by the accident which hapned the death of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e would be <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>tacle unto his de<U+017F>ires, he re<U+017F>olved to prevent it: and therefore when night came he took two or three eunuchs with him, and by a backe dore, went into the Palace where <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was detained. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> was gone out, by fortune the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e had <U+017F>hut her Chamber dore, <U+017F>o as <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to knock: and <hi>Eudoxe</hi> knowing his voice, al<U+017F>o hearing the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs murmure, <U+017F>he doubted what de<U+017F>ign brought him thither: <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf out of all meanes then to defend her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he put the table and all <U+017F>he could lay her hands upon, again<U+017F>t the dore: hoping perhaps <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> would come to her releif. But when <U+017F>he had a while <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained this <U+017F>eige wherin the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Gen<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> warred again<U+017F>t the virtue of <hi>Eudoxe</hi>: <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved upon a mo<U+017F>t generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign for a woman. She with the help of her two daughters, took all the mattes that were under their beds, and other combu<U+017F>tible things and heaping them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather in the mid<U+017F>t of the Chamber, <U+017F>he took two lighted candles, and <U+017F>etting them a fire: dear flames (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a loud voice) be more pure then tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> revenge upon me the pernitious de<U+017F>ignes of that Barbarian and be as mercyle<U+017F><U+017F>e unto him as he is unto me: <U+017F>he pronounced the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>o loud and di<U+017F>tinctly that the King heard every <U+017F>illable: <U+017F>o as finding thereby the intention of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and fearing <U+017F>ome misfortune <U+017F>hould follow, he and his eunuchs redoubled their <U+017F>trength and at la<U+017F>t broke upon the dore: but the fire being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53528:192"/>
and the <U+017F>moke being inclo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>triving for a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, it found it at the opening of the door, and that with <U+017F>uch violence, as two of tho<U+017F>e that were at the door were choaked. <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> <U+017F>urprized at this accident, began to flie, and never thinking of any way to quench this fire, only thought of <U+017F>aving him<U+017F>elf. But <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> after a long <U+017F>earch after the King, and coming again to the place where <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was, he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw her Pallace on fire; but he pre<U+017F>ently thought it an effect of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e her courage, or of the revenge of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw tho<U+017F>e flames were like to devour all the <U+017F>weet hopes he had of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, he was two or three times ready to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o into the flame; yet de<U+017F>iring fir<U+017F>t to know all particulars of the truth, he began to enquire of all he met, but none could tell him any thing more, then that <hi>Eudoxe</hi> her <U+017F>elf u<U+017F>ed this extremity to free her <U+017F>elf from <U+017F>ervitude.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> unto whom the Councel of <U+017F>ix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred had refu<U+017F>ed the poi<U+017F>on, imbarquing at the Port of the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilians, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered (as I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince) with a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>weet hopes which an A<U+017F>trologer had infu<U+017F>ed into them, they <U+017F>et forward: But as heaven took delight in putting every day new ob<U+017F>tacles unto their pro<U+017F>perity, it <U+017F>uffered them to fall into the hands of a Pirate, who in taking away their liberty, took away all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were promi<U+017F>ed unto them. The name of this Pirate was <hi>Cloroha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes,</hi> vulgarly called the bloody Pirate; becau<U+017F>e, be<U+017F>ides his being a Native Barbarian, and bani<U+017F>hed Africa for a thou<U+017F>and crimes committed by him, he had made a <U+017F>olemn vow, never to pardon any whom Fortune made his <U+017F>laves. He pulled out the eyes of <U+017F>ome, cut off the no<U+017F>es, ears, and tongues of others: thus took he delight in torturing men. Sometimes when he was enraged he would pull out the hearts of <U+017F>ome, and others he would <U+017F>acrifice; <U+017F>ometimes unto Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and <U+017F>ometimes unto Mercury, as the god of theft. His retreat was mo<U+017F>t commonly into the I<U+017F>le of great Brittany, where he found many that was <U+017F>utable to his own humour, and by that means found a more <U+017F>afe refuge. So as he <U+017F>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and fro the Ocean, and often pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the <U+017F>traits of Gibralter, otherwi<U+017F>e cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led high Earth, he fell into the Mediterranean Sea, and mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>olently roved about the Coa<U+017F>ts of Spain. This was the Barbarian that met with the <U+017F>hip wherein <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> &amp; <hi>Olimbres</hi> were, and in a <U+017F>hort time borded her: But tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver u<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>tartled at any dangers, they <U+017F>eized each of them upon a <U+017F>word and buckler, inciting <U+017F>ome Merchants to defend them<U+017F>elves, advanced them<U+017F>elves to hinder any from leaping into their <U+017F>hip: Some Marriners, to whom the name and trade of Pirats were odious, <U+017F>eeing an inevitable death had <U+017F>urrounded them, them, they re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ell their lives at as dear and noble a rate as they could: So as <U+017F>eizing upon Arms, and joyning them<U+017F>elves unto <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> there began a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>harp di<U+017F>pute. When they fir<U+017F>t began <hi>Clorohalantes</hi> did nothing but laugh, <U+017F>eeing the inequality of forces: But when by the valour of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he <U+017F>aw many of his men dead, he began to be very angry, and arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, he him<U+017F>elf would needs become a combatant. At the <U+017F>ight of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, all tho<U+017F>e who followed his Fortune a<U+017F><U+017F>umed fre<U+017F>h forces, and having him for their guide, did leap into the <U+017F>hip where <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres</hi> did <U+017F>o bravely di<U+017F>pute for their lives, as every blow that fell from their Arms were mortal unto all upon whom they light. But not to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon every particular, it will <U+017F>uffice you know that <hi>Clorohalantes,</hi> <U+017F>eeing what little advantage his <U+017F>ide got, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they <U+017F>hould at the <U+017F>ame time charge on in the Poup: which was done accordingly, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>harply, that tho<U+017F>e which defended them<U+017F>elves, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to with<U+017F>tand the over numero<U+017F>ity of their enemies, they let them have <U+017F>uch free acce<U+017F><U+017F>e<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as in le<U+017F><U+017F>e then a quarter of an hour they were ma<U+017F>ters of the <U+017F>hip; and the <U+017F>ooner becau<U+017F>e <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> after a long re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, fell at the la<U+017F>t one by the other, and were exceedingly weak with lo<U+017F>s of abundance of blood. <hi>Clorohalantes</hi> more proud of this victory then of any he ever got before, he quite forgot the price at which he bought it; but <U+017F>till he retained in his memory the brave re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which <hi>Olimbres</hi> made, and a <U+017F>lave that fought next him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cau<U+017F>ed them to be brought into his <U+017F>hip, and commanded their wounds to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53528:192"/>
be dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, being re<U+017F>olved to make a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemn <U+017F>acrifice of them as of the mo<U+017F>t glorious prey that ever he got <U+017F>ince he knew what belonged unto Arms or Sea.</p>
               <p>In order to this de<U+017F>ign he turned <U+017F>ail towards great Brittain, and <U+017F>eeing he had a very favourable wind, he would needs by way of diver<U+017F>ion know, who tho<U+017F>e were, which by their valour had killed <U+017F>o many of his men. And therefore as <U+017F>oon as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> had recovered them<U+017F>elves a little better, they were brought before this Pirate, who addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Olimbres,</hi> as unto him who <U+017F>eemed to be the Ma<U+017F>ter, he asked him who he was, and from whence he came? <hi>Clorohalantes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Olimbres</hi> unto him, with a deportment that <U+017F>hewed the genero<U+017F>ity of his <U+017F>pirit) I am a Cavalier and a Patrician of Rome: My name is <hi>Olimbres</hi>; and if thou wilt know by what Fortune I am become thy <U+017F>lave, then know, that to <U+017F>ave the life of a friend, I did not follow <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> when loadned with the <U+017F>poils of Rome, he returned into Africa; Since that, finding no felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in life, many con<U+017F>iderations moved me to <U+017F>eek out for death; and in order to that, I went to demand poi<U+017F>on from the councel of <U+017F>ix hundred, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me, I was con<U+017F>trained to con<U+017F>ult with an Oracle, the an<U+017F>wer whereof made me wend my cour<U+017F>e towards Africa: So I did, imbarquing my <U+017F>elf in this <U+017F>hip, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which thy Arms hath triumphed, and <U+017F>ubmitted me unto thy will: As for this <U+017F>lave, whom thou <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t with me, I do not know his Fortune, nor what he is: for having bought him but a while <U+017F>ince, I have no knowledge of him; only I begin to think, by the fight which he hath made with me, that his courage and affection de<U+017F>erves a better Fate then that which is fallen upon him.</p>
               <p>This was all that <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him, and <hi>Clorohalantes</hi> remembring that he had formerly heard of the name: Was it not you (<U+017F>aid he) whom <hi>Eudoxe</hi> <U+017F>ent unto the King of the Vandals to <U+017F>olicite him to deliver her from the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Maximus?

In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he cau<U+017F>ed them to be carried away, and commanded their wounds <U+017F>hould be carefully dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: from hence forward, he re<U+017F>olved to be revenged on the per<U+017F>on of this Cavalier, for all the injuries that he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi>; and imagining that he <U+017F>hould do an extream di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure unto that barbarous King, if he <U+017F>hewed his hatred upon this occa<U+017F>ion, he re<U+017F>olved to make <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>uffer all the infamous tortures he could invent: And to begin his affliction betimes, he <U+017F>ent him word what he was to expect: which me<U+017F><U+017F>age <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbres</hi> received without the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>may; but fearing what would become of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aces,</hi> he began to make <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad complaints, that even <hi>Clorohalantes</hi> him<U+017F>elf, though a Barbarian, could not hear them without compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. <hi>Olimbres</hi> knew, that but for him, the life of his friend had never been expo<U+017F>ed unto <U+017F>o many mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes: So as finding him<U+017F>elf culpable of all the mi<U+017F>eries which <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> <U+017F>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of tho<U+017F>e which were menaced, he could not chu<U+017F>e but cur<U+017F>e the very day of his birth. <hi>Olimbres</hi> prepared him<U+017F>elf for the wor<U+017F>t, he did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to comfort him<U+017F>elf in this thought, that the la<U+017F>t minute of his life would be the mo<U+017F>t glorious unto him, <U+017F>ince it gave him a means to make it appear unto what degree his affection was arrived.</p>
               <p>Thus they continued <U+017F>ome dayes; during which, their wounds healed <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, as they were perfectly cured: and as if heaven were weary with tormenting them with any longer mi<U+017F>eries, a tempe<U+017F>t aro<U+017F>e at Sea, and <U+017F>o violent it was, that the <U+017F>hips of <hi>Clorohalantes,</hi> being forced to yield unto the violence of the <U+017F>torm, they were driven by the wind and we then among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hips which <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erick</hi> had loadned with the plunder of Rome, and which lying at Anchor for a favourable wind: Then <hi>Clorohalantes,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would not fall into the hands of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> he killed him<U+017F>elf: This unlookt for deliverance was an Omen of good Fortune unto <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> who being relea<U+017F>ed from their fetters, longed to embrace each other; but they forbore, le<U+017F>t their Care<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>hould too much undi<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them and make them known.

At this <U+017F>ad news <hi>V<U+017F>races</hi> fell down: and <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed, that it was long before he was able to open his mouth; but to <U+017F>pend no time in needle<U+017F>s relation of their <U+017F>orrowes, <U+017F>ince you may ea<U+017F>ily imagine them let me only tell you, that after many a complaint again<U+017F>t heaven for pre<U+017F>erving them <U+017F>o oft from <U+017F>everall perills, they accu<U+017F>ed the gods of inju<U+017F>tice, as if they had pre<U+017F>erved them from a le<U+017F><U+017F>er burthen of mi<U+017F>eryes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a greater.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, hindring each other from making any attempts upon their per<U+017F>ons, they intended to return unto the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilians a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them<U+017F>elves that now they had <U+017F>uch good rea<U+017F>ons to die, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible the poi<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould be denied them. They had no <U+017F>ooner fixed them<U+017F>elves upon this cour<U+017F>e but <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> came unto the place where <hi>Olimbres</hi> was: and becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e who went to carry the news of <hi>Olimbres</hi> arivall, could not <U+017F>peak with the Father, they were con<U+017F>trained to make their addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto the <U+017F>on: and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Olimbres</hi> in his African voyage had gotten the affectionate freind<U+017F>hip of that Prince, <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> went with joy to receive him; They had no <U+017F>ooner embraced each other, but <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> began fir<U+017F>t to <U+017F>peak: dear <hi>Olimbres</hi> (<U+017F>aid he in a loud voice) you are arrived at a time wherin you will find all our court in great di<U+017F>order. If I be not mi<U+017F>taken (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered the <U+017F>ad <hi>Olimbres</hi>) I do know the principall cau<U+017F>e, and certainly, after the death of three <U+017F>uch fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, joy were far out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, <hi>Olimbres</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>end forth a mo<U+017F>t profound <U+017F>igh as he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o: and <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his joyes whi<U+017F>pered that Cavelier in the ear; The misfortune (<U+017F>aid he unto him) is nothing <U+017F>o great as is beleived: upon this taking him by the arme he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried backe into the boate, wherin none was but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>aces</hi> who was <U+017F>triving betwixt life and death: and cau<U+017F>ing all the men to <U+017F>tand at a di<U+017F>tance and candles to be taken away, when he thought none could hear but <hi>Olimbres,</hi> he began this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e. Dear freind (<U+017F>aid he unto him) I mu<U+017F>t make two very particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ions unto you; by the one I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my own ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and by the other, my Fathers <U+017F>hame: upon this, he related unto him, how he was in love with the young <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and how <U+017F>he received him: afterwards he related the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> u<U+017F>ed towards <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> the Mother; He told him of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment by rea<U+017F>on of the poi<U+017F>on which I had prepared for her: at la<U+017F>t he told him of all the attempts which the King had made upon the Chamber of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e, and how <U+017F>he <U+017F>et it on fire: after this; Now dear <hi>Olimbres</hi> (continued he) you mu<U+017F>t know, that <hi>Eudoxe</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner kindled the fire, not any horrors of

death, but <U+017F>orrowes to be a cau<U+017F>e of her two Daughters death did <U+017F>o far enter into her <U+017F>oul, as <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but retire her <U+017F>elf into another Chamber where the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es lay; Then <U+017F>hutting the door, and remembring the affection which I had profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he began to think, that perhaps if <U+017F>he could e<U+017F>cape this danger, <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> would leave pur<U+017F>uing her or that I would find out <U+017F>ome way to <U+017F>top him. This con<U+017F>ideration made her con<U+017F>ent not to die yet: <U+017F>o as opening the window towards the garden, by fortune <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied at her feet two <U+017F>heets<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which <U+017F>he tyed togeather, and by them <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t let down <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> next <hi>Placidia,</hi> and la<U+017F>tly her <U+017F>elf; <hi>Olimbres</hi> having no patience: How? (<U+017F>aid he, and interrupted) is not <hi>Eudoxe</hi> dead? <U+017F>he is not (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi>) <U+017F>he ran unto a little hou<U+017F>e in the corner of the garden belonging to the Gardiner, whom <U+017F>he awaked, (for as you know, tho<U+017F>e kind of men go to bed betimes) <U+017F>he made him open the door, and as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was entred: freind (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) the palace is all on fire. Upon this the Gardiner who by rea<U+017F>on of the darkne<U+017F>s did not know <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> he went out, and was not long before he <U+017F>aw the flames fla<U+017F>h out of the Chamber from whence the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es came; then coming in again in a great ama<U+017F>e, good gods (<U+017F>aid he) what will become of the fair pri<U+017F>oners? They are in a place (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Eudoxe</hi>) where their lives do depend upon thee; and if thou wilt pre<U+017F>erve them, I will make thee happy for ever. Upon this, <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed him to light up a candle; and the poor fellow in a mighty confu<U+017F>ion asking her what <U+017F>he would have him to do; all that I would have thee do (<U+017F>aid <hi>Eudoxe</hi>) is to hide us, lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hould come and <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e us; then would I have thee ran in all ha<U+017F>t and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> where we are but above all, be <U+017F>ure that no living <U+017F>oul know it but only he.</p>
               <p>The Gardiner then finding no <U+017F>afer place to put them in then a little cave which was near his hou<U+017F>e, their he hid them, and came to tell me what <hi>Eudoxe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. He had as much a do to get unto me, as I had to get out of the croud; for you mu<U+017F>t know <hi>Olimbres,</hi> that the town is in <U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>o as one could hardly know another in the di<U+017F>order. But at la<U+017F>t I followed him to his little hou<U+017F>e, upon which abundance of <U+017F>parks began already to fall; which making me fear it would at length be burned I could not not give any te<U+017F>timones of my joy unto the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es: but carrying them as <U+017F>ecretly as I could unto the hou<U+017F>e of one of my dome<U+017F>tiques not far from thence, I gave <U+017F>ome money to the Gardiner, and charged him upon paine of his life to be <U+017F>ilent. Leaving them then in <U+017F>afty there, I returned unto the Ca<U+017F>tle to <U+017F>ee the King, but I could not: for the horror of this accident had <U+017F>o terified him that he would not be <U+017F>een by any. Thus was I the fir<U+017F>t that knew of your return where at I much rejoyce, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, dear <hi>Olimbres,</hi> that I will continue in the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ires which I have, and ever had to love and <U+017F>erve you. This was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> which was abundance of joy unto <hi>Olimbres</hi> and I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid it had bin the highe<U+017F>t degree, if the joyes of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aces</hi> had been comparable unto his. That di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed Cavelier heard all that the Prince <U+017F>aid, for he being behind in the boate, they took no notice of him; And his joyes to hear that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e was alive did <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>port him into the other extream, as formerly he was in his mi<U+017F>eryes and greif. Yet heaven which would pre<U+017F>erve him for the felicity of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer him to die upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e of delight: but following <hi>Olimbres,</hi> whom <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> would needs have to lodge in the Ca<U+017F>tle, they were no <U+017F>ooner alone, but they began to embrace each other, and <U+017F>pent almo<U+017F>t all the night in relating their adventures.</p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> heard of the return, and of his <U+017F>hippes, and of <hi>Olimbres</hi> but the memory of this late di<U+017F>mall accident, would not <U+017F>uffer him to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of tho<U+017F>e joyes which at another time, he had re<U+017F>ented. Yet he welcomed <hi>Olimbres</hi> as well as he could: and de<U+017F>iring to hide from po<U+017F>terity the true cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Eudoxes</hi> death, he began to invent, all the excu<U+017F>es he could devi<U+017F>e to palliate that crime which he had committed. <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>eemed to beleive all the King <U+017F>aid, and fetching a hundred di<U+017F><U+017F>embled <U+017F>ighes for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e three Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, he ob<U+017F>erved, that the memory of this <U+017F>ad tragedy had infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome repentance into the King: and indeed, he greived <U+017F>o extreamly at it, as one might read repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <U+017F>orrow in his eyes: and to leave <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timony of that e<U+017F>teem which he had
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53528:194"/>
of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> though a captive, he cau<U+017F>ed her corps to be <U+017F>earched among<U+017F>t the reliques of the combu<U+017F>tion. They found the bodies of the three <hi>Eunuches</hi> which the flame had <U+017F>mothered, but <U+017F>o con<U+017F>umed as none of them retaining any form, they were taken for the corp<U+017F>es of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and her two daughters; <hi>Gen<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> he prepared a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tatly monument to be erected for them, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be put into coffins of <U+017F>ilver he al<U+017F>o gave orders they <U+017F>hould be very carefully guarden.</p>
               <p>In the mean <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> who feared that <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was not <U+017F>afe enough in the Town, he cau<U+017F>ed her to be carried unto a very fair hou<U+017F>e which he had in the Countrey, not far from Carthage. As <U+017F>oon as conveniently he could, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed <hi>Olimbres</hi> thither al<U+017F>o, under a pretence of diverting him: but as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Eudoxe</hi> <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed as <U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>wond, yet at la<U+017F>t reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and de<U+017F>iring to <U+017F>peak with him in private, <U+017F>he carried him into another chamber, leaving <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> with the young <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and <hi>Placidia.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was alone with <hi>Olimbres,</hi> <U+017F>he called into her memory all the <U+017F>ervices of <hi>Vr<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the thoughts of his death did <U+017F>o afflict her, that her teares, and her <U+017F>ighes would not of a long time let her tongue do its office. At la<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he could <U+017F>peak, well <hi>Olimbres</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) what do you think of my fortune? Am I not extreamly mi<U+017F>erable that whether I would or no, mu<U+017F>t live after the lo<U+017F>s of your freind? In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, her voice was lo<U+017F>t again, among<U+017F>t her <U+017F>ighes, and teares, and <hi>Olimbres</hi> beginning to <U+017F>peak, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, <U+017F>ince heaven has <U+017F>o ordained it, you are infinitly to be commended, for conforming your will unto it: and perhaps in recompence, it will one day deliver you from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that <U+017F>ad accident. Alas (replied <hi>Eudoxe</hi>) it will rather to puni<U+017F>h me: for know <hi>Olimbres,</hi> that let this memory bring me what mi<U+017F>eryes, and affliction it will, I had rather die then not pre<U+017F>erve it. But <U+017F>ince all my teares cannot call <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> backe, good <hi>Olimbres</hi> acquaint me with the particulars of your voyage, and I <U+017F>hall relate my misfortunes unto you. Madam (<U+017F>aid the Cavelier) Prince <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> has made me acquainted with mo<U+017F>t of your affaires: and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he told her of the la<U+017F>t freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, which he <U+017F>eemed to have done unto <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces,</hi> and afterwards told her how he was taken captive by <hi>Clorohalantes:</hi> then how the coun<U+017F>ell of <U+017F>ixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred had denied him poy<U+017F>on; how he was delivered and la<U+017F>tly how he came to Carthage, without any other trayn but a <U+017F>lave which he bought to be<U+017F>tow upon her. What <U+017F>oever it be (<U+017F>aid <hi>Eudoxe</hi>) that comes from the hand of <hi>Olimbres,</hi> I <U+017F>hall hold it in a mo<U+017F>t particular e<U+017F>teem: but if you will be<U+017F>tow him upon me it <U+017F>hall be upon a condition that I <U+017F>hall give him his liberty. Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>) I do not think that he would have it: upon this he went out to look for <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces,</hi> who was in <U+017F>uch impatience to her who had the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of his life, as his <U+017F>oul was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of all extraordinary motions; At la<U+017F>t, being <U+017F>welled with love, with fear, and with re<U+017F>pect, he was brought into the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> as <U+017F>oon as he entred into her chamber he ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at her feet; Then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e laying her hand upon his head, I do take you for mine (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) <U+017F>ince <hi>Olimbres</hi> will have it <U+017F>o, and will from hence forward take away the name of <U+017F>lave, and make you free. Upon this, <U+017F>he commanded him to ri<U+017F>e: Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi>) another would give you thanks for this favour; But truly I think no felicity comparable unto my <U+017F>ervitude: I told you (replied <hi>Olimbres</hi>) that he would not take the liberty which you would give him: In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and ob<U+017F>erved her to change collour: and indeed, at the voice of <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> all her blood came into her face, and <U+017F>tepping back to looke upon him, <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> ro<U+017F>e up: and <hi>Eudoxe</hi> in a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e.

               <p>
                  <hi>Olimbres</hi> continued <U+017F>ome dayes at Court, and had no other contentment but what he received from the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> and <hi>Placidia,</hi> whom he vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very often under the pretence of waiting upon the Prince a hunting; for the King grieved <U+017F>o extreamly at the memory of that Fatal fire, as he could not look upon any with a kind a<U+017F>pect. He is, as I told you before, of a nature barbarous enough, and yet he did much value his honour: <U+017F>o as knowing how this la<U+017F>t acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his would <U+017F>tain it, he grieved beyond mea<U+017F>ure, and did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to <U+017F>tifle the memory of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olimbres</hi> then <U+017F>eeing he could not be any more <U+017F>erviceable unto <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> he de<U+017F>igned to return unto <hi>Marcian,</hi> hoping the authority of that Emperour might procure the liberty of this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e: But <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> who had other thoughts, when <hi>Olimbres</hi> did communicate his intention to him, I would have you <U+017F>eem (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Olimbres</hi>) as if you did take your leave of the King, that you may <U+017F>o try his affection unto you; but I would not have you leave me, for I <U+017F>hall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy you in the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Eudoxe. Olimbres</hi> promi<U+017F>ing to obey all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he went unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> and mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>ought him for leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <U+017F>ince he had no <U+017F>ervice to command him there: a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him that he <U+017F>hould think him<U+017F>elf infinitly honoured in the continuance of his friend<U+017F>hip. The King, who loved this Cavalier well; and knew that the death of <hi>Placidia</hi> who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed unto him, had extreamly offended him; he re<U+017F>olved not to let him go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, and therefore de<U+017F>ired him, not to think of his departure for <U+017F>ome certain dayes, after which he <U+017F>hould be at liberty to do what he plea<U+017F>ed. <hi>Olimbres</hi> was contented to <U+017F>tay as long as the King commanded, and the King, communicating unto <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> his de<U+017F>ign unto <hi>Olimbres,</hi> he asked him what he <U+017F>hould do to oblige that Cavalier: The Prince propounded <U+017F>everal wayes, and was very glad to find the Kings affection beyond his hopes: He acquainted <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> with it, and told him, that if he could but comply hand<U+017F>omly with that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> unto what he would. <hi>Olimbres</hi> even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hed at this, be<U+017F>eeched him to negotiate <U+017F>o with the King, as to get him to go unto the hou<U+017F>e where <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was; and told him that the only expedient was to invite him unto a dinner in that place, which indeed was the fine<U+017F>t <U+017F>eat about all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage: <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> thought this no hard matter to do, and therefore making the propo<U+017F>ition unto the King, they appointed a day for it.</p>
               <p>In the interim the Cavalier acquainted <hi>Eudoxe</hi> with his re<U+017F>olution, and though <U+017F>he did find <U+017F>ome difficulty in it, yet <U+017F>he did approve on't, being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aces</hi> his love, of <hi>Thra<U+017F>imonds</hi> promi<U+017F>es, and <hi>Olimbres</hi> his fidelity.

'Tis true I am very <U+017F>orry that I have not given any te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that affection which I bear unto you; but till occa<U+017F>ions fall out that I may, I be<U+017F>eech you accept of my good intentions, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that I would do any thing which would be contentment unto you.

Amid<U+017F>t this common joy, I was not forgotten, for <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> at that very in<U+017F>tant <U+017F>ent for me; but I, who knew I was never to go out of pri<U+017F>on, until I went to execution, I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I had <U+017F>o prepared my <U+017F>elf for death, as I thought they only je<U+017F>ted with me: At la<U+017F>t my own eyes cleared me all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions: for being brought into the Kings pre<U+017F>ence<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> there I <U+017F>aw <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe</hi> at liberty, and received a pardon for my life.</p>

               <p>Upon this la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olution, he looked towards Mount-bri<U+017F>on, and lo<U+017F>ing all thoughts of returning to Lions, he prepared him<U+017F>elf for the woods and Forre<U+017F>ts which cover the mountain of I<U+017F>oures, and there <U+017F>eek <U+017F>ome contentment to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly humour. He did not know that <hi>Laonice</hi> was already retired thither; for doubtle<U+017F>s, had he had the lea<U+017F>t thought of that, he would never have wended that way; but fancying to find that <U+017F>olitude and liberty of life which he de<U+017F>ired, he re<U+017F>olved upon it: and without more di<U+017F>pute with him<U+017F>elf, he went to take up his lodging almo<U+017F>t upon the very top of all the mountain. There <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>omething nearer heaven, he conceived him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>omething nearer <hi>Cleon:</hi> and not imagining he could ever be diverted from that <U+017F>olitude which <U+017F>eemed already <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet and plea<U+017F>ing unto him, he re<U+017F>olved to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away in quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e that little time which he had to live. For the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd dayes he did nothing el<U+017F>e but contemplate upon <hi>Cleon,</hi> who was fre<U+017F>h in his memory; and having none to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his <U+017F>orrows unto, the rocks and the trees became the confidents of his <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; unto the one he related every particular accident that befell him, ever <U+017F>ince he fir<U+017F>t loved her; and upon the bark of the other he engraved the name of <hi>Cleon:</hi> but imagining, that without a grand crime he could not <U+017F>eparate that <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name; and the name of <hi>Tircis</hi> a<U+017F>under, he engraved it al<U+017F>o. Sometimes loadned with <U+017F>ome fruits which he had gathered, he would go unto a little rivolet, which falling down into the plain, does water <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant meadows, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards empties it <U+017F>elf into Lignon; and there contemplating upon the cataracts, and great falls of this water: This (<U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf) has a great re<U+017F>emblance unto my misfortune. Heaven would never let me take any re<U+017F>t, and if ever I hope for it, <U+017F>urely it will be when I am ready to enter into my grave, like to this little rivolet, which is never in quietne<U+017F>s until it has lo<U+017F>t it <U+017F>elf in Lignon, which is its grave.</p>
               <p>In <U+017F>uch kind of <U+017F>olitary entertainments he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away the day; after which he went unto his <U+017F>ad habitation, and never <U+017F>tirred from thence, until the Sun had dried up the tears of Aurora: he had met with a cave not much unlike that of <hi>Laonices,</hi> which was not far off; probably the<U+017F>e caves were made by other hands then tho<U+017F>e of Nature; and the Druides, in the infancy of Religion not being much conver<U+017F>ant among<U+017F>t men, made choice of the<U+017F>e retreats <U+017F>o near each other, as they might meet and confer about matters of Religion. It hapned, that the third day after <hi>Tircis</hi> came thither, that he began his cu<U+017F>tomary exerci<U+017F>e, and went out of his cave, as <U+017F>oon as the Sun had cleared the day; but not wending his cour<U+017F>e towards that little rivolet, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away almo<U+017F>t all the day in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the beauties of that place, which he had cho<U+017F>en for his la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>idence. On the one <U+017F>ide he viewed all the Forre<U+017F>ts, and <U+017F>aw as far as the farthe<U+017F>t part of the Sebu<U+017F>ians: and on the other <U+017F>ide, his pro<U+017F>pect reached as far as that <U+017F>tately city, which the Rho<U+017F>ne and the Arrar do wa<U+017F>h with their cry<U+017F>tal <U+017F>treams. Sometimes he admired the talne<U+017F>s of the trees, who<U+017F>e leavy branches did <U+017F>hade him from the <U+017F>corching heat of the Sun: Otherwhiles looking upon the ground, in which his eyes took deep root, he was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee it <U+017F>o clean and neat, and <U+017F>o even, that there was not <U+017F>o much as one <U+017F>hrub to hinder his walk. Being thus taken up in the<U+017F>e little ravi<U+017F>hments, he took no notice that night <U+017F>urprized him: So as being a good di<U+017F>tance from his cave, and not well knowing the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, the night al<U+017F>o growing dark, he could not hit the way unto his habitation. He laid him down therefore under the fir<U+017F>t tree he came unto, where it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>leep came upon him: yet at la<U+017F>t, after he had <U+017F>pent a good part of the

night in his ordinary contemplations, his wearied limbs received that plea<U+017F>ing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>hment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laonice</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who thought that help which the gods had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed unto her, long in coming, <U+017F>he wakened very early, to go according to her cu<U+017F>tome, and talk of her <U+017F>orrows unto the flowers and the winds: yet <U+017F>he walked not long before <U+017F>he found <U+017F>ome engravements upon the barks of trees, which being fre<U+017F>hly done, did ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves. She went pre<U+017F>ently unto them; and her thoughts being alwayes upon <hi>Tircis,</hi> as <hi>Tircis</hi> was upon <hi>Cleon,</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie, which opened her eyes and judgement, made her know that there they were both together. This did extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h her; and not being able to imagine what Demon it <U+017F>hould be that did her this ill office, <U+017F>he was more and more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: and to compleat her amazement, <U+017F>he perceived <hi>Tircis</hi> him<U+017F>elf lying all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long under an oak, <U+017F>ome ten or twelve paces from the place where <U+017F>he was. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid<U+017F>t her joyes to <U+017F>ee him, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>eized with an extream fear to appear before him; becau<U+017F>e at that in<U+017F>tant, all the contempts, <U+017F>lights, and rigours, of that Shepherd again<U+017F>t her, did come into her memory. Remembring then principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his la<U+017F>t words, as being the mo<U+017F>t bitter that ever his tongue uttered again<U+017F>t her: This Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elf) does mea<U+017F>ure his hatred according to my love, and takes delight in <U+017F>eeing both extream: he thinks he has bani<U+017F>hed me out of Forre<U+017F>ts, and perhaps would drive me out of the world, if he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee me again: I will not therefore <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elf unto him; but, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he upon a <U+017F>udden, why <U+017F>hould the gods promi<U+017F>e me a cure, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e that <hi>Tircis</hi> be the remedy?

Thus having ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed them, and lapped all tho<U+017F>e dear Letters in a bag which he called his trea<U+017F>ury, he ro<U+017F>e up, and walked up and down till night invited him unto his Cave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laonice</hi> did not <U+017F>pend the day <U+017F>o: for <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tir out of hers, lea<U+017F>t if <hi>Tircis</hi> <U+017F>hould, it would make him quit his habitation for ever; which he had cho<U+017F>en for the tranquility of his la<U+017F>t dayes: yet not being able to leave thinking upon him, <U+017F>he never le<U+017F>t contriving out <U+017F>ome way or other which might in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure allay that irreconcilable hatred which was in the <U+017F>oul of this <U+017F>hepherd towards her.

Her greate<U+017F>t fear was to meet him out of his cave: for no other place but it, could be favorable unto her de<U+017F>ign; And therefore as <U+017F>he went thither <U+017F>he looked about her very circum<U+017F>pectly on all <U+017F>ides to <U+017F>ee whither <U+017F>he could <U+017F>py him, and <U+017F>eeing nothing of him, <U+017F>he came in the mid<U+017F>t of the night unto the <U+017F>ame place where <U+017F>he had lodged him a little before: at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>tanding <U+017F>till at the mouth of the cave, <U+017F>he li<U+017F>tned with her ear to hear whether or no, he was a <U+017F>leep; with <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner a<U+017F><U+017F>ured off, but recommending her <U+017F>elf unto love, and to the god of <U+017F>leep and dreames, <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to name <hi>Tircis,</hi> three times: at that name, the <U+017F>hepherd half wakned, and fetching a deep <U+017F>igh he turned towards <hi>Laonice,</hi> who began to hope well, in her de<U+017F>ign; Know <hi>Tircis</hi> (continued <U+017F>he in the <U+017F>ame tone) that I do come from the gods to command thee, that thou cea<U+017F>e thy unju<U+017F>t hatred again<U+017F>t the beauty of <hi>Laonice</hi>: her love ought to be the <U+017F>ole object of all thy de<U+017F>ires upon paine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the wrath, and anger of that diety who commands it: and that thou maye<U+017F>t more clearly know, that this is the will of the <U+017F>upream powers, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that to morrow thou <U+017F>halt find this <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s near unto this place <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all thy rigours, as thou oughte<U+017F>t to repent of them. Faile not therefore to comply with her: never fear offending <hi>Cleon,</hi> <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf who brings this command unto thee. Upon this <hi>Laonice</hi> retired, and <hi>Tircis</hi> who at the name of <hi>Cleon</hi> began to open his eyes, he had <U+017F>o much time only as to <U+017F>ee her vani<U+017F>h: For at that in<U+017F>tant the Moon <U+017F>hined <U+017F>o clear into his Cell, that the <U+017F>hepherd not being able to endure the light, was con<U+017F>trained to turn the other way. He had confu<U+017F>edly heard what <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>aid, and retained the <U+017F>ence in his memory: but as if he were not well wakned, he fell a <U+017F>leep again after he had <U+017F>ighingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the name of <hi>Cleon</hi> twice. Which <hi>Laonice</hi> di<U+017F>tinctly heard for <U+017F>he had no <U+017F>ooner retired her <U+017F>elf out of the Cell, but <U+017F>he li<U+017F>tned with her ear at the mouth of the Cave to hear what <hi>Tircis</hi> <U+017F>aid; Being certain then that <U+017F>he was heard <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her <U+017F>elf to her own Cell, and re<U+017F>ted her <U+017F>elf as well as <U+017F>he could untill it was day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tircis</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide he got up very early: and having nothing more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent in his thoughts then the love he pre<U+017F>erved for the a<U+017F>hes of <hi>Cleon,</hi> it was not long before he fell to mu<U+017F>e upon the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in the night time; at the fir<U+017F>t, he fancied it only a dream: But then remembring what he had heard, he made not doubt but that was a Vi<U+017F>ion. Al<U+017F>o never thinking upon any <U+017F>uch fallacy as was put upon him; but infallibly beleiving that it was the gho<U+017F>t of <hi>Cleon</hi> which he <U+017F>aw. But deare<U+017F>t gho<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he with teares in his eyes) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon weary of my <U+017F>ighes and teares? is that inviolable pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

with <U+017F>uch holy purity, become <U+017F>o far trouble<U+017F>ome as to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e and anger thee? If in that felicity which thou do<U+017F>t enjoy; and whereof this great <U+017F>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour which waits upon thee even in the horrours of night, is a mo<U+017F>t undeniable proof unto me: If, I <U+017F>ay in that happy e<U+017F>tate it does grieve thee to <U+017F>ee that I can give but poor and weak te<U+017F>timonies of my love: Con<U+017F>ider, I be<U+017F>eech thee, dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Gho<U+017F>t, that in this the effects are far different from their cau<U+017F>e; and the<U+017F>e poor te<U+017F>timonies of my affection, do peri<U+017F>h almo<U+017F>t in their conceptions, yet my love which produceth them, will la<U+017F>t to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Upon this he was <U+017F>ilent for a while, and afterwards beginning again: But <hi>Cleon</hi> (continued he) who is plea<U+017F>ed to put thee upon things the mo<U+017F>t difficult, does command thee to love <hi>Laonice,</hi> knowing well thou mighte<U+017F>t as well attempt an impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility: If thou do<U+017F>t di<U+017F>obey her, though it be the fir<U+017F>t fault thou did<U+017F>t e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commit again<U+017F>t her, it is a crime no le<U+017F><U+017F>e puni<U+017F>hable, then if it were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again<U+017F>t a Diety. And if thou do<U+017F>t obey her, who will di<U+017F>pence with thee for all the vowes and oathes which thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>o often <U+017F>worn, never to have any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto any but only her? Doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf (<U+017F>aid he) for as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much power to make me <U+017F>wear them, <U+017F>o has <U+017F>he the power to make me break them, after <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>olute command. Ah deare<U+017F>t <hi>Cleon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him<U+017F>elf) how intollerable is this la<U+017F>t rigour which thou do<U+017F>t inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? It were far more ju<U+017F>t to command me to die, then to live with <hi>Laonice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, he went out of his cave, not to go and <U+017F>eek for this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, but only to divert him<U+017F>elf, and to <U+017F>ee which way he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him<U+017F>elf to do as he thought <hi>Cleon</hi> had commanded him. But as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that now <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>hould have no room in his thoughts there was not one te<U+017F>timony of love which ever <U+017F>he had given him, but it came into his remembrance. And this wrought more effect upon his <U+017F>oul, when he con<U+017F>idered that <U+017F>he continued her love, notwith<U+017F>tanding all his hatred and di<U+017F>dain. After this, <U+017F>he being very fair, the remembrance of the features in her face <U+017F>eemed to in<U+017F>pire him with pity; and as often as he thought upon tho<U+017F>e cruelties wherewith he requited her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was moved unto a kind of repentance: the only thing which did mo<U+017F>t of all retain his anger, was the memory of that revenge which <U+017F>he took upon <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> thinking <U+017F>uch premeditated wickedne<U+017F>s, and carryed with <U+017F>o much art, did argue a trayterous and malitious <U+017F>pirit. But as if he would not condemn her without a hearing: yet (<U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf) revenge is <U+017F>weet in what mind <U+017F>oever it be; and how is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a weak woman <U+017F>hould defend her <U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t it, <U+017F>ince the greate<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons which our Hi<U+017F>tories mention, found more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the motions of this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, then to conquer Kingdomes? It were unreasonable to think that <hi>Laonice</hi> had not her imperfections, as well as other mortals; and perhaps this was it which made <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>ay lately unto me, that were he at lea<U+017F>ure, he would make me confe<U+017F>s that Shepherde<U+017F>s was not <U+017F>o much to blame as I imagined: Doubtle<U+017F>s he would have told me, that her re<U+017F>entment was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to me, and that I was obliged to her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had made it appear, that in lo<U+017F>ing me, <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t the only thing that could force her to commit a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. He would have repre<U+017F>ented unto me, that <U+017F>he had imitated tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>perate per<U+017F>ons, who not knowing how to regain that which death or Fortune had taken from them, they would be revenged upon the gods, and break down tho<U+017F>e Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which before they had erected unto their honour.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch, or <U+017F>uch like di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, <hi>Tircis</hi> entertained him<U+017F>elf: Sometimes condemning the <U+017F>ubtilties of <hi>Laonice,</hi> and otherwhiles excu<U+017F>ing them; and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times condemning him<U+017F>elf for being the principal Authour of the evil which <U+017F>he had done; but as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Cleon</hi> came into his thoughts, the memory of her tran<U+017F>ported him, and kept him from thinking upon any thing el<U+017F>e a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this Combate of thoughts he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away almo<U+017F>t all the day, and <U+017F>tirred not from his cave, but only to drink at the little rivolet, which relieved him in that nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. But <hi>Laonice,</hi> <U+017F>eeing the day almo<U+017F>t gone before <U+017F>he heard any news of <hi>Tircis,</hi> <U+017F>he began to fear that her devi<U+017F>e was di<U+017F>covered: yet <U+017F>he waited <U+017F>till at the entrance into the wood, where the trees gave a more delectable <U+017F>hade then in any other place; and <U+017F>uch was her impatience, that at every bla<U+017F>t which
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53528:202"/>
moved the trees, <U+017F>he looked about, imagining it to be <hi>Tircis.</hi> At la<U+017F>t, having thus <U+017F>pent the day in <U+017F>uch inquietudes as are u<U+017F>ual unto one that loves perfectly, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to counterfeit a Gho<U+017F>t the <U+017F>econd time, with an oath never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her <U+017F>elf again, in ca<U+017F>e her plot took no better succe<U+017F>s then it had before. Then (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elf) will I intent this Barbarian eternally. I will never let him take a minutes re<U+017F>t: I will kindle a flame at the fire of my love, which a thou<U+017F>and times wor<U+017F>e then that of the Furies, <U+017F>hall <U+017F>corch him without intermi<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without conforming him. In this de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>he prepared her <U+017F>elf to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where <hi>Tircis</hi> was, about the <U+017F>ame time of night <U+017F>he did before; but fearing the Shepherd <U+017F>hould be awake, in hopes to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cleon</hi> the <U+017F>econd time, <U+017F>he thought it better to go thither a little before day. So <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away mo<U+017F>t part of the night under tho<U+017F>e trees, and when <U+017F>he thought it time, <U+017F>he went to execute what <U+017F>he had propo<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he came to the caves mouth, <U+017F>he li<U+017F>tned with her ear as <U+017F>he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and when <U+017F>he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that <hi>Tircis</hi> was a<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>he entered in with as little noi<U+017F>e as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could make: the fir<U+017F>t thing <U+017F>he did was to cal him by his name, knowing very well, that naturally every one has a greater di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to hearken unto his own name, then to any other word; and indeed, the Shepherd upon the in<U+017F>tant of naming him, did give <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timonies that he was not fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep: and therefore <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him: <hi>Tircis,</hi> thy di<U+017F>obedience hath offended the gods and <hi>Cleon,</hi> and the rigour of <hi>Laonice</hi> unto thee <U+017F>hall be the puni<U+017F>hment of thy crime; unle<U+017F><U+017F>e thou woulde<U+017F>t have her <U+017F>pirit become inexorable unto thee, prepare thy <U+017F>elf to repair that fault this day, which thou did<U+017F>t commit ye<U+017F>terday: and once again con<U+017F>ider, that it is <hi>Cleon</hi> which commands it, and thou mu<U+017F>t never expect any favour from her, if thou do<U+017F>t not obey me.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <U+017F>he went out again; and hearkning at the door, <U+017F>he heard <hi>Tircis</hi> fetch a deep <U+017F>igh, and afterwards rai<U+017F>ing his voice: Alas, my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Cleon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) why do<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon fly out of the pre<U+017F>ence of him, who once was half thy life? or why do<U+017F>t thou now impo<U+017F>e that upon me, which thou did<U+017F>t abhor? Good gods! Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible there <U+017F>hould be any alteration? Can you be guilty of that common fault in men? Then he held his peace, and <hi>Laonice,</hi> who thought <U+017F>he had now <U+017F>aid enough, <U+017F>he was now ready to return, but upon a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>ay; Well <hi>Cleon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) I will follow thy councel, and obey thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and <U+017F>ince the gods have in<U+017F>pired thee with <U+017F>ome pity upon <hi>Laonice,</hi> it is not ju<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of her mi<U+017F>eries then thou art. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he began again to <U+017F>igh, and the Shepherde<U+017F>s being all joy to hear it, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>tay to hear any more; but going <U+017F>ome two or three hundred paces off, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to give him all opportunities, to render reall obedience unto the faigned command which <U+017F>he had impo<U+017F>ed upon him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Tircis</hi> could not <U+017F>leep any more, but thinking upon the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of <hi>Laonices</hi> body and mind, and now having no more aver<U+017F>ion to make him abominate all <U+017F>he did, he began to think that the time he <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away with her, would be <U+017F>omething more plea<U+017F>ing unto him then that which he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pend in the <U+017F>olitude which he had cho<U+017F>en. In order hereunto, he got up as <U+017F>oon as day dawned; and not being able to imagine where he <U+017F>hould meet with this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s: but why <U+017F>hould I trouble my <U+017F>elf about it? (<U+017F>aid he upon a <U+017F>udden) the <U+017F>ame gods who commanded me to love her, will doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e give me the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to <U+017F>ee her.</p>
               <p>Upon this he went out, and not knowing which way to wend his cour<U+017F>e, he followed the fir<U+017F>t path his foot fell into. <hi>Laonice,</hi> who was within ken, was not long before <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him appear; and going into his path, <U+017F>he <U+017F>at down, and when he was within hearing the began to <U+017F>ing. At this voice <hi>Tircis</hi> <U+017F>tood amazed; and admiring the providence of the gods, in the conduct of this affection, he <U+017F>tole from tree to tree, till he came ju<U+017F>t unto the place where <U+017F>he was, as <U+017F>he had ended her <U+017F>ong: He pre<U+017F>ently fell down upon his knees; and the Shepherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>eeming to be extreamly afraid, <U+017F>he got up, and would have fled away: But <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> catching hold of her: Fair <hi>Laonice</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) as <hi>Cleon</hi> was formerly the cau<U+017F>e of that little e<U+017F>teem which I did <U+017F>et upon your beauty: <U+017F>o <U+017F>he is now the cau<U+017F>e of

that love which I come to offer unto you, and doubly happy <U+017F>hall I be, if I can but find a favourable reception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>eeming <U+017F>till to wonder at all this; cruel man (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) are you not yet weary with tormenting me? how came you hither to per<U+017F>ecute me, in a place which I had cho<U+017F>en as a remedy again<U+017F>t your cruelty? If you be the <U+017F>ame <hi>Tircis</hi> who has <U+017F>o often and <U+017F>o cruelly tortured me, what moves you to come now and flatter me with fair promi<U+017F>es of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which you have <U+017F>o often put me out of all hopes ere to obtain? And if you be but only his Gho<U+017F>t, then tell me, what makes thee for<U+017F>ake the <U+017F>oul of that <hi>Cleon,</hi> who<U+017F>e a<U+017F>hes you have <U+017F>o long Idoliz'd? I am really the <U+017F>ame <hi>Tircis,</hi> replied the Shepherd, who not being able to cea<U+017F>e loving that fair one, would rather have died then changed; but <U+017F>ince I have the command of <hi>Cleon</hi> for it, no other upon earth but only <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onice,</hi> is to have the glory of po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing me. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he offered to take her hand, and the Shepherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>tepping back, as not daring to touch him: Stay <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) I am yet in a doubt, whether what I <U+017F>ee be real, or only an illu<U+017F>ion; either let me recollect my <U+017F>pirits, or you will affright me to death. Ah <hi>Laonice,</hi> replied <hi>Tircis,</hi> could we as ea<U+017F>ily believe miracles as the gods can do them, you would <U+017F>oon cea<U+017F>e your wonder. Indeed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Laonice</hi> and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) to <U+017F>ee <hi>Tircis</hi> upon his knees before <hi>Laonice,</hi> and to hear him talk of any love to her, are two no <U+017F>mall miracles; and yet (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis</hi>) it is not more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I live, then it is that I love you. I do equally make a doubt of both (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Laonice</hi>) and that which troubles me, is to know what proofs I ought to ask of what you <U+017F>ay. Proofs mo<U+017F>t infallible (replied the Shepherd) which is my hearty repentance of the rigours which formerly I have returned you for the good will you had unto me, and an inviolable vow never to be any ones but yours: Upon this, he <U+017F>uddenly took her hand, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it: and <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>miling, now (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I know that you have a body and are no illu<U+017F>ion; but I will think, that certainly there is <U+017F>ome delu<U+017F>ion in this, unle<U+017F>s you further acquaint me with your intention: My intention (an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd) is <U+017F>utable to my words, and if the affection which I offer unto you, do merit a kind of reception which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire, then I do conjure you, for my <U+017F>ake, to quit the<U+017F>e de<U+017F>arts, which are places more proper for Bears and Tigers, then <U+017F>uch beauties as yours: and let us both go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto Mountverdune, where you <U+017F>hall receive from me the la<U+017F>t te<U+017F>timony of my <U+017F>incere affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laonice,</hi> who asked no more, yet was at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>omething <U+017F>hie in the matter, did ac la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ent unto the de<U+017F>ires of <hi>Tircis:</hi> As they went on the way, <hi>Tircis</hi> asked by what Fate it was, that they both met <U+017F>o hapyily in that Forre<U+017F>t, and <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>hewed unto him the Oracle which <U+017F>he had received. Afterwards <hi>Tircis</hi> told her with abundance of innoceney, all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Gho<U+017F>t which appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: at which <hi>Laonice</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile, to <U+017F>ee what happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s her artifice had effected, which the Shepherd attributing unto her joyes to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s him, he never had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of her cunning: At la<U+017F>t being come unto a Temple, <hi>Tircis</hi> de<U+017F>ired <hi>Laonice</hi> to give her con<U+017F>ent, that a Druide might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them; which <U+017F>he con<U+017F>enting unto, the marriage was pre<U+017F>ently after <U+017F>olem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized: and then they went down together into the plain, to tell the news of their unlookt for marriage unto the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e accidents hapned unto <hi>Tircis,</hi> whil<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of Lignon were in extream di<U+017F>order, by rea<U+017F>on of the intere<U+017F>t which every one had in the per<U+017F>ons of <hi>Celadon, A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi>; but above all, <hi>Licidas</hi> <U+017F>eemed mo<U+017F>t worthy of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by rea<U+017F>on of that fury which the death of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed in him: And indeed, all the way as they went, <hi>Adamas</hi> did not interpo<U+017F>e one word unto the complaints of that Shepherd, for he found them all <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, as he could not condemn him for it. But as <U+017F>oon as all the company was come unto his hou<U+017F>e, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana, Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> were laid in tho<U+017F>e chambers which the Druide had appointed for them: <hi>Belinde</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>till kept the one with <hi>Diana,</hi> and the other with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> they ob<U+017F>erved that by little and little they opened their eyes, and by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ighs which they <U+017F>ent forth

<U+017F>eemed to be yet in life. <hi>Phillis</hi> ran as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>hee could to acquaint <hi>Adamas</hi>; who very glad of this newes, went immediately unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> to <U+017F>ee whether any <U+017F>ignes of life were in her: But hee found both him and <hi>Silvander</hi> al<U+017F>o, in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate they were at the Fountain: But though hee <U+017F>aw no hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, yet hee and <hi>Lycidas</hi> undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Celadon,</hi> whil<U+017F>t <hi>Thamiris</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> got <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> into bed. And when they were both in bed, the Druid laid his hand to the heart of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and found that <U+017F>till there remained <U+017F>ome heat. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <U+017F>hee was only in a <U+017F>wound, but <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>wound as by force of the Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was much longer and more violent then ordinary. This did <U+017F>o over-joy him, that he went immediately unto his Clo<U+017F><U+017F>et for <U+017F>uch remedies as he thought more proper to fetch life again; and indeed they had <U+017F>uch good operation, as in le<U+017F><U+017F>e then a quarter of an hour, they both revived out of that Lethargy into which they were fallen. <hi>Lycidas</hi> no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw his brother alive, but repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him<U+017F>elf of all his furious impieties which hee had uttered, hee kneeled down at the beds feet, and lifting up his eyes: Oh yee great Gods (<U+017F>aid hee) who by a great Providence unknown unto us, do govern all things, I render unto you mo<U+017F>t hearty thanks, for the favour you have done me in, in re<U+017F>toring <hi>Celadon.</hi> Oh yee pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Divinities, again<U+017F>t whom my Fury did belch out Bla<U+017F>phemies: I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the horridne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my Crime, and beg your Pardon. Upon this hee ro<U+017F>e up; all joyed to <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon</hi> not dead.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, the <U+017F>hepherd no <U+017F>ooner opened his eyes, but hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the danger unto which hee had expo<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf: and thinking to finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf lying upon the ground full of wounds and all bloudy, hee was amazed when hee <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf in a delicate bed; where there was not Lions nor Unicornes, but in lieu of them, <hi>Adamas</hi> and his brethren <U+017F>tanding by him. The accident which hapned unto him in <hi>Galatheas</hi> Chamber after they had taken him out of the water, ame pre<U+017F>ently into his mind: yet not being able to imagine how he came to be re<U+017F>cued from the clawes of the Lions, which hee thought would have torn him in a thou<U+017F>and pieces, he ca<U+017F>t his langui<U+017F>hing eyes upon the Druid, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one arme out of bed, hee took his hand and <U+017F>poke not a word, as doubting whether the objects hee had <U+017F>een were reall or only imaginary: And therefore the Druid leaning over the bed, <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid hee unto him, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his cheek) the Gods have been kinde unto us, and prevented the ill de<U+017F>ignes which you had again<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elfe: you are <U+017F>till alive, my Son, maugre all your attempts to dye; and <U+017F>ince there is a kinde of <U+017F>trange Fatality which will not let us lo<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, I do hope it will prove both unto your contentment and minde: Father, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon</hi> then in a weak and langui<U+017F>hing tone) I am afraid, that the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject from whence you draw <U+017F>ome hopes of contentment, will cau<U+017F>e in mee a more violent de<U+017F>pair then ever yet I re<U+017F>ented: For if this part of life which remaines to mee mu<U+017F>t be imployed to mourne for the death of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom I <U+017F>aw with mee in the <U+017F>ame danger, and who (doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e) has received from the Lions that injury which they refu<U+017F>ed mee: believe it Father, every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute that I live will be a torture to mee ten thou<U+017F>and times wor<U+017F>e then death. Upon this <hi>Lycidas</hi> took him about the neck, and embracing him with a million of carre<U+017F><U+017F>es; No no, dear Brother (<U+017F>aid hee unto him) <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is as well as you are, I heard <hi>Phillis</hi> tell the Druid as much. Oh good God (cryed out <hi>Celadon</hi>) in this you have <U+017F>hewed your Ju<U+017F>tice: But Father (<U+017F>aid hee to <hi>Adamas</hi>) may I believe what <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>aies? You may (an<U+017F>wered the Druid) for all this is but an effect of the great enchantment; and the Lions and Unicornes are turned into <U+017F>tatues of Marble, <U+017F>till keeping their form and colour: Moreover, the <U+017F>ame things that have hapned unto you, are hapned unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Silvander.</hi> How? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon</hi>) is not <hi>Silvander</hi> dead? No (<U+017F>aid the Druid). In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, hee drew the curtain a little, and let him <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>hepherd whom <hi>Thamiris</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> were comforting as well as they could: For not knowing the true cau<U+017F>e which induced him to look for a death, they thought that his <U+017F>orrowes, to live <U+017F>o ignorant of him<U+017F>elf, did make him de<U+017F>ire to die: and therefore they u<U+017F>ed all the be<U+017F>t arguments they could to per<U+017F>wade with him: They told him that his misfortune of being ignorant of him<U+017F>elf, ought not to trouble him, <U+017F>ince
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53528:204"/>
the door of heaven was open unto all well qualified men alike; That his merits had gotten him the effectionate hearts of <U+017F>o many <U+017F>hepherds, as would at all times <U+017F>upply his nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities, and make him live as well as them<U+017F>elves. In fine, they gave him the be<U+017F>t language and comfort they could; but not touching the right <U+017F>tring, nor hitting right upon his maladie, their mu<U+017F>ick did but jarre in his ears, &amp; did not work upon his humour, nor could they get any an<U+017F>wers from him, but <U+017F>uch as made them think that his <U+017F>orrowes being <U+017F>o extreame, they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e unknown to them. They left him therefore in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For the Druid, at the in<U+017F>tance of <hi>Celadon,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired no other witne<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es but <hi>Lycidas,</hi> did draw them out of the room. As <U+017F>oon as they were gone, <hi>Silvander</hi> went into <hi>Celadons</hi> bed; who having received him, Shepherd (<U+017F>aid he unto him) I have no rea<U+017F>on to wi<U+017F>h you well. Why? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon</hi>) Becau<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi>) you did divert mee from my de<U+017F>igne of precipitating my <U+017F>elfe; for had it not been better for you to have been a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my death, then of the continuation of my mi<U+017F>eries? But <U+017F>ee now, unto what a <U+017F>ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am reduced, <U+017F>ince I can no longer avoid the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> the envie unto one, and the change of the other, will be double death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee. I cannot repent of what I did (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon</hi>) for it is my glory to have contributed any thing unto the pre<U+017F>ervation of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hepherd as you are; but I am very <U+017F>orry that you have made your <U+017F>elf a companion of my Fortune, <U+017F>ince you are the only cau<U+017F>e of my not dying in this adventure: and the Gods would not have let mee live, but onely to puni<U+017F>h mee for <U+017F>uffering you to hazzard your life in <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion wherein no other Lover but my <U+017F>elf ought to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed. That is a <U+017F>ecret (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi>) known onely to Tautates: But <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to let the<U+017F>e deep mi<U+017F>eries alone, pray tell mee if you know any thing of <hi>Diana?</hi> I had not <U+017F>o much lea<U+017F>ure (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon</hi>) as to enquire, but I heard that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was <U+017F>till alive: yet <hi>Lycidas</hi> perhaps can <U+017F>atisfie you. Upon this hee called him; and <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>itting down at the beds feet, related what <hi>Phillis</hi> told unto the Druid: which joyed <hi>Silvander</hi> a little; but upon a <U+017F>udden, fetching a deep <U+017F>igh, Alas, alas replied hee, <hi>Paris</hi> is doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e now with her <U+017F>wimming in carre<U+017F><U+017F>es of Love. No, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas, Paris</hi> is very bu<U+017F>ie in giving the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of the hou<U+017F>e; and though the accident which hapned unto <hi>Diana</hi> did not a little trouble him, yet hee was con<U+017F>trained to that civility by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Adamas,</hi> who would needs have him entertaine <hi>Galathea, Ro<U+017F>anira, Daphnide, Medonthe,</hi> and other Nymphes which came from Marcelles. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> upon this asked his brother, how long it was <U+017F>ince they came? to whom <hi>Lycidas</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that they came in the morning, and were all trimmed in the habit of <U+017F>heperde<U+017F><U+017F>es, purpo<U+017F>ely to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the time more plea<U+017F>antly. At this, <hi>Silvander</hi> began to <U+017F>igh; but <hi>Lycidas</hi> even ravi<U+017F>hed with joy to <U+017F>ee his brother, hee could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh. <hi>Celadon</hi> asked him the cau<U+017F>e of his laughing. I laugh, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas,</hi> to <U+017F>ee <hi>Silvander</hi> jealous, and to <U+017F>ee how that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion does produce the <U+017F>ame effects in him, which it did in mee when hee made it his <U+017F>port to vexe mee in that angry mood: and certainly to heare him talk, would make one believe that <hi>Diana</hi> has had two or three children by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> when God knowes, that not <U+017F>o much as a promi<U+017F>e of marriage has pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who thought that <hi>Lycidas</hi> only mocked, hee changed neither face nor humour; but, on the contrary, <U+017F>eemed more troubled then before.</p>
               <p>Alas <U+017F>hepherd, <U+017F>aid hee unto him, have you no more compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion ten to rub upon my <U+017F>ore<U+017F>t wound? What great offence have I committed again<U+017F>t you, that can de<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o cruel a revenge? I prote<U+017F>t, replied <hi>Lycidas,</hi> I have no thoughts of any revenge upon you: But if you could as easily hinder <hi>Paris</hi> from marrying <hi>Diana,</hi> as it is certain they are not yet married, you would quickly put an end to all your mi<U+017F>eries. <hi>Silvander</hi> then <U+017F>eeming to be extreamly glad of the newes; The Gods (<U+017F>aid hee) are my Friends: For had I dyed, I had di<U+017F>obeyed <hi>Diana,</hi> who did ab<U+017F>olutely forbid mee dying, untill I hear her marriage was con<U+017F>umma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

I had no other a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urance of it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi>) but the report of a boy which looks to my

Flock, and told mee of it with <U+017F>o much innocent <U+017F>implicity, as I could not <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of it. The <U+017F>ame encounter is hapned unto you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> that happens unto many others, when reports do pa<U+017F><U+017F>e through many mouthes<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>, for every one addes a little, and the la<U+017F>t will <U+017F>weare they <U+017F>aw that which neither is, nor ever was.

               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner uttered the<U+017F>e few words, but hee looked upon <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Shepherd (<U+017F>aid hee unto him) why <U+017F>hould wee thus <U+017F>lugg away the time in bed? there is nothing that hinders us from ri<U+017F>ing. True, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon</hi>; Though <hi>Adamas</hi> will not let us <U+017F>tirre from hence, yet wee may walk up and down the Room. Upon this, <hi>Silvander</hi> took his cloaths, and whil<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon</hi> was <U+017F>eeking for his, hee had almo<U+017F>t dre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe: But neither <hi>Celadon</hi> nor <hi>Lycidas</hi> could finde his cloaths; for the Druid, who as hee went out, had carried away the cloaths of <hi>Alexis,</hi> hee had forgot to put <hi>Celadons</hi> in lieu of them: <U+017F>o, as being forced to keep his bed, <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>ate down by him: And falling into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning the Inchantment, <hi>Lycidas</hi> related unto them all that hee had <U+017F>een.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> went to <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and that <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw him near her bed, but looking upon him with <U+017F>uch: an eye as plainly te<U+017F>tified the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment wherein <U+017F>hee was; Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee unto him, how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould now <U+017F>ee mee in this bed, and nor rather in my coffin? and by what misfortune am I <U+017F>evered from <hi>Alexis?</hi> To this, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Druid, I cannot an<U+017F>wer; for I know nothing of the accidents: But if the Gods <U+017F>hould never let you <U+017F>ee her again, I <U+017F>hould think them ju<U+017F>t in it, <U+017F>ince you have already treated her with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>dain, as they may think they are kinde unto you in it. But Father, replied the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, would you have mee pardon the offence which I have received from her di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e? You have told mee <U+017F>o much of her innocence, that I do con<U+017F>ent to love him no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I did: and <U+017F>ince they know that I am not now angry again<U+017F>t her, nor can live without her, why do they not re<U+017F>tore her unto mee?</p>
               <p>When I told you of her innocence, replied the Druid, I told you but what I thought obliged mee not to conceale, knowing her di<U+017F>cretion <U+017F>o well; and you have not known <U+017F>ince, that I <U+017F>aid nothing but truth. Since the Unicornes were <U+017F>een by you, and it is a mo<U+017F>t infallible truth, that tho<U+017F>e Animals never come near a woman who is in the lea<U+017F>t blemi<U+017F>hed in her Cha<U+017F>tity. But the greater the innocency of <hi>Alexis</hi> is, the greater is your crime; and therefore I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that the Gods do intend to puni<U+017F>h you for it, and will never <U+017F>uffer you to enjoy a per<U+017F>on whom you have without any rea<U+017F>on twice bani<U+017F>hed from your pre<U+017F>ence. I perceive Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> faintly, that <hi>Alexis</hi> is dead, and that the Gods are ju<U+017F>t in puni<U+017F>hing mee <U+017F>o. But they will not be ju<U+017F>t, if they let mee live, or at lea<U+017F>t will not <U+017F>uffer mee, after I have been puni<U+017F>hed for the unju<U+017F>t an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I conceived again<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon,</hi> to be recompenced for the Love which I pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for him in the mid<U+017F>t of our greate<U+017F>t misfortunes. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, her eyes gu<U+017F>hed out with Tears: And <hi>Adamas</hi> having compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon her, Daughter, <U+017F>aid hee do not thus immoderately afflict your <U+017F>elf, until you hear more particulars of the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Alexis</hi>: my cares of bringing you hither, were a cau<U+017F>e of my not knowing what was hapned unto her: but if you will promi<U+017F>e to <U+017F>tay untill I returne with patience, I will promi<U+017F>e to bring you a faithfull relation. Father, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> though the condition wherein I <U+017F>aw her, makes mee more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of her death, yet <U+017F>ince you command it, I will <U+017F>tay till you return, that you may afterwards think my de<U+017F>ign of following her the more ju<U+017F>t: But, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (continued <U+017F>hee) even for pities <U+017F>ake, do not <U+017F>latter mee, in thinking to comfort mee, you will make mee the more de<U+017F>perate. <hi>Adamas</hi> did promi<U+017F>e to do what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hee de<U+017F>ired, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Bellinde</hi> in talk with <hi>Diana,</hi> hee would

Afterwards going unto <hi>Celadon</hi>; How comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid hee unto him) that you are not up as well as <hi>Silvander?</hi> Is not your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then <hi>Adamas</hi> remembring that hee had locked them up, hee went and brought tho<U+017F>e that hee was wont to wear before his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ement; and giving them unto him, Here <U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid hee unto him, may you be happy in that habit, and enjoy her whom you love be<U+017F>t. <hi>Celadon</hi> did take them with a thou<U+017F>and thanks for his good wi<U+017F>hes, and as <U+017F>oon as hee began to ca<U+017F>t his eies upon them, <U+017F>o many thoughts came into his minde, that hee could not chu<U+017F>e but fetch a deep <U+017F>igh: which the Druid ob<U+017F>erving, How now <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid hee)? had you rather continue in your di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, then a<U+017F><U+017F>ume this habit? I cannot tell Father, (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepherd faintly) which of the two make me the more happy: For under the habit of <hi>Alexis, A<U+017F>trea</hi> commanded mee to die, and under that of <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hee bani<U+017F>hed mee her pre<U+017F>ence. <hi>Adamas,</hi> who <U+017F>aw that the memory of the<U+017F>e things did trouble him, and having no minde to talk any more of them, but withdrawing a little, to give him the more time to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e him, <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid hee) do not di<U+017F>pute upon the choi<U+017F>e any longer, but weare this that I have brought unto you; and if you will referre all the re<U+017F>t unto mee, I will finde out a way to make you happy. Upon this, <hi>Celadon</hi> dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf; and when hee was ready, <hi>Adamas</hi> embraced him: Then <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> did the <U+017F>ame with <U+017F>o many tears and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Love, as it was ea<U+017F>ie to judge, that the affection which tyed them together, proceeded from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cau<U+017F>es than con<U+017F>anguinity. <hi>Silvander</hi> was extreamly joyed to <U+017F>ee it; and as hand<U+017F>ome as hee had appeared under the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e of a Druides daughter, hee appeared much hand<U+017F>omer in the habit of a <U+017F>hepherd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> took him by the hand, and carrying him out of the chamber, Sonne (<U+017F>aid hee unto him) you mu<U+017F>t know, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> does infinitely de<U+017F>ire to know what is become of you, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch welcom newes will be be<U+017F>t from your own mouth, I think it mo<U+017F>t fit you <U+017F>hould carry it your <U+017F>elfe. At this <hi>Celadon</hi> changed colour: But Father (<U+017F>aid hee) <U+017F>hee has commanded mee to die, and though I did endeavour to obey her, yet it is to be feared <U+017F>hee will not take my endeavour for good payment. Never let that trouble you, (replied the Druid) I have <U+017F>o well prepared her minde in your ab<U+017F>ence, as <U+017F>hee is re<U+017F>olved never to give you any more cau<U+017F>e of di<U+017F>content. If you do love her, you mu<U+017F>t not refu<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee her; for all the hopes <U+017F>hee has, is now only that you are alive. In <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o, hee entreated <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> to accompany them unto her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: <hi>Celadon</hi> did tremble at every <U+017F>tep, till hee came to the beds <U+017F>ide of that <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and then began to <U+017F>igh, and was not able to <U+017F>peak one word. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi> did mildly ca<U+017F>t her eyes upon the Druid, and <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o <U+017F>ilent, did think at fir<U+017F>t that hee brought her bad newes: Ah Father (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee) your <U+017F>ilence does <U+017F>peak my ill fortune.

Then <hi>Adamas</hi> looking upon her with a <U+017F>eeming <U+017F>ad eye, Daughter (<U+017F>aid hee) I <U+017F>hould never be the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad newes, but that I am forced unto it. Upon this, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> began to tremble: Good Father (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee) hold mee no longer in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, <U+017F>peak plainly, and relate unto mee all the accidents that have hapned unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>: as <U+017F>hee <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <U+017F>hee <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly afflicted, as if <U+017F>hee had not a minute to live.

               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Adamas, Galathea, Ro<U+017F>anira, Celadon,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, were gone into a walk upon the left hand, which led them in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly into a little wood, which the Druide had inclo<U+017F>ed within the pale of his garden: But they were no <U+017F>ooner entred into it, then they heard a voice which made a mo<U+017F>t lamentable noi<U+017F>e. <hi>Adamas,</hi> who never heard the like, he was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know what it was; and remembring how <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was carryed away in the time of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> his Rebellion, he was afraid, that <U+017F>ome Shepherde<U+017F>s was menaced with the like accident: therefore he ran unto the place, from whence he thought this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noi<U+017F>e came; and he was no <U+017F>ooner come unto it, with <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira, Galathea,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t who followed him, but they perceived that it was man <U+017F>triving and <U+017F>truggling in the arms of <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is.</hi>

               <p>This <U+017F>ight did extreamly <U+017F>urprize them; and the more, when the man doubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cries, and <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>till <U+017F>triving with him till he was ill in a <U+017F>weat, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have <U+017F>ome ill de<U+017F>igns one again<U+017F>t the other; and <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is,</hi> being the <U+017F>tronger, had <U+017F>urmounted the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his enemy.

I <U+017F>hall offend your ears and patience.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to tell you then, that the affection which I te<U+017F>tified unto the <U+017F>age <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> during her captivity unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> did purcha<U+017F>e me <U+017F>o great a <U+017F>hare in the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> as we may all <U+017F>ay, that ever <U+017F>ince we have been all one and the <U+017F>ame. This was the rea<U+017F>on, that when they departed, I be<U+017F>eeched the King to let me got with them; and their de<U+017F>ign was, to prefer me unto <hi>Marcian,</hi> as conceiving that <U+017F>age Emperour would love me when he once knew me; but <hi>Gin<U+017F>erick,</hi> who perhaps doubted or feared, that the remembrance of my impri<U+017F>onment would beget <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>entmeats in me again<U+017F>t him, he would not upon any terms give me leave. But on the contrary, thinking that honours and riches were the mo<U+017F>t powerful charms that he could u<U+017F>e to keep me about his per<U+017F>on, he began to put me upon imployments which were very trouble<U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, <U+017F>ince they diverted me from my <U+017F>tudies; but yet very honourable they were, <U+017F>ince they were the greate<U+017F>t offices in all his Dominions. A corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency betwixt <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces, Olimbres,</hi> and me, did not yet die, notwith<U+017F>tanding the Rigour of this <U+017F>eparation; but as if ab<U+017F>ence were a means to link us in affection the more firmly; it did encrea<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t us at that di<U+017F>tance. We were exceedingly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and careful in <U+017F>ending unto each other; and as I gave them an accompt of all my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e and negotiations, <U+017F>o I believe, they did participate unto me their mo<U+017F>t intimate thoughts. Thus I heard of their return unto <hi>Marcian</hi>; the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>es wherewith that Emperour did <U+017F>olemnize their marriage, and in fine, the greate<U+017F>t part of that which I <U+017F>hall tell you in the Sequel of this di<U+017F>cou<U+017F>re.

Judge, I be<U+017F>eech you, how nearly his death did concern <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and how nearly they re<U+017F>ented

it, <U+017F>ince they were beholding unto him for the greate<U+017F>t part of their well-beings. This was the cau<U+017F>e, that they, in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting the Authours of this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Patricide, they did generally oppo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t their de<U+017F>ignes, and negotiated <U+017F>o well, that <hi>Ardabures</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>par,</hi> being failed in their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a great Grecian was cho<U+017F>en Emperour, called <hi>Leon,</hi> and born in the Town of Be<U+017F>tique: It is true, that their Faction being extreamly <U+017F>trong, they would not con<U+017F>ent unto this election, but upon condition that the Raigns of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <U+017F>hould be for a time in the hands of <hi>A<U+017F>par. Leon</hi> made no difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as a partner; but he made them all know pre<U+017F>ently after, that Empiredom admits of no Competitours, and that when he con<U+017F>ented unto it, he promi<U+017F>ed no le<U+017F>s then an impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Leon,</hi> amid<U+017F>t his joyes to <U+017F>ee the Empire of the Ea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him. he did not forget what <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres</hi> had done in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and knowing that <hi>Martians</hi> affection unto them was very great, he thought it but ju<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ucceed him, as well in his love to them, as in his crowns. Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf then as kindly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, he de<U+017F>ired them to continue their affections to him, and prote<U+017F>ted, that when any opportunities pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves, wherein he might honour them, he would prefer them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other per<U+017F>ons what<U+017F>oever. Look now upon <hi>Leon</hi> for a while peaceable in the Ea<U+017F>t, but <U+017F>o were not we in Africa: for <hi>Majoranus,</hi> who <U+017F>ucceeded <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in the Empire of the We<U+017F>t, to get Sicily out of the hands of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> who was become the Ma<U+017F>ter of it, he made attempts that was worthy of his courage, and in his de<U+017F>ign (as they <U+017F>ay) of coming to burn us in our hou<U+017F>es, he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erably murdered by the <U+017F>ame Souldiers who made choice of him. His death, which <U+017F>hewed all the world how <U+017F>hort a while the favours of Fortune do la<U+017F>t, did give us <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t, and made <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> rouz up his former courage and de<U+017F>igns: <U+017F>o as rai<U+017F>ing a Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Army, he put him<U+017F>elf into a condition to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t all men whom he accounted his enemies: And certainly his preparations were not in vain, for <U+017F>oon after the death of <hi>Majoranus Soverian,</hi> who <U+017F>ucceeded him, prepared him<U+017F>elf to pro<U+017F>ecute the de<U+017F>igns of his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; but hearing of our forces, he pre<U+017F>ently changed advice, and turned his arms again<U+017F>t the Alans, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated near Bergamus, and there killed their King <hi>Beringus</hi> Perhaps this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had blown up his courage, and carryed him upon <U+017F>ome new enterprise again<U+017F>t us; but his death, which was almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>udden as his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ours, thought not <U+017F>o violent, did at once <U+017F>tifle his de<U+017F>igns and hopes upon Rome.</p>
               <p>During this time, <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> as I told you before, had ready <U+017F>hipt a brave and gallant Army, <U+017F>o as not to let it lie idle, he re<U+017F>olved to give Rome a <U+017F>econd vi<U+017F>it, invited unto it (as I think) by the memory of his fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>poils. His design was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly carried, but the Emperour <hi>Leon</hi> was adverti<U+017F>ed of it, who, not to let Italy peri<U+017F>h in that di<U+017F>order wherein it then was, did <U+017F>end <hi>Anthemius</hi> to defend it from the inva<U+017F>ion of the Vandals. But <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> who quickly knew that he <U+017F>hould be mole<U+017F>ted in his enterprize, by the pretentions of one <hi>Gervandus,</hi> who <U+017F>ince was exiled, he ha<U+017F>ted away; and having made <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Army, did leave his other Son in Carthage, with an expre<U+017F>s prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to ordain any thing before he had communicated unto me, and taken my advice. I remained therefore by this means in Africa, where, if I had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any had intentions, I had not wanted means to put them in execution; but ever being an hater of all evil actions, I would <U+017F>ooner have died then done them. Be<U+017F>ides thus, I did extreamly love <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond</hi> and the young Prince, with whom I <U+017F>tayed as a Governour: <U+017F>o as the intere<U+017F>t of this affection, was enough to make me forget the greate<U+017F>t injuries I ever received from their Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> then embarqued him<U+017F>elf, flattering him<U+017F>elf with hopes, that his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yage would be no le<U+017F><U+017F>e pro<U+017F>perous, then the conque<U+017F>t of all the world. But O, how fond and deceitful are all humane intentions? One <U+017F>ingle day <U+017F>aw all this glory, and all this war like Array, vani<U+017F>h to nothing: for <hi>Leon,</hi> who feared that <hi>Anthemius</hi> was not <U+017F>trong enough to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o formidable an Army, did ha<U+017F>te away relief under the conduct of one <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus,</hi> who being, by the favour of the gods and the winds, joyned with him, did defeat <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> and gave him
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53528:209"/>
<U+017F>o <U+017F>harp a cha<U+017F>e, as he was con<U+017F>trained to retire into Carthage, with as much <U+017F>hame and infamy, as his ambition did before promi<U+017F>e him glory and honour. In a very <U+017F>hort time, this <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus</hi> made him<U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of Sicily, and regained all that the conque<U+017F>ts of <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> had ravi<U+017F>hed from the Romane power; but not contenting him<U+017F>elf with tho<U+017F>e Trophes which he had already gotten, whil<U+017F>t <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius</hi> was returned to Rome, he de<U+017F>igned to <U+017F>ubjugate Africa, and not to leave <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> <U+017F>o much ground as to make him<U+017F>elf a grave.</p>
               <p>This re<U+017F>olution did put <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> into a greater confu<U+017F>ion, then I am able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e: He <U+017F>aw all his Armies defeated, <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus</hi> triumphant, Sicily lo<U+017F>t, the Vandals ruined, and all Africa affrighted: <U+017F>o as not knowing which way to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t his enemy, one day he did me the honour to communicate him<U+017F>elf unto me: I freely told him, that if he did not think him<U+017F>elf able to defend him<U+017F>elf by force, he had no other way but to have recour<U+017F>e unto Pollicy, and that the mo<U+017F>t favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expedient would be, to <U+017F>top the mouth of his enemy by corrupting him with gifts and promi<U+017F>es; and that though he <U+017F>pent herein all the riches that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the plunder of Rome, yet would have this advantage by it, that he gave nothing but was their own, and had thereby pre<U+017F>erved his life and e<U+017F>tate. This propo<U+017F>ition did <U+017F>ound well in his ears, and thinking that perhaps I had wit enough to bring this about, he imployed me to go unto <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus,</hi> and gave me a full power to manage this negotiation as <U+017F>eemed good unto me. Upon this I went, and found <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus</hi> advanced very far; but not to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon every circum<U+017F>tance and cour<U+017F>e I took to overcome him; let it <U+017F>uffice I tell you, that after I had told him there was no prudence in exa<U+017F>perating an enemy <U+017F>o far as to make him de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: That the greate<U+017F>t glory he could hope for, was to get by his valour all that which Italy had lo<U+017F>t: That <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> did offer to re<U+017F>tore it unto him, even all the riches that he had brought from Rome. This Man, who doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e was of a greedy and covetous Nature, was wrought upon by the promi<U+017F>es which I had made unto him, to keep this negotiation <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, that never any could come to the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Thus did I in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort give peace unto Africa, and re<U+017F>t unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> who had no <U+017F>ooner performed the conditions of this <U+017F>ecret treaty; but <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus,</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as I believe (for it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>uch actions <U+017F>hould long lie hid) was commanded by <hi>Leon</hi> to return unto Con<U+017F>tantinople. This Emperour would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>uffer neither <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> nor <hi>Olimbres</hi> to be ab<U+017F>ent from him: for tru<U+017F>ting in their courages and affections, al<U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting the Factions of <hi>Ardabures</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>par,</hi> he was very glad to keep them by him, as two Pillars to <U+017F>upport him in ca<U+017F>es of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity; but at this time, when the malice of the<U+017F>e two Factions had broken out anew, and <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> after <U+017F>everal skirmi<U+017F>hes, little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, he was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>end for <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus,</hi> who had under him the only forces which could <U+017F>ecure him in the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>cus</hi> then, was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>ent for, but <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and telling him how great a <U+017F>hame unto them it was, that they could not do any <U+017F>ervice unto <hi>Leon,</hi> and that it was better for them to peri<U+017F>h in a brave attempt then to <U+017F>tay and let another have the glory of giving peace unto the Ea<U+017F>t: to whom <hi>Olimbres,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirit a<U+017F>pired unto great actions, an<U+017F>wering that he was ready to avoid that <U+017F>tain upon their honours, they a<U+017F><U+017F>embled together one day all the Forces they could rai<U+017F>e, and charged <hi>Ardabures</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>par</hi> <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly, that after a long and <U+017F>harp Combate, wherein the lo<U+017F>s of blood was the lea<U+017F>t mark of their courages, they took them both Pri<U+017F>oners, and brought them to the mercy of <hi>Leon,</hi> who to <U+017F>top all fears of any further Rebellion, did publickly put them to death.</p>
               <p>This was the <U+017F>tate of things, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Anthemius</hi> found how far the perfidie and ingratitude of a man could go: for <hi>Rithimer,</hi> a Goth by Nation, whom <hi>Severian</hi> had made a Citizen of Rome, and Lieutenant of his Army, and unto whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius</hi> married his daughter, he ro<U+017F>e up again<U+017F>t him; and forgetting all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which he had received from his father in Law, he <U+017F>trove at the Empire, and endeavoured to u<U+017F>urp the Crown and Authority. <hi>Anthemius,</hi> more grieved at his ill Nature, then at his pretentions, did generously oppose him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri<U+017F>es,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53528:210"/>
and had no <U+017F>ooner adverti<U+017F>ed <hi>Leon</hi> of <hi>Rithimers</hi> ingratitude, but the Emperor di<U+017F>patched <hi>Olimbres</hi> to him, to deliver him from the oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this kin<U+017F>man-enemy. But the doom of the de<U+017F>tinies being inevitable, <U+017F>ome accident or other impeded the voyage of <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>o as he came no farther then Ravenna, when <hi>Rithimer,</hi> having violated the peace which he contracted with <hi>Anthemius</hi> only to have the more facility to betray him did rebell a new: defeated <hi>Belemer,</hi> who came with relief unto <hi>Anthemius</hi>; Entred into Room: plundered the hou<U+017F>es: Pillaged the <U+017F>tatly Palaces, burned the Temples, and mi<U+017F>erbaly put him to the <U+017F>word who had done him <U+017F>o many benefits.</p>
               <p>This violence had like to have killed <hi>Olimbres</hi> with greif, and the more becau<U+017F>e he conceaved that he might have <U+017F>topped his comming unto Rome. But this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelty did incen<U+017F>e the gods much more, who being unwilling to <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch abominable iniquity, and ba<U+017F>e treachery to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unpuni<U+017F>hed, they would never <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch an impious wretch to raign, but let him die the mo<U+017F>t violent death that ever did man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olimbres</hi> pre<U+017F>ently after, was declared Emperor, and called unto Rome as the only hope of that de<U+017F>olate e<U+017F>tate: which news quickly carried unto Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, and was <U+017F>o welcome unto <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> and <hi>Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they ever bare unto him that they re<U+017F>olved to give <U+017F>ome perticular te<U+017F>timony of their joy: For my part, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my joyes were far above my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions or any imagination, and in my exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of gladne<U+017F><U+017F>e I thought a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and times of that which an A<U+017F>trologer foretold him, (which was, that he <U+017F>hould not die untill he was made Emperor, and had commanded the Empire of the we<U+017F>t) not bring able to comprehend how it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible any mortall man could without a miracle have <U+017F>uch perfect knowledge of future things. At la<U+017F>t, after I had long thought upon it, I found the proverbe true, which <U+017F>ayes, that as one mi<U+017F>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is alwayes followed with another, <U+017F>o very often one good fortune is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with another: for <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> who as I <U+017F>aid before, re<U+017F>olved to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear his joyes at the advancement, and good fortune of <hi>Olimbres</hi> he would add unto my joyes at this news, another; whith was, to be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me then, to prepare my <U+017F>elf for this voyage: and I <U+017F>wimming in <U+017F>uch delights as this encounter did promi<U+017F>e me, hoping that happily, it would make <hi>Placidia</hi> come to Rome, and that <hi>Eudixe,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>aces</hi> might meet there al<U+017F>o, in two dayes I <U+017F>et all things in <U+017F>uch good order, that I was ready to part away. <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> provided a Ship purpo<U+017F>ly for me, in which, he put <U+017F>ome men of war, and loadned me with <U+017F>o many rich pre<U+017F>ents for <hi>Olimbres,</hi> as I may mo<U+017F>t truly <U+017F>ay, I never <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o much riches togeather in my life. So after <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick, Thra<U+017F>imond,</hi> and his Brother had committed me to the protection of the gods, we weighed Anchor: our Marrinors <U+017F>ang himnes to the honour of Neptune, and pre<U+017F>ently after we lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of Carthage, <U+017F>ome Merchants wich traffiqued into Italy, joyned them<U+017F>elves with us: and having as favorable a Gale as we could wi<U+017F>h, every one had good hopes in the conclu<U+017F>ion our voyage, <U+017F>ince the beginning was <U+017F>o pro<U+017F>perous.</p>
               <p>Thus we <U+017F>ailed <U+017F>ome dayes without any impediment: but as if the Dieties of the Sea, who live in a perpetuall incon<U+017F>tancy, were angry at our happine<U+017F>s, we quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, that the intervall between pro<U+017F>perity, and adver<U+017F>ity is but very <U+017F>male: Indeed, with in your <U+017F>pace of one hower we <U+017F>aw the little curle that was upon the face of the water turned into Mountainous billowes, upon that humide element, which lo<U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves in one another, did <U+017F>eem to ju<U+017F>tle, and <U+017F>trive which <U+017F>hould give the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>hoke again<U+017F>t our Ship. The winds which before <U+017F>welled one <U+017F>ailes which a gentle breath, turned into contrarys, and began a war among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, and contended which <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t overturn us. Yet we found wor<U+017F>e enemyes then all the<U+017F>e: the air at the <U+017F>ame time became ob<U+017F>cure, and afforded us no light but lightning, affrighting voyces of thunder, &amp; flaming fla<U+017F>hes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <U+017F>et fire upon <U+017F>ome of our Ships, which we <U+017F>aw burning in the mid<U+017F>t of the waves, whil<U+017F>t it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to <U+017F>ave one man, for <U+017F>uch as thought to avoid the flames, were immediatly <U+017F>wallowed up by the waves. In this horrid confu<U+017F>ion, the Pilats did abondon them<U+017F>elves unto the mercy of the enraged Sea:
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53528:210"/>
and the Marriners having no hopes of any <U+017F>afty but in their prayers, they cut their ma<U+017F>ts and cordage, and left all to violence of the wind and waves. For my part, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that in this danger, death did never pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf unto me with a more grime contenance, and it grieved me extreamly that I was to end my dayes before I had enjoyed the happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeing <hi>Olimbres.</hi> This tempe<U+017F>t la<U+017F>ted eight whole dayes, during which I may <U+017F>ay we hardly ever <U+017F>aw, any day or light: <U+017F>ometimes we were rouled one way, <U+017F>ometimes another, and <U+017F>eemed only as if it were to make choi<U+017F>e of a place for Shipwrack, for every where we found the <U+017F>ame dangers. At la<U+017F>t, that Ship wherin I was, being bigger, and <U+017F>tronger then any of the re<U+017F>t, and the la<U+017F>t the peri<U+017F>hed, it cla<U+017F>hed again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome rockes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian coa<U+017F>t; and as if Neptune had re<U+017F>erved us for the la<U+017F>t victime, as <U+017F>oon as ever our Ship was <U+017F>hevered to pieces, the air cleared up; the <U+017F>tormes cea<U+017F>ed, and the Sea was calm: Tho<U+017F>e whom fear had not killed, did peri<U+017F>h as I think with the Ship: and I, who was re<U+017F>olved to keep my <U+017F>elf alive as long as I could, I took a little wooden Goffer, wherin I kept <U+017F>ome oyntments, and e<U+017F><U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es to help <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>tood in need of them, and with it I ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf into the water: My de<U+017F>ign was to <U+017F>wim as long as my <U+017F>trength la<U+017F>ted, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elf that I <U+017F>hould prolong my life two or three howers, and perhaps the gods during that time might <U+017F>end <U+017F>ome help. Thus, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained by my little wooden Coffer, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>wimming, I perceived that I was not far di<U+017F>tant from the rock again<U+017F>t which our Ship was <U+017F>plit; Then I a<U+017F><U+017F>umed fre<U+017F>h courage, and <U+017F>trength and by the help of heaven which never for<U+017F>ook me in any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I came to the place where I de<U+017F>ired to be. I was no <U+017F>ooner out of the water, but being both weary, and wet, I put off all my cloathes, and lay my <U+017F>elf down by them, which I did not put on again untill the Sun had dryed them. From hence did I <U+017F>ee floating in the Sea the reliques of our Shipwrack: and after I had a little contemplated upon the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which had cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o many men, and <U+017F>o much wealth to peri<U+017F>h, I began to con<U+017F>ider al<U+017F>o that my own fate was not much more favourable, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw that my life could not be pre<U+017F>erved long upon that rock, <U+017F>o naked as I was, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <U+017F>upply of food again<U+017F>t hunger. Yet <U+017F>till hoping in the goodne<U+017F>s of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven who<U+017F>e anger was appea<U+017F>ed, I <U+017F>trove again<U+017F>t this greedy Mon<U+017F>ter all the re<U+017F>t of the day, and all the night following: and the next morning, when my heart began to faint for want of food, I re<U+017F>olved to make u<U+017F>e of my e<U+017F><U+017F>en<U+017F>es, of which when I came from Carthage, I had made good provi<U+017F>ion; I laid my hand then upon the little Coffer never remembring that I had left the key of it in the Ship. And therefore when I <U+017F>aw I could not open it, I re<U+017F>olved to break it: but I had no <U+017F>ooner lifted it up to da<U+017F>h it again<U+017F>t the rock, then I con<U+017F>idered that the force of the blow would infallibly break all the gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>pill the e<U+017F><U+017F>en<U+017F>es. Upon this thought I laid the boxe at my feet, and lifting up my eyes unto heaven to aske <U+017F>ome help, I e<U+017F>pied a Ship under full <U+017F>aile, and which being very well equipaged, <U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>he had not been at Sea during the time of the <U+017F>torm. I began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently to crye out as loud as ever I could: but I quickly <U+017F>ound my voice was to no purpo<U+017F>e, and that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible it <U+017F>hould reach <U+017F>o far: Therefore putting off my <U+017F>hirt, I waved it in the air, like a banner; which I had not done above half a quarter of an hower or there about, but I perceived them to untye the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boate, and row towards me with four or five men only in it.</p>
               <p>Judge how I was joyed at this: indeed I am not able to expre<U+017F>s how much: but <U+017F>o it was, that I ha<U+017F>ted to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, and in my feares, lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome new mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune <U+017F>hould hinder me of this relief which <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>o near me, I thought that they did not row <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t as they might have done: yet in le<U+017F><U+017F>ethen half an hower they came unto the rock where I was, and they were no <U+017F>ooner come but I leaped into the boate, never remembring the boxe which was when all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the only remedy I had left to comfort me again<U+017F>t the injury of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet after my <U+017F>pirits were a little recollected I began to think upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things that were with in it, and therefore entreated the men to return back, and <U+017F>o they did very willingly. It was not long before we came to the Ship which had <U+017F>ent me this relief, where I received from every one <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of joy, as made in evident, that the life of a man was of no little con<U+017F>ideration
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53528:211"/>
in their minds; <U+017F>ome of them gave my Bisket and Wine, other <U+017F>ome, <U+017F>alted meate, and thus did they very charitably feed me in my extreamity of hunger. After this, they de<U+017F>ired me to tell them all the particulars of my <U+017F>hipwrack, which they hearkened unto with amazement; and pre<U+017F>ently after, night did invice us all to re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Thus whil<U+017F>t every one was preparing them<U+017F>elves for <U+017F>leep, two of tho<U+017F>e who had releived me did come unto me, and invited me to re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf in a Cabine: I dur<U+017F>t not refu<U+017F>e this kind offer, thinking it not fit to di<U+017F>obey them in any thing, after <U+017F>uch a benefit received. Thus I con<U+017F>ented unto all they de<U+017F>ired; and as <U+017F>oon as we were all three <U+017F>ate down, the fir<U+017F>t of them, who <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>o ready and joyful to do me any <U+017F>ervice, after a thou<U+017F>and thanks unto him for it, I was very de<U+017F>ireous to know his name; He an<U+017F>wered, that he was called <hi>Palemon,</hi> and that he was a Segu<U+017F>ian: Then calling to memory what I had heard concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Adventures of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>aces,</hi> and remembring that a man of that Country and (as I thought) of the <U+017F>ame name, had formerly <U+017F>aved him from killing him<U+017F>elf, I asked him whether he was not the man, who in <hi>Italy</hi> had done that good office for the Caveleir: He told me no; but true it was, that a Segu<U+017F>ian did re<U+017F>cue <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>r<U+017F>a<U+017F>es</hi> from the Arms of death; but his name was <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not <hi>Palemon</hi>; But however, (continued I) I do find by the help you have afforded, that the gods are friends unto your Country, <U+017F>ince they have made all the men in it <U+017F>o charitable and kind: and doubtle<U+017F>s this la<U+017F>t action of yours to me, will find from Heaven a great reward; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that as far as I am able, <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hall never be found ungrateful.</p>
               <p>At the name of <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is,</hi> he that was on the other <U+017F>ide me, and almo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep, did <U+017F>tart up, and turning him<U+017F>elf towards me, did ask me whether or no I named <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is,</hi> and what I <U+017F>aid of him: to whom I an<U+017F>wered, that I did name him, and that it was in a<U+017F><U+017F>uring <hi>Palemon</hi> that I would upon all occa<U+017F>ions be ready to acknowledge the good office he had done me: Do you bear the name of that man, who is <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>teemed in the world? (<U+017F>aid he unto me) who cannot want friends in what place <U+017F>oever you can go? To this I an<U+017F>wered as mode<U+017F>tly as I could; but to omit the relation of that good opinion which he had of me, and what he <U+017F>aid in my advantage; I will only tell you, that I was acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the man whom they looked after. And after I had received the Letter from <hi>Damon,</hi> and told them I was able to <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fie that de<U+017F>ire which moved them to undertake this voyage; I made them all <U+017F>o full of joy, as they could hardly <U+017F>leep that night.</p>
               <p>They under<U+017F>tood that my de<U+017F>ign was to go unto <hi>Rome</hi> to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Olimbres</hi>; <U+017F>o as telling me it would not be a long and difficult Journy by Land; and that if I would <U+017F>ee <hi>Damon,</hi> and <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> by the way, I <U+017F>hould not go above four days journey out of my way; I con<U+017F>ented to go by Land, and <U+017F>o accordingly we did about break of day.</p>
               <p>Then they began to <U+017F>peak unto me concerning <hi>Celideas</hi> cure, and <U+017F>hewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, the little bloody <U+017F>ticks; but the hopes which I had that I <U+017F>hould ere long dre<U+017F>s the wounds them<U+017F>elves, made me de<U+017F>ire them to defer this cure until we came there. Upon this, they pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me no further; but knowing that I had a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the City of the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilians,</hi> becau<U+017F>e there <hi>

From thence we left upon our left hand, a <U+017F>tately Ca<U+017F>tle, which, they <U+017F>ay was built by <hi>Turnus</hi>: Afterwards following upon the Ro<U+017F>n, night did <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e us within three Leagues of <hi>Vienna.</hi> We were then con<U+017F>trained to go no further, becau<U+017F>e we were to pa<U+017F>s through a thick and dangerous wood; and the danger was the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Army of the Francks being di<U+017F>-banded, many Souldiers waited for pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>engers, and either robbed or killed them; But <U+017F>ee how hard a matter it is to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53528:211"/>
avoid the decrees of Fate: The next morning <U+017F>etting out betimes, and not gone above half a League, we were met by a dozen or fifteen of the<U+017F>e Rovers. At the fir<U+017F>t the <U+017F>eemed to begg <U+017F>omething of us; but we no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>eemed will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>omething upon them, but three of the <U+017F>turdie<U+017F>t of them <U+017F>eized upon the bridles of our Hor<U+017F>es; and the re<U+017F>t falling pell mell us, pulled us to the ground. <hi>Halladiue</hi> made as good re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance as he could, and <U+017F>o did <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> al<U+017F>o, who drawing out his Sword upon a <U+017F>udden, no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw his hand upon his Bridle, but he quite cut off the hand at one blow: But it being a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for <U+017F>o few to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>o many well armed men who, be<U+017F>ides their Swords, had compleat Arms and Daggers; this re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance did but the more incen<U+017F>e them, <U+017F>o as they re<U+017F>olved to kill us all. Then they carried us upon the left hand into the thicke<U+017F>t part of the wood; where <U+017F>trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping us of all our cloaths, not leaving us <U+017F>o much as our Shirts, they tyed our hands behind us, and then tyed us every one unto a <U+017F>everal Tree. There <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> found their Barbarity; for he who<U+017F>e hand he had cut off, being extream impatient of revenge, he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw tyed, but going unto him; This hand (<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>hewed him his right hand) <U+017F>hall puni<U+017F>h thee for the lo<U+017F>s of the other. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he <U+017F>tabbed him mo<U+017F>t inhumanely, five or <U+017F>ix times into the body: He was tyed <U+017F>o near unto me, as I could <U+017F>ee his eyes bid me the la<U+017F>t adieu; for (having handkerchiefs tyed before our mouths lea<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould cry out) we could not <U+017F>peak.</p>
               <p>I who thought that <hi>Palemon</hi> had only got a minutes <U+017F>tart of me, I confe<U+017F>s that I an<U+017F>wered him only with my eyes al<U+017F>o, and prepared my <U+017F>oul to follow him without <U+017F>orrow. But I cannot tell whether my age did infu<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pect into the<U+017F>e Rogues, or whether it was my de<U+017F>tiny to dye la<U+017F>t; but <U+017F>o it was, that as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Palemon</hi> had given up his la<U+017F>t breath, they turned towards <hi>Halladine</hi>; and as they were ready to make him feel the fury of their Arms, upon a <U+017F>udden one among<U+017F>t them, who <U+017F>eemed to have <U+017F>ome command over the re<U+017F>t, did make a <U+017F>ign unto his companions to hold their hands, and that he had <U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ay unto him. Upon this command they <U+017F>tayed, and this man comming nearer <hi>Halladine</hi> to take away the handkerchief from his mouth, he asked him from whence he came, and from whom? from <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he; and what did you before you came away? (asked the man) I was (<U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine</hi>) at the Temple: And did none <U+017F>peak unto you? (<U+017F>aid the man) <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi> then thinking a little upon it, no, replied he, none except a young Souldier, who told me he was at the taking of <hi>Calice,</hi> and having no means to carry him hone<U+017F>tly into his own Country, was forced to implore the charity of well-di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed people: Did you give him any thing? (<U+017F>aid the man) I gave him <U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine,</hi> a little piece of money, which was all I had about me: Very well (<U+017F>aid the man pre<U+017F>ently) this <U+017F>hall be either thy life or thy death. In <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o, he turned towards his companions, and per<U+017F>waded with them <U+017F>o far, as he obtained the life of <hi>Halladine</hi>; but lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e them, or make them known, they <U+017F>topped his mouth, blinded his eyes, and untying him from the Tree, they <U+017F>et him upon his hor<U+017F>e, wich his face towards the hor<U+017F>es tail, his arms tyed behind him, and his leggs tyed under the belly of the hor<U+017F>e. In this equipage they let him go, and broke out into extream laughter at him: And whil<U+017F>t they wery thus bu<U+017F>ie about <hi>Halladine,</hi> three or four of them were <U+017F>earching in my Pockets for the key of my box, which was behind my Saddle, and pre<U+017F>ently after, others came to butcher me: But when they were within three or four paces of the Tree where I was tyed, we heard a great out-cry, as of one that was extreamly affrighted: Fear pre<U+017F>ently began to <U+017F>eize upon them, and not knowing from what cau<U+017F>e this noi<U+017F>e miget proceed, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently began to fly away as fa<U+017F>t as they could, and the fa<U+017F>ter, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed that <hi>Halladine</hi> had brought <U+017F>ome to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e them.</p>
               <p>Thus they were no <U+017F>ooner out of my <U+017F>ight, but turning mine eye towards the place from whence this hideous out-cry came, I e<U+017F>pyed through the Trees; one <U+017F>ingle man, who<U+017F>e affright had made his eyes look wilde and wandring: <U+017F>ometimes he held his hands cla<U+017F>ped together, <U+017F>ometimes he would lift them

up to his hair, as if he would pull it off: otherwhiles, he would fall down upon his knees, as if he would beg for mercy: afterwards he would ri<U+017F>e up again, and run ten or twelve paces as fa<U+017F>t as ever he could, <U+017F>till crying out in a mo<U+017F>t lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tone, and complaining mo<U+017F>t pittifully. He was no <U+017F>ooner come near me, but I de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak, and intreat his help; but the handkerchief before my mouth would not let me, and be<U+017F>ides, I <U+017F>aw him fall down to the ground, without either <U+017F>en<U+017F>e or motion. At fir<U+017F>t I thought him dead, but pre<U+017F>ently after, hearing him breath, as one that was extreamly oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in his <U+017F>tomach, I knew that he was <U+017F>till alive. Judge, I be<U+017F>eech you, in what condition I was now, and how perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I was at his <U+017F>leep, for my fears that the<U+017F>e Rogues would come again and fini<U+017F>h their wicked de<U+017F>ign, did make me think his <U+017F>leep to be twice as long as it was: for indeed he continued not in this Lethargy above two howers, during which time, I had <U+017F>till for my entertainment, the horrours of a death almo<U+017F>t inevitable, and the object of <hi>Palemons</hi> <U+017F>ad adventure.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Halladine</hi> was returned to the Town, from whence we came in the morning; for his hor<U+017F>e took that way as <U+017F>oon as he felt him<U+017F>elf at liberty: And certainly, it was a plea<U+017F>ant and deplorable pa<U+017F>time to behold, for being <U+017F>tark naked, and tied, as I told you before, all the little children followed him, and the people ran in the <U+017F>treets laughing at this odd <U+017F>pectacle; and, I believe, it would have been long before he had found any help, if by Fortune a Sacrificer going unto the Temple, and being a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>ee a man in that condition, had not <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his hor<U+017F>e, and thrown a long cloak upon <hi>Halladine.</hi> Pre<U+017F>ently after, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied him, and as <U+017F>oon as he could <U+017F>peak, he related unto him the accident which had happened with <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighs and tears, that the Sacrificer being moved unto compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and the people all about him, not being able to endure <U+017F>uch a horrid action, they all pre<U+017F>ently armed them<U+017F>elves to try if they could apprehend tho<U+017F>e that had unworthily u<U+017F>ed him.</p>
               <p>This hapned at the <U+017F>ame time when the man who fell down by me in a <U+017F>wound did awaken; and God knows how afraid I was, that he would have continued on his way without relieving me: At la<U+017F>t, by good Fortune he turned his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and <U+017F>eeing me in that condition, near a corps with many wounds, he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized that he <U+017F>tood immoveable, I perceived by his eyes, that <U+017F>leep had <U+017F>ettled his mind, for he did not look <U+017F>o wild and rovingly; but <U+017F>eeing him full of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, mixed with amazement, I began to hope that he would take <U+017F>ome pity upon me; and indeed, he came pre<U+017F>ently to unloo<U+017F>e me, and helped me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my clothes: I was no <U+017F>ooner dre<U+017F>t, but thanking him for the good office he had done me, I told him the whole <U+017F>uccess of our di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. He <U+017F>eemed to be very much concerned at the mi<U+017F>fortune of <hi>Palemon</hi>; and advi<U+017F>ing me to return unto the place from whence I came in the morning, to take order for <hi>Palemons</hi> fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he offered to accompany me. I took his councel, and getting upon my hor<U+017F>e, I de<U+017F>ired him to get upon <hi>Palemons,</hi> which the Thieves had not carryed away, le<U+017F>t, as I believe, he <U+017F>hould have de<U+017F>eryed them: We were no <U+017F>ooner got into the high way, but we met above two hundred per<U+017F>ons which <hi>Halladine</hi> conducted thither. <hi>Halladine</hi> did think to find me dead, and therefore as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw me, he took me about the neck, and did me a thou<U+017F>and Carre<U+017F><U+017F>es. After this, we went to the place where <hi>Palemon</hi> lay, whom we no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw, but <hi>Halladine</hi> and I were ready to with him for grief.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, having given him an honourable Funeral, we went unto Vienna. There <hi>Halladine</hi> taking me a<U+017F>ide, and telling me how many impediments might happen in the cure of <hi>Celidea</hi>; he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me to give <hi>Damon</hi> that contentment: <U+017F>o as the next morning I took his little bloody <U+017F>ticks, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them as I would have done the wounds them<U+017F>elves.</p>
               <p>I doubted not but a pre<U+017F>ent good effect would follow: for in the compo<U+017F>ition of this <U+017F>alve, which I brought in a little box for <hi>Olimbres,</hi> I had not omitted any ingredient which would not make extreamly <U+017F>ubtil: and by good Fortune, when I came from Carthage, it was not above a month before I had finished that making of it, though it was a whole year before I began it: for be<U+017F>ides the oyles which were to be extracted, as the oyl of Flax, and the oyl of Ro<U+017F>es, there was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

So I had no <U+017F>ooner dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e little <U+017F>ticks, but we parted; and the man who had relieved me, hearing me name Forre<U+017F>ts unto <hi>Halladine,</hi> he be<U+017F>eeched us to let him go with us; but becau<U+017F>e I thought every moment upon the danger from which he had relea<U+017F>ed me, as <U+017F>oon as we were got into the way, I asked him as civilly as I could, what good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had brought him thither <U+017F>o opportunely, and from whence proceeded that rapture wherein I <U+017F>aw him? he lifted up his eyes pre<U+017F>ently to heaven, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ca<U+017F>ting them upon me, with a deep <U+017F>igh: Alas (<U+017F>aid he unto me) that which you do call a rapture, is rather a ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment which the gods have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon me, for the expiation of my <U+017F>ins: But <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire the di<U+017F>course of it, though my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be beyond all hopes of cure, I will obey you, provided you permit me to <U+017F>tay no longer upon the relation of it then I de<U+017F>ire, left the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it do drive me into the <U+017F>ame extremities, wherein you <U+017F>aw me: Upon this, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Halladine</hi> was in deep <U+017F>tudy, <U+017F>ome thirty paces from us, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his relation thus.</p>
               <p>Know, Father, that my name is <hi>Azahides</hi>: the place of my birth is among<U+017F>t the Allobroges: My Father was one who ever held a con<U+017F>iderable rank in that Town, which <U+017F>tands upon the Lake of Leman<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> When I was hardly capable of rea<U+017F>on, and when that Province was involved in many troubles, becau<U+017F>e they would take from <hi>Gondioch</hi> all that he had on this <U+017F>ide the Rhyne, they did put arms into my hands, when I had hardly <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expiration of <U+017F>ome time, a truce was made, which la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>ome yeares: During which, my Father con<U+017F>idering, that he had no child but me for the <U+017F>tay of his Family and age, he re<U+017F>olved to marry me; and <U+017F>o indeed he did unto a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair and hand<U+017F>ome wife, whom I kept not above a year, for the died in child-bed after <U+017F>he had left me a daughter, as a pledge of her love. Pre<U+017F>ently after, the great captain <hi>Aetius</hi> had the government of Gaul; and renewing the fir<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns which the Romanes had again<U+017F>t us, he prepared him<U+017F>elf for the execution of them. This was the rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Abariell</hi> (for that was my fathers name) could never keep me with him: for my humour (which found <U+017F>ome particular <U+017F>ati<U+017F>faction in blood and <U+017F>laughter) was <U+017F>tronger them all, the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions he u<U+017F>ed to hinder me from leaving him: So I parted from him, and until the time that <hi>Aetius</hi> had command to leave us in peace, I was alwayes in every combate, at the taking of all Towns, and in every dangerous enterprize that was to be executed. One time among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, much plunder falling to my <U+017F>hare, I gave it all in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of a young boy called <hi>Silvander,</hi> about five or <U+017F>ix yeares of age, and who, they told me, was <U+017F>tollen from <U+017F>ome place beyond the Rho<U+017F>ne, and in the Province of Vienna. The a<U+017F>pect of this child did plea<U+017F>e me <U+017F>o exceedingly well, as I re<U+017F>olved to give him as good education as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, and afterwards to take him home unto me, as a man that was obliged unto me for his life. In order hereunto, peace was no <U+017F>ooner concluded, but I <U+017F>ent for him to my hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>hewed him unto my Father, as the be<U+017F>t booty that ever I got. But here, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you, ob<U+017F>erve a very <U+017F>trange effect of divine Providence: This child, whom I de<U+017F>tiny'd unto perpetual <U+017F>ervitude, no <U+017F>ooner appeared in my Fathers eye, but con<U+017F>idering the little comfort he had in me, by rea<U+017F>on of my turbulent and <U+017F>tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nature, he re<U+017F>olved to bring up this boy, and to e<U+017F>tablish upon him the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all his hopes. This re<U+017F>olution was not <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, but it came to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <U+017F>o as beginning to fore<U+017F>ee what might afterwards happen, I began al<U+017F>o to u<U+017F>e all my Art for <U+017F>topping the cour<U+017F>e of this growing good will. But all my plots and devices were in vain; for my Father, taking him from me as his own, did <U+017F>end him to the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian <U+017F>chools, where he grew <U+017F>o good a proficient, and <U+017F>o every way accompli<U+017F>hed, as for all my envy of him, I could not chu<U+017F>e but confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that my Father could not place his affection upon an object more worthy of e<U+017F>teem. Yet, all my Fathers e<U+017F>tate being in his own free di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and fearing left he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of it, as well as of his affection, to my di<U+017F>advantage, I de<U+017F>igned not only to oppo<U+017F>e his Fortune, but again<U+017F>t his life al<U+017F>o, if occa<U+017F>ion did offer it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:53528:213"/>In the mean time, the daughter which I had, was no le<U+017F>s grown in beauty then <U+017F>he was in body and wit: <U+017F>o as then, being fit for marriage, my Father made a propo<U+017F>ition to marry her unto <hi>Silvander.</hi> And indeed, I took this as an occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my revenge: for having commanded my daughter to make my Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I would never give my con<U+017F>ent unto it; and told her, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for her to marry him <U+017F>ecretly; I contrived it <U+017F>o, that poor <hi>Silvander</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain hour in the night when he would come, and that he <U+017F>hould come up a rope-ladder in at a window which is over the Lake: At the hour appointed I came into the chamber, I cut the rope when he was half up, and let him fall into the water like a <U+017F>tone, <U+017F>o he was never heard of <U+017F>ince.</p>
               <p>You may well judge Father, that though I had no other <U+017F>in but this<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> yet this was enough to merit from the gods a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere puni<U+017F>hment; but, as if heaven would <U+017F>et me out unto men, as an example of avarice and cruelty, I was loadned with other burthens more heavy and intollerable. Know then, Father, that as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Silvander</hi> was drown'd, I was the fir<U+017F>t that would needs run unto the place where the noi<U+017F>e was, and commanding my daughter, upon pain of death, to <U+017F>ay that the cord did break of it <U+017F>elf: I did ca<U+017F>t the fault upon the effect, whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I my <U+017F>elf was the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>e. My daughter did not fail me, and after I had looked out at the window, I went unto <hi>Abariel,</hi> and acquainted him with this <U+017F>ad accident. At the fir<U+017F>t he broke out into tears and cries, and afterwards finding his <U+017F>orrows to be remedile<U+017F>s, he fell into <U+017F>uch a deep <U+017F>wound, as I thought he would have rendred up his <U+017F>pirit: We put him therefore into his bed, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving again, he fixed his eyes upon me a long while together: afterwards, with a deep <U+017F>igh ah <hi>Azahides</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me) confe<U+017F>s the truth; are not thy plots the cau<U+017F>e of this death? Then having compo<U+017F>ed my face into a <U+017F>eeming <U+017F>orrow, I an<U+017F>wered no, and that I would <U+017F>ooner have con<U+017F>ented unto my own death, then have procured him <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>content: Well, well, (replied he) the gods are Judges which cannot be corrupted nor deceived, if thou bee<U+017F>t innocent of this crime, I be<U+017F>eech them to pardon thee, as I do all the re<U+017F>t of thy di<U+017F>obedient cour<U+017F>es, which thou ha<U+017F>t committed again<U+017F>t me; but if thou bee<U+017F>t guilty, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech them to mea<U+017F>ure their puni<U+017F>hments according to thy offences. In <U+017F>aying this, his voice began to fail him, and <U+017F>ome of our friends and kindred, who came in upon the noi<U+017F>e, did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they could no comfort him. But he being old and decrepite, he was <U+017F>o feeble to undergo this grief, as we all thought he would not out live that night: which my daughter <U+017F>eeing, <U+017F>he came unto him, and whi<U+017F>pered him in the ear a long time together. I was afraid once that <U+017F>he had betrayed me, for <U+017F>he only was a witne<U+017F>s of my wicked act; but certainly, had I thought <U+017F>he would have told him, I would never have <U+017F>uffered her to <U+017F>peak unto him: this made me ob<U+017F>erve their motions very exactly, and <U+017F>hould have found, if the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had exa<U+017F>perated him; but on the contrary, the mind of <hi>Abariel</hi> grew more <U+017F>ettled and <U+017F>trong: yet falling again into his fir<U+017F>t weakne<U+017F>s, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<U+017F>aid he unto her, and took her hand) you <U+017F>ee I have not life enough to <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my <U+017F>elf of what you tell me, and therefore I will believe, that this remedy which you would give unto my weakne<U+017F>se, proceeds rather from pity of my pain, then from any truth which obliges you to tell me <U+017F>o. Let me die therefore, dear daughter, and if I have any power over you, go and obey this my la<U+017F>t command: Go this very hour unto my brother (<U+017F>aid he, and pointed unto my uncle) I will leave him enough to <U+017F>ee you well provided for; but above all, never live with your Father again, at lea<U+017F>t as little as you can, for he will never be a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of honour and virtue unto you. Upon this he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, and de<U+017F>ired my uncle to carry her away, which he did accordingly. Afterwards, turning him<U+017F>elf towards me: I do leave unto you (<U+017F>aid he unto me) that e<U+017F>tate which you have <U+017F>o greedily gaped after, I advi<U+017F>e you to remember this; That you will never be le<U+017F><U+017F>e rich, then when you greedily de<U+017F>ire to be more. I know not what <U+017F>ecret opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the gods have in<U+017F>pired into my mind; but I <U+017F>hall die extreamly ill <U+017F>atisfied with your deportment; I pray God all my apprehen<U+017F>ions be fal<U+017F>e, but if they be true, I will be an eternal torment to thy con<U+017F>cience.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e words, which he had much ado to utter, were almo<U+017F>t the la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>poke:
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53528:213"/>
for he had no <U+017F>ooner pronounced the word Adieu, but his <U+017F>oul expired. This did <U+017F>hake my very <U+017F>oul; for afterwards I <U+017F>eemed to be almo<U+017F>t as dead as he, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repent of the crime which I had committed: yet <U+017F>hrowding the re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my crime, as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, under tho<U+017F>e teares which I might well <U+017F>hed for the death of a Father, I carryed the matter <U+017F>o well, that in lieu of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning me, they commended me for the grief I expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed at his death.</p>
               <p>I built a very honourable monument for him <U+017F>utable to his quality: as <U+017F>oon as the la<U+017F>t ceremonies were performed, I began to plot how I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tifle all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my fault, imagining that I <U+017F>hould never be at re<U+017F>t as long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained any in the World that was able to di<U+017F>cover it: <U+017F>o as I fell almo<U+017F>t upon the mo<U+017F>t barbarous de<U+017F>ign that ever entered into the thoughts of man: and being re<U+017F>olved to tru<U+017F>t all things unto your di<U+017F>cretion, I mu<U+017F>t tell you that I was upon the point of preparing poy<U+017F>on to give my Daughter, when I heard that they had placed her among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals bordering upon the Lake, under the charge of one called <hi>Bellinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus finding my <U+017F>elf at once, without Father without Daughter, but not without <U+017F>ome feares of my trea<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t <hi>Silvander</hi> to be one day di<U+017F>covered, I began to enjoy the e<U+017F>tate which <hi>Abariel</hi> left me. But I pre<U+017F>ently found that my Father was a true prophet, and that there is no man rich which is not contented: for <U+017F>ince the accrue of <U+017F>o great an e<U+017F>tate, I found my <U+017F>elf a thou<U+017F>and times poorer then when I had le<U+017F><U+017F>e. When I thought to put in execution any of tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ignes which moved me unto a de<U+017F>ire of enjoying my Fathers po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, I found an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility in doeing it, eyther in the thing it <U+017F>elf, or in my own humour: for when I wi<U+017F>hed my <U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of an e<U+017F>tate that I might make good chear, though I had the e<U+017F>tate, yet I wanted the <U+017F>tomack; and ever <U+017F>ince <hi>Abariel</hi> dyed, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pre<U+017F>ented with any meat which went not again<U+017F>t my appetite: If I wi<U+017F>hed it to entertain my friends, I con<U+017F>idered that I had no friend in all the World; for being concious of my crime, I thought all men to be judges, and that my own kindred never came unto me, but to carry me unto condign puni<U+017F>hment. Thus finding no peace in any <U+017F>ociety, I betook my <U+017F>elf unto <U+017F>olitude, and in order to that, retired my <U+017F>elf unto a hou<U+017F>e which I had in the Country: but which way <U+017F>oever I went, <U+017F>till my <U+017F>in followed me, and gave me no more re<U+017F>t there then in another place: and as if heaven would make my <U+017F>elf my own puni<U+017F>her, nothing did come into my mind for a whole month together; but the thoughts of my crime, and of the puni<U+017F>hment which I was to <U+017F>uffer for it. This did <U+017F>o much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me as I did by degrees find, that my rea<U+017F>on was lo<U+017F>t in the violence of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment: for as I <U+017F>aid before, no meat goeing down with a good <U+017F>tomack, the <U+017F>male nouri<U+017F>hment which I received by it, helped much to the impairing of my judgment and health. I <U+017F>trove a while again<U+017F>t this growing di<U+017F>ease: But the gods who<U+017F>e hands lay heavy upon me did quickly <U+017F>hew me that they can inflict greater paines upon mortals then the lo<U+017F>s of their wits and rea<U+017F>on: for one night when I had <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elf in my Chamber, and laid down upon my bed in hopes to take <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t, it being long <U+017F>ince I had any, me thought: But why do I <U+017F>ay, me thought, <U+017F>ince what I <U+017F>hall tell you I did hear, I <U+017F>ay I did hear the dore open with a hidious noi<U+017F>e: and as <U+017F>oon as I ca<U+017F>t my eye that way to <U+017F>ee what the matter was, I <U+017F>aw <hi>Abariel</hi> bloody in <U+017F>everall places, holding in one hand a candle lighted, and in the other a heart pierced with three or four knives: he had before him one of the furies, and two others on each <U+017F>ide one: all three carrying candles as he did: and armed in their other hands with whips, god knowes how much this fight <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed me, and more his approach for comming to my bed: <hi>Azahides</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) do<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>ee this heart all pierced and wounded? It is the very <U+017F>ame which the wounds of thy di<U+017F>obedience did murder: and becau<U+017F>e the gods would not have the to lo<U+017F>e thy <U+017F>hare of bli<U+017F><U+017F>e in the <U+017F>econd life, they have <U+017F>ent me to puni<U+017F>h thee unto repentance in this world, for a crime whereof thy own con<U+017F>cience does accu<U+017F>e the: after he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he retired back two or three paces, making a <U+017F>ign unto the furies which accompanied him: They pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon me: and whil<U+017F>t one cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>erpents to gnaw upon my bre<U+017F>t, another burned me with the candle, and the third did la<U+017F>h me <U+017F>o with a whip, that the more I cryed,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53528:214"/>
and complained, the more her rage and fury encrea<U+017F>ed. I cannot tell what I did not to molifie the <U+017F>oul of my Father; I ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf a hundred times at his feet, but when I thought to embrace his legges, I felt nothing but air, becau<U+017F>e he fled from me, fearing (as I think) that my torment would end with his anger: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this torment above an hover; after which, <U+017F>o deep a <U+017F>leep did <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e upon me, as it la<U+017F>ted untill day: when I wakned, imagining to find my body all marked with the paines that I had endured, I was all amazed, when I found not one <U+017F>ign of any <U+017F>uch torments as I felt. This made me think, that this revenge was divine, <U+017F>ince my <U+017F>oul only re<U+017F>ented it: and thinking that <U+017F>acrifices might work <U+017F>ome good effects, I offered many; But for all them my malady continued: <U+017F>o as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every eight day, I endured the <U+017F>ame torment; at la<U+017F>t, not being able to live in <U+017F>uch extremity I was in<U+017F>pired to go, and con<U+017F>ult with an Oracle, which gave me this an<U+017F>wer.</p>

               <p>This Oracle (out of which I could not collect any thing, but that I <U+017F>hould nere be cured untill he whom I had killed did <U+017F>ee me, and had pardoned my crime) did put me into <U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion, as in effect <U+017F>eeing it altogether impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, my fury augmented: Yet an old prophet telling me that I mu<U+017F>t never di<U+017F>pair in the goodne<U+017F>s of the gods, and that if ever I found any remedy it would be only in Forre<U+017F>ts, my <U+017F>pirit was a little calmed. I <U+017F>et forward therefore immediatly: and was no <U+017F>ooner entred into the wood where I found you ye<U+017F>terday but I <U+017F>aw the <U+017F>ame <hi>Abariel</hi> again with the <U+017F>ame furies, ju<U+017F>t in the way in which was to go; I ran pre<U+017F>ently into the thick of the wood in hopes to avoid meeting this di<U+017F>mall object: but he quickly overtook me, and as if my flight offended him, I was never <U+017F>o much tormented as I was then; This was the cau<U+017F>e of that tran<U+017F>port, and rapture wherein you <U+017F>aw me, which moved you unto as much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as admiration, and which made me to cry out as you did hear: glad I am that it did produce <U+017F>o good an effect as the <U+017F>aving of your life, and it <U+017F>hall be the more plea<U+017F>ing to me as long as I live.</p>
               <p>This (<U+017F>aid <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi>) was all that <hi>Azahides</hi> told me there; And though I did ab<U+017F>olutly believe that all this fury was only an effect of an imagination extreamly wounded, yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but judge, upon the <U+017F>ight of the Oracle which he made me read two or three times over, that it would be very difficult to find a remedy again<U+017F>t his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And indeed, as we were walking together in this wood, this tran<U+017F>port took him again, and forced him unto <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange actions, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ee him without abundance of horror, and extream pity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> did harken all this while with extream attention; The gods (<U+017F>aid he) are <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t and good, as they do never inflict more mi<U+017F>eryes upon men, then they give power to <U+017F>upport them: This may be <U+017F>een in <hi>Azahides,</hi> who for all his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious torments yet <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts: Now you mu<U+017F>t know, that this <hi>Silvander</hi> whom he thinks to be dead is not <U+017F>o: for being adverti<U+017F>ed by his own Daughter of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on indented again<U+017F>t him, he tyed his own clothes fall of <U+017F>and unto the rope, and when he heard them fall into the water, he e<U+017F>caped away.</p>
               <p>This made me conceive, that of what quality <U+017F>oever his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was, whether
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53528:214"/>
in imagination or otherwi<U+017F>e, it may be <U+017F>peedily cured, <U+017F>ince <hi>Silvander,</hi> who has been many months in this Country, will certainly look kindly upon him, and not deny him the pardon, upon which the cure depends: Thus do we <U+017F>ee the full accompli<U+017F>hment of the Oracle, <U+017F>ince this is the place where Neptune quitted, when <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> did cut a Mountain, through which the waters which over-flowed all this Country, did run out: And you are the <U+017F>tranger the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of who<U+017F>e fortune did amaze the Nymphs; for mo<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e whom you <U+017F>ee here in the habit of Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, are indeed the Nymphs of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, and contented both, at the Druids di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, and be<U+017F>eeched him to make as much ha<U+017F>te as he could, that <hi>Azahides</hi> might receive <U+017F>o great a benefit: Therefore <hi>Adamas</hi> entreating <hi>Celadon</hi> to go and fetch <hi>Silvander</hi>; That Shepherd found him walking another walk, with <hi>Lycydas, Doris, Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others, not pre<U+017F>uming to come where <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>anira</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> was, lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould interrupt them. As soon as <hi>Celadon</hi> related unto him part of what he had heard, and having brought him unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Azahides,</hi> returned out of his Lethargy, who <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o much company <U+017F>o neer him, offered to go away; But <hi>Olicar<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>tayed him, and after <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, did let him under<U+017F>tand, that his torments were now near their end; unto which <hi>Azahides</hi> giving no credit, they pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Silvander</hi> unto him, whom he pre<U+017F>ently knew, though he was much changed as well in condition as habit, who pro<U+017F>trating him<U+017F>elf before him, he did nothing a long while but <U+017F>hed tears, at the memory of what he had attempted again<U+017F>t his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: At the la<U+017F>t, <hi>Silvander</hi> embraced him with much re<U+017F>pect, and did <U+017F>o freely Forgive him that offence, as he was comforted in his mind, <U+017F>o as carrying this news unto his daughter, who was confined among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals, he never was troubled in mind with tho<U+017F>e torments any more.</p>
               <p>The Relation of <hi>Olica<U+017F>is,</hi> and that which had hapned unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and unto <hi>Diana,</hi> as well at the Fountain of Verity, as <U+017F>ince they were brouget unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> had taken up <U+017F>o much of the day, as it was almo<U+017F>t night when <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who was already come unto the Pallace of I<U+017F>oures, did <U+017F>end a Coach unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <U+017F>he might come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira, Dorinde,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the company.</p>
               <p>The Druid, who was in hopes of their company that night, was very <U+017F>orry <U+017F>orry that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had debatred him of that happine<U+017F>s; yet not daring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, becau<U+017F>e obedience vnto the Nymph was but his duty, he con<U+017F>ented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their departure; and waiting upon them part of the way, he be<U+017F>eeched them to honour him with their return the next day: <hi>Galathea</hi> promi<U+017F>ed to ask per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and afterwards <U+017F>eeming very <U+017F>orry that <U+017F>he had not time enough to talk with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>he went away fully re<U+017F>olved to emply her endeavours to <U+017F>ee her again.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as they came unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> they gave her an exact accompt of all that they had <U+017F>een; and after they had told how much the Inchantment had affrighted them, they told her thot the god of love was to pronounce <U+017F>ome Oracles, and commanded that they <U+017F>hould come and con<U+017F>ult with him: This Novelty made the Nymph very de<U+017F>irous to be pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>o as without <hi>Galatheas</hi> mention of her promi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he commanded to make all things ready, that <U+017F>he might go unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> very early in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merindor</hi> was come from Mount Bri<U+017F>on with the Nymph; and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aid he was <U+017F>ent from <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond, Dorinde</hi> received him as kindly as <U+017F>he could, though <U+017F>he retained <U+017F>till a fre<U+017F>h memory of his behaviour towards her: But at this time forgetting all his levity, <U+017F>he bad him welcome; and after Supper, imagining that he dur<U+017F>t not not talk of any thing but of the Prince<U+017F>s bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, to whom the joys of <hi>Celadon</hi> was an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentment, he returned unto the company he left in the Garden; but there hapned to be a change <U+017F>ince he went: For <hi>Doris</hi> being acquainted with
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53528:215"/>
the death of <hi>Palemon,</hi> <U+017F>he fell into <U+017F>uch extreamities of griefs, and complaints, as would have moved a <U+017F>tone to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be no le<U+017F>s greeved then <U+017F>he; and when he con<U+017F>idered that he was the principal cau<U+017F>e of that Shepherds death, he could not imagine any thing that was able to comfort him. The Druid thinking he could not do a more charitable office, then to comfort them in their <U+017F>orrows, he took <hi>Doris</hi> in one hand, and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> in the other; and betwixt that place and the hou<U+017F>e, he gave them <U+017F>uch cordial Language, as he much allayed the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>ouls, and put them into hope, that as the gods had <U+017F>ent this <U+017F>ad affliction upon them, <U+017F>o certainly out of their goodne<U+017F>s, they would <U+017F>end them comforts. In the mean while, the <U+017F>ighs of <hi>Doris,</hi> did blow that fire more vehement, which love had long <U+017F>ince kindled in the heart of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi>: And the tears which that Shepherd <U+017F>hed at the <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entments of <hi>Doris,</hi> were <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing unto that afflicted Shepherde<U+017F>s, as they <U+017F>erved for a kinde of comforts and ea<U+017F>e, unto the pain which <U+017F>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Adamas</hi> found that his per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions had a good opperation with them, he left them, and went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Bellinde,</hi> who was already returned unto the Chamber of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>: And becau<U+017F>e he feared that if all this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny went to vi<U+017F>it them, it would be but trouble<U+017F>ome to them, he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that none <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee them till the next morning: Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Paris</hi> to wait upon <hi>Celadon, Silvander,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t into their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and advi<U+017F>ed them to be all in readine<U+017F>s the next morning, to go and hear the Oracles which the God of Love was to pronounce: <hi>Paris</hi> was obedient unto this command; and though he had great de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee <hi>Diana,</hi> yet he dur<U+017F>t not ask permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, imagining, that <U+017F>ince <hi>Celadon</hi> could not <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> would not grant unto him more priviledge then unto the other. <hi>Bellinde</hi> found <hi>Diana</hi> in a very joyful condition; for the return of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which he made of <hi>Silvanders</hi> health, had almo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tored her fre<U+017F>h com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion into her cheecks; <U+017F>o as after <U+017F>he had rejoyced a while with the Druide, <U+017F>he retired, full of joy that <hi>Diana</hi> promi<U+017F>ed her to ri<U+017F>e the next morning. <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> al<U+017F>o, after a while of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with them, he went unto his Chamber, and de<U+017F>ired <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> to lye in the Chamber of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> that in ca<U+017F>e they <U+017F>hould need any help, <hi>Leonide</hi> might <U+017F>erve them.</p>

I do ask this term only for my con<U+017F>olation, after which we <U+017F>hal be both <U+017F>atisfied according to your own de<U+017F>ires. <hi>Diana</hi> had much a do to make this an<U+017F>wer, but <U+017F>etting <U+017F>uch a face upon it as might be<U+017F>t hide her de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he perfectly contented <hi>Paris,</hi> who not knowing that <U+017F>he took this term only to invent <U+017F>ome way to deliver her <U+017F>elf from the tiranny of <hi>Bellinde:</hi> he verily believed that at the end of the three dayes <U+017F>he would con<U+017F>ent to marry him; Therefore he gave her thanks, as for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t favour <U+017F>he could do him: and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her hand: faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he unto her,) not only the<U+017F>e three dayes, but al<U+017F>o all my life, I <U+017F>hall be yours in all love and obedience.</p>
               <p>This was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> had together, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Adamas</hi> in his talk with <hi>Silvander</hi> did all that he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could, to di<U+017F>cover from whence that grief which he found in the face of that <U+017F>hepherd did proceed: and becau<U+017F>e he had already ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and him, he harped much upon that <U+017F>tring, but found <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>o cold, or rather di<U+017F>creet, as he could gather no <U+017F>atisfaction from thence; Therefore he changed his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: and therefore conceiving that he might give in generall that con<U+017F>olation which he was re<U+017F>olved to apply unto a perticular <U+017F>ubject; Sage <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) do not think it <U+017F>trang if out of an inqui<U+017F>itive curio<U+017F>ity I do intrude my <U+017F>elf into your affaires; you know that we are naturally <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of their intere<U+017F>ts whom we love; <U+017F>o as having a mo<U+017F>t particular affection unto you, I mu<U+017F>t needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly de<U+017F>irous to know from whence tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures which I have ob<U+017F>erved in you, do proceed; Revered Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> the affection which you <U+017F>ay you have unto me, does proceed from that compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which makes men <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the mi<U+017F>eries of one another: and though in this, you do no more for me then is common unto all mi<U+017F>erable people, yet am I extreamly obliged unto you, and wi<U+017F>h that the gods had as much pity upon me as you have. The gods, replied <hi>Adamas,</hi> will do according as they plea<U+017F>e, and not alwayes as we de<U+017F>ire: yet not that our condition is ere the wor<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e all that they do is for our good: but commonly we do judge according unto our unruly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which will not let us waite with patience for that <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e which they would give unto our de<U+017F>ires; Hence it is, that many in complaining of their misfortunes do murmure again<U+017F>t heaven. But as <U+017F>oon as the <U+017F>un of Pro<U+017F>perity begins to <U+017F>hine upon them, then they begin to repent they ever accu<U+017F>ed heaven, or di<U+017F>paired of help, this makes me to <U+017F>ay that a well tempered <U+017F>pirit ought to be alwayes equall and alike, and both in adver<U+017F>ity, and pro<U+017F>perity <U+017F>et the <U+017F>ame face: Believe it <hi>Silvander</hi> (but you know it as well as I) this le<U+017F><U+017F>on is not <U+017F>o hardly learnt, as is thought: a good courage will ma<U+017F>ter all manner of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions: and remember, that to <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all unto the good will of the gods, is undi<U+017F>putably the be<U+017F>t document a man can learn, and the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret of life. I do know Sir (replied <hi>Silvander</hi>) how great the imbecillity of men is, nor am I ignorant of the omnipotency of the gods; I have equally had experience of both, and without looking any farther then my own <U+017F>elf, I can find mo<U+017F>t remarkable examples of it: if I have not <U+017F>o much power over my own <U+017F>oul as to keep it from <U+017F>inking under the blows of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it is not that I am ignorant of my duty, or that I do not mo<U+017F>t humbly <U+017F>ubmit

unto the will of the Gods: But this great imbicelity whereof I <U+017F>peak, and which is almo<U+017F>t intollerable to humanity, does make me indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto any good con<U+017F>ideration.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Silvander</hi> was <U+017F>ilent, and <hi>Adamas</hi> would have <U+017F>poke, but upon a <U+017F>udden he heard a great cry, and <U+017F>aw <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> running to him as fa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> she could: This accident did very much amaze him, and enquiring to know the cou<U+017F>e, Oh (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) do you not <U+017F>ee the Nymphs ready to divorce us; for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens <U+017F>ake let us fly away as fa<U+017F>t as we can: In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he began to run; but the Druid <U+017F>taying her: Madam (<U+017F>aid he) they cannot hurt you, and unle<U+017F>s you be afraid of Marble, you have no rea<U+017F>on to ran away. How? Marble? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) do you not <U+017F>ee them move near us?

               <p>
                  <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> then looking upon her, and <U+017F>eeing that neither <U+017F>he, nor any of the re<U+017F>t were afirighted, <U+017F>he began to take courage; but as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Adamas</hi> told her how tho<U+017F>e Animals came to be metamorphized, Truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I do not more wonder at the Miracle, then at <hi>Galathea,</hi> in her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ye<U+017F>terday of the Inchantment, <U+017F>hould never acquaint me with this particular; after this <U+017F>he was perfectly recollected; and being but a little di<U+017F>tant from the Fountain, The Druid, leaving the company, he advanced almo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e to the Cloud which hung over it: Then falling down upon on his knees, and all the company after his example doing the like, he began this Prayer unto the God of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OH thou Son of</hi> Venus, <hi>adored Deity, who<U+017F>e Empire is above, and over all, and inveterate enemy of confu<U+017F>ion; We be<U+017F>eech thee, as thou did<U+017F>t Chaos, <U+017F>o dispel all the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>orders, and this Enchantment: It is not any curio<U+017F>ity that brought us hither, but thy own command; <U+017F>o as having appointed this day, Let our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience excu<U+017F>e our nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of making this voyage: Pronounce, Oh God of Love, out of pity pronounce what thou ha<U+017F>t de<U+017F>tined in favour of the<U+017F>e Groves: And as the glory of plea<U+017F>ing thee is the only object which we do propo<U+017F>e unto our <U+017F>elves; So let our contentment be the <U+017F>ubject of thy An<U+017F>wers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prayer being ended, <hi>Adamas</hi> returned to the place where the Troop was; and then a little wind did ari<U+017F>e, which wa<U+017F>ted unto our ears the noi<U+017F>e of <U+017F>tirredwaters: Pre<U+017F>ently after, the wind grew more boi<U+017F>terous, and comming only by bla<U+017F>ts, it brought with it great fla<U+017F>hes, like to Lightning, which had but an in<U+017F>tant between their beginning and ending; many affrightning clapps of Thunder followed: Then upon a <U+017F>udden, the Cloud above the Fountain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, one might <U+017F>ee come out by degrees, in the mid<U+017F>t of the water, a huge Ba<U+017F>on of Ja<U+017F>per, upon a Pede<U+017F>tal of Porphery, mo<U+017F>t curiou<U+017F>ly enriched, upon which the God of Love <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf, in the <U+017F>ame form as before he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>At the <U+017F>ight of this Deity, Reverence invited every one to look down; but afterwards, Curio<U+017F>ity rai<U+017F>ing up their looks, they <U+017F>aw that the God of Love held in his left hand a great Azure Table, in which were written the<U+017F>e words, in Letters of Gold.</p>

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53528:218"/>
they heard a murmur, and a noi<U+017F>e, like to the clapping together of many hands: It was an Emblem of that joy which all the Shepherds, and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es did re<U+017F>ent for the happine<U+017F>s of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Celadon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that in<U+017F>tant, the Shepherd did lo<U+017F>e the memory of all the mi<U+017F>eries he had endured; and not knowing how he <U+017F>hould enough thank the God of Love for that happine<U+017F>s which now he <U+017F>aw infallible; he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and not being able to <U+017F>peak one word, his face changed colour two or three times: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> received no le<U+017F>s contentment; <hi>Phillis</hi> was even ravi<U+017F>hed with joy; and <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elf did find <U+017F>ome comfort unto her <U+017F>orrows, in tho<U+017F>e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which were promi<U+017F>ed unto her companion; But as the greate<U+017F>t felicities may <U+017F>ometimes be taken for a pre<U+017F>age of <U+017F>ome future great misfortune, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of that link which does in<U+017F>eparably tye adver<U+017F>ity and pro<U+017F>perity together: So this joy did not long continue in their countenances: For after the God of Love had given them time to <U+017F>ee his plea<U+017F>ure in this Table, pre<U+017F>ently he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and in lieu of Golden Letters written in Azure, they <U+017F>aw in a Silver Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble written in black Characters, the<U+017F>e words.</p>

               <p>The Heavens began to Thunder again, and upon a <U+017F>udden the Clouds and the Tables vani<U+017F>hed.

                  <hi>Lycidas, Thamiros, Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, did not know what countenances to put on, and <hi>Celadon</hi> him<U+017F>elf did forget all his cau<U+017F>es of joy.

Oh God of Love, (<U+017F>aid he in in a loud voice) which do<U+017F>t envy my fedelity, I do give thee thanks for the care thou ha<U+017F>t taken in making me to dye <U+017F>o gloriou<U+017F>ly; I know very well that as death is to tryumph over me, <U+017F>o <hi>Paris</hi> is to tryumph over <hi>Diana</hi>; but <U+017F>ince my mean birth cannot di<U+017F>pute with him for the victory, I cannot think that any command could come from a more pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant God: Here I am, Great God, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey thee; And <U+017F>ince the doom is irrevocable, in ordaining me to live till to morrow, may the Sun turn his hours into munites, and ha<U+017F>ten his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for my <U+017F>ake.

The gods, replied the Druide, do not give <hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Paris</hi> becau<U+017F>e he de<U+017F>ervs her; nor do I think they deny her unto you, for want of any good qualities which may intitle you to a legitimate pre<U+017F>ence unto her: I do very well know both your worths, and for all my affection unto him, I am not <U+017F>o par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially blind, but I al<U+017F>o know what great advantages your wit has above his; but to tell you truly, I think the gods do thus, to <U+017F>hew how oft men are deceived in their judgements, and that the Laws of all humane Prudence, is far inferiour unto tho<U+017F>e that are e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed in heaven: But <hi>Silvander</hi> (continued he) give me leave to part from you a little, that whil<U+017F>t you do joyn with the re<U+017F>t of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I may think upon <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e which may be expedient both for you and me.</p>

The truth is, that having received <U+017F>o many favours from you, it was my duty to acknowledge them; but <U+017F>ince I was able to do it only in my wi<U+017F>hes, in what place could I do it more to your advantage, then in this which I am in que<U+017F>t of?

This meeting was worth the <U+017F>eeing; for <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi> knowing the King at a good di<U+017F>tance off did alight from their hor<U+017F>es, and comming on foote, he was no <U+017F>ooner alighted from his al<U+017F>o but they ca<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves at his feet, and with much humble <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion asked pardon for parting from him. The King received them with open arms, and with <U+017F>ingular expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions of joy at their return did promi<U+017F>e to forgive, and forget all that was pa<U+017F>t, provided they would not give any new cau<U+017F>es of complaint. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> in the mean time came up, and <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>hewing him to the King. <hi>Gondebaut</hi> offered unto him the <U+017F>ervice of him<U+017F>elf, and Kingdom with extraordinary expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Afterwards, he embraced <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Godomar</hi> telling him, that this was he who<U+017F>e arms had prevailed over <hi>Polemas.</hi> I am very glad (<U+017F>aid he) that his valour did make to appear us the inju<U+017F>tice of that rebell, which he had with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a legitimate pretence: after this, he received tho<U+017F>e honours which <hi>Damon, Alcidon</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, did unto him. After which, all taking hor<U+017F>e they rid towards the Town.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as they were come within half a league; they di<U+017F>covered a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, ranged into Battalia, as if they ready to give a battle; They were variou<U+017F>ly armed: <U+017F>ome with <U+017F>lings: <U+017F>ome with bows and arrows: others with pikes, on one arme a backler, and cimiters by there <U+017F>ides. They were about eighteen thou<U+017F>and in number, which made <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> believe that it was the re<U+017F>t of the Army which he had <U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t <hi>Marcellis: Gondebout,</hi> the Princes, and all the re<U+017F>t did pa<U+017F><U+017F>e through the mid<U+017F>t of them: and they were no <U+017F>ooner through, but they were met by four thou<U+017F>and hor<U+017F>e, which waited upon them into the Town.</p>
               <p>At the gates, <hi>Clotilda</hi> waited for their comming, and with her a hundred of the faire<U+017F>t Ladies in all Lions, who appeared upon milk white Hor<U+017F>es, with <U+017F>eemed proud to bear <U+017F>uch loudes of beauty. At the arrivall of the Princes, <hi>Clotilda</hi> only alighted, whom <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond and Godamar</hi> embraced, and whom <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion, Damon, Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>aluted with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible honour and re<U+017F>pect. Afterwards they all got up again, and went unto the Temple of Venus, where the mu<U+017F>ique of voices, and in<U+017F>truments received them, and helped to render thanks unto the gods for their <U+017F>afe return: from thence they went unto the Athenian Garden, where <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had the lodgings of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> and was plea<U+017F>ed that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond, Godamar</hi> and <hi>Clotilda,</hi> <U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o be there to keep him Company.</p>
               <p>All this day was <U+017F>pent in fea<U+017F>ts, and when night came all the Court went upon the water to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome fireworks of joy which were prepared ju<U+017F>t where the ro<U+017F>ne, and the Arar do contract a marriage, and from thence till they come to the Sea, do lie lovingly together in one bed; one might well imagine that this was not done without de<U+017F>ign, but this place was purpo<U+017F>ely cho<U+017F>en to denote the reunion of Children and Father. But however, many fine <U+017F>ights were <U+017F>een, and the King

returned <U+017F>ingularly well <U+017F>atisfied. For my part, my greate<U+017F>t admiration was the diligence of the workmen, and excellence of their invention, having <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time for it.</p>

Upon this <hi>Clotilda</hi> was quite out of countenance, and in her a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, not knowing where he <U+017F>hould hear all the<U+017F>e things, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o affraid that he would puni<U+017F>h her for entertaining the <U+017F>ecrets of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> that falling down upon her knees, <U+017F>he began to implore his mercy, and aske him pardon. But the King commanding her to ri<U+017F>e, he took her hand, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her; Nay nay Daughter (<U+017F>aid he) never fear that you have angred me; I know what care you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to quench his flame, and I am <U+017F>ure, it is not long of you, that he has not complied with my humour; but <U+017F>ince neither your endeavours nor mine can bring him to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e I conceive it expedient, to this which I will communicate unto you as the la<U+017F>t remedye: in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he cau<U+017F>ed her to <U+017F>it down at his beds feet, and then he continued thus,</p>
               <p>It is probable <hi>Clotilda</hi> that you do know what <U+017F>perit <hi>Dorinde</hi> is of, and that being of <U+017F>o ambitious a temper as <U+017F>he is, no doubt but though <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> be very amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and han<U+017F>ome, yet <U+017F>he loves him as much for his quality as his per<U+017F>on. Now you mu<U+017F>t know that when <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons of her quality, do arrive at any high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour, they alwayes become mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>ufferable, and u<U+017F>e a mo<U+017F>t tiranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and dominering authority over all: they think the Sunnes does <U+017F>hine only to plea<U+017F>e them, and charge the earth with ingratitude, if it do not produce her faire<U+017F>t flowers in all places where they <U+017F>hall honour it with their feet; Truth is, they are full of <U+017F>o much dangerous vanity, that (judging fal<U+017F>ly of all things) if they think any one to be an ob<U+017F>tacle unto their fortune or ambition, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently are plotting to ruine them; and are never quiet till they have done it. I <U+017F>peak this, partly in relation unto you <hi>Clotilda</hi>; to the end you may <U+017F>ecure your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, as though I <U+017F>hould faile you, yet, that you may never fall into <U+017F>uch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities as I have mentioned, which doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e will come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, if <hi>Dorinde</hi> ever bring about her de<U+017F>ignes: for as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> marry her, <U+017F>he, who as you know is only the Daughter of <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> will become <U+017F>o proud to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf Queen of the Burgundians, as for getting her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he will al<U+017F>o forget what is due unto your merit and quality; The va<U+017F>t difference that is betwixt her extraction and yours, will make her <U+017F>o a<U+017F>hamed to appear where you <U+017F>hould be, as perhaps will beget <U+017F>uch a hatred in her <U+017F>oul, that your life may be in danger. This is the danger, which threatens you: and if you do come to a fatall end, it is meerly your own fault, <U+017F>ince the remedy is yet in your own hands, which is <hi>Clotilda,</hi> by all meanes to quench this fire, which has already broken out into <U+017F>uch great flames.</p>
               <p>Judge Madam, how ea<U+017F>ily the <U+017F>pirit of a young lady might receive all the impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions: The King had no <U+017F>ooner done his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e but he had infu<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>trange mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t in to the <U+017F>oul of this young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all the<U+017F>e misfortunes would come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e in ca<U+017F>e this affection continued: So as forgetting what <U+017F>he owed

unto the amity of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> and preparing her <U+017F>elf to do what<U+017F>oever the King commanded again<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde</hi>; Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, my fears of being mi<U+017F>erable, <U+017F>hall not be the motive to make me obey you; but it <U+017F>hall be my de<U+017F>ires to make you know that I will never be ungrateful unto your goodne<U+017F>s: Therefore I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to tell me what I mu<U+017F>t do, that I may pre<U+017F>ently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it, and by that you may judge of my affection. Truth is (<U+017F>aid the King) ha<U+017F>te is very requi<U+017F>ite in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; for in <U+017F>uch matters, delays are dangerous, and often marre all; you mu<U+017F>t therefore of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity get that half Ring which is in the hands of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible expedition. Oh Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Clotil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and interrupted) I doubt it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; for did you <U+017F>ee with what care he kept it, you would wonder; he looked upon it, he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, he laid to his heart, he talked to it as if <hi>Dorinde</hi> were pre<U+017F>ent; and therefore I am afraid that being <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, it will be a great difficulty to get it from him. It is not my de<U+017F>ign to attempt it openly (<U+017F>aid the King) or by violence, you know <U+017F>uch ways have been already u<U+017F>ed without effect; but I would have us go about it by cunning, and do all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we can to deceive him: Oh (replied <hi>Clotilda</hi>) it is hard deceiving <U+017F>uch mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful <U+017F>pirits as his: you may be deceived (replied <hi>Gondebaut</hi>) <U+017F>o you will do as I <U+017F>hall direct, which doubtle<U+017F>s will be an ea<U+017F>ie matter to do, <U+017F>ince he takes you under the notion of a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and not as one who would divert his affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clotilda</hi> promi<U+017F>ing to do her be<U+017F>t, the King continued thus: You daughter have <U+017F>een this Ring, and you know what mettle and <U+017F>ize it is, get another made of the <U+017F>ame, and as like it as you can; then breaking it in two, keep the one half, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> will certainly come to you, as he did the la<U+017F>t night, and will be as cerimonious to this Ring as before: when he does, take your half in one hand, and take his in the other, and when he asks for it again, in lieu of his, give him yours; it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould perceive it; for not having the other to compare them together, nor mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting your de<U+017F>ign, he will beleive it the <U+017F>ame he brought from Marcelles, which done, we will proceed further, and to morrow I will tell you how,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clotilda</hi> thought this invention to be excellent, and very fea<U+017F>able; and after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>worn to u<U+017F>e her be<U+017F>t endeavours: Well <hi>Clotilda</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Gondebaut</hi>) you mu<U+017F>t now give me this contentment, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>worn it, and I de<U+017F>ire it: This invention is the only Remedy we have, and I will u<U+017F>e it: If you do your be<U+017F>t endeavours, you <U+017F>hall ere long <U+017F>ee how much I love you; and if on the contrary, I find you fail me, and that my de<U+017F>ign do come to be di<U+017F>covered (which can no way be but by want of good-will, or gro<U+017F>s indi<U+017F>cretion) be certain, I will take it as the greate<U+017F>t injury I ever received from any enemy.

               <p>I wil not abu<U+017F>e your ears, Madam, with too preci<U+017F>e a relation of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circum<U+017F>tance, which is not fully pertinent to my purpo<U+017F>e; It will <U+017F>uffice you know that all this day was <U+017F>pent in hunting, and part of the night in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, After which <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> failed not to accompany <hi>Clotilda</hi> in her Chamber; for in the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> he took delight in nothing <U+017F>o much as in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her: Among<U+017F>t other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e they fell into talk of the Ring; and as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> had taken it out of his Box, he <U+017F>hewed it unto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s, who took it into her hand as if <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to look upon the fa<U+017F>hion of it; whe <U+017F>he had it, <U+017F>he put both her hands behind her, <U+017F>he left <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> Ring on the <U+017F>tool, and kept only that which <U+017F>he had provided; afterwards holding out both her hands to him <U+017F>hut: I hold a wager (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) that you gue<U+017F>s not in which it is. The Prince, who never mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted her fallacie; I hold a wager (<U+017F>aid he and <U+017F>miled) it is in that hand: In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he touched <hi>Clotil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> right hand, and opening it he found only the counterfeit of that which he <U+017F>ought for; yet <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it to be the very <U+017F>ame which <hi>Dorinde</hi> gave him, he innocently took it, and looking upon the Prince<U+017F>s: Oh Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he and <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) you mu<U+017F>t know that love can do any thing, and though he be blind, yet

nothing can be hid from him: In <U+017F>saying <U+017F>o, he laid this counterfeit part of the Ring to his lips, and <hi>Clotilde</hi> <U+017F>eeing him ki<U+017F>s it with <U+017F>o much devotion and zeal, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile; but pre<U+017F>ently after hearing him <U+017F>igh, her <U+017F>oul re<U+017F>ented <U+017F>ome little kind of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and therefore <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto her <U+017F>elf, Oh <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond,</hi> did<U+017F>t thou but know how much mi<U+017F>ery my Artifice is preparing for thee, thou would<U+017F>t turn all thy <U+017F>ighs of love into <U+017F>ighs of rage and di<U+017F>pair: Upon this thought <U+017F>he repented that ever con<U+017F>ented unto this Trea<U+017F>on; but then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to memory the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> and con<U+017F>idering how inevitable her ruine would be, if <U+017F>he did not pur<U+017F>ue her enterpri<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he thought it be<U+017F>t to fini<U+017F>h what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o happily begun: But becau<U+017F>e the night was far <U+017F>pent, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>mond</hi> who would never have been weary of her company, did not think of retiring, <U+017F>he put him in minde of it; and when he was gone <U+017F>he went to bed.</p>
               <p>The next morning, <U+017F>he got up betimes, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he imagined the King would <U+017F>end for her, to what <U+017F>he had done: And indeed <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner dre<U+017F>t, but a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger came according to her expectation: As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he came into his Chamber; Come <hi>Clotilda</hi> (<U+017F>aid the King unto her) have we gotten this Ring? we cannot get it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clotilde</hi> and <U+017F>miled) out of his hands; why? (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> and began to be angry) becau<U+017F>e it is not there (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clotilda</hi> and <U+017F>till <U+017F>miled) for it is in mine; and that you may not doubt of it, <U+017F>ee here the accompli<U+017F>hment of your de<U+017F>ire, and my promi<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the King took it, and <U+017F>eeming highly <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fied with the diligence of <hi>Clotilda</hi>; Do not think (<U+017F>aid he) that whil<U+017F>t you were at work, I was idle; they have promi<U+017F>ed to bring me a man hither this morning, who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Squillinder,</hi> and who, if I mi<U+017F>take not, did formerly live in Forre<U+017F>ts, and fled hither for refuge: Now they tell me this man is the rare<U+017F>t in the world at counterfetting all manner of hands; which if he be, he <U+017F>hall write a Letter from <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that will do the deed; only one thing troubles me, I cannot think upon one that is fit to execute the re<U+017F>t of my plot; for he mu<U+017F>t be a man of excellent wit and judgment, and one, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that has <U+017F>ome colour of pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Then <hi>Clotilda</hi> began to think a little; afterwards upon a <U+017F>udden: There are many (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) who have loved her, and I know two who do at this very in<U+017F>tant loue her, and are here; you may chu<U+017F>e which of them you think mo<U+017F>t fit for your purpo<U+017F>e: Then <U+017F>he named <hi>Periander,</hi> and <hi>Merindor.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as the King heard my name, he clapped his hands together, and <U+017F>eemed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly glad: I am certain (<U+017F>aid he) this Cavileir will do what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hall bid him.

And how hard it is for us to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the charms of their Commands, e<U+017F>pecially when they come with any appearance of Ju<U+017F>tice: <hi>Gondebaut</hi> had not <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>ent for me, but he told me all that I have told you; and after this, and a world of mountainous promi<U+017F>es, in ca<U+017F>e I could win <hi>Dorinde</hi> to marry me, he did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly engage me to do what<U+017F>oever he would.

               <p>This done, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Squillander,</hi> and commanded <hi>Ardilan</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence double to what the Fellow could expect: After this, hee turned him<U+017F>elf unto mee; See here <hi>Menandor</hi> (<U+017F>aid hee unto mee) now all depends upon your good management of the matter: I have already told you, that if you proceed hand<U+017F>omly, you <U+017F>hall receive advantages from mee beyond your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>atisfaction of your Love unto <hi>Dorinde:</hi> you have wit enough to manage this mater aright; and though you had no intere<U+017F>t in it but mine, yet that is enough to make mee hope well in your proceeding, I would have you go about it as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, and that you go unto <hi>Dorinde</hi> as <U+017F>ent from <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond:</hi> When you come fir<U+017F>t to her, upon the fir<U+017F>t opportunity of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, tell her that <U+017F>hee is not to pretend any more unto the Crown of the Burgundians, <U+017F>ince it is already de<U+017F>tiny'd from the daughter of the King of Theurons, to whose Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors, <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and I have <U+017F>igned the Articles: I know that this will much afflict her; but a man of your accompli<U+017F>hments will make her take this lo<U+017F><U+017F>e with little grief; e<U+017F>pecially if you tell her, (as your Love will dictate unto you) that <U+017F>till <U+017F>hee <U+017F>hall be a Queen, and raign <U+017F>overaignly in your heart. I an<U+017F>wered him, That I was wholly devoted to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but there was one ob<U+017F>tacle in my way, which was, that I was engaged to run at the Ring with Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> this very day; and <U+017F>hould I fail him, <U+017F>omething might perhaps be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the King <U+017F>cratched his head a long time together, and <U+017F>aid not a word: afterwards upon a <U+017F>udden, It is no matter (<U+017F>aid hee) if you go not till night; for let <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion, Lindamor</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Cavaliers be as ha<U+017F>ty as they will to return unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tay them till to morrow, to the end, that before they can tell <hi>Dorinde Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> is not married, you may have time enough to get her con<U+017F>ent to marry you: and if I be not much mi<U+017F>taken, you will finde no great difficulty in it: For very <U+017F>pite to <U+017F>ee that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> has ca<U+017F>t her off, will make her content to what you will; and to be revenged, will give unto you that Empire which my <U+017F>on pretended unto. Which if it come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, never fear what <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> can do afterwards: For if hee offer to attempt any thing again<U+017F>t you, or again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>ervice, I <U+017F>hall take a cour<U+017F>e to keep him within compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of his duty.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:53528:224"/>
from the King, and which Love making mee as blinde as him<U+017F>elf did move me to undertake: For certainly, had I not been <U+017F>tark blinde, I <U+017F>hould have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>een the misfortune which hapned unto mee <U+017F>ince. But to proceed; be plea<U+017F>ed to know, Great Nymph, that the Cour<U+017F>e at the Ring being ended<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> where every one did very well, and wherein <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Lindamor</hi> among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, did get a mo<U+017F>t high e<U+017F>teem, I departed with a re<U+017F>olution to ride all the night; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rain <U+017F>o extreamly, as I was con<U+017F>trained to tarry at the fir<U+017F>t Town I came at. The next morning, which was ye<U+017F>terday, I got up betimes, and came unto you very early. I <U+017F>hall not need to tell you with what an eye <hi>Dorinde</hi> looked upon mee, for you were a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it: but let mee tell you, it was with a kinder a<U+017F>pect than <U+017F>hee would, had <U+017F>hee known the me<U+017F><U+017F>age which, I brought, I told her, that I had a Letter to pre<U+017F>ent unto her from Prince <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond:</hi> and then I <U+017F>aw through her eyes the contentment of her <U+017F>oul; but becau<U+017F>e you were ready to <U+017F>it down at the Table, I did not pre<U+017F>ent it untill wee were ri<U+017F>en. Perhaps Madam, you ob<U+017F>erved how <U+017F>hee took mee a<U+017F>ide: Indeed I did (an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) and I made a doubt whether it was for the love of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> or your<U+017F>elf: Then Madam you mu<U+017F>t know (<U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor</hi>) that <U+017F>eeing none near to interrupt us, fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hee asked for the Letter which the Prince had <U+017F>ent; upon which, <U+017F>eeming to look for it, and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to prepare her for reading of it. But fair <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid I) it <U+017F>eems you expect <U+017F>ome great contentment from this Letter: Why not? (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>hee and <U+017F>miled) <U+017F>ince the Prince has done mee the honour to write it. I cannot tell (<U+017F>aid I, and <U+017F>eemed as if I could not yet finde it) but upon this I <U+017F>topped: And <hi>Dorinde</hi> looking mee in the face, <U+017F>hee found there <U+017F>uch coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>hee began to fear that all was not <U+017F>o well as <U+017F>hee imagined: <U+017F>hee pre<U+017F>ently changed colour, and hoping that I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, It <U+017F>eemes <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee unto mee) you have a minde to make mee buy the contentment of this Letter very dear: but pray give it mee; for the favour is at <U+017F>o high a rate, as I <U+017F>hall never be able to pay it. Shee had no <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, but I found it, and pre<U+017F>enting it unto her, Here Madam (<U+017F>aid I) may you finde in it as much contentment as you expect. The<U+017F>e words did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the feares of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>o as receiving the Letter with a troubled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <U+017F>hee opened it with a trembling hand, and at la<U+017F>t read it: Shee had no <U+017F>ooner read two or three of the fir<U+017F>t lines, but <U+017F>hee tryed whether or no her eyes had deceived her; and pointing with her finger at the words which were <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her, in hopes to find <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ence in them, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till found the <U+017F>ame, and <U+017F>o read on to the end of this <U+017F>ad Letter. And when <U+017F>hee came to the place where <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> advi<U+017F>ed her to <U+017F>eek for happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in my armes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did then <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e her, and I heard her <U+017F>ay in a low voice, Yes, yes, per<U+017F>idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, could I but pull out of thy brea<U+017F>t that heart which thou did<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e to pre<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o faithfully: upon this, <U+017F>hee began to <U+017F>igh, and to be quite out of countenance; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he cryed in good earne<U+017F>t: And chu<U+017F>ing rather that I <U+017F>hould be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her teares, then you, <U+017F>hee turned her <U+017F>elf towards mee, and when <U+017F>hee could <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>aid thus unto mee: I cannot tell <hi>Merindor,</hi> from whence <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden change <U+017F>hould proceed; Pray tell mee, if you can? Faire <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) perhaps that Letter will give you a better accompt then I can: No (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>hee) it mentions nothing at all, but onely that hee is married, and I wi<U+017F>h to heaven I had dyed before I heard that word: Then Madam, replied I, I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with the Circum<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the end I may le<U+017F><U+017F>en your <U+017F>orrowes and pardon his Infidelitie. Then I told her all that I could invent to colour this Lye: I told her that <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner entered into Lyons, but Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adours from the King of Theurons came to treat about this alliance: and that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> having found it very advantageous, had turned every <U+017F>tone, and u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o many arguments to per<U+017F>wade <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> unto it, as at the la<U+017F>t hee con<U+017F>ented: That afterwards, the Prince would have <U+017F>toln away, but being prevented, <hi>Clotilda</hi> was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to per<U+017F>wade him unto this marriage: That this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e was once out of all hopes to bring it about; but at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hee tampered <U+017F>o with him, and had <U+017F>uch a prevalence with him, as <U+017F>hee made him <U+017F>igne the Articles, and at the

To this I added a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ignes of <U+017F>orrow, that I <U+017F>hould be the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad newes: and only received the Commi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to get the opportunity of putting her in memory of my former <U+017F>ervices, and not to grieve her. My di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and her teares did end both together, and I prote<U+017F>t Madam, I was amuzed to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>orrowes <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon vani<U+017F>h; at lea<U+017F>t; I ob<U+017F>erved in her countenance a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange alteration, and was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ed man in the world, when I heard her <U+017F>ay; Since I mu<U+017F>t knew the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of this per<U+017F>idious Prince, I am not <U+017F>orry <hi>Merindor,</hi> that you have brought mee the newes. Know therefore, that I will content you for it very <U+017F>hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and end my dayes with you. After this, <U+017F>hee left mee and went towards you: For my part, I was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied man upon earth; and wi<U+017F>hed that the night was already pa<U+017F>t, hoping <U+017F>hee would perform her promi<U+017F>e in the morning: which indeed <U+017F>hee did; but Madam in a farre different manner from what I expected: and <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>hee went to work.

You, who never <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected her de<U+017F>igne, did lend it unto her: but you were no <U+017F>ooner gone, then <U+017F>hee took mee unto the Coach with her, and commanded the Coachman to carry her unto Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu.

Poor <hi>Silvander,</hi> I am the only one for whom thou dye<U+017F>t, and the only one who does not accompany thee in this <U+017F>ad journey: In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf up in the window, the better to look upon her lover: But <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> fearing <U+017F>he would throw her <U+017F>elf down, catched hold of her: Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> unto her) though this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be without remedy, and your <U+017F>orrows infinite, yet I be<U+017F>eech you allow <U+017F>omething to our affection, and for our <U+017F>akes <U+017F>trive again<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>pair, which does every moment in<U+017F>pire you with <U+017F>ome fatal de<U+017F>ign again<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf: Ah Si<U+017F>ter (replied <hi>Diana</hi>) tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>afe in the Port, may well look upon tho<U+017F>e that are in danger of <U+017F>hipwrack, and wi<U+017F>h them well; had you the <U+017F>ame pain I have, you would reject all Coun<U+017F>els that <U+017F>hould advi<U+017F>e you to live: And why do you condemn that in me, which you would put in practi<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf,

were you in my room? No, no, companion, I mu<U+017F>t follow <hi>Silvander</hi>; no con<U+017F>ideration what<U+017F>oever can divert me from it; and if you will oblige me, go both of you, and be pre<U+017F>ent at this Ceremony, where the mo<U+017F>t amiable Victime is to be <U+017F>acrifized, that ever was, for having no confidents but you, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any others will give me <U+017F>o faithful a relation of his la<U+017F>t actions.</p>

                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> who conceived that <hi>Diana</hi> had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on for this reque<U+017F>t did think it be<U+017F>t for <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to take this office upon her; and turning towards <hi>Diana,</hi> Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you mu<U+017F>t not imagine that both of us will accept of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion; I mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>tay with you, for I will not leave you to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your di<U+017F>pair; You do oblige me (replied <hi>Diana</hi> faintly) by your cares to pre<U+017F>erve me; but the favour which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will do me, will do no le<U+017F>s if <U+017F>he will take <U+017F>o much pains as to relate unto me me the circum<U+017F>tances of <hi>Silvanders</hi> death: And therefore, dear <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and turned towards her) I be<U+017F>eech you do not deny me this <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>ince it is the only one I expect in this extreamite: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> dur<U+017F>t not contradict the de<U+017F>ires of her companion; but promi<U+017F>ing to give her a faithful relation of all things, <U+017F>he departed: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the great companion was not yet gone far from the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he quickly overtook them, and a little after found <hi>Celadon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> all this while never <U+017F>tirred from the window; but keeping her eyes <U+017F>till fixed upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>till thought what means <U+017F>he could invent not to be long after him. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who al<U+017F>o beheld the order of this Ceremony, and having no particular object whereon to fix her looks, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lycidas</hi> in that multitude was not knowable, <U+017F>he looked one while upon one thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while upon another. She <U+017F>aw the Eubages and the Vaces going fir<U+017F>t, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and other In<U+017F>truments u<U+017F>ed in Sacrifices. After them, went <hi>Adamas</hi> holding <hi>Silvander</hi> in his hand; and <U+017F>ome eight or ten paces after him, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> betwixt <hi>Godamar</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi>: A little after, <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved <hi>Bellinde, Ro<U+017F>anira, Galathea, Madonthe,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, whom the Cavaliers led by the Arm: And becau<U+017F>e all the re<U+017F>t followed in confu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he could not find <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi> which made her think; that perhaps he would not be a <U+017F>pectator of this <U+017F>ad Ceremony.</p>
               <p>In this con<U+017F>ideration, neither <hi>Diana,</hi> nor <U+017F>he, could re<U+017F>train their tears: but when the di<U+017F>tance of place, and thickne<U+017F>s of Trees had in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly taken from them the <U+017F>ight of this great company; Then was <hi>Diana</hi> afflicted beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure; <U+017F>he did not only lo<U+017F>e her <U+017F>peech, but was very near loo<U+017F>ing her life: yet finding in this extremity <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubject of con<U+017F>olation: Come, come (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he upon a <U+017F>udden) away with the<U+017F>e unprofitable complaints, <hi>Silvander</hi> has no need of my tears or <U+017F>ighs; if I will give him any contentment in his <U+017F>econd life I mu<U+017F>t accompany him with my <U+017F>oul. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he left the window; and by fortune ca<U+017F>ting her eye upon a little Cabinet of Ebony, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pyed a knife, which <U+017F>he and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome two days before, when they did eat in the Chamber; <U+017F>he had a good de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>eize upon it, but fearing that <hi>Phillis</hi> would <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he let it alone, and walking up and down the Chamber, <U+017F>he watched till her companions eyes were off her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillis</hi> no <U+017F>ooner turned her <U+017F>elf another way, but <hi>Diana</hi> went to the Cabinet, and having <U+017F>eized upon the<U+017F>e Arms, <U+017F>he went to bed: <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he came unto her, and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> did nothing but <U+017F>igh; Alas, dear <hi>Diana</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I <U+017F>ee it is vain to flatter our <U+017F>elves with hopes of any remedy: It is by the will of the Gods that <hi>Silvander</hi> is ravi<U+017F>hed from us, and we have no better way then to beg as much patience as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to endure this extream misfortune: For my part, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I have already prepared my <U+017F>elf, and do prote<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>o good a remedy with me, I find my grief nothing <U+017F>o violent. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who knew not that <U+017F>he had got a knife, did imagine that <U+017F>he took her for this good remedy, and therefore <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered her thus: Certainly, dear <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, if your griefs may be ea<U+017F>ed by my re<U+017F>entments, they <U+017F>hall quickly cea<U+017F>e their violence: For mine are <U+017F>o great, as I may <U+017F>afely <U+017F>ay they do equal yours; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I would do any thing that would conduce unto your con<U+017F>olation. Dear Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) I know very well that you are very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of my <U+017F>ufferings;

and that your affection and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion would make you do any thing to ea<U+017F>e me.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, the<U+017F>e two Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es entertained each other in expectation of <hi>Astreas</hi> return; and in the mean time <hi>Silvander</hi> came to the place where death was to triumph over him. There was not one in all the company which did not change colour when they <U+017F>aw the pile of wood, he only looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it without the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>may.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the Druide was got upon it, and the Eubages and their ve<U+017F><U+017F>els<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and and knife, and all in readine<U+017F><U+017F>e, he him<U+017F>elf got up al<U+017F>o; and kneeling down, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon the cloud which covered the Fountain of Verity. <hi>King of <U+017F>ouls</hi> (<U+017F>aid he with mo<U+017F>t admirable con<U+017F>tancy) <hi>Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Deity who never had in heaven any thing <U+017F>o fair as the eyes of</hi> Diana: <hi>O great God of Love; <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t die to <U+017F>atisfie for the <U+017F>in which my pre<U+017F>umption hath committed in adoring her: Receive<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>weet Tyrant, this te<U+017F>timony of my obedience, and what puni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>oever my Crime had merited; yet let thy wrath be appea<U+017F>ed by my death.</hi> Upon this he ro<U+017F>e up, and after he had put off his dublet, he made a <U+017F>ign to the Druide that he was ready to die: his great re<U+017F>olution did a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h all the <U+017F>pectatours, and even the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible did <U+017F>hed tears at the misfortune of this Shepherd; but above all, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Celadon</hi> appeared the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>adly afflicted: for as the one lamented the Fate of <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> <U+017F>o the other grieved no le<U+017F><U+017F>e for the misfortune of <hi>Diana. Adamas,</hi> for his part, he doubted whether he had life enough to our-live this Sacrifice: yet con<U+017F>idering, that it was the will of the gods, he began to put his hand to the work.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>caffold which he had cau<U+017F>ed to be erected, was about <U+017F>ome two yards in height, and that it might hold the more wood, it was <U+017F>ix yards in length, and as much in bredth: As <U+017F>oon as all things were in readine<U+017F><U+017F>e, the Druide took two great Tapers which he lighed at the fire, which one of the Bubages carried in a <U+017F>ilver chafingdi<U+017F>h, and giving them unto two other Hubages; he commanded them to go nine times about the <U+017F>caffold. After this, but with a trembling hand, he took the knife, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to the Shepherd, he asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had con<U+017F>tancy enough to die, without his eyes being blinded; and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> prote<U+017F>ting, with abundance of alacrity, that the minute of his death, was the <U+017F>weet oft minute of all his life, he opened his bre<U+017F>t to receive the blow: but <hi>Adamas</hi> being in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort offended at his forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e: <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him in a low voice) the ha<U+017F>te which you make to die, is indeed an argument of your courage; but it may al<U+017F>o be an argument of your di<U+017F>pair: The gods do not like precipitate actions, and therefore I conjure you to wait with a little more patience, for the blow which you are to receive. We do u<U+017F>e in our Sacrifices to <U+017F>prinkle the <U+017F>caffold with <U+017F>ome drops of blood which we take from the Victime which is to be <U+017F>acrificed: and therefore, not to go again<U+017F>t this order, I will <U+017F>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the wood with yours, upon which you are to die. <hi>Silvander</hi> made no an<U+017F>wer unto the words of <hi>Adamas</hi>; but after he had <U+017F>hewed him that he was ready to obey what<U+017F>oever he commanded, the Druide took hold upon his arm a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the hand, and the Shepherd him<U+017F>elf turned up the <U+017F>lieve of his <U+017F>hirt, left is <U+017F>hould be any hindrance unto his de<U+017F>ign: an Eubage pre<U+017F>ently brought a ba<U+017F>in to receive the blood, and <hi>Adamas</hi> lifted up his hand to make the wound: But he no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eye upon the place which he was to cut, but a <U+017F>trange a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <U+017F>eized upon him: At fir<U+017F>t, he could not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>tir, or take his eyes off the arm of <hi>Silvander</hi>; afterwards, perceiving him<U+017F>elf to weaken upon a <U+017F>udden, he let fall the knife, and taking the Shepherd about the neck, O <hi>Silvander</hi> (cryed he out) O <hi>Paris,</hi> my <U+017F>on <hi>Paris</hi>: In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, his <U+017F>trength quite failed him, and <hi>Silvander</hi> him<U+017F>elf having not <U+017F>o much as to hold him up, they fell both together upon the <U+017F>caffold.</p>
               <p>At the <U+017F>ight of this accident, tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>tood at a little di<U+017F>tance gave a great cry, imagining that <hi>Silvander</hi> had received his Fatal blow; yet <U+017F>eeing <hi>Adamas</hi> to fall fir<U+017F>t, they thought that the Sacrificer was him<U+017F>elf become the Victime: At that in<U+017F>tant the two Tapers did miraculou<U+017F>ly extingui<U+017F>h of them<U+017F>elves, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of the Bubages; and <hi>Paris,</hi> ravi<U+017F>hed at this <U+017F>pectacle, and that he

<U+017F>hould be named, went pre<U+017F>ently up the <U+017F>caffold. He was no <U+017F>ooner there, but the Druide a<U+017F><U+017F>umed his <U+017F>pirits and <U+017F>trength, and falling down upon his knees: Mo<U+017F>t pitiful and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate gods (cryed he out) who never <U+017F>uffers us to <U+017F>peak any untruth, I give you mo<U+017F>t hearty thanks for the great favour you have done me: Pardon me, if in de<U+017F>pairing of your goodne<U+017F>s, I did murmure again<U+017F>t the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your infinite benignity: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I have <U+017F>inned as a mortal man, but I will make a vow to <U+017F>erve you as my Soveraign Tautates, and promi<U+017F>e to offer upon your Altars, continual Victimes: After this, he ro<U+017F>e up; and <U+017F>eeing the whole A<U+017F><U+017F>embly was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed then he, he took <hi>Paris</hi> in one hand, and holding <hi>Silvander</hi> in the other, he rai<U+017F>ed his voice to as loud a <U+017F>train as he could, and began to <U+017F>peak in this manner.</p>
               <p>I mu<U+017F>t make here a Publick confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a private action, and in the <U+017F>ight of all Forre<U+017F>t declare that, which until now was never known unto any but the gods and my <U+017F>elf. I do prote<U+017F>t, that this is <hi>Paris</hi> (<U+017F>aid he and <U+017F>hewed <hi>Silvander</hi>) this who has born that (<U+017F>aid he and <U+017F>hewed <hi>Paris</hi>) is not my <U+017F>on, but only by adoption, and as affection, or rather piety moved me to give him that name and title. But becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a change is not ordinary, I am in<U+017F>pired to give you my rea<U+017F>ons, to the end all men may learn never to de<U+017F>pair in the goodne<U+017F>s and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of heaven. Know then, that when the valour of <hi>Aetius</hi> added glory to the Grandure of the Romane Empire, and when the Prudence of this great Captain had gotten to him<U+017F>elf the government of Gaul, this countrey which had enjoyed a <U+017F>ecure peace for many ages before, did now find that it was not without enemies; and it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but my Intere<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a misfortune which was then common unto all the<U+017F>e Provinces, I quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found how barbarous the in<U+017F>olency of tho<U+017F>e are, who look after profit more then glory in their triumphs, for they delight in nothing but de<U+017F>truction, and in plundering all that pre<U+017F>ents it <U+017F>elf unto their infatiable fury. Their rage did not only reach <U+017F>o far as to ravi<U+017F>h all that was precious in my hou<U+017F>e, but al<U+017F>o they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hed away my <U+017F>on, who was the only <U+017F>tay of all my hopes. I did what I could to hinder them, I told them, he could not do them any <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>ince he was but five years of age: I be<U+017F>eeched them to have <U+017F>ome pity upon his innocency and my affliction; I u<U+017F>ed all the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions that either <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s or de<U+017F>pair could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pire: But neither compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at my tears, nor re<U+017F>pect which was due unto my quality, nor the horrour of their crime, were able to move them, but rather made them more furious; and do what I could, they would needs commit two faults: the one, in taking away my <U+017F>on, and the other in leaving me alive. After this misfortune, I remained without child, and without con<U+017F>olation; my cares became my food, and my tears my drink, and but for the charge which I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon me to exerci<U+017F>e, certainly I had followed the<U+017F>e ravi<U+017F>hers of my <U+017F>on, or el<U+017F>e confined my <U+017F>elf unto <U+017F>ome horrid <U+017F>olitude: But <U+017F>ince I could not leave the duty of a Druide I was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>tay in the <U+017F>ame place where every object did pre<U+017F>ent my lo<U+017F>s before my eyes.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, I went to take the air along the banks of Lignon; there I mu<U+017F>ed upon my lo<U+017F>s, and how deplorable it was, and when I was in the depth of my melancholy thoughts, I heard the voice of a child crying very near me: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently being <U+017F>truck with a <U+017F>ecret joy, I went that way, and was not long before I found him: he was <U+017F>et upon the very brink of the bank, and <U+017F>o near, that his tears dropped into the water: for all his <U+017F>orrows, he <U+017F>eemed very fair, and I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that imagining his de<U+017F>tiny to be like unto that of <hi>Paris,</hi> I conceived a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection to him, and took him along with me: I did what I could to know who were his Parents, but being, as I conceive, younger then <hi>Paris,</hi> he could not give me any <U+017F>atisfaction. I had no <U+017F>ooner brought him home, but being proud of this new prey, I began to find <U+017F>ome comfort in my affliction, and to thank the gods, that after the lo<U+017F>s of my <U+017F>on they had <U+017F>ent me another, unto whom I might in rea<U+017F>on give that title, <U+017F>ince I was no le<U+017F>s then a Father unto him in pre<U+017F>erving his life.</p>
               <p>I commanded therefore all tho<U+017F>e who were witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter not to <U+017F>peak of it unto any; and charging them to call this Chide by the others

name, they did all <U+017F>o well obey mee, that none know of my misfortune: and there was not any in all Forre<U+017F>ts, who did not think this <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Paris</hi> to be the <U+017F>ame which the Gods had given mee for a Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or. Yet <U+017F>ince this day the Gods have di<U+017F>covered the truth, and permitted mee to finde in <hi>Silvanders</hi> arme the only mark by which I could know him, it is mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, that I do declare him to be the true <hi>Paris:</hi> in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o; hee embraced <hi>Silvander</hi> again with teares in his eyes; afterwards turning up the <U+017F>leeve of his <U+017F>hirt, hee <U+017F>hewed unto all tho<U+017F>e that were near the <U+017F>caffold the branch of Mis<U+017F>leto, which hee had imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon his arme, and which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>hee had once <U+017F>een, when being in a <U+017F>wound, <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>tole from him a bracelet which hee wore: After this <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> beginning to <U+017F>peak: But (<U+017F>aid hee) though this <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Paris</hi> cannot now be called my Son, yet I doe prote<U+017F>t I will <U+017F>till love him as well as if hee hee were; and marrying him unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> I will give him <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hare in my e<U+017F>tate as <U+017F>hall keep him from beating any envy unto the Fortune of the other. And to the end it may not be thought, that becau<U+017F>e hee was found by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>ide, lying upon the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e and abandoned of all the world, that therefore his birth was infamous; I would have you to know, that I found about him <U+017F>uch infallible <U+017F>ignes of his being de<U+017F>cended from <U+017F>ome illu<U+017F>trious Family, as I mu<U+017F>t needs doubt, whether in taking him to be mine I did not do an injury unto the glory hee might have had from his own original. Tho<U+017F>e that left him in that condition, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had not time to <U+017F>trip him of his cloaths, or perhaps they were not <U+017F>o barbarous as to do it: For I found him in a little purple gown, embroydered over with fine gold, and interwooven with flowers of <U+017F>ilk, <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>itely wrought and <U+017F>hadowed, as they did exactly imitate the natural. At night when I cau<U+017F>ed him to be got to bed, I <U+017F>aw that hee wore at his brea<U+017F>t a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Agathe hanging in a chain of gold; in which was engraved a Lion, and clo<U+017F>e by him a Lions Whelp which was fighting for his life again<U+017F>t a Tiger as big as him<U+017F>elf, and about him were written in great Characters the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Comme ne de ce Lion:</hi> and this made mee think this childe had a very generous father, who expecting actions from his Son worthy of his birth, would <U+017F>ignifie thereby, the great hopes that hee had in his future valour: The<U+017F>e are the marks that I found about this childe, which I have <U+017F>afely kept; and I wi<U+017F>h they may conduce as much unto his contentment, as tho<U+017F>e markes of my Son have <U+017F>erved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince mee that hee is my own. Upon this <hi>Adamas</hi> was <U+017F>ilent; and leaving all the by <U+017F>tanders in a <U+017F>trange a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> above all the re<U+017F>t, did not know how to interpret what <U+017F>hee had <U+017F>een: <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>hee imagined that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a dream, and <U+017F>ometimes accu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf for not believing her own eyes; but her wonder was greater, when <U+017F>hee <U+017F>aw <hi>Bellinde</hi> advancing in great ha<U+017F>te, and being helped up to the <U+017F>caffold, <U+017F>hee took him about the neck who had ever been taken for <hi>Paris</hi>: Deare <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee) is it thou my Son, whom <hi>Adamas</hi> has <U+017F>o carefully brought up? <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> my Son <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> let mee embrace and ki<U+017F><U+017F>e thee my dear Son <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes.</hi> Upon this her voice failed her, but not her <U+017F>trength; for <U+017F>hee held him <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e and hard, as hee was not able to fall downe upon his knees. As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>hee could <U+017F>peak, it was only to tell the Druid, that all the marks which hee had found upon that childe were upon <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> and that the Figures and Motto which were upon the Agathe, were only to <U+017F>ignifie that it was <hi>Celion.</hi>

As <U+017F>oon as they were come near, the croud made away for them, untill they came to <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Bellinde</hi> who were already come down from the <U+017F>caffold: for de<U+017F>iring no le<U+017F>s a Theater then the whole plain of Forre<U+017F>ts for the repre<U+017F>entation of this tragi-Comedy they went unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired that the knot of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould he di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in her pre<U+017F>ence.</p>

                  <hi>Adamas,</hi> held <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> by the hand; and <hi>Bellinde, Paris</hi>: <U+017F>o as <hi>Diana</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner come unto them, but the Druide embraced her, and being hardly able to with hold his tears for the extream joy which he re<U+017F>ented; Daughter (<U+017F>aid he unto her) heretofore I de<U+017F>ired to give you this Son as a lover and as a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: but the gods would not let my ignorance commit <U+017F>uch a crime, and have this day ordained that I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ent him unto you as a Brother; In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o he pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> unto her, and afterwards continuing, take him (<U+017F>aid he) as the be<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ent I can offer unto you, and let him find more favour as your kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, then he could as your <U+017F>ervant. <hi>Diana</hi> did not hear the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words; for as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had liberty to <U+017F>alute <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>he was in<U+017F>pired with <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinious affection, as <U+017F>he embraced him a long time, and <U+017F>poke not a word. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> was no le<U+017F>s ama<U+017F>ed and mute, <U+017F>o as not being able to <U+017F>peak, their tongus did lea<U+017F>t of all contribute unto the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of their re<U+017F>entments, and perhaps they had forgotten them<U+017F>elves in the tran<U+017F>port into which this new acquaintance had put them, if <hi>Bellinde</hi> had not interrupted their carre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>aid unto the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s: <hi>Diana,</hi> to plea<U+017F>e both the Oracles and your affection at once, I do here give you <hi>Paris</hi> not as he is <hi>Silvander,</hi> who<U+017F>e ruine the gods do <U+017F>till de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire, but as the legitimate Son of the grand Druide unto whom the gods do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e happine<U+017F>s beyond all our de<U+017F>ires, as it has already our hopes. Upon this <hi>Silvander,</hi> or rather <hi>Paris,</hi> advanced: and ca<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf at the feet of <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>econd, oh faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he unto her) the favour which <hi>Bellinde</hi> hath done me: and <U+017F>ince I want nothing to make me compleatly happy, but your con<U+017F>ent, give it deare<U+017F>t <hi>Diana</hi> to accompli<U+017F>h my good fortune; Yes <hi>Paris</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) I will give it, <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>erve it, and <U+017F>he who has the <U+017F>ole power of me commands it. Then <U+017F>he embraced, and afterwards ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf down at the feet of <hi>Bellinde,</hi> from whom she obtained a pardon for her former di<U+017F>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This commune joy, appeared in the countenances and eyes of all; But <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> being tho<U+017F>e that were mo<U+017F>t intere<U+017F>ted, it is ea<U+017F>ie to imagine that their joyes were beyond all compari<U+017F>on or expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: and indeed they appeared fairer then before; And that <hi>Diana</hi> had lo<U+017F>t much of her collour in her precedent afflictions, yet being con<U+017F>trained to make a confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her love in publique, even <U+017F>hame did bring <U+017F>uch blushes into her checks, as re<U+017F>tored unto her the fresh lu<U+017F>ter of her beauty.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide <hi>Celadons</hi> <U+017F>atisfaction was beyond all parralell that the good fortune both of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> did <U+017F>ute <U+017F>o well with his de<U+017F>ires; And the right <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes looking upon the <U+017F>caffold, and then upon <hi>Diana,</hi> he was <U+017F>o ravished to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf out of that danger wherein he thought to have perished as he could not enough be thankfull for his good fortune. <hi>Bellinde</hi> did not know in which she had mo<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of joy, whether in finding him whom she thought for ever lo<U+017F>t, or in finding a means to content both the gods and <hi>Diana. Adamas</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf already in Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of tho<U+017F>e favours which the Oracle promi<U+017F>ed unto him, after he had re<U+017F>tored <hi>Celadon</hi> unto his dear <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he thought him<U+017F>elf fully recompen<U+017F>ed for all the cares, and paynes he had taken to pre<U+017F>erve them. Thus had every one particular con<U+017F>iderations of the pre<U+017F>ent happine<U+017F>s, when the Druide knowing that <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e was to be done, he went unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and be<U+017F>eeched her to command what was her plea<U+017F>ure to be done: and the Nymph thought fit, that after <U+017F>o many favours which the gods had <U+017F>hewed them), they could do no le<U+017F>s, then return mo<U+017F>t humble thanks: and in order thereunto, she commanded that <U+017F>ome Bulls <U+017F>hould be brought, and <U+017F>acrificed in lieu of <hi>Silvander.</hi> Which the Victimaries obeying, <hi>Adamas</hi> did <U+017F>acrifice them withall u<U+017F>uall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53528:232"/>
And when hee viewed the intralls, hee found them all <U+017F>o pure and found, as hee was very certain that the Gods were well plea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>This my<U+017F>tery being ended, the Druid did put off the habit of grand Sacrificer; and now no <U+017F>ignes of any enchantment remaining about the Fountain, almo<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e that were about the Fountain were in<U+017F>pired with a great de<U+017F>ire of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it: but above all <hi>Alcidon</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t impatient; for the Oracle had promi<U+017F>ed that hee <U+017F>hould there finde an end of his paines. Hee addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf therefore unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <U+017F>aid thus unto him: You do know, reverend Father, by the relation which I have formerly made unto you of my Fortunes, that the beginning of my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e depends only upon your permitting mee to look into the Fountain of Loves veritie: And now <U+017F>ince there is no ob<U+017F>tacle to hinder mee but that, I do mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to let mee have recour<U+017F>e unto that remedy which only can give mee full contentment: Generous <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi> (an<U+017F>wered the Druid) you ask mee a thing which depends only upon your <U+017F>elf: yet if you will take my advice, let mee tell you, that I do think the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to be quite di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, and do conceive it fit, that (<U+017F>ince the Female Lover which was to die, was <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the Hee Lover <hi>Silvander</hi>; for death being only a deprivation of being, they are both dead, <U+017F>ince neither <hi>Alexis</hi> nor <hi>Silvander</hi> are in being, but the one become <hi>Celadon,</hi> and the other <hi>Paris</hi> my Son) <U+017F>ome order be ob<U+017F>erved in it: For it is to be feared, that if every one <U+017F>hould follow his own fancy, <U+017F>ome confu<U+017F>ion would ari<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t this great multitude, I do conceive it fit therefore, that wee <U+017F>hould ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>ome order, in which every one in their turnes may finde his particular Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And becau<U+017F>e wee <U+017F>ee that the God of Love is no le<U+017F><U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ed to have his power admired in the homely Cottages of our Shepherds, as well as in great Palaces: Nay, to break the force of an inchantment hee ca<U+017F>ts his eye only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as taking mo<U+017F>t delight in their innocency; mee thinks it fit that they, by who<U+017F>e meanes this Inchantment is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, <U+017F>hould have the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ay: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi> thought this to be but rea<U+017F>on; and the Druid having asked the advice of the Great Nymph, <U+017F>hee gave him leave to do as hee plea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas</hi> then went unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> and got his con<U+017F>ent to be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould look into the Fountain: at the fir<U+017F>t, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did oppo<U+017F>e it, imagining that it was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort, to doubt of her affection. But the Druid telling her it did much conduce unto her Glory, that Po<U+017F>terity <U+017F>hould know this Inchantment ended only for the tranquillity of this Shepherd, <U+017F>hee was obedient to what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee plea<U+017F>ed. So <hi>Adamas</hi> took <hi>Celadon</hi> by the hand, and leading him unto the <U+017F>ide of the Fountain, both kneeled down: And the Druid having made a prayer unto the God of Love, <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>tooped down; and hee had no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eye upon the water, but hee <U+017F>aw his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as fair as imagination was able to repre<U+017F>ent her: This <U+017F>ight did ravi<U+017F>h him the more, becau<U+017F>e hee <U+017F>aw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf alone with her, and becau<U+017F>e it was a full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of her inviolable Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was conducted thither by <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down as <hi>Adamas</hi> did before, <U+017F>hee made a <U+017F>igne unto the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>toop down, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> obeying, the Image of <hi>Celadon</hi> immediately appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, accompanied with all the Graces that Nature could infu<U+017F>e into his face: After this, <U+017F>hee yielded place unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who never for<U+017F>ook her in this my<U+017F>tery of Love, <U+017F>ince their affections had linked them together: So the<U+017F>e three fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, one after another, did look into the liquid Chry<U+017F>tal, which was then unto them the Fountain of oblivion: For at that very in<U+017F>tant they lo<U+017F>t the memory of all the mi<U+017F>eries they had endured: And the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Celadon, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who<U+017F>e images they <U+017F>aw, was a perfect remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t all their pa<U+017F>t paines: Next after this, <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion,</hi> at the de<U+017F>ire of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> approached this miraculous water: and though hee had <U+017F>tronger arguments of <hi>Ro<U+017F>aniras</hi> Love, then ever to doubt of it, yet hee looked in, becau<U+017F>e hee would be an eye-witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of this miracle: So as hee <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf next his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and not being able to conceive that <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o near him, hee turned about to <U+017F>ee whether <U+017F>hee <U+017F>tood behinde him; but not <U+017F>eeing her there, hee
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53528:232"/>
looked into the water again, and remained in that contemplation, until <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> came and took him off, that <U+017F>he might <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ame which he had done. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi> was the next that advanced in a trembling pace, to clear her <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions of <hi>Sigi<U+017F>monds</hi> fidelity; and as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he looked into the Fountain, <U+017F>he was fully <U+017F>atisfied concerning the love of that Prince: <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he accu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, and made a vow never to doubt again of his affection. <hi>Alcidon</hi> in the mean while, be<U+017F>eeched <hi>Daphnide</hi> not to deny him that remedy which the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had promi<U+017F>ed unto them: To which <U+017F>he con<U+017F>enting, they went one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to con<U+017F>ult with the water; which pre<U+017F>enting them with what they de<U+017F>ired, they were infinitly well <U+017F>atisfied with their good Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would not be <U+017F>ingular, he went as the re<U+017F>t did, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eeched <hi>Madonthe</hi> to do the like; but becau<U+017F>e they were already but one and the <U+017F>ame, this <U+017F>ight did hardly add any contentment unto them. They had no <U+017F>ooner left the Fountain free, but every one did ca<U+017F>t their eyes upon <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whom, his re<U+017F>pects unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did keep from this my<U+017F>terious water, and becau<U+017F>e the great Nymph knew his mind, <U+017F>he made a <U+017F>ign unto him to go thither, whom he immediatly obeyed; but after he had received from this <U+017F>ight all the <U+017F>atisfaction he could ever hope for, he perceived his joyes to le<U+017F><U+017F>en, when his fears of a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al did forbid him to ask what the Fountain had promi<U+017F>ed unto him: yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Godomar</hi> and he had together as they went to Lions, he took a little heart; and therefore as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>ired to know what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s he had, he told her clearly, that the water made him believe he had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hare in <hi>Galatheas</hi> favour. Brave <hi>Lindamor</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) you do de<U+017F>erve her better then any man in the world, and I would have you to enjoy her: Then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing <hi>Galathea</hi> to come near, and pre<U+017F>enting her unto the Cavalier, here <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do give her unto you; and if this recompence do not equal your <U+017F>ervices, yet take it in good part, and con<U+017F>ider that I do give you all that I can. Upon this, the Cavalier kneeled down, and even ravi<U+017F>hed with joy, did ki<U+017F>s her hand by way of thanks.</p>

                  <hi>Delphires, Thomantes, Dori<U+017F>ea, Filiutes,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, who had all left their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations to come unto this Sacrifice of <hi>Silvander,</hi> they had all the priviledge of this water, and found <U+017F>uch Dooms as ended all their differences, far better then the <U+017F>entence which <hi>Diana</hi> had pronounced a little before: for in de<U+017F>pite of the pretentions and pur<U+017F>uit of his Rival, <hi>Thomantes</hi> continued po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>our of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire.</hi>

                  <hi>Ligdamon, Silvia,</hi> and after them many Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es went to <U+017F>ee their De<U+017F>tinies in this water; and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Dori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> was in<U+017F>pired to look in: Doubtle<U+017F>s the only thing that moved her unto it, was her hopes to <U+017F>ee the Gho<U+017F>t of <hi>Palemon</hi>; but the god of Love, who is an enemy unto the dead, was revenged of her, and pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> unto her in lieu of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and this Shepherde<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized at it, that though <U+017F>he did not much love him, yet not to di<U+017F>obey the ordinances of this god, <U+017F>he received him into the place which <hi>Palemon</hi> had ravi<U+017F>hed from him. Thus after every one had looked into the water, <hi>Hylas</hi> was the <U+017F>ingular per<U+017F>on that approached not: which moved <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> to ask the rea<U+017F>on, to whom the Shepherd returned this an<U+017F>wer. I know, Madam, you are not to be told; and <U+017F>ince this Fountain bears the name of the truth of Love, I will not oblige her to commit a fault for my <U+017F>ake. That, replied <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be under<U+017F>tood of actions that are evil; but to love one is a thing <U+017F>o laudable and hone<U+017F>t, as you need not fear what the Fountain can tell you concerning that <U+017F>ubject. Madam (replied the incon<U+017F>tant) I am not very inqui<U+017F>itive to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did well or ill, in loving as I have done: I have followed the grain of my own humour, and do believe it is not to be condemned, <U+017F>ince it has exactly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Nature, which will peri<U+017F>h and die rather then be confined alwayes to one thing. But to tell you truly, that which has much induced me to affect change, is the con<U+017F>ideration which I have had of the lives of tho<U+017F>e Lovers, who like unto <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> have endeavoured to get the <U+017F>imple <U+017F>irnames of faithful and con<U+017F>tant: for I have ob<U+017F>erved them alwayes <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable, as I thought that Love did puni<U+017F>h them for their fidelity and con<U+017F>tancy, as for crimes which I ought

to <U+017F>hun. And yet <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> you <U+017F>ee that on the contrary, the god of Love rather loves them, and has brought them to a higher pitch of felicity, then ever they could expect or de<U+017F>ire. At this, <hi>Hylas</hi> was a little gravelled; but at the la<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>hook his head, I <U+017F>wear, Madam (<U+017F>aid he) they de<U+017F>erve all the felicity they find; and it may be <U+017F>aid, that it was rather <U+017F>old then given them, for they have paid full dear for it! But for all that, I would look into this Fountain where Love di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers <U+017F>o many truths, if I had not a <U+017F>tronger rea<U+017F>on which re<U+017F>trains me, and which makes me think it to be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible: Upon this, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> asking what it was, it is Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) becau<U+017F>e this Fountain is <U+017F>o little, that if I <U+017F>hould look into it, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee half of tho<U+017F>e faces which I have loved: Three or four faces will fill it; and how is it then po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that <hi>Dorinde, Carlis, Stillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Palanice, Aymea, Doris, Florice, Phillis, Cry<U+017F>eide, Stella,</hi> and as many more, <U+017F>hould find any room there? <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and all the company, could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at the conceit of <hi>Hylas</hi>; but <hi>Adamas,</hi> telling him, that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the per<U+017F>on whom he then loved, it did <U+017F>o per<U+017F>wade, with him, that he re<U+017F>olved to look into the Fountain; and <U+017F>o accordingly he ran thither immediatly, and without any kneeling, looked in: at which the god of Love was not offended, but <U+017F>hewed <hi>Stella</hi> unto him whom he then loved, without any other per<U+017F>ons but <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> and <U+017F>he, which did <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h him, as knowing thereby the will of that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s, he vowed inviolably to fix him<U+017F>elf there.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e My<U+017F>teries being ended, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>iring to memorize them unto po<U+017F>teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did command all this great company to follow her unto Marcelles, where <U+017F>he would celebrate a fea<U+017F>t for eight dayes together, in memory of <U+017F>o many remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es. None dur<U+017F>t di<U+017F>obey this command; and therefore, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>et forward, every one prepared them<U+017F>elves to follow. They had not gone above two hundred paces, but they <U+017F>aw upon their left hand a Shepherd and a Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e coming together, who were pre<U+017F>ently known to be <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi>: They held each other by the hand, at which <hi>Hylas</hi> was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed, that he ran to meet them; and wondering at the change which he <U+017F>aw in the humour to <hi>Tircis,</hi> he was extreamly glad that he had found a companion in his infidelity. <hi>Laonice</hi> in the mean while, no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> whom he <U+017F>till took to be <hi>Silvander</hi>; but ha<U+017F>ting to them, <U+017F>he asked pardon for the Trea<U+017F>on which <U+017F>he had practi<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t them, which <U+017F>he quickly obtained: for they did forgive her, and the more willingly, becau<U+017F>e they were now above all fears of any alteration in their Fortunes. <hi>Tircis</hi> enquired of <hi>Hylas,</hi> from whence all that great company came, and being told in few words, he would needs go and <U+017F>ee his De<U+017F>tiny as the re<U+017F>t had; but <hi>Laonice</hi> would not let him, and therefore they followed the re<U+017F>t unto Marcelles: where, during the eight dayes which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had devoted unto fea<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and plea<U+017F>ures, all the<U+017F>e Lovers did happily con<U+017F>ummate their marriages, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Dorinde,</hi> whom <hi>Godomar</hi> carryed unto Lions, after he had heard that <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut</hi> had at la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ented unto a marriage betwixt <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> and her. <hi>Ro<U+017F>ilion</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>anira</hi> returned unto the Queen <hi>Argires: Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hou<U+017F>es; and all the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es returned home, and talked of nothing but the happine<U+017F>s of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and the felicity of <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
