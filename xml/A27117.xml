         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>She (<U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>tand amazed) urged him farther with the<U+017F>e words (<U+017F>o mode<U+017F>tly <U+017F>poken) <hi>I pray Sir, let it be <U+017F>o, it may be I may be thought worthy for to wait upon her.</hi>

                  <hi>No,</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Prince) <hi>they <U+017F>hall all attend on thee, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves no more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e happy then according to the degrees of favour that thou <U+017F>halt ranke them in, and their merits, at thy hands, <U+017F>hall purcha<U+017F>e estimation. For (by all that's <U+017F>acred) before the morrowes Sunne <U+017F>hall reach to its Meridian, thou <U+017F>halt be mine. Doe not you <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refu<U+017F>all, le<U+017F>t you make us thinke, that you</hi> Romanes <hi>have an art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond us, to make your <U+017F>elves more acceptable by crowning your Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Humility.

               <p>All his attendants (e<U+017F>pecially they of the Female Sexe) were not (as yet) more affected with <hi>envie</hi> of her happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, then they were plea<U+017F>ed with the <hi>humble</hi> manner of her behaviour, untill their <U+017F>econd thoughts had placed their envies right again<U+017F>t her: con<U+017F>truing that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97485:6"/>
Mode<U+017F>tie, as a piece of cunning, to attract Honour (the more) by flying it; and to draw his love more and more towards her, by <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to refu<U+017F>e it. This night, the honourable women, by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Prince, attended <hi>Honoria;</hi> who the next day, as their Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, was to command their attendance. Which day being come, the time of that day allotted for the <U+017F>olemnization of <U+017F>o great a Marriage was at hand: when they were both made one, with the greate<U+017F>t pompe and ceremony that could be devi<U+017F>ed, which I leave to your owne imaginations to <U+017F>upply the place of a de<U+017F>cription. But one thing I mu<U+017F>t not omit, becau<U+017F>e it was <U+017F>o ominous to that, which after happened: For at the <U+017F>ame time whil<U+017F>t the Prie<U+017F>t was joyning the Hands of tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e Hearts were one already, Blood gu<U+017F>ht from his no<U+017F>trils, and at once <U+017F>tain'd the two maine pre<U+017F>ervers both of Knowledge and Devotion, the <U+017F>acred Directory, and the Prie<U+017F>ts lips; and made the very word which en<U+017F>ured the Prince his love unto <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria,</hi> Rubrick in the Lyturgie. Which though the <U+017F>tanders by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it as a bad <hi>Omen,</hi> yet the parties them<U+017F>elves, guarded with Innocence, and Thoughts as noble as their Re<U+017F>olutions towards each other, di<U+017F>dain'd to under<U+017F>tand it a pre<U+017F>age of evill.</p>
               <p>No le<U+017F><U+017F>e prodigious was that of the Di<U+017F>hes being <U+017F>erv'd up to the Bridall Board with a noi<U+017F>e of the Cloud-cleaving thunder of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and with Lightnings from the <U+017F>everall windowes cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing the meat: Which was not con<U+017F>trued, as a benediction, by tho<U+017F>e who did ob<U+017F>erve it; and they who were lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious, were (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding) <U+017F>omewhat out of countenance to behold <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad Pottents: which the Princely Bride perceiving, thus <U+017F>pake unto her better part:</p>
               <p>MY LORD,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why <U+017F>hould you and I be troubled at the<U+017F>e accidents, <U+017F>eeing it lies within our power to make them nothing? If you <U+017F>hould once <U+017F>peak har<U+017F>h to me, that thunder would be terrible in mine eares; neither can I feare the bla<U+017F>ting of any Lightning, but what may (unhappily) have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure from your eyes; and when I de<U+017F>erve either, may I meet with both. The Prie<U+017F>ts blood dropt not upon our hands, but upon his booke; whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e are pure and innocent, we need not feare. Though the blood fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Letter, it did not fall upon the meaning that was between us. Be you but con<U+017F>tant to the<U+017F>e vowes which you have made, and it <U+017F>hall not lie within the power of Fate to work our prejudice.</hi>

                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> returning from his <hi>Purgatory,</hi> to his <hi>Palace, Bertaldo</hi> could not be long out of his <U+017F>ight, but <U+017F>alutes him in this language: <hi>How fares the Prince? we thought that we had lo<U+017F>t you, none could tell what was become of you.</hi>

kinde, and altogether one noble nature; and the latter (being a contrary quality and ba<U+017F>e temper of the blood) we never examine of how inferiour an allay it is, which al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eems to us more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e, according to the <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accidents it meets withall, yet <U+017F>till we mu<U+017F>t <hi>totall</hi> the particulars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Ignoblene<U+017F><U+017F>e;</hi> <U+017F>o that in this con<U+017F>ideration, there is no place left for Indifference to act her part, and the<U+017F>e two leafes of the <U+017F>ame dore have never a wicket to let a <hi><U+017F>neaking</hi> di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition creep between them; either he mu<U+017F>t be a brave Gallant Man, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome faint-hearted coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Companion; and if he be but either of the<U+017F>e, I can play my game to my owne advantage.</p>

               <p>I have granted you that already <hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Armena) my Argument holds good from the le<U+017F><U+017F>er to the greater; but Mans wi<U+017F>dome must not be there exercis'd in the ob<U+017F>ervation of humours, or di<U+017F>cerning of <U+017F>pirits, but in the well management of the power of his dominion: for both Civill and Divine Lawes have given <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>overaignty to men over their Wifes, that they oftentimes lo<U+017F>e their Prerogatives by <U+017F>eeking to gaine that by Rea<U+017F>on which is theirs by Authority.

He that an<U+017F>wers the nimblene<U+017F><U+017F>e of his wifes tongue with the volubility of his owne, doth but ju<U+017F>tifie the warre by giving quarter: nothing makes this <U+017F>ubject <U+017F>ooner rebell, then when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees her Emperour knowes not how to Command.

                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> thus awakt, and remembring the good tidings overnight, he thought they were <U+017F>o good, that he began to be afraid they were

too good to be true. Thus the Devill, after we have overcome all his temptations, throwes his la<U+017F>t Dart, and <U+017F>eekes to poy<U+017F>on us with infidelity, like the Ship that hath e<U+017F>caped <U+017F>o great Enemies, and <U+017F>o many Shipwracks, at la<U+017F>t peri<U+017F>hes in the Harbour.</p>
               <p>But whil<U+017F>t he was in this great danger, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o many Rocks and Shelves: <hi>Berontus</hi> (like a good Pilot, comes to guide him <U+017F>afely into the Harbour) at who<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> reades comfort in his lookes; and askes him if he has heard of his <hi>Honoria,</hi> (anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his relation with his confidence) in the<U+017F>e words:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Berontus</hi> taking <hi>Nagivius</hi> by the hand, from point to point, tells him the full relation of the whole, as hath been before expre<U+017F>s'd: Which, when <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had heard throughout, he knew not whether he <U+017F>hould acknowledg him<U+017F>elf more beholding to the <hi>Hand,</hi> or to the <hi>In<U+017F>trument,</hi> that made <U+017F>uch mu<U+017F>ick to his <hi>Eares:</hi> he <U+017F>howr'd down obligations upon <hi>Berontus,</hi> as upon a Favourite that was capable of receiving tho<U+017F>e acts of Grace: But when he came to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>Navigius,</hi> he found him <U+017F>o un<U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptable, that he could not love him otherwi<U+017F>e, then with the Love wherewith fond Ladies u<U+017F>e to be in love with their Lap-dogs, who<U+017F>e over-gladne<U+017F><U+017F>e at <U+017F>mall favours, make their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>orry that they are not rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby they may be more capable of further benefits. <hi>Both</hi> in <hi>their</hi> kind were fully <U+017F>atisfied, the <hi>one</hi> with princely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; the <hi>other</hi> with <U+017F>pitting a few acknowledgments in his mouth, which the <hi>one</hi> received with <hi>due</hi> reverence, and <hi>good</hi> behaviour; the other with <U+017F>o many <hi><U+017F>crapes</hi> of his feet, and <hi>wagging</hi> of his tail.</p>
               <p>All the Palace did <hi>ring</hi> of this good newes; nothing but <hi>acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of joy and gladne<U+017F><U+017F>e was heard among<U+017F>t the People, every body ran to <U+017F>ee <hi>Navigius: Berontus</hi> was no body among<U+017F>t the Vulgar, like to like enjoy'd their liking; the poor man was well help'd up, from a peck of troubles, to <U+017F>uch a mea<U+017F>ure of admiration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> was <U+017F>ent for in Po<U+017F>t-ha<U+017F>te, (who returning as <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.) The next thoughts that were in election, was how the<U+017F>e two Ladyes were to be <U+017F>ent for, and who <U+017F>hould be employ'd in that Affair. It was determined, that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>patch'd upon this <hi>Emba<U+017F>sie; Berontus</hi> to the <hi>I<U+017F>land of Majorca,</hi> to attend upon <hi>Honoria;</hi> and <hi>Bertaldo</hi> to <hi>Minorca,</hi> to waite upon <hi>Amari<U+017F><U+017F>a.</hi> And this for two Rea<U+017F>ons, to which I might adde a third.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t was, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Berontus</hi> had been <U+017F>o <hi>Fortunate</hi> to bring the Good-newes, it was thought fitting that he <U+017F>hould have the <hi>Honour</hi> of the Employment.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>econd was, That <hi>Bertaldo</hi> thought it more convenient <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to wait upon his <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> than his <hi>Si<U+017F>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the third was, That <hi>Lorenzo</hi> knew <hi>Honoria</hi> would be <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <U+017F>ufficiently to hear of her Brothers welfare at any hand, but he could not reward <hi>Berontus</hi>'s <U+017F>ervices with le<U+017F><U+017F>e re<U+017F>pect. Two Ships

were <U+017F>peedily prepar'd, the one for <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> the other for <hi>Berontus:</hi> But all had been like to be <U+017F>poil'd, for the Prince taking great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Philoret,</hi> had gain'd <hi>Bertaldo</hi> his con<U+017F>ent, that <hi>Philoret</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay behind to keep him Company; but there <U+017F>ate <U+017F>uch a cloud on <hi>Philoret</hi> his Countenance, as made them all fear they <U+017F>hould have no Faire weather after them, if he were left behind; wherefore the Prince willingly releas'd him of his grant.</p>
               <p>They were all fairly Shipp'd; but behold, they were <U+017F>carce out of <U+017F>ight of the Maine-land, but their <hi><U+017F>tately</hi> Ships were forc'd to <hi><U+017F>trike</hi> Saile to angry <hi>Neptune:</hi> who, with his <hi>awfull</hi> Trident, <hi>muster'd</hi> his Turbulent waves, whil<U+017F>t the innumerous Tacklings <U+017F>erv'd for <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Whi<U+017F>tles</hi> to the winde, to call on danger to her Execution, whil<U+017F>t the <hi>Boyling</hi> Ocean lifted up her Waves <U+017F>o high, that the <hi>Ma<U+017F>ts</hi> of both the Ships <hi>charg'd</hi> their <hi>tops</hi> through the proud <hi>Heads</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulting Billowes; till others (as if they had been their Friends) lifted the <hi>Victors</hi> upon their <hi><U+017F>houlders</hi> to <U+017F>uch a height, as their main <hi>Ma<U+017F>ts</hi> were in danger to have fallen <hi>foul</hi> with the <hi>Cele<U+017F>tiall Sphears;</hi> raking from their <hi>re<U+017F>tle<U+017F><U+017F>e</hi> bottomes, <U+017F>o much <hi>Sand,</hi> as not onely <hi>di<U+017F>coloured</hi> the green Ocean, but al<U+017F>o threatned a di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the whole <hi>Earth</hi> into <U+017F>o many <hi>Attomes</hi> in the <hi>Sea:</hi> So that no <hi>marvaile,</hi> that they had <hi>quite</hi> lo<U+017F>t <hi>one another,</hi> whil<U+017F>t they were <hi>both</hi> thus <hi>likely</hi> to be <hi>lo<U+017F>t.</hi> So that it hapned (by rea<U+017F>on of this Storme) that <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who was bound for <hi>Minorca,</hi> was (by the fortune of the Windes) blown upon the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Majorca;</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> (who was bound for <hi>Majorca)</hi> was thrown upon the le<U+017F><U+017F>er I<U+017F>land: The mi<U+017F>take was not <U+017F>o great, whil<U+017F>t their Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ions were both the <U+017F>ame.</p>

Sirrah, had it been in the day thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t never have done this: I prote<U+017F>t I <U+017F>aw him not, but he came upon me all of the <U+017F>uddaine, I knew not how, nor which way. O my Arme! my Shoulder is out of Jont, my Neck is Bruis'd, my Head is Broken! Who would have thought there had been <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength in <U+017F>uch a little Urchin!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> told him, That <hi>if he thought the</hi> Night <hi>had been any</hi> di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage <hi>to him, he <U+017F>hould doe well to take the</hi> advantage <hi>of the Day, he would an<U+017F>wer him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>No</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hamon) I think you have given me enough for all the dayes of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All began to <hi>admire Prickette,</hi> every body thought <hi>Prickette</hi> a <hi>Gallant</hi> Man; who but <hi>Prickette</hi> was <hi>cry'd</hi> up for a <hi>daring</hi> fellow. <hi>Prickette</hi> repaires to the <hi>Herauld,</hi> brings his witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, tells him what he had done: The <hi>Herauld bids him leave the management of the re<U+017F>t to him, and bring his</hi> Rivana <hi>along with him, much about the time of

the Solemnity, and he would conveigh them a way where they <U+017F>hould not need to go through the Temple of Vertue, but pa<U+017F><U+017F>e through the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, into the Temple of Honour.</hi>

               <p>Now becau<U+017F>e I will not end my <U+017F>tory with <hi>relations</hi> of <hi>Wedding Garments,</hi> or <U+017F>uffer my <hi>pen</hi> to be <U+017F>o neare of kinne to <hi>feathers</hi> in a <hi>bed</hi> as to write their <hi>happine<U+017F><U+017F>es upon its Sheets,</hi> I <U+017F>hall onely bring the<U+017F>e <hi>Worthies</hi> into the <hi><U+017F>acred Temple,</hi> and there leave them in a place of <hi>glory &amp; honour,</hi> into a place that was all <hi>light</hi> &amp; had no <hi>windows,</hi> <U+017F>uch a <hi>light</hi> as receiv'd its <hi>lu<U+017F>tre</hi> from the <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>melting <U+017F>oules burning</hi> in the <hi>fire of love,</hi> which were <hi>upon &amp; under</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> who<U+017F>e <hi>Quire</hi> was <hi>pav'd</hi> with <hi>precious Stones,</hi> where <hi>Diamonds</hi> were <U+017F>et in <hi>Characters,</hi> whereby Letters of Light were <U+017F>o compos'd that every foot that gave a <U+017F>tep made impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon Eternity.

Into this glorious Temple the Heraulds lead the<U+017F>e loving Paires, and placed them in their <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <U+017F>eates of rotten, but now <U+017F>hining wood; upon one <U+017F>ide whereof was written <hi>Mortallity;</hi> and upon the other, <hi>Corruption upon armes who<U+017F>e hands laid hold upon the <U+017F>eates,</hi> as if they were ready to teare them in <U+017F>under. After that the high Prie<U+017F>t had made an end of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and perform'd the holy Rites, there de<U+017F>cended from above a Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion and a Pen which an Angel received and delivered it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high Prie<U+017F>ts hands, who pre<U+017F>ented both to <hi>Perii<U+017F><U+017F>a;</hi> which Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion was that <hi>that</hi> Pen <U+017F>hould write, <hi>I'm before Mortallity,</hi> and <hi>In before Corruption:</hi> <U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame power made the <U+017F>ame hands as <U+017F>tayes to <U+017F>ecure their ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate, which formerly had been the cau<U+017F>es of their di<U+017F><U+017F>olutions: And thus we end our Hi<U+017F>tory with the heavenly Chori<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>inging this <hi>Antheme:</hi>
