            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus being ignorant of his ill hap, after a choice of the fitte<U+017F>t place for the grazing of his flock neare his deare<U+017F>t <U+017F>heepherde<U+017F>s, he went to bid her good morrow, being extreamly joyed to <U+017F>ee her: <U+017F>he returned an<U+017F>wer with looks and language <U+017F>o cold, as if a chill winter had frozen every <U+017F>yllable. The <U+017F>hepheard, unaccu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ight, was infinitly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and though he could not imagine his dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter <U+017F>o great as afterwards he found it, yet the very thought of offending her he loved, was enough to co<U+017F>t him his life.

He had no <U+017F>ooner uttered the<U+017F>e words, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes toward <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he leaped into the River with cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lignon</hi> in that place was very deep and violent, &amp; by rea<U+017F>on of the Rocke which repul<U+017F>ed the water, there was a kind of whirlpit: <U+017F>o as the <U+017F>hepheard was long before he <U+017F>unk to the bottom, and longer in comming up to the top againe. And when he did appeare, nothing could be <U+017F>een, but fir<U+017F>t a leg, and then an arm: at la<U+017F>t being gulfed up by the turning of the waves, he was carried away under the water. Now <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> runs to the Water <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>eeing him whom <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but love by her meanes <U+017F>o neer his death; <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o affrighted, that in lieu of lending any help, <U+017F>he falls into a <U+017F>wound and that <U+017F>o neer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when <U+017F>he returned to her <U+017F>elfe, at the fir<U+017F>t motion <U+017F>he fell in, and was in <U+017F>o much danger, as all that <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hepheards clo<U+017F>e by could do was litle enough to <U+017F>ave her by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her out by her garments; which kept her above the water, and gave them time to draw her unto the <U+017F>ide: but life was <U+017F>o farre <U+017F>pent, as <U+017F>he perceived it not. They carried her unto the next <U+017F>hepherds cabbin, whereby accident <hi>Phillis</hi> was, and where they <U+017F>hifted her cloaths: <U+017F>he all this while was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed both at her owne accident and at that of <hi>Celadons,</hi> that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>peake. Mean while, <hi>Celadon</hi> was hurried by the fury of the waves a farre off on the other <U+017F>ide of the River, among<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome little trees; but with very little <U+017F>igne of life.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So it chanced, that as they came into the cottage, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> opened her eyes, but you may imagine that they had lo<U+017F>t much of their wonted lu<U+017F>tre, and looked heavy and dull, and their <U+017F>prightline<U+017F>s drowned in tears yet <U+017F>uch tears, as, flowing from an enflamed heart and lovely eyes moved abundance of love and pitty from all her beholders. When <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied her companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he was much moved; but much more when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Lycidas</hi> and though <U+017F>he was loath to let the people about her know the cau<U+017F>e of her di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter; yet <U+017F>he was forced to <U+017F>ay, hat his brother was drowned in helping her. <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the newes, that he ran immediatly to the fatall place with all the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepheards, leaving <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> alone, who pre<U+017F>ently after, began to follow them, but <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a pace, that though they had much to <U+017F>ay, yet they could not <U+017F>peake one <U+017F>yllable. Meane time the <U+017F>hepheards came to the River <U+017F>ide, and looking on every <U+017F>ide they could not finde the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>igne of what they <U+017F>ought; for only tho<U+017F>e, who went the lowe<U+017F>t downe the River, chanced to find his hat, which the waves had ca<U+017F>t up upon <U+017F>ome willows and reeds which grew by the water <U+017F>ide: this was all the newes they could heare: As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> he was carried by the water much lower and into a place where it was unpo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to find him. for as I told you before, the waves had wafted him over to the other <U+017F>ide, and he <U+017F>tucke upon a thick ru<U+017F>h of trees, where it was very hard to <U+017F>ee him.</p>
            <p>When he was even betwixt life and death, there came to the place, three fair Nymphs, with di<U+017F>heavelled haire waving and hanging upon their <U+017F>houlders, under a garland of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Pearles; their bre<U+017F>ts were naked their <U+017F>leeves turned up to the elbow, and their arms bare, onely covered with pure<U+017F>t Lawne to the Wre<U+017F>ts, on which they wore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53526:5"/>
rich bracelets of Orientall Pearls: each of them wore a quiver full of arrows, and in their hands they carried bowes of Ivorie: their petticotes were tucked up <U+017F>o high as permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their golden buskins to be <U+017F>eene, as high as the knee. It <U+017F>eems they came unto that place upon <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igne: for (<U+017F>aid one of them) this is the very place, <U+017F>earch well the <U+017F>ide of the River; See, <U+017F>ee! how impetuou<U+017F>ly it <U+017F>wells it <U+017F>elf above its common levell: ob<U+017F>erv that Tuft of trees, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it is the very <U+017F>ame which was repre<U+017F>ented to us in the mirror. 'Tis true, (<U+017F>aid the chiefe of them,) but all the re<U+017F>t is nothing re<U+017F>emblant: but me thinkes I <U+017F>ee another odd place, more likely to find that which we looke for: its very probable (<U+017F>aid the third, who had not yet <U+017F>poke) for the place is <U+017F>o exactly de<U+017F>cribed, as I beleeve there is not one tree, but you <U+017F>aw in the mirrour. In <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they came <U+017F>o neere the place where <hi>Celadon</hi> was, that nothing but a few leaves did interpo<U+017F>e betweene him and their <U+017F>ight. They having exactly <U+017F>urvayed every thing, they concluded it to be the place which was <U+017F>hewed unto them, and therefore re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>it downe. The principall of the<U+017F>e Nymphs as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>itting downe, e<U+017F>pyed <hi>Celadon:</hi> and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing him to be <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hepheard a<U+017F>leepe and beckning with one hand unto her companions, <U+017F>he pointed to the place with the other; and treading very gently for feare of waking him <U+017F>he <U+017F>tepped forward; but being neerer, <U+017F>he beleeved him to be dead. For his feet did lie in the water, his right arme upon his head, and the left carle<U+017F>ly hanging behind him; his neck awry as if his head were too heavy; his mouth halfe open, and almo<U+017F>t full of <U+017F>and<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> his face pale and dirtie, his eyes almo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>ed: and his haire which he wore very long, <U+017F>o wet, that the water ran like a <U+017F>tream from it his countenance was the very picture of death; his backe <U+017F>o bended, that it <U+017F>eemed broke: and that made his belly <U+017F>eeme the more <U+017F>welled. The Nymphs, <U+017F>eeing him in this deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, were mooved with much pitty; and <hi>Leonida,</hi> as mo<U+017F>t officious and pittifull, was the fir<U+017F>t which laid hand upon him to draw him out of the river. The water, which he had <U+017F>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed came from him in <U+017F>uch abundance, that the Nimph finding <U+017F>ome warmth yet in him, did beleeve him to be recoverable. Then <hi>Galathia,</hi> who was the chiefe of them, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other Nymph, who looked on but did not help; Come <hi>Sylvia,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) why are you <U+017F>o idle? come and help, if not to ea<U+017F>e your companions, yet out of pittie to this poore <U+017F>hepheard. I am con<U+017F>idering, Madam, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that though he be very much changed, yet me thinkes I <U+017F>hould know him. Then taking him by the other arme, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him more preci<U+017F>ely, Certainly (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I am not mi<U+017F>taken: Tis he I meane; and beleeve it, he merits all our helps: for he is not only of the fir<U+017F>t family in all the country, but his merits are <U+017F>o many, as our be<U+017F>t indeavours to <U+017F>ave him will be well imployed: All this while, the water came from him in <U+017F>uch abundance, that the <U+017F>hepheard being more empty, began to breathe: but did not yet open his eyes nor come unto him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Galathia</hi> having an opinion that he was the man, of whom the Druid had <U+017F>poken unto her, <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe did help her companions: and commanded them to carry him unto her Pallace of <hi>I<U+017F>oures,</hi> where he might have the be<U+017F>t accommodations of help. And accordingly with much adoe, they carryed him to the place, where the litle Merill wood with their chariot, into which they all did get. <hi>Leonida</hi> undertooke to be their guide; and, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>eene by the guards of the Ca<U+017F>tle, they went in at a backe <U+017F>ecret dore. As <U+017F>oone as they were gone, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> reviving from her <U+017F>wounding fit, did fall into the water, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Lycidas</hi> and they who went to <U+017F>earch for <hi>Celadon,</hi> could heare no other tidings of him, then, as formerly I told you: <U+017F>o as <hi>Lycidas,</hi> being but too well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of his brothers death, he went to <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to condole with her their common di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. She, <U+017F>ad <U+017F>oul, did nothing el<U+017F>e but walk mourning along the River <U+017F>ide, untill <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o weary that <U+017F>he was forced to <U+017F>it downe as full of anger griefe and amazement, as a little before, <U+017F>he was of incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and jealou<U+017F>ie. She was <U+017F>itting a lone by her<U+017F>elfe; for, <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Lycidas</hi> returne, went out to heare <U+017F>ome newes, as the re<U+017F>t did. This Shepheard when he came, being weary and de<U+017F>irous to know how this misfortune came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, he did <U+017F>it downe by her; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand began to talke; Oh heavens, fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he) what a fatall mi<U+017F>chance is this, which hath happned unto us; I <U+017F>ay, us, for as I have lo<U+017F>t a deare brother <U+017F>o you have lo<U+017F>t one who was not him<U+017F>elfe without you.

it grieves me to <U+017F>ee you, as little concerned at it as if he were a meere <U+017F>tranger unto you.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s then looked <U+017F>adly towards him, and after a little pau<U+017F>e of con<U+017F>ideration, an<U+017F>wered. Shephered, I am much grieved at the death of your brother, not in con<U+017F>ideration of any affection which he bore unto me, but in re<U+017F>pect of his many other excellent qualities, which might well move any to grieve at his misfortune: for, as for the affection which you <U+017F>poke of, it was <U+017F>o common unto other <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es my companions, as it was their parts to lament him more then mine. Oh mo<U+017F>t ungratefull <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, cryed out <hi>Lycidas,</hi> I <U+017F>hall thinke the gods unju<U+017F>t, if they do not puni<U+017F>h you for your inju<U+017F>tice: you have <U+017F>mall rea<U+017F>on to thinke him uncon<U+017F>tant, who, for all the anger of his Parents and cruelty of your rigour, would not dimini<U+017F>h the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>parke of his affection to you. This is ingratitude in the height, <U+017F>ince all his actions and <U+017F>ervices could not a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of the thing, which none living ever doubted of, but your <U+017F>elfe: This am I certaine of, that he would <U+017F>ooner have di<U+017F>obeyed the Supreame gods, then the lea<U+017F>t of your commands. Then did the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in an angry manner an<U+017F>wer, that this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was di<U+017F>advantagious to his Brother; for <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timonies of his infidelitie. You fill me full of wonder (replied <hi>Lycidas,)</hi> but I be<U+017F>eech you how came you to the knowledge of it? Shepherd, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> the <U+017F>tory is too long and lamentable to be told: <U+017F>atisfie your <U+017F>elfe with this that if you do not know it you are the only one that is ignorant of it: for there is not a <U+017F>hepherd about the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> which cannot tell you, that <hi>Celadon</hi> had a hundred Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es. And, to be <U+017F>hort, the<U+017F>e eares of mine were no longer then ye<U+017F>terday witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of the amorous di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which he held with his <hi>Aminthé</hi> (for <U+017F>o he called her) and I had hearkned longer unto it, had I not beene di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at his perfidie, or, to tell you truly, had I not other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which was more advantagious unto me. <hi>Lycidas</hi> at this, like a man di<U+017F>tracted, cryed out: oh now, I <U+017F>ee the cau<U+017F>e of my brothers death; it was your jealou<U+017F>ie, <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> your jealou<U+017F>y is the onely cau<U+017F>e of this dire di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. Poore <hi>Celadon!</hi> I now remember thy Prophetique words, when thou <U+017F>aide<U+017F>t, thy fain'd affection would co<U+017F>t thee thy life. Then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe unto her, Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) that you <U+017F>hould forget tho<U+017F>e commands, which you <U+017F>o often and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ingly, did lay upon him? five or <U+017F>ix times at the lea<U+017F>t, I can witne<U+017F><U+017F>e he was down upon his knees, begging a revocation of them: You may remember when he returned from <hi>Italie</hi> it was your fir<U+017F>t injunction to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble love unto another, which he intreated you rather to bid him die then do. My deare <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aid he, (I <U+017F>hall never forget his words) though I mu<U+017F>t &amp; will be perfectly obedient unto all your commands, yet I cannot chu<U+017F>e but throw my <U+017F>elfe at your feet, imploring onely <U+017F>o much favour as to bid me Die, rather then bid me <U+017F>erve any other then <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> And you did an<U+017F>wer, Nay, Shepheard, far be it from my thoughts to command you to Die; but it is to try your affection, and principally to blind the eyes and <U+017F>top the mouths of all inqui<U+017F>itive <U+017F>pies, that I do enjoyn this di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation upon you. He, not being able to di<U+017F>obey you in any thing, undertooke the difficulty; and indeed difficulty I rightly phra<U+017F>e it. For he never went unto the place, where hee was to put his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation into practice, but he fir<U+017F>t laid him<U+017F>elfe downe upon his bed, as if a trembling fit of a feaver came upon him. Not above two dayes <U+017F>ince, I found him engraving upon a tree, the<U+017F>e en<U+017F>uing ver<U+017F>es, who<U+017F>e characters, if you have not quite forgotten both him and his <U+017F>ervices, you will know, if you plea<U+017F>e to turne your eyes towards yonder tree on the other <U+017F>ide of the River, which containes the<U+017F>e lines:</p>

               <hi>Lycidas</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner gon but they heard another voice a far off, which <U+017F>eemed to draw neere them: and <U+017F>etting them<U+017F>elves to hearken, they were interrupted by that <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e who held the head of a <U+017F>hepherd in her lappe, and uttered the<U+017F>e complaints; Fie, fie, thou obdurate peece of cruelty, thou pittile<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheard; how long will thy heart be marble, and eares <U+017F>topped to my prayers?

eternally exiled him: and being grown de<U+017F>perate, he did chu<U+017F>e death rather then <U+017F>uch a piece of crueltie as <U+017F>he. Oh Heavens! <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> in a great amazement) whats this you <U+017F>ay?

It is mo<U+017F>t certainly true (an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard) <U+017F>he has partly told me as much, and I do conjecture the re<U+017F>t by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed, he being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely grieved for the death of his brother, and as much offended again<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> and <U+017F>he, very <U+017F>orry for <hi>Celadons</hi> death, angred at the anger of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie of her companion would not apply any extreame remedies, at the fir<U+017F>t; but only <U+017F>ome gentle preparatives to mollifie him.

On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>welled in teares and <U+017F>uncke in <U+017F>orrow: as having not teares enough to wa<U+017F>h away her error, nor words enough to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e her griefe, both her eyes and mouth did leave their offices unto her imaginations <U+017F>o long as both eyes, toung, imagination, and all other faculties being tyred out, <U+017F>he fell a<U+017F>leepe.</p>
            <p>Whil<U+017F>t things pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus among<U+017F>t the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Celadon</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved by the three Nymphes in the Pallace of <hi>I<U+017F>oures</hi> with all indulgent care: but the hurt which the water had done him was <U+017F>o great, that for all their remedies which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he could not open his eyes nor give any <U+017F>igne of life, but only by the beating of his heart, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing all the day and a good part of the night, before he came to him<U+017F>elfe; And when he opened his eyes, he was in a great amazement to find him<U+017F>elfe in that place: for he very well remembred what he had done and how a ra<U+017F>h de<U+017F>pair had made him throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe into the water: but he knew not how he came thither. And after he had <U+017F>tayed a long while in this confu<U+017F>ed thought, he asked whether he was alive or dead. If I be alive (<U+017F>aid he) how is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the cruelty of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hould not kill me? And if I be dead, why, cruell Love, do<U+017F>t thou torment me in the <U+017F>hades of death? is it not enough that thou ha<U+017F>t my life, but thou mu<U+017F>t receive my old flames out of my dead a<U+017F>hes? And the great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had left him having now for<U+017F>aken him, he called into his memory all his former conceptions, and his mind being full of imagination both of his mi<U+017F>eries and al<U+017F>o of his former happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, he fell into <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>leepe, that the Nymphes had time enough to come and <U+017F>ee him, and finding him fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leepe, they opened the curtaines and windowes very gently, and did <U+017F>it downe by him, the better to view and contemplate upon him. <hi>Galathea,</hi> after a whiles confideration, did in a low voice for feare of wakeing him, <U+017F>ay, oh how this Shepheard is changed <U+017F>ince ye<U+017F>terday? What a fre<U+017F>h complexion is upon a <U+017F>uddaine come into his face? <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly I do not repent of all the paines I have taken in <U+017F>aving his life; for as you <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>weetheart (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee, and turned towards <hi>Silvia)</hi> he is one of the principall in al the country: Madam, (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) mo<U+017F>t certainly he is; for <hi>Al<U+017F>ippes</hi> is his Father, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> his Mother. How? <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <hi>Al<U+017F>ippe</hi> <U+017F>o famous, who to <U+017F>ave his freind, did break open the Pri<U+017F>on of the Vi<U+017F>igotts at <hi>U<U+017F><U+017F>um?</hi> The very <U+017F>ame, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia)</hi> I have <U+017F>eene him <U+017F>everall times at fea<U+017F>ts, which are kept by the Townes about <hi>Lignon.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Al<U+017F>ippes</hi> <U+017F>eemed unto me mo<U+017F>t worthy of ob<U+017F>ervation, I looked long upon him: for the formalitie of his beard, and the gravitie of his venerable age, did exact honour and ob<U+017F>ervance from every one.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Celadon</hi> I remember, that of all the Shepheards, there was only he and <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who had confidence enough to approach me; by <hi>Silvander</hi> I knew which was <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and by <hi>Celadon</hi> which <hi>Silvander:</hi> for both of them, had in their Garbes and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>omthing more generous, then the name of Shepheard u<U+017F>eth to owne.

world; the plot being, that <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>hould go to that place at the hour, to the end that <U+017F>he might more willingly be induced to marry him, which otherwi<U+017F>e, the affection <U+017F>he bore unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> would not permit. But Fortune and Love, are too hard for Prudence; and <U+017F>ent <hi>Celadon</hi> thither by chance, as I have told you: <U+017F>o as <hi>Galathea,</hi> intending to fixe Love upon this Shepheard, did thinke him to be extreame Lovely: And <U+017F>eeing he did not wake, <U+017F>he went out as gently as <U+017F>he could, to entertaine her new thoughts.</p>
            <p>There was neere his chamber a backe paire of <U+017F>taires, which opened to a low Gallerie, out of which, by a draw bridge one might go into a Garden full of choice varieties, Fountaines, Statues Walkes, Arbors and all that Art could invent; out of this Garden was a dore into a Wilderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>everall <U+017F>orts of Trees: in which was <U+017F>everall Labirinthes, wherein one might wander to the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of ones <U+017F>elfe, yet by rea<U+017F>on of the umbrage were very delightfull: In one of which was a Fountaine called The truth of Love, a place in truth marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ly plea<U+017F>ing: for by force of Inchantment, a Lover who looked in it might <U+017F>ee her, he loved: if he were Loved, he might <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>e by him if <U+017F>he Loved another, that other would be pre<U+017F>ented and not him<U+017F>elfe: And becau<U+017F>e it did di<U+017F>cover all the deceipts of Lovers, it was called the Truth of Love. In another, Labirinth was the Cavern of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and in another was the denn of an old Mandrake, full of <U+017F>o many wonders and witchcrafts, that every vanitie appeared a fre<U+017F>h miracle. Moreover, in the other parts of the wood, there was <U+017F>everall other Grotts, <U+017F>o well counterfeited, and neere the naturall, as the eye did oft deceive the judgment. It was in this Garden, where the Nymph did walke wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the waking of the Shepheard: And becau<U+017F>e her new de<U+017F>ires would not permit her to be <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>he faigned to forget <U+017F>omthing which <U+017F>he commanded <hi>Silvia</hi> to go and <U+017F>eeke: for <U+017F>he confided le<U+017F><U+017F>e in her green youth, then in <hi>Leonidas</hi> who<U+017F>e age was arrived at more matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, though both the<U+017F>e Nymphes were her <U+017F>ecret confidents. And being alone with <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> <U+017F>he thus <U+017F>aid unto her; what do thinke, <hi>Leonida,</hi> has not this <hi>Druide</hi> a <U+017F>trange know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things? Does not the gods freely communicate them<U+017F>elves unto him? for what is future, he knowes as well as the pre<U+017F>ent: The truth is, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, he did very directly <U+017F>hew you in the Mirror, the very place where you found this Shepheard, and al<U+017F>o told you the very time; but his words were <U+017F>o ambiguous, that I beleeve he hardly under<U+017F>tood them him<U+017F>elfe. Why do you <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>ince he hath particularly told me every thing as perfectly as I my <U+017F>elfe do not now kow them, better than he did before they happened? he only told you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould find in this place a thing of an ine<U+017F>timable value, though formerly it had beene di<U+017F>dayned: Nay, <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he has told me more then that: particularly; Madam, <U+017F>aid he, you have two very contrary influences: the one the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate under the heavens; the other the mo<U+017F>t happie that can be de<U+017F>ired: And it is in your choice to take which you will: And to the end you may not deceive your <U+017F>elfe, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that you are and <U+017F>hall be coveted by many great and Noble per<U+017F>onages, where vertues and merits may ea<U+017F>ily moove you: but if you mea<U+017F>ure your affection by their meritts, or their Love, and not by what I <U+017F>hall tell you: from the <U+017F>upream gods, I do Progno<U+017F>ticate, that you will be the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable woman alive. And to the end you may not be mi<U+017F>taken in your choice, remember that <U+017F>uch a day you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee at <hi>Mar<U+017F>eilles</hi> a Knight in <U+017F>uch a habit, who does and will court you for marriage: which if you permit, then I do pronounce your mi<U+017F>ery. And therefore I advi<U+017F>e you to <U+017F>hun <U+017F>uch a man and thinke upon him rather as your <U+017F>ad fate, then as your <U+017F>ervant: on the contrary, ob<U+017F>erve well the place which is repre<U+017F>ented in this Mirror, for on <U+017F>uch a day at <U+017F>uch an hour you <U+017F>hall there meet a man, in who<U+017F>e affection the heavens has placed all your felicitie: if you can <U+017F>o order it, that he do Love you, never beleeve the gods againe, if you become not more happie then you can de<U+017F>ire: but be <U+017F>ure, that the fir<U+017F>t of you two who <U+017F>hall meet, be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hall begin Love. This, <hi>Leonida,</hi> is as cleere as the Sun at noone, and I do already perceive that his predictions are true. For I <U+017F>eeing this Shepheard fir<U+017F>t, I mu<U+017F>t tell you truly, I find <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parkes of affection towards him. Good heavens! Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida</hi> unto her) do you intend to place your Love upon a Shepheard? do you not remember who you are? I do <U+017F>o, <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and you mu<U+017F>t know that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are men as well as <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, and their Noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e is as great as others, both being <U+017F>prung from one and the <U+017F>ame originall: <U+017F>o as if this Shepheard be well borne, why <U+017F>hould I not think him as worthy of me as any other: The truth is Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> di<U+017F>grace it as you will, he is a Shepheard: The truth is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> he is a well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hed man. But Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> you who are <U+017F>o high a Nymph, Lady; after <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> of all the<U+017F>e goodly Countries: can your courage de<U+017F>cend <U+017F>o low as to Love a

man of common ranke? a Ru<U+017F>tique a Shepheard, a man not worth a <U+017F>traw? Friend, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> remember that <hi>Enone</hi> became a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e for <hi>Paris</hi> his <U+017F>ake, and when <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t him, She <U+017F>hed many a bitter teare. Madam, laid <hi>Leonida, Paris</hi> was a Kings <U+017F>onne; and the error of another, ought not to move you to the like. If it be an error, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <U+017F>he, the blame is in the gods who advi<U+017F>e me unto it by the Oracle of their <hi>Druides:</hi> but, my freind, <hi>Celadon</hi> is not <U+017F>o farre off in kindred from <hi>Paris:</hi> are they not both come from the <U+017F>ame originall? Did you not heare what <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>aid of him and his Father? You mu<U+017F>t know they are not <U+017F>hepheards out of any want, but becau<U+017F>e they would enjoy that <U+017F>weet and harmle<U+017F><U+017F>e kind of life. But deare Madam, added <hi>Leonida,</hi> can you thus forget the affection and <U+017F>ervices of the generous <hi>Lindamour?</hi> I am not willing, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> that oblivion <U+017F>hould be the recompence of his <U+017F>ervices: but I am unwilling withall, that my affection unto him <U+017F>hould be the utter ruine of all my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Oh Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you remember how full of fidelity he hath ever been. Oh my friend, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider what it is to be eternally mi<U+017F>erable. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> an extream affection, a pure fidelitie, the imployment of a whole age and continuall <U+017F>ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought not to be <U+017F>o long entertained, but merited a better requitall then a change. For God <U+017F>ake Madam, con<U+017F>ider what impo<U+017F>tures all the<U+017F>e Fortune tellers are: they vent for truthes the idle imaginations of their fond dreames: they are flat lyars, <U+017F>ince of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred predictions hardly one happens truly, they are <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>hly ignorant, <U+017F>ince for all their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e in others mens matters they know not their owne fortune: will you bee per<U+017F>waded by the fanta<U+017F>ticall talke of this fellow, to make that man mi<U+017F>erable who hath bin <U+017F>o much yours? Look but a little upon his Love; con<U+017F>ider what hazards he hath run for you; how he fought with <hi>Polemas;</hi> what de<U+017F>paire he was then in; what torments you now prepare for him, and how hee will certainly invent <U+017F>ome way of death to him<U+017F>elfe when he knowes it. <hi>Galathea</hi> did <U+017F>hake her head, and thus an<U+017F>wered; <hi>Leonida,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t not now thinke upon either <hi>Lindamor</hi> or <hi>Polemas</hi> as heretofore; but upon my owne eternall either happine<U+017F><U+017F>e or mi<U+017F>ery; the motives you u<U+017F>e are very good for your <U+017F>elfe, who will be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no further then to a little pittie: but for my <U+017F>elfe they are very dangerous, <U+017F>ince the mi<U+017F>ery does not menace me for a day but for ever. Tis true, were I in your place, and you in mine, perhaps I <U+017F>hould give the <U+017F>ame advice: but certainly an eternall mi<U+017F>ery is very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: As for the fabulous conjectures of tho<U+017F>e Divinres which you <U+017F>peak of; I will for your <U+017F>ake beleeve, that perhaps they will not <U+017F>o fall out, and perhaps they will but I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, do you think any prudent per<U+017F>on will for the <U+017F>atisfaction of another, conclude all his happine<U+017F><U+017F>e or all his mi<U+017F>ery upon a perhaps? But if you Love me, u<U+017F>e no more of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: for if you do, I <U+017F>hall thinke you aime at the <U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Lindamure,</hi> more then mine. And as for him, never feare, but he will find out a better way of care then death: rea<U+017F>on and time will temper him how many de<U+017F>parato's have you <U+017F>eene, whom a little time has not perfectly cured? The<U+017F>e two faire Nymphs thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed, when they <U+017F>aw <hi>Silvia</hi> returne, and therefore they broke off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> con<U+017F>ider that not only my contentment, but all my felicitle is at the <U+017F>take: <hi>Leonida</hi> could not reply, beeau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvia</hi> was <U+017F>o neere as to heare their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. She being come, <hi>Galathea</hi> under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Celadon</hi> was awake, for li<U+017F>tning at the dore, <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>igh and groane: Tis very true, that a little while after their departure from his chamber, he did waken and the Sun <U+017F>hining very <U+017F>plendently upon his bed, as he opened his eyes he was <U+017F>o dazled that being confu<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>o great a light, he knew not where he was: his la<U+017F>t dayes paine had much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed him, but at that time he was without any pain; <U+017F>o as remembring his fall into the River and the opinion which he had a little before of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, and now finding him<U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>uch a glorious light, he knew not what to thinke, unle<U+017F><U+017F>s that Love had ravi<U+017F>hed him into heaven in recompence of his fidelitie: and that which mo<U+017F>t induced him to this opinion, was to <U+017F>ee the chamber hung with <U+017F>uch rich hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and admirable pictures, <U+017F>o lively that his yet weake eye could not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them from <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances.

A little further off was to be <U+017F>eene the picture of great <hi>Jupiter</hi> with an enflamed countenance, but grave and full of Maje<U+017F>tie, in his eyes, a mixture of benignitie and terror: with a Croune upon his head: in his left hand a Scepter, which he re<U+017F>ted upon his thigh where was to be <U+017F>eene the <U+017F>carre which he gott, when by the imprudence of the Nymph <hi>Semele,</hi> to <U+017F>ave little <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he was forced to open that place, and carry the marke of it unto the end of his tearme.

When he was thus deepe in contemplation, the three Nymphes came into his chamber, who<U+017F>e beautie and Maje<U+017F>ty, did more plunge him into admiration That which mo<U+017F>t helped on his conceipt of being dead, was, his fancying the three Nymphes to be the three Graces, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>eeing the litle Merill among<U+017F>t them who<U+017F>e <U+017F>tature, beautie, plumpne<U+017F><U+017F>e, Golden Lockes and Jolly Lookes <U+017F>eemed unto him, a <hi>Cupid.</hi> And though he was much confu<U+017F>ed in him<U+017F>elfe, yet his courage which was alwayes above the qualitie of a Shepheard did prompt him unto <U+017F>o much confidence, as to aske them in what place he was.

Country Inhabitants of fields and woods, and our wits are not Calculated for any higher Meridian, and therefore made no further inquity of you. Have you met with no further knowledge of us <U+017F>ince that (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea?)</hi> The information that I had (an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard) was from the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which my Father made of his fortunes, in which I have often ob<U+017F>erved him to mention <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> but I am not at all acquainted with any particulars concerning her, though I have much de<U+017F>ired it.

            <p>Know therefore, welcome Shepheard, that Anciently this Country now called <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> all floated with a deepe Aby<U+017F><U+017F>e of waters, &amp; only the high Mountaines about it was uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red except <U+017F>ome hills in the midde<U+017F>t of the plaine, as the Rock of <hi>I<U+017F>oures</hi> &amp; mount <hi>Verdon:</hi> <U+017F>o as all the Inhabitants did live upon the tops of the Mountaines. The Ancient families of this Country, have their names engraved upon old ruines, upon the tops of the hills. But about fourteen or fifteen ages <U+017F>ince, a Romane who in ten yeares conquered all the Gaules, did cut <U+017F>ome of the Mountaines, by which the water rann away and drained our plaines: which <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant unto him as he would needs make them habitable: and to that end cau<U+017F>ed all tho<U+017F>e who lived on the Mountaines to come and live in the plaines and cau<U+017F>ed the fir<U+017F>t building there, to be called after his owne name <hi>Julius.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e the humid plaines produced abundance of Trees, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay the country was called <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> and the people <hi>Forre<U+017F>ters;</hi> whereas before they were called the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians:</hi> but tho<U+017F>e were much deceived. For the name of <hi>Forre<U+017F>t</hi> did come from <hi>Forum,</hi> a little Towne which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans built and called <hi>Forum Segu<U+017F>ianorum,</hi> as if they would have <U+017F>aid, the place or the mar<U+017F>h of the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians,</hi> which indeed was onely the place where they kept their Armes whil<U+017F>t they were putting their neighbour Countries into order.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Celadon,</hi> is the antiquitie of this Province, as <U+017F>ome do confidently hold; but there are two opinions quite contrary. The Romans <U+017F>ay that when our plaines were all covered with water, the cha<U+017F>te godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> thought the place <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant that <U+017F>he dwelt there ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much: for her <hi>Driades</hi> and <hi>Amadriades,</hi> did live and hunt in tho<U+017F>e great woods and high hills, which circled about this great Levell of waters: and becau<U+017F>e there was no great <U+017F>tore of Fountaines, <U+017F>he came hither often with her <hi>Naiades</hi> which al<U+017F>o dwelt here: but when the waters were let out, the <hi>Naiades</hi> were forced to follow, and go with them into the wide Ocean. So as the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e lo<U+017F>ing halfe her Nymphs, and not being able to take her full <U+017F>winge of delight with <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a Traine, <U+017F>he made choice of <U+017F>ome daughters of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, and joyned them unto the Nymphs which remained, unto whom al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he gave the name of Nymphs. But <U+017F>o it hapned, that many among<U+017F>t them, <U+017F>ome being brought up under fond and tender Mothers, others u<U+017F>ed to the court<U+017F>hip of <U+017F>ervants; and not being able to take the paines of hunting, nor lo<U+017F>e the memorie of their affectionate <U+017F>ervants, they would needs go back to their hou<U+017F>es againe and Marrie. At which the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e was <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed that She for<U+017F>ooke this prophane Country, and did fly from that vice which <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much abhorred. But not to puni<U+017F>h the vertues of <U+017F>ome for the errours of others, before <U+017F>he departed <U+017F>he did for ever mo<U+017F>t ignominiou<U+017F>ly bani<U+017F>h out of the Country, all tho<U+017F>e who had beene faultie, and made choice of one, unto whom <U+017F>he gave the <U+017F>ame Authoritie which <U+017F>he had over all the Country, and willed that the Race of this one <U+017F>hould have all the Soveraigne power for ever: And ever after <U+017F>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to marry. Yet expre<U+017F>ly forbidding that any man <U+017F>hould ever <U+017F>ucced her.

But whether it was <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> yet <U+017F>o it is, as if by a <U+017F>upernaturall priviledge, we have ever <U+017F>ince been maintained
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53526:11"/>
in our priviledges, <U+017F>ince none ever troubled our tranquillitie. Nay <hi>Alaricke</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi> when with <hi>Aquitaine</hi> he had conquered all the Provinces on this <U+017F>ide <hi>Loire,</hi> knowing our <U+017F>tatutes, did confirme the priviledges, and without any u<U+017F>urpation, did leave us in our antient freedome. Perhaps you will thinke it <U+017F>trange I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o particularly talke of things which tran<U+017F>cend the capacity of my age; but you mu<U+017F>t know that <hi>Pimander</hi> my Father was very inqui<U+017F>itive unto the Antiquities of this country; <U+017F>o as the mo<U+017F>t knowing <hi>Druides</hi> did commonly make it their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, &amp; I gleaned <U+017F>uch fragments from them as mo<U+017F>t delighted me. Thus I came to know that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> my Mother was in a continued line de<U+017F>cended from her whom the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathea</hi> did elect: <U+017F>he being <U+017F>ole Lady of all the<U+017F>e Countryes, and having one Sonne called <hi>Clidaman;</hi> She brought up with us many young maides and daughters of <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, where being in <U+017F>o good a <U+017F>choole, they might learne all the vertues which their age and <U+017F>exe was capable of. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins go habited as you <U+017F>ee us, in the <U+017F>ame fa<U+017F>hion which <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathea</hi> was accu<U+017F>tomed to weare, and which in memorie of her we have con<U+017F>tantly kept. Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> I have acquainted you with our condition; and I am confident that before you part from us (for I would have you <U+017F>ee us altogether before you go) you will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that our a<U+017F><U+017F>embly will not yeild unto any other, either in vertue or beautie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celadon</hi> now knowing who the<U+017F>e Nymphes were, he knew al<U+017F>o what reverence was due unto them; and though his conver<U+017F>ation had been onely among<U+017F>t his equall Shepheards, yet his good education had taught him how to behave him<U+017F>elfe unto his <U+017F>uperiors. After he had rendred them all the honour which he thought him<U+017F>elfe obliged unto, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but wonder, <U+017F>aid he, to find my <U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many great Nymphs: and I who am but a <U+017F>imple <U+017F>illie <U+017F>hepheard, to receive <U+017F>o many favours from them. <hi>Celadon</hi> (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galathea)</hi> vertue, in what place <U+017F>oever it is will merit both Love and Honour as well when it is <U+017F>hrowded under the cheap habit of a <U+017F>hepheard, as under the rich and glorious Purple of a King; and for your particular, you are in no le<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>ideration among<U+017F>t us, then the greate<U+017F>t of the <hi>Druides</hi> or Nobles of our Court; for <U+017F>ince your merits are as great, our favours <U+017F>hall be no le<U+017F><U+017F>e. And as for your wonder at finding your <U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t us, know that it proceeds from the Providence of the Gods, who have <U+017F>o ordained it (as at more lea<U+017F>ure you may know) either becau<U+017F>e they would not have <U+017F>o much vertue lo<U+017F>t in the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts;</hi> or, intending to make you greater then you are, they will by you, make a per<U+017F>on who loves you, happy: live then, and be happy, for you need de<U+017F>ire no more then your health. Madam (an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard who did not well under<U+017F>tand this language) If I mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire mine owne health, it <U+017F>hall be only to render you <U+017F>ervice, in exchange of <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours which you are plea<U+017F>ed to conferre upon me: But for my part, I mu<U+017F>t thinke of no other cour<U+017F>e but returning to the woods and Pa<U+017F>tures; otherwi<U+017F>e the <U+017F>olemne vow which our Fathers have made unto the Gods, will accu<U+017F>e us to be unworthy children of <U+017F>uch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What vow is that, <U+017F>ad the Nymph? The Hi<U+017F>tory of it would be too long replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> but in <U+017F>hort this, Madam; All tho<U+017F>e about the Rivers of <hi>Loire, Turan, Argent</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t of the Rivers, have <U+017F>everall yeares with one accord, a<U+017F><U+017F>embled in that great Plaine which is neere Mount <hi>Verdum,</hi> and con<U+017F>idering the Inconveniences which ambition and de<U+017F>ire of rule, in that people called Romans, hath brought upon all their Neighbours, they do all by mutuall con<U+017F>ent <U+017F>weare to fly all ambition for ever, and they and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to live peaceably in the habit of <U+017F>hepheards. And ever <U+017F>ince it hath been ob<U+017F>erved (<U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing was this vow unto the Gods) that who<U+017F>oever broke this oath, did never pro<U+017F>per. And among<U+017F>t us, my Father is the mo<U+017F>t remarkable example: So as now <U+017F>eeing the will of heaven is to have us live in re<U+017F>t, we have a new ratified this vow, with <U+017F>o many <U+017F>acred oathes, as he that breakes it <U+017F>hall be mo<U+017F>t dete<U+017F>table. I do profe<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, I am very glad to heare this: for I never knew before, the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>o many good and antient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies have for<U+017F>aken Townes and <U+017F>pend their dayes in woods and <U+017F>olitary places. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> if your condition will permit you, I <U+017F>hall be very glad to heare you relate the fortune of your Father <hi>Al<U+017F>ippes,</hi> and why he betooke him<U+017F>elfe to that kind of life, which he had <U+017F>o long laid a<U+017F>ide; for I am mo<U+017F>t confident, it is mo<U+017F>t worthy of knowledge.

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of</hi> Alcippes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> you command me to relate the mo<U+017F>t intricate <U+017F>tory in the world; and in which one may learne that who<U+017F>oever contrives the hurt of another mu<U+017F>t prepare him<U+017F>elfe for a great part of it. In obedience therefore to your commands I <U+017F>hall briefly tel you, what I have gleaned from the ordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of him, unto whom all the things hapned: for, to make us more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of our happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in living at re<U+017F>t, my Father hath often related unto us his <U+017F>trange fortunes. Be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, Madam that <hi>Alcippes,</hi> being educated by his Father in the <U+017F>implicitie of a <U+017F>hepherd, had ever a Genius far different from his education; and any thing that <U+017F>melt of a Town plea<U+017F>ed him much better then a Field: So as when he was a little boy, his delight was in a<U+017F><U+017F>embling other boys together, and <U+017F>etting them into order; and do what the grave Signiors could, he would <U+017F>till be teaching them how to arme them<U+017F>elves, and <U+017F>hoot in bowes. The Ancients of our village, who ob<U+017F>erved his actions did Prophe<U+017F>ie great troubles to en<U+017F>ue upon their country, and that <hi>Alcippes</hi> was of too turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a <U+017F>pirit to be kept within the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of a <U+017F>hepherd. When his age became more virile he fell in Love with the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who was then <U+017F>ecretly corrted by another <U+017F>hepheard called <hi>Alces.</hi> And <hi>Alcippes</hi> having <U+017F>o good a conceipt of him<U+017F>elfe, that he thought any <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s would bid his affection welcome when<U+017F>oever it was offered, he re<U+017F>olved not to u<U+017F>e much artifice, in declaring him<U+017F>elfe: <U+017F>o as meeting her at one of the Sacrifices unto <hi>Pan.</hi> as <U+017F>he was returning home to her village he <U+017F>aid unto her; I could never have believed my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o weake, as not to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the blowes of an enemy, who hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me and never thought upon it. She an<U+017F>wered him, that he who wounds again<U+017F>t his will ought not to be called an enemy. But I do find it otherwi<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered he, and therefore I may very well give this name unto you: who I? replyed <U+017F>he, I was never <U+017F>o, either in thought or act: for I ever <U+017F>et a great valew upon your merit. This is one of the wounds you give me, <U+017F>aid he: but I <U+017F>ee you can carry Love in your eyes and in your mouth, but will not harbour it in your heart: The <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e then finding her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, and that he did meane matter of Love, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered: I do <U+017F>et <U+017F>uch a value upon your vertue <hi>Alcippes</hi> as I ought to do; but as for any Love, whereof you <U+017F>peak, beleeve me I have none for any, either in my eyes or heart; e<U+017F>pecially for <U+017F>uch pittyfull <U+017F>pirits as can content them<U+017F>elves to live like Savages in woods. It is not the election of love but my de<U+017F>tinie which makes me yours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the <U+017F>hepherd; and <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>emblance of humor there is betwixt us, that I have borne a mo<U+017F>t deadly hatred unto a <U+017F>hepherds life, which you <U+017F>corne <U+017F>o much, even from my very cradle: I do prote<U+017F>t that if changing my condition will promote me into your favour I wil immediatly quit my flock and <U+017F>heephooke, and live among<U+017F>t men, not among<U+017F>t Salvages. You may change your condition, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Amarillis,</hi> but not me; for I am re<U+017F>olved to be <U+017F>till <U+017F>o much my <U+017F>elfe, as not to give my affection unto another. If therefore you would have us live as formerly we have done leave off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of affection and Love, and talke of <U+017F>uch things as we were wont, el<U+017F>e thinke it not <U+017F>trange that I bani<U+017F>h you my pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>ince it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that Love and the Civilitie of <hi>Amarillis</hi> <U+017F>hould dwell together. <hi>Al<U+017F>ippe</hi> not expecting <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer was <U+017F>o confounded that it was a long while before he could an<U+017F>wer but, being come to him<U+017F>elfe, he was per<U+017F>waded, that it was the ba<U+017F>hfullne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her age and <U+017F>exe, not want of any good will to him, made her give <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he an<U+017F>wered: what<U+017F>oever you are plea<U+017F>ed to be or <U+017F>ay, I <U+017F>hall never be any thing but your devoted <U+017F>ervant. And if the command you have impo<U+017F>ed upon me were not incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with my affection, you may mo<U+017F>t confidently beleeve, that nothing in the world can make me di<U+017F>obey. But I be<U+017F>eech you excu<U+017F>e and <U+017F>uffer me to continue my de<U+017F>igne which is onely a te<U+017F>timony of your merit: for whether you will or no, I am re<U+017F>olved to pro<U+017F>ecute it. The <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e then turning her eye <U+017F>milingly upon him, I know not <hi>Al<U+017F>ippe</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) whether this be for <U+017F>ome wager, or out of willfullne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that you <U+017F>peake thus. It is both (an<U+017F>wered he) for I have laid a wager with my de<U+017F>ires to overcome you, or to die: and this re<U+017F>olution is changed into ob<U+017F>tinate willfullne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince nothing can divert me from that oath which I have taker. I <U+017F>hould have been very glad, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Amarillis,</hi> if you had made choice of <U+017F>ome other marke for your importunities: Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepherd, all this cannot make me alter my de<U+017F>igne; Then think not much, replyed <hi>Amarillis,</hi> if I be as firme in my ob<U+017F>tinacie, as you are in your importunitie. The <U+017F>hepherd would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, but he was interrupted by many <U+017F>hepherds comming towards them. So as <hi>Amarillis</hi> for a conclu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>aid unto him in a low voice, you will do me a great di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure <hi>Alcippe,</hi> if your re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>hould be knowne: I can be contented to know your follies, but <U+017F>hould,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53526:12"/>
be much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed if any other <U+017F>hould know them. Thus ended my Fathers fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Amarillis,</hi> which did infinitly angment his de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>erving her. As they went along the way they met <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinda,</hi> who were ob<U+017F>erving two turtles, billing and making Love unto each other, not caring a <U+017F>traw who <U+017F>aw them, which gave <hi>Alcippes</hi> an occa<U+017F>ion to remember the la<U+017F>t commands of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> and to <U+017F>ing the<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es; and becau<U+017F>e his voice was very good, every one did lend a <U+017F>ilent eare.</p>

               <p>But he, not being able to abide in that place where he was wont to <U+017F>ee her, he re<U+017F>olved (what<U+017F>oever came on't) to be gone; and as <U+017F>oone as he <U+017F>ought for an occa<U+017F>ion, he found it to his hearts de<U+017F>ire. A little before, the Mother of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> died: and Preparations were in hand to entertaine her in the great Citie of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles</hi> as their new Lady, with abundance of Tryumph. This <U+017F>olemnity, did draw thither out of curlo<U+017F>itie, mo<U+017F>t of the Country: and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, my Father obtained leave to be one: from hence did <U+017F>pring much of his mi<U+017F>erie. He was in the prime of his age; faire, beyond any in the Country; his hair flaxen which naturally curled in rings, and which he wore very long; in briefe, Madam he was <U+017F>uch a one as I beleeve Love did chu<U+017F>e out for a marke of revenge; and thus it was. There was a certain Lady which had <U+017F>een him and loved him in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ecret di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e that we could never know her name. When he came fir<U+017F>t to <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> he came as a <U+017F>hepherd, but in a very hand<U+017F>om mode; and to the end he <U+017F>hould not run into any extravagancyes, as he did in his owne Hamlet his Father <U+017F>ent two <U+017F>hepherds with him as guardians, the principall of which was called <hi>Cleantes,</hi> a man who<U+017F>e humour was <U+017F>utable unto my Fathers, in<U+017F>omuch as he affected him exceedingly. This <hi>Cleantes</hi> had a Son called <hi>Clindor</hi> equall in age with my Father, and had a naturall inclination to Love <hi>Alcippe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcippe,</hi> in retaliation of this affection, did al<U+017F>o Love him above any other; which was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing unto <hi>Cleantes,</hi> that he could not deny my Father any thing and therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ob<U+017F>erved how other Gallants were habited: how they were armed; and how they fought at Barriers, both of them be<U+017F>eeched <hi>Cleantes</hi> for <U+017F>uch allowance as might put them into the equipage of appearing among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e Knights and Gallants. Have you <U+017F>o much courage (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleantes</hi> unto them) as to equal your <U+017F>elves with them? Why not? (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Alcippes)</hi> have I not armes and thighes as well as they? Though you have, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleantes)</hi> yet you have not learned the Garbe, and civill deportment of Townes. Tis true (an<U+017F>wered he) but <U+017F>uch ceremonies are not <U+017F>o difficult as to bla<U+017F>t the hopes of quickly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. You have not yet the u<U+017F>e of your armes (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleantes)</hi> nor know how to fence, or fight as they do: Tis no matter replyed <hi>Alcippes,</hi> we have courage enough to <U+017F>upply that defect. Why would you leave off a country life? Said <hi>Cleantes;</hi> what <U+017F>hould men do in woods (An<U+017F>wered <hi>Alcippes)</hi> and what good can men learne among<U+017F>t bea<U+017F>ts? It will vexe you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcippe,</hi> to be <U+017F>lighted by the Ladies, who will <U+017F>light and <U+017F>corne you, and upbraid you with the name of <U+017F>hepheards. If to be a Shepheard be ignominious, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippe)</hi> let us own that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion no longer; and if it be not, then the di<U+017F>dain will not hurt us: for if they do, I will indeavour by my actions to get honour and e<U+017F>teem among<U+017F>t them. At la<U+017F>t <hi>Cleantes</hi> <U+017F>eeing their re<U+017F>olutions to change their lives; well children (<U+017F>aid he) <U+017F>ince you are thus re<U+017F>olved, let me tell you that though you pa<U+017F><U+017F>e under the notion of <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, yet your extraction is from the be<U+017F>t branch in the Country, and the noble<U+017F>t Knights in all <hi>France,</hi> have no better a pedigree then you have, though your Ancienters upon <U+017F>ome certain con<U+017F>iderations, made choice of <U+017F>uch a retired kind of life. Never fear, therefore, the

finding a good reception among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Cavaliers, <U+017F>ince the very be<U+017F>t among<U+017F>t them is of your own blood. The<U+017F>e words, did kindle the <U+017F>parks of their de<U+017F>ire unto a flame; and made them more forward to put their re<U+017F>olutions into execution; never reflecting upon the future, nor thinking what inconveniency that kind of life might bring them; nor dorring at the di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of <hi>Alcippes</hi> Father. <hi>Cleantes</hi> provides them all nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries; they did quickly in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into acquaintance, and get love among<U+017F>t the be<U+017F>t; <hi>Alcippes</hi> was grown <U+017F>o expert in armes; that he was accompted one of the be<U+017F>t Knights of his time.</p>
               <p>During this fea<U+017F>t, which la<U+017F>ted two monthes, a certain Lady as I told you before, had <U+017F>een my Father, and was <U+017F>o much taken with him that <U+017F>he devi<U+017F>ed this Stratagem to bring her ends about. Upon a day when my Father was in the Temple; an old woman came and <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elfe clo<U+017F>e by him: and <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he were at her prayers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid two or three times, <hi>Alcippes, Alcippes,</hi> but never looked towards him. He hearing him<U+017F>elfe named, did think to ask her what <U+017F>he would have with him, but <U+017F>eeing her eyes turned another way; he thought <U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken to <U+017F>ome other. She perceiving that he heard her, continued, <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> it is to you I <U+017F>peak, though I did not look upon you; if you will enjoy a better fortune, then ever any Knight in our Court did, meet me in the twilight at the <hi>Piazza</hi> neere the Pallace, and there I will accquaint you further. <hi>Alcippe</hi> hearing this, an<U+017F>wered her with a regardle<U+017F><U+017F>e look, that he would be there: and he failed not. For as <U+017F>oon as night came, he went to the place appointed, where he tarried not long for the old woman, who mufled up in a taffatle hood, took him a<U+017F>ide and <U+017F>aid unto him, Young man thou art the happie<U+017F>t man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the affection of the faire<U+017F>t Lady, and greate<U+017F>t beautie in all this Court, whom (upon <U+017F>uch conditions as I <U+017F>hall require) if thou wilt, thou <U+017F>halt enjoy, and receive fullne<U+017F><U+017F>e of delight. Young <hi>Alcippe</hi> hearing this faire offer, asked who the Lady was? Fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you mu<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e never to enquire her name, but to keep your happy fortune extreamly <U+017F>ecret; the next condition is, that you let me blind your eyes, when I conduct you to her. <hi>Alcippe</hi> told her, that as for enquiring her name, and keeping <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y, he would mo<U+017F>t wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly con<U+017F>ent; but as for his being blinded, he would never <U+017F>uffer it. What do<U+017F>t thou fear man, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he): I fear not any thing, an<U+017F>wered he, but I would have mine eyes at liberty. Fond young man (<U+017F>aid the old woman) what a novice yet thou art? Can<U+017F>t thou find a heart to <U+017F>light <U+017F>uch a fair opportunity upon <U+017F>uch ea<U+017F>ie conditions? Come come, never dorr at it, nor doubt any danger: where is the courage that thy pre<U+017F>ence promi<U+017F>eth? can any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary perill affright thee from a mo<U+017F>t certain happine<U+017F><U+017F>e? Then <U+017F>eeing him un willing; Cur<U+017F>ed be thy mother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) who brought thee forth: thou ha<U+017F>t thy countenance &amp; thy courage more from her, then thy father: Young <hi>Alcippes</hi> could not hear the language of this angry old woman without laughing: and afterwards bethinking him<U+017F>elfe what enemyes he had, he re<U+017F>olved to go along with her, provided <U+017F>he would let him weare his <U+017F>word; and <U+017F>o he <U+017F>uffered her to hood wink him, and conduct him whether <U+017F>he would. I <U+017F>hould be too long and tedious, Madam, <U+017F>hould I relate every particular of this night: but after many turnings and windings, and perhaps <U+017F>everall times one way, he was brought into a chamber, where blindfold, he was undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by this old woman, and got into bed: A little after came the Lady who <U+017F>ent for him, and went to bed unto him, where after the light was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away <U+017F>he did unmuffle his eyes: but, do what he could, he could not draw one <U+017F>yllable from her. So as he ro<U+017F>e the next morning, and knew not who his bedfellow was, onely he imagined her to be young and fair: and an hour before day <U+017F>he who brought him thither; came to conduct him back again with the <U+017F>ame ceremonies: And it was agreed between them, that when<U+017F>oever he was to come again; he <U+017F>hould find a little <U+017F>tone in a corner of the <hi>Piazza</hi> the <U+017F>ame morning.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <hi>Alcippes</hi> Father dyed: <U+017F>o as he was <U+017F>ole Ma<U+017F>ter of him<U+017F>elf; and had not the commands of <hi>Amarillis</hi> re<U+017F>trained him, perhaps he might have retired him<U+017F>elfe into a Country life again. For all the favours of this unknowne Lady could not drive her out of his mind. The great gifts which he often received from her, could not do it: nor could the favours of <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> which he had obtained, have retained him from the woods. But, it being hard for a young <U+017F>pirit to keep any thing <U+017F>ecret long, <hi>Clindor</hi> his dear friend <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>pend after a va<U+017F>t rate, he asked him how he was able to maintaine <U+017F>o great an expence? At fir<U+017F>t he was <U+017F>omthing <U+017F>hie; but afterwards, told him his adventure of this unknown Lady; and how all the art he had, could not di<U+017F>cover who <U+017F>he was <hi>Clindor</hi> advi<U+017F>ed him the next time he went to cut off a peece of the fringe at the foot of the bed and the next morning to go unto all the hou<U+017F>es which he could <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, and try if he could find any <U+017F>uch bed; which he did; and by this trick my Father came to the knowledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53526:14"/>
of her who was <U+017F>o favourable unto him. Yet he ever kept it <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, that neither <hi>Clindor,</hi> or any of his children could ever know it. But the fir<U+017F>t time he went to her after this, when he was ready to ri<U+017F>e in the morning he conjured her to conceal her <U+017F>elfe no longer, for he knew <U+017F>he was <U+017F>uch a one. She, hearing her <U+017F>elfe named, was ready to <U+017F>peak: yet <U+017F>he kept <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, untill the old woman came: then when <hi>Alcippes</hi> was gone, <U+017F>he terrified her with a thou<U+017F>and meanaces, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>covered her unto him; <U+017F>o as the poor old band came trembling to my Father and told him that he had deceived her. Then he in a <U+017F>miling manner told her his device which he had u<U+017F>ed, and that it was the invention of <hi>Clindor.</hi> She, extreamly glad of this di<U+017F>covery, after a thou<U+017F>and denialls of it, went to tell this Lady of it. And when <U+017F>he knew that <hi>Clindor</hi> was the inventor of this artifice, <U+017F>he turned her anger again<U+017F>t him, &amp; ea<U+017F>ily pardoned <hi>Alcippe,</hi> whom indeed <U+017F>he could not hate: yet from that day <U+017F>he never <U+017F>ent for him again. And <U+017F>ince nothing is <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet as revenge unto an offended <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this woman was never at re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he had <U+017F>prung a quarrell between <hi>Clindor</hi> and one that was Cozen unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> whom <hi>Clindor</hi> killed; and though he was pur<U+017F>ued, yet by the help of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> he got into <hi>Anvergne</hi> and <U+017F>aved him<U+017F>elfe: But <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> tran<U+017F>acted <U+017F>o with <hi>Alerick</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> who was then at <hi>Thoulou<U+017F>e,</hi> as he did impri<U+017F>on him at <hi>U<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> with command unto his officers that they <U+017F>hould remit him into the hands of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> who intended his death. <hi>Alcippe</hi> left no <U+017F>tone unturned to obtain his pardon but all in vaine. Wherefore fore<U+017F>eeing the inevitable ruine of his freind he re<U+017F>olved at what rate <U+017F>oever, eyther to <U+017F>ave him or die with him. He was then at <hi>U<U+017F><U+017F>on,</hi> as I told you before, a place <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, as it <U+017F>eemed meere folly to attempt the getting him out: however not being able to live without <hi>Clindor,</hi> he re<U+017F>olved to be beforehand with tho<U+017F>e who were to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Pimander:</hi> <U+017F>o as going away in a di<U+017F>content, he get a dozen freinds, and came to the gates of the Ca<U+017F>tle, clad like Country fellowes, having under their jackets <U+017F>hort <U+017F>words, and baskets on their armes, as if they came to <U+017F>ell <U+017F>omething. I have <U+017F>ince heard him <U+017F>ay, that there was three Forts all one within another. The<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olute Pea<U+017F>ants came to the outmo<U+017F>t of them, where they found very few of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> upon the Guard: for mo<U+017F>t of them were gone into the Town, to provide nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries for the Garri<U+017F>on. Being come <U+017F>o neer, they offered their commodities to <U+017F>ell at <U+017F>o cheap a rate, that almo<U+017F>t all within came to buy them. Then my Father, <U+017F>pying his opportunity got him who guarded the gate by the neck, killed him; and at that very in<U+017F>tant every one of his commpanions killed his man<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in, kept the re<U+017F>t out at the <U+017F>words point: then running to the Pri<U+017F>ons they found <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> and <U+017F>o many others, as being armed they thought able to maintaine the Garri<U+017F>on. To abridge my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I will onely tell you Madam, that though upon the Alarme the gates of the Town were <U+017F>hut, yet they forced them and got out without the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of one man, though the Governour who was killed there, did make a very brave re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. Thus was <hi>Clindor</hi> <U+017F>aved, &amp; <hi>Alerick</hi> being accquainted, that this enterprize was acted by my Father he was <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t him, as he <U+017F>ent to <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> to demand ju<U+017F>tice upon him &amp; <U+017F>he unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lo<U+017F>e his friend<U+017F>hip, <U+017F>ent pre<U+017F>ently to <U+017F>ea<U+017F>e upon my Father: but his friends gave him <U+017F>uch timely notice of it, that he got out of the Country, and joyned him<U+017F>elfe with a Nation who a little after entred <hi>France</hi> and in ho<U+017F>tile manner came as farr as the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> and <hi>Arar,</hi> and <U+017F>ome part of the <hi>Allobroges;</hi> and being de<U+017F>irous to enlarge their territories they made a fierce warr upon the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> the <hi>O<U+017F>trogots</hi> &amp; the Romans: among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e was my Father entertained, &amp; being known for a man of valour, was pre<U+017F>ently honoured with <U+017F>everall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But within a few yeares, <hi>Gondioch</hi> King of this Nation dying, <hi>Gordebert</hi> his Sonn <U+017F>ucceeded him in the Throne of <hi>Bourgundie:</hi> and being de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ettle his affaires in the beginning he contracted peace with his neighbours, marrying his Son <hi>Sigi<U+017F>mond</hi> unto one of the Daughters of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>O<U+017F>trogots:</hi> and to hold faire with <hi>Alerick</hi> who was implacably offended again<U+017F>t <hi>Alcippes,</hi> he promi<U+017F>ed to entertaine him no longer.

But the Love to ones own country being above all others, my Father though in great favour with <U+017F>o many Emperours, yet had greater de<U+017F>ire to breathe in his own native aire: and Fortune did pre<U+017F>ent the meanes unto him when he lea<U+017F>t expected it. <hi>Alerick</hi> died: and <hi>Tyherre</hi> his Son <U+017F>ucceeded him, who having many Brothers, had enough to do in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his own, without thinking upon his Fathers enemyes. And therefore, being de<U+017F>irous to carry fair withall in the beginning of his Reigne, he publi<U+017F>hed a generall Act of Oblivion, which pardoned all offences committed in his Kingdome. This was a good <U+017F>tep to <hi>Alcippes</hi> returne, if <hi>Pimander</hi> had once forgot the injurie which he received: yet as the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> were in<U+017F>trumentall in his bani<U+017F>hment, <U+017F>o Fortune would have them as forward in his repeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> little before, (as I told you) <hi>Arthur,</hi> King of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> had in<U+017F>tituted the Knights of the Round Table: an order con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of a certain number of young vertuous men, who were obliged to go and <U+017F>eek adventures, to puni<U+017F>h the wicked, to relieve the oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and to defend the honour of Ladies. Then the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> which then dwelt in <hi>Pampo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luna,</hi> in imitation of this Order, did chu<U+017F>e out a number of Knights, who went into many Countries and <U+017F>hewed their valour. And at that time, there came one of the<U+017F>e <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long wandring through many Countries, unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles;</hi> where having made his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tomed challenge, he vanqui<U+017F>hed many of <hi>Pimanders</hi> Knights who<U+017F>e heads he all cut off, and as en<U+017F>igns of his valour, <U+017F>ent them unto a Lady in <hi>Spain</hi> whom he courted as his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s Among<U+017F>t he re<U+017F>t <hi>Amarillis</hi> lo<U+017F>t an Uncle, who, like my Father not reli<U+017F>hing a Shepherds life, had betaken him<U+017F>elfe to armes. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Amarillis</hi> heard of this <U+017F>ad Accident, <U+017F>he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the news by letter unto my Father; not with any de<U+017F>igne of his comming to her but only to make him a partner in her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e. Love, which ever prompts a noble <U+017F>oul unto a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and generous de<U+017F>ignes, would not permit my Father to know of <hi>Amarillis</hi> lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>itt <U+017F>till: but he re<U+017F>olved immediatly upon revenge. Therefore with the Emperors leave he came di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed into <hi>Cleantes</hi> hou<U+017F>e, who under<U+017F>tanding his re<U+017F>olution, did endeavour to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade him, but Loves arguments were of more validity then his. One morning when <hi>Pimander</hi> was going to the Temple, <hi>Alcippes</hi> armed <hi>Cap a pe</hi> pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf before him; and though his helmet was up, yet his beard was <U+017F>o grown <U+017F>ince his departure, that he was not knowable. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Pimander</hi> under<U+017F>tood his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, he <U+017F>ent an Herald to acquaint the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igot</hi> with it: To be <U+017F>hort, my Father overcame him; and pre<U+017F>ented his <U+017F>word unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was exceedingly glad that this cruell <hi>Vi<U+017F>igot</hi> was vanqui<U+017F>hed. Then, not making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe known unto any, except <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who <U+017F>aw him in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Cleantes,</hi> he returned unto <hi>Bizantium,</hi> where he found his accu<U+017F>tomed entertainment. Mean while <hi>Cleantes</hi> de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more then to <U+017F>ee him in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> at liberty, did di<U+017F>cover him unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know the name of that man who fought with the <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Pimander</hi> at fir<U+017F>t was amazed; but afterwards being moved by the vertue of this man, he asked whether it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>till alive? To whom <hi>Cleantes</hi> made an<U+017F>wer, relating all his long voyages and <U+017F>ervices of <U+017F>o many Kings: Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>Pimander,</hi> this mans vertue merits reward and not bani<U+017F>hment: let him returne, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him that his de<U+017F>erts <U+017F>hall find from me a full reward. I freely pardon him all that ever he did again<U+017F>t me. Thus my Father, after he had been <U+017F>eaven yeares in <hi>Greece,</hi> returned into his Country, and was much honoured both by <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who conferred upon him one of the greate<U+017F>t offices about their per<U+017F>ons. Abundance of any thing cloys and faded de<U+017F>ires have no force in them. As <U+017F>oon as my Father, had ta<U+017F>ted the favours of Fortune in a full mea<U+017F>ure, his ta<U+017F>t was glutted and he de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed them. Some good Angell, intending to draw him out of that Gulfe, in which he had <U+017F>o often been <U+017F>o nigh a <U+017F>hipwrack, did in<U+017F>pire him with <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as the<U+017F>e Come <hi>Alcippe,</hi> would he <U+017F>ay unto him<U+017F>elf, I mu<U+017F>t take thee under exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; what doe<U+017F>t thou intend to do?

Thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tand day and night upon thy Guard, both again<U+017F>t friends and enemies: if thou do<U+017F>t yeild, there is no creature <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable as a cre<U+017F>t-falne Courtier, out of favour.

and which can never be found any where el<U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e, Madam, were the con<U+017F>iderations which brought my Father unto his fir<U+017F>t Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Wherein he enjoyed the height of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e: for he was <U+017F>o much beloved and honored by all his neighbours, that they held him for their Oracle; yet this was not the end: For he was no <U+017F>ooner at home, but Love began to open his fir<U+017F>t wound: and <hi>Amarillis</hi> did co<U+017F>t him more mi<U+017F>ery, then all the re<U+017F>t of his misfortunes. Then did he revive that Device which he bore in all his travells which was in French <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne de Gray,</hi> meaning thereby <hi>Peine I'ay;</hi> in Engli<U+017F>h, The mi<U+017F>ery I endure. From this Love of his did grow an inveterate hatred. For <hi>Alces, A<U+017F>treas</hi> Father, was al<U+017F>o infinitly in Love with <hi>Amarillis;</hi> and <hi>Amaril is,</hi> during my Fathers exile, did, by the command of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, permit it: on the other <U+017F>ide <hi>Alcippe,</hi> though he had ca<U+017F>t off his habit of Chivalrie, yet he retained his courage; and not being able to admit of any Rivall, did often fall foule with <hi>Alces,</hi> who al<U+017F>o had courage enough; And it was the thought of everyone, that if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Amarillis</hi> had not con<U+017F>ented to give her unto <hi>Alcippes,</hi> one of them two had died for it. But though this marriage <U+017F>topped all quarrells, yet there <U+017F>till remaines <U+017F>uch roots of hatred, as will never be quite eradicated <U+017F>o as <U+017F>till there is no familiarity between <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Alcippes:</hi> Thus much fair Nymph (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Silvia)</hi> perhaps you have heard in our Town, when you were there for I am Son unto <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis;</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is Daughter unto <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Hippolyta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Celadon</hi> ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e not without much paine: for <U+017F>peaking was trouble<U+017F>ome to him: and this was the rea<U+017F>on he did <U+017F>o abreylate his relation. But <hi>Galathea</hi> was unimaginably <U+017F>atisfied, when <U+017F>he heard of what Parents this Shepherd was de<U+017F>cended, whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much Loved.</p>
               <p>As long as day la<U+017F>ted, the<U+017F>e faire Nymphes <U+017F>o entertained <hi>Celadon,</hi> that had not <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> change infinitly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed him, he had found no great cau<U+017F>e to be weary of them: for they were very fair, and al<U+017F>o full of di<U+017F>cretion: Yet as the ca<U+017F>e was with him, he could not chu<U+017F>e but de<U+017F>ire to be alone and fore<U+017F>eeing that would not be till night, which would force them away, he wi<U+017F>hed for it every minute. When he was mo<U+017F>t alone, he thought him<U+017F>elfe be<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied: for night being come, and the Nymphes retired to their chambers, his own thoughts came to accompany him with <U+017F>uch cruell Memorandums, as made him uncapable of any other companions di<U+017F>mall de<U+017F>paire did look him in the face; for if again<U+017F>t the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>entence of his Mi<U+017F>tris, he did oppo<U+017F>e his innocency, then the <U+017F>uddain execution of it did appear in the eyes of his fancy. And as he was falling from one thought into another his hand fell a cidentally upon the Riband tyed to his arme, in which was <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Ring: Oh what horrid memorialls came then into his mind? Then did he fancy the fury which her <U+017F>oul expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed both by words and actions, when <U+017F>he pronounced the <U+017F>entence of his bani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then after a long and <U+017F>ad contemplation upon this la<U+017F>t dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, he began to think upon the change of his Fortune; how happy he had been, and how <U+017F>he favoured him. Then begun he to think what <U+017F>he had done for him how for his <U+017F>ake <U+017F>he had <U+017F>lighted many well qualified <U+017F>hepherds how little <U+017F>he valued the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of her Father, or anger of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they oppo<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t her affection: then began he to con<U+017F>ider, that Fortune is as fickle in matters of Love as in any thing el<U+017F>e: and how few of all her favours remained with him, which was only a Bracelet of her hair tyed about his arme; and a Picture which he wore at his bre<U+017F>t, who<U+017F>e Ca<U+017F>e he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed many a time: as for the Ring which he wore about the other arme he e<U+017F>teemed that, rather as forced then of any benevolence. Then upon a <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he remembred the Letters which <U+017F>he had writ unto him in the happie dayes of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in favour and which he alwayes carried about with him in a little bagg. Oh what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was he in when he fir<U+017F>t thought upon them! for he feared le<U+017F>t the Nymphes when they pulled off his cloathes <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>een them. In this doubt he called out aloud for the little Merril: for he allwayes waited in a Lobby clo<U+017F>e by. The little boy, hearing him call <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two or three times, came to <U+017F>ee what his plea<U+017F>ure was. My little officer (<U+017F>aith <hi>Celadon)</hi> doe<U+017F>t thou know what is become of my clothes? for they containe <U+017F>omthing which would much perplex me to lo<U+017F>e: Your clothes Sir, <U+017F>aid he, are not far from hence, but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, for I <U+017F>earched them. Oh <hi>Meril</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Shepheard) thou art much mi<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for there was <U+017F>omething which I valued above my life; then turning towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>ide of the bed he began to make exceeding <U+017F>ad complaints a long while together. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> hearing him, was on the one <U+017F>ide very <U+017F>orry to heare him lament as he did; and on the other <U+017F>ide was in great doubt whether he <U+017F>hould tell him all he knew: at la<U+017F>t not being able to be longer a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his <U+017F>orrowes; he told him that he needed not to trouble him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much for he was <U+017F>ure the Nymph <hi>Galathea</hi> loved him too wel to keep from him any thing which he <U+017F>o much valued: At this, <hi>Celadon</hi> turned towards him, and asked whether

And truly if it be <U+017F>he, whom I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it is, She is one of the faire<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t admirably qualified per<U+017F>ons, that ever mine eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: her name is <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> and that which induceth me to beleeve it is <U+017F>he, is this word <hi>Phillis:</hi> for tho<U+017F>e two Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es are intimate companions. And though, as I told you, her beauty be beyond al compari<U+017F>ons, yet it is the lea<U+017F>t amiable quality in her for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o ful of <U+017F>everall perfections, as her beauty is the lea<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was but a wider opening of <hi>Galatheas</hi> wound, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>til greater difficulties appeared in the accompli<U+017F>hment of her de<U+017F>igne. And being unwilling to impart any more unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> <U+017F>he tyed up the papers and went to bed not without a croud of various thoughts, which <U+017F>leep by degrees did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e. As <U+017F>oon as the day dawned, litle <hi>Merill</hi> went out of the Shepherds chamber, who had done nothing but lament all the night long: and <hi>Galathea</hi> having commanded him to have a very <U+017F>trict ob<U+017F>ervance over all the actions of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and to make a report unto her, he went out to accquaint her with his ob<U+017F>ervations: <hi>Galathea</hi> was awake, and talking aloud with <hi>Leonida,</hi> litle <hi>Merill</hi> knocked at the dore, and came in. Madam, <U+017F>aid he, not a wink of <U+017F>leep have I got all this night: for poor <hi>Celadon</hi> is even at deaths dore for want of tho<U+017F>e papers you took from me ye<U+017F>terday: and <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>uch lamentable de<U+017F>paire, I could not chu<U+017F>e but comfort him a little, by telling him that you had them How? Replied the Nymph, knowes he that I have them? Yes Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merill,</hi> and he told me that he would ask you for them, for he has a great e<U+017F>teem of them: had you heard as I did, how he lamented the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of them, it would have forced your heart to pitty him. Good <hi>Merill,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph, tell me what he <U+017F>aid?

                  </gap>he turned to the other <U+017F>ide, as if di<U+017F>tracted, and <U+017F>aid, Now are all things at the very wor<U+017F>t; and after a while <U+017F>ilence, thinking me in bed and a <U+017F>leep, I heard him <U+017F>igh and <U+017F>ay aloud. Oh <hi>A<U+017F>trea, A<U+017F>trea,</hi> mu<U+017F>t bani<U+017F>hment be the recompence of all my faithfull <U+017F>ervices? If thy affection be changed, why do<U+017F>t thou blame me to excu<U+017F>e thy <U+017F>elfe? If I have been faulty, why is not my fault made knowne unto me? Is there no Ju<U+017F>tice in Heaven, nor pitty in thy heart? If therebe, why do I find no favour from either? that I might either dy, or obey <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> comwand. Oh mo<U+017F>t cruell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; if I <U+017F>hould die, would it not argue rather deficiency of Love, then exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of courage? Then he pau<U+017F>ed a while and afterwards began again But whither would my flattering and truycerous hopes tran<U+017F>port me? Dare ye once againe appear unto me? what <U+017F>hadow of any hope can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be, after <U+017F>o much time <U+017F>pent, after <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices performed <U+017F>o much affection expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>daines endured, and many impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities vanqui<U+017F>hed. Mu<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>ence be the pittifull reward of all the<U+017F>e? No, no, hope rather for a favour from a grave than from her. After much <U+017F>uch like di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he was <U+017F>ilent a long while; then turning him<U+017F>elfe in bed, I heard him begin his lamentations, which continued untill day: and all were complaints again<U+017F>t one <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom he accu<U+017F>ed of change, and cruelty. <hi>Galathea</hi> knew <U+017F>o much of <hi>Celadons</hi> e<U+017F>tate, by <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Letters, and by <hi>Merills</hi> report, that it had been better for her, if <U+017F>he had been more ignorant; yet flattering her <U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>he imagined that <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> <U+017F>corne might happily make the way more ea<U+017F>ie to accompli<U+017F>h her de<U+017F>ires: But tho<U+017F>e are Novi<U+017F>ts in the School of Love who know not, that Love never dies in a noble &amp; generous heart: and that the root of it, is never quite pulled up. Yet in this hope <U+017F>he writ a note, and put it among<U+017F>t the Letters of <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> afterwards, giving the bundle to <hi>Merill,</hi> Here <hi>Merill</hi> <U+017F>aid flie, carry this bundle unto <hi>Celadon</hi> and tel him, that I wi<U+017F>h I could as well render him all the contentments which he wants.

and to read that which <U+017F>he had writ. <hi>Merill</hi> he went away; and <hi>Leonida</hi> being in another bed <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>ee the bundle, nor hear the me<U+017F><U+017F>age which <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>ent; but as <U+017F>oon as he was gone, <U+017F>he called her into the <U+017F>ame bed: then began thus to talke: You know <hi>Leonida,</hi> what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we had ye<U+017F>terday concerning this Shepherd; <U+017F>ince that, I have met with more intelligence then I could have wi<U+017F>hed; you heard what <hi>Merill</hi> <U+017F>aid, and what <hi>Silvia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> perfections; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>ince the Fort is taken, I fore<U+017F>ee a double diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in getting it againe: yet I find that this happy Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e hath much offended him, and a generous heart cannot brook a di<U+017F>dain with out a re<U+017F>ent.

The whole cour<U+017F>e of your actions will be mea<U+017F>ured by it; what would you think of another that <U+017F>hould lead <U+017F>uch a life? You wil an<U+017F>wer me perhaps, that you do no ill: Oh Madam, it is not enough for a per<U+017F>on of your quality to be free from crime, but they mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o free from <U+017F>candall. Were he a man worthy of you, I <U+017F>hould with <U+017F>ome patience allow of it; but <hi>Celadon</hi> though he be the chiefe of the Country, yet he is a Shepherd, and not known for any more; and this vaine opinion of happy or unhappy can it <U+017F>o far bewitch you, and <U+017F>o degenerate your <U+017F>pirit as to equall <U+017F>heep-keepers, clownes and halfe-<U+017F>avages with your <U+017F>elfe. For Heavens <U+017F>ake. Madam, con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e things, and be your <U+017F>elfe, <hi>Leonida</hi> had continued on, if <hi>Galathea</hi> in a great rage had not interrupted her: I told you before, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I wil not allow any more of <U+017F>uch moral doctrine: I am re<U+017F>olved. When I ask your advice, ehen give it: mean time, no more of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will incurre my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. Upon this, <U+017F>he turned away to the other <U+017F>ide of the bed in <U+017F>uch a fury, that <hi>Leonida</hi> knew <U+017F>he had much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed her. Nothing comes neerer the quick, then to object honour again<U+017F>t Love; but the rea<U+017F>ons of Love will be predominate. A little after <hi>Galathea</hi> turn'd about, and told her, that <U+017F>he did not, till now, ever think her <U+017F>o arrogant as to be her Governe<U+017F><U+017F>e: Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, <U+017F>uch thoughts were never mine, I know my duty better then <U+017F>o: but <U+017F>ince you take that ill, which I <U+017F>poke, out of my affection to you, I <U+017F>hall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after never give you any occa<U+017F>ion to be angry with me, for that cau<U+017F>e.

Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> Heavens <U+017F>well all your de<U+017F>ires with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but I b<U+017F>eeech you, give me leave to tell you only this once, that you will extreamly <U+017F>taine your honour. It will be an age before his grounded affection to <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> will be rooted out: who<U+017F>e beautie and vertue has no <U+017F>econd. But <hi>Leonida,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea) A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>lights him, <U+017F>he is offended at him, and <U+017F>he hath bani<U+017F>hed him: can you beleeve his <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <U+017F>o pu<U+017F>illanimous as to endure all this? Oh Madam, replied <hi>Leonida,</hi> extingui<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch vain hopes: if he have no courage at all, then he will never re<U+017F>ent the<U+017F>e things: and if he have a noble <U+017F>pirit then let me tell you, that a generous minded man will never give over an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he finds it full of difficulties: for example, remember your coor<U+017F>e entertainment of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how cruelly you have treated him, yet how little all tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>daines and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties do <U+017F>tartle him. But admit that <hi>Celadon</hi> who is a <U+017F>hepheard and who<U+017F>e courage cannot come in compare with <hi>Lindamors,</hi> admit I <U+017F>ay that he <U+017F>hould fall off from <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> what hopes of any good can you conceive from thence? Do you think a man that's once deceived will ever be deceived a <U+017F>econd time by the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject? No no Madam, he that is once burnt will not come neer the <U+017F>ame fire again: perhaps (and herein is your mo<U+017F>t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous hopes) that time will cure him of his wound, and till then he will never <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him<U+017F>elfe to be wounded againe by another: how long that may be, Heavens know: mean time is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to keep the knowledge of it <U+017F>o long from the Guards in the Court? Either they will <U+017F>ee him; for you cannot alwaies keep him mued up in your chamber, or el<U+017F>e <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> as di<U+017F>creet as he is, yet he is but a child &amp; may blab it out <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I charge you to <U+017F>pare your paines upon this <U+017F>ubject: I am re<U+017F>olved: &amp; if you will have me think you love me, advance my de<U+017F>igne as much as you can: and leave the re<U+017F>t to my care. If <hi>Celadon</hi> be recovered, you may carry him this morning into the Garden: for I find my <U+017F>elfe a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53526:17"/>
and <U+017F>hall <U+017F>carce ri<U+017F>e out of bed till towards night: <hi>Leonida</hi> was very <U+017F>orry that no argument would prevaile and returned no an<U+017F>wer: only this, that <U+017F>he would contribute her be<U+017F>t endeavours for her <U+017F>atisfaction.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e two were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, <hi>Merill</hi> did his office and delivered the me<U+017F><U+017F>age: finding the <U+017F>hepherd awake, he bad him good morrow from the Nymph, and pre<U+017F>ented the papers unto him. Oh how ready he was to ri<U+017F>e up and receive them? He cau<U+017F>ed the window and curtains to be opened in all ha<U+017F>te: he opened the bundle after <U+017F>everall ceremonious ki<U+017F><U+017F>es. Oh my dear papers, <U+017F>aid he, how have the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trange hands u<U+017F>ed you? then he <U+017F>orted them and laid them in order according to the time they were written, and finding another paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t them, he opened it, and read the<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>Celadon, <hi>I would have you know that</hi> Galathea <hi>Loves you: and that Heaven hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> A<U+017F>treas <hi>di<U+017F>daine, becau<U+017F>e they would not have a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e any longer enjoy that which a Nymph de<U+017F>ires: acknowledge your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and do not <U+017F>leight it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Shepheard was all wonder; but <U+017F>eeing that little <hi>Merill</hi> kept an ob<U+017F>ervant eye over all his actions, he would not <U+017F>uffer his wonder to be <U+017F>eene but tying up all the papers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and laying them in his bed, he asked, who gave them unto him? I took them out of my Ladies clo<U+017F>et, (<U+017F>aid he) and had I not beene very de<U+017F>irous to ea<U+017F>e you of that paine in which I <U+017F>aw you were, I <U+017F>hould hardly have dared to have brought them: for my Lady is not very well. Who is with her (asked <hi>Celadon):</hi> the two Nymphes you <U+017F>aw ye<U+017F>terday (<U+017F>aid he) the one is <hi>Leonida</hi> the Neece of <hi>Adamas;</hi> the other <hi>Silvia</hi> the Daughter of the glorious <hi>Deanta;</hi> and de<U+017F>ervedly his Daughter <U+017F>he is; for <U+017F>he is owner of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tately Mine, that e're eye beheld.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Celadon</hi> came to the fir<U+017F>t notice of <hi>Galathea's</hi> affection to him. And he fore<U+017F>aw that it would prove an addition of mi<U+017F>ery unto him: therefore he prepared him<U+017F>elfe for it. Now <U+017F>eeing halfe the day was already <U+017F>pent: and finding him<U+017F>elfe very well, he would not any longer be a pri<U+017F>oner to his bed; conceiving that the <U+017F>ooner he <U+017F>tirred abroad, the <U+017F>ooner he might take his leave of the faire Nymphes Ri<U+017F>ing therefore with that re<U+017F>olution, as he was going out to walk, he met <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> whom <hi>Galathea</hi> had <U+017F>ent to beare him company; for <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe would not ri<U+017F>e, nor be <U+017F>eene, being a<U+017F>hamed of the Letter <U+017F>he had written. They went into the Garden; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Caladon</hi> would conceale his <U+017F>orrowes, he con<U+017F>trained him<U+017F>elfe into as blith an humour as he could; and <U+017F>eemed full of curio<U+017F>itie to know every thing he <U+017F>aw. Fair Nymphes (<U+017F>aid he unto them) are we not neer the place where the Fountaine of verity in Love is? I do much de<U+017F>ire, if it may be, we may <U+017F>ee our <U+017F>elves in it. Tis very neer (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) in yonder wood, but it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be <U+017F>een for which you may thank that Lady who is the cau<U+017F>e of it (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and pointed unto <hi>Silvia)</hi> I know no rea<U+017F>on why you <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e me (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he): for, ought the <U+017F>word be blamed if an imprudent man lay his hand upon it, and cut him<U+017F>elfe? Tis very true (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> but the per<U+017F>on who wounds with it, is to be blamed, and beleeue it your beauty is <U+017F>uch as cannot be looked upon, without homicide: Be it what it will, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia</hi> with a little blu<U+017F>h) it hath cords <U+017F>trong enough, never to let him go whom once it hath captivated. She <U+017F>aid this, as twitting her with the infidelitie of <hi>Agis,</hi> who once Loved her, and either out of jealou<U+017F>ie or <U+017F>ome two monthes ab<U+017F>ence, was quite changed: al<U+017F>o upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her with <hi>Polemas,</hi> who was <U+017F>tolne from her by another beauty which <hi>Leonida</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood very well and thus replied; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Si<U+017F>ter, that my cords are ea<U+017F>ily untyed and the ea<U+017F>ier becau<U+017F>e I would never take <U+017F>o much paines as to tye them fa<U+017F>ter. <hi>Celadon</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto their pretty quarrells with much delight, and to the end, they <U+017F>hould not end too <U+017F>oon, he <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Silvia:</hi> fair Nymph, <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>eemes you are the cau<U+017F>e why this admirable Fountaine cannot be <U+017F>een, I be<U+017F>eech you oblige us <U+017F>o far, as to tell us, how it came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Celadon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the Nymph and <U+017F>miled, you have bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e enough at home, and need not meddle much in that of others: but if your Love will allow of <U+017F>o much curio<U+017F>itie, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida</hi> if you reque<U+017F>t her may perhaps tell you the end, as <U+017F>he did unde<U+017F>ired, the beginning.

                  <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> the mother of <hi>Galathea,</hi> hath a Son called <hi>Clidaman,</hi> owner of as many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities, as any per<U+017F>on of his age and ranke is capable of for he is exqui<U+017F>ite at any thing which relates either to Arms or Ladyes. About three years agoe, to give <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timonie of his gentle di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and by the permi<U+017F>ion of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> he gave a <U+017F>ervant unto all the Nymphs and this not by election, but lot: for having put the names of all the Nymphs into one ba<U+017F>in; and the names of all the young Caveliers into another, then in an open a<U+017F><U+017F>embly, the ba<U+017F>in in which the Nymphs were, was pre<U+017F>ented to the young Gallants: and the ba<U+017F>in in which the young Gallants were, was pre<U+017F>ented unto the Nymphs. Then by the <U+017F>ound of <U+017F>everal trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; the young <hi>Clidaman</hi> did draw his lot and it chanced to be <hi>Silvia</hi> afterwards the young Nymph did draw her lot, and it chanced to be <hi>Clidaman.</hi> Great were the applaudes which every one gave but the behaviour of <hi>Clidaman</hi> was mo<U+017F>t extolled who as <U+017F>oon as he had received his lot, went and kneeling down before this Nymph, did ki<U+017F>s her fair hand She out of mode<U+017F>ty would not have <U+017F>uffered it without the command of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who <U+017F>aid, it was the lea<U+017F>t homage <U+017F>he could receive. After her all the re<U+017F>t took their chances: to <U+017F>ome it happned according to their de<U+017F>ires, and to others, not. <hi>Galatheas</hi> fortune fel upon a brave Gallant called <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who then was newly returned from the armie: mine fell upon one, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Agis,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t perfidious and uncon<U+017F>tant wethercock that ever was Some of the<U+017F>e who took their fortunes did only in appearance like their chances: others did with their hearts ratifie what fortune had done: and tho<U+017F>e who were mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ed with their chances, were <U+017F>uch as before that, had conceived <U+017F>ome <U+017F>eeds of affection. Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, young <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was one, who<U+017F>e lot light upon <hi>Silera;</hi> a Nymph truly very amiable, but not to him, who had already di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of his heart. And certainly it was happy for him that he was then ab<U+017F>ent for he would never have performed that faigned homage which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>is</hi> would have commanded, &amp; that perhaps would have brought him into di<U+017F>grace. For you mu<U+017F>t know, that he was brought up among<U+017F>t us, and was <U+017F>o faire and hand<U+017F>ome in all his actions, as every one e<U+017F>teemed him; e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Silvia,</hi> they being both of an age. At fir<U+017F>t their ordinary conver<U+017F>ation begot a Love like unto that between Brothers and Si<U+017F>ters: <U+017F>uch a Love as their age was capable of; but as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> grew in years, <U+017F>o he did in affection, <U+017F>o as at fourteen or fifteen years of age, his wil began to change it <U+017F>elf into de<U+017F>ires; and his de<U+017F>ires, by degrees, became pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. Yet he carried the matter <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly, that <hi>Silvia</hi> her <U+017F>elfe had never knowne it, if <U+017F>he had not forced him unto it. Afterwards when he knew his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and confidered what <U+017F>mal hopes there was of his cure, then the mirth and plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F><U+017F>e which was wont to be in his lookes and all his actions, was turned into <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and from <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e into <U+017F>uch lumpi<U+017F>h melancholy, that every one took notice of the alteration. <hi>Silvia</hi> was not the la<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e who asked him the rea<U+017F>on; but <U+017F>he could draw nothing from him but heartle<U+017F><U+017F>e an<U+017F>wers. At la<U+017F>t when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw his dulne<U+017F><U+017F>e continued, one day when <U+017F>he was complaining again<U+017F>t the coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his affection, and obliging him to conceale nothing from her, <U+017F>he perceived, that he could not <U+017F>o well con<U+017F>traine him<U+017F>elfe, but that a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>igh came out in lieu of an an<U+017F>wer. This moved her to beleeve, that perhaps Love was the cau<U+017F>e of his ill. Did not poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> carry the matter very di<U+017F>cretly all the while in all his actions, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could never imagine her <U+017F>elf to be the cau<U+017F>e. Perhaps the Nymphes humour not liking the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, was partly the cau<U+017F>e; however his prudence was great that could conceal <U+017F>uch ardent affection. Now <hi>Silvia</hi> begins to urge him more then <U+017F>he did before, and told him, that if Love was the cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would contribute all her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and do all the good offices, he could de<U+017F>ire. The more he denied it, the more de<U+017F>irous was <U+017F>he to know it; at la<U+017F>t, not being able to hold any longer, he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that it was Love: but <U+017F>aid that he had <U+017F>worn never to tell with whom. Tis mo<U+017F>t high pre<U+017F>umption, <U+017F>aid he to love her; but being compelled to it by <U+017F>uch an unre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table beauty, I am the more excu<U+017F>able: yet <U+017F>hould I name her, what excu<U+017F>e could I find for my ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e? The <U+017F>ame excu<U+017F>e that your friend<U+017F>hip

Upon this he took up a little gla<U+017F><U+017F>e which <U+017F>he wore, and held it before her eyes. You may imagine how <U+017F>he was <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this: and <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>ince <U+017F>wore unto me, that <U+017F>he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved it to be <hi>Galathea</hi> whom he adored. Whil<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tood amazed in contemplation of her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood amazed at her own <U+017F>implicity: <U+017F>he was very angry with him, but more with her <U+017F>elfe, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple as to force this manife<U+017F>to of Love from him. Yet all her haughty <U+017F>pirit would not permit her to condemne <hi>Ligdamor.</hi> but <U+017F>he did ri<U+017F>e up upon a <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and without a word went away full of rage, that any mortall dur<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ume to Love her.

At la<U+017F>t recollecting him<U+017F>elfe, he got to his lodging as well as he could, out of which he <U+017F>tirred not a long time: for <hi>Silvias</hi> cold entertainment of his affection, did <U+017F>o pierce his heart, that he fell <U+017F>ick; and when none hoped for any life, he writ this Letter unto her.</p>

               <p>This Letter was brought unto <hi>Silvia</hi> when <U+017F>he was alone in her chamber; but I came in immediatly after, and indeed, happily for poor <hi>Ligdamor.</hi> For ob<U+017F>erve the humour of this Nymph; <U+017F>he conceived <U+017F>uch a hatred again<U+017F>t him ever <U+017F>ince he di<U+017F>covered his affection to her, as their former friend<U+017F>hip is not only out of mind: but <U+017F>he hates him: and is <U+017F>o carele<U+017F><U+017F>e of him, that when <U+017F>he heares any, lamenting &amp; de<U+017F>paring of his recovery, <U+017F>he is no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then if <U+017F>he had never <U+017F>een him. I who particularly took notice of it, did not know what to think unle<U+017F>s that her youth might make her forget ab<U+017F>ent per<U+017F>ons; but at this time, when I <U+017F>aw her refu<U+017F>e the Letter which came from him, then I knew there was <U+017F>ome fallings out betweene them. Therefore I took up the Letter which <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed, and which the boy who brought it, had by his Ma<U+017F>ters command left upon the table; <hi>Silvia,</hi> le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ubtile then <U+017F>he might have been, ran after me and de<U+017F>ired me not to read it. I am re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee it (<U+017F>aid I) though for no other rea<U+017F>on. but becau<U+017F>e you forbid it. Then <U+017F>he began to blu<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>aid, deare <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, do not read it, I be<U+017F>eech you oblige me, and let it alone; I conjure you to it by our friend<U+017F>hip: what can the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e be, (an<U+017F>wered I) which you thus conceale from me? Beleeve it, <hi>Silvia,</hi> if you u<U+017F>e any di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations to hide your matters from me, it will fill me <U+017F>o full of curio<U+017F>itie, as to di<U+017F>cover you. Why <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) may I not hope well in your di<U+017F>cretion? No more, <U+017F>aid I, then I can in the <U+017F>inceritie of your affection.</p>
               <p>After a long wrangling about this Letter, I made her <U+017F>weare to tell me all upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <U+017F>ecrecy. Then <U+017F>he told me, what I have told you concerning <hi>Ligdamor:</hi> and at this very hour, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) he troubles me with his Letters: but what have I to do with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, or rather di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations? Nay, an<U+017F>wered I, they are not di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, but truthes; Suppo<U+017F>e they be, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what have I to do with his follies? You are obliged, an<U+017F>wered I, to help <U+017F>uch mi<U+017F>erable men, as you have throwne downe a precipice. What helpe can I bring, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? mu<U+017F>t I not live in the world? Why, is he where I am? Would you have me run away when he comes in pre<U+017F>ence? Let him keep at home, and I <U+017F>hall never trouble him. All the<U+017F>e excu<U+017F>es, an<U+017F>wered I, are of no validitie; for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you are an acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary, if not a principal, in his mi<U+017F>ery: had you fewer perfections; were you le<U+017F><U+017F>e amiable; did you not a u<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much care in your dre<U+017F><U+017F>e, beleeve it, he had never been brought to this extremity. Very good, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and laughed: you are very plea<U+017F>ant in charging me with the<U+017F>e faults: what would you have me to be, if you would not have me to be what I am? Do you not know; <hi>Silvia,</hi> an<U+017F>wered I that who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>harpens a <U+017F>word in a mad mans hand is culpable of all the harme he doth? That beauty which the heavens hath be<U+017F>towed upon you <U+017F>o liberally, hath

had a <U+017F>harp edge <U+017F>et upon by you, <U+017F>o as no eye can look upon it without a wound; may not you be ju<U+017F>tly taxed with all the murders which your cruelty commits? <hi>Silvia</hi> you ought not to be <U+017F>o faire and full of perfections, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you <U+017F>tudie to make your <U+017F>elfe as good as you are fair, and get as much <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e into your <U+017F>oul, as heavens have put into your face: but alas you are <U+017F>o farre from healing, that you are full of nothing but rigour and cruelty.</p>
               <p>The rea<U+017F>on why I was <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate in defence of <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> was be<U+017F>ides a relation of kindred, never any knew him but loved him, and I had heard, unto what a pittifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was brought. Then after much di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to this purpo<U+017F>e, I opened the Letter and read it aloud, that <U+017F>he might hear it. But it had no more operation upon her, than upon a <U+017F>tone, which I much wondred at, and perceived that I mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome violent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which did induce me to tell her, that what<U+017F>oever came on it, I would not have <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> peri<U+017F>h. Well Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o pittifull, I may cure him. It is not upon me, an<U+017F>wered I, that his cure depends, but you; but I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, if you continue towards him as formerly you have, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>pite you with a very notable di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. For <hi>Ami<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hall know it and I will tell it to every one I meet. In <U+017F>hort, I Love <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> and will not <U+017F>ee him dye, if I can hinder it. You <U+017F>ay very well, <hi>Leonida,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a fret) the<U+017F>e are the good offices I ever expected from your friend<U+017F>hip. My friend<U+017F>hip, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>hall be as much to you as him, and <U+017F>hall be for you again<U+017F>t him if he were in the wrong. Here we made a long pau<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>poke not a word. At la<U+017F>t I asked her what her re<U+017F>olution was? What you will, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>o you will not publi<U+017F>h the follies of <hi>Ligdamor;</hi> for though I cannot be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any crime yet I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>orry, the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be divulged Oh <hi>Silvia,</hi> cryed I out this is an excellent humour; you are afraid it <U+017F>hould be known, that a man Loves you but you are not afraid to murder a man. Come, come looke a little better on <hi>Ligdamor</hi> give him as much hope, as may make him recover, then afterwards u<U+017F>e him as you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o you let him live<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Write two lines of a little comfort to him. I had much adoe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faine this favour from her, yet I <U+017F>till did threaten to tell all, if <U+017F>he did not; but after a long debate, <U+017F>he writ thus unto him.</p>

               <p>This Letter came very opportunely: for when he had hardly <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as to read it, he found a command from <hi>Silvia,</hi> to live: and when he was re<U+017F>olved never to u<U+017F>e any more remedies, yet in obedience to this Nymph, he ordered him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o, as in a <U+017F>hort time he mended. But for all that, this fair peece of cruelty was <U+017F>till as cold as ice towards him, when he was recovered: the mo<U+017F>t favorable an<U+017F>were he ever could obtaine from her was, I Love you not: neither do I hate you: let this <U+017F>atisfie you, that of all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>erve me, you di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me the lea<U+017F>t. When either he or I made any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her, <U+017F>he gave us <U+017F>uch cruell language as is unimaginable by any but <U+017F>he, and in<U+017F>upportable to any but <hi>Ligdamor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to abbreviate this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; <hi>Ligdamor</hi> loved her and courted her ever <U+017F>ince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other appearance of hope, but what I have told you; till <hi>Clidaman</hi> by Lot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>became her <U+017F>ervant: And had he not known by me, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> fared no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he in her affection, I know not what would have become of him. But though this did a little comfort him, yet the grandure of his rivall infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome fits of jealou<U+017F>ie I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when once I told him, that he need not fear <hi>Clidaman,</hi> he returned me this an<U+017F>wer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53526:19"/>
Fair Nymph, <U+017F>aid he, I will ingeniou<U+017F>ly tell you, from whence my jealou<U+017F>ie proceeds; and judge you whether or no I am in the right. I have had <U+017F>uch long experience of <hi>Silvia,</hi> as I mu<U+017F>t needs know, that fidelity of affection nor extremity of Love will never move her: <U+017F>o as doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>uch motives will never move her: yet as I have learned from the reverend <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> your Unckle, every one is <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>ome fatall <U+017F>troke, which they cannot avoide when they are once touched by it: what can I imagine will <U+017F>ubject this fair one, except it be grandure and power? Therefore I do fear, it is the fortune and not the merits of <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> will win her: his grandure and not his affection will carry her. But certainly, in this he was in the wrong, for neither the Love of <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> nor the grandure of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> could ever move the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of goodwill in <hi>Silvia.</hi> I beleeve. Love re<U+017F>erves her for an example unto others, intending to puni<U+017F>h <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>daine by <U+017F>ome unaccu<U+017F>tomed way. At this time, there chanced a very notable te<U+017F>timonie of her beauty; or at lea<U+017F>t, the power <U+017F>he had to make her <U+017F>elfe loved. Upon that Fe<U+017F>tivall, which every yeare was celebrated the <U+017F>ixth day of the Moon in July on which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was wont to offer a <U+017F>olemne <U+017F>acrifice, as well by rea<U+017F>on of the fea<U+017F>t, as becau<U+017F>e it was the birth day of <hi>Galathea,</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice there came into the Temple, a number of men in the morning; among<U+017F>t them was one <U+017F>o full of noble Maje<U+017F>ty as it was ea<U+017F>y to imagine that he was Ma<U+017F>ter to the re<U+017F>t. He was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad and melancholy, as it was evident <U+017F>omthing did much afflict his <U+017F>oul. His habit was deep black trayling upon the ground, which did eclip<U+017F>e the hand<U+017F>omene<U+017F><U+017F>e of his proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his head was bare; his hair fair and curling, as bright as Sun beames, which attracted the eyes of every one upon him. He came up as farre as the lowe<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep of the Throne, where <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did <U+017F>it; and after an humble reverence, he retired again waiting untill the <U+017F>acrifice was ended: and whether to his good or bad fortune I know not, he <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elfe directly oppo<U+017F>ite unto <hi>Silvia.</hi> He no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon her but he knew her though he had never <U+017F>een her before: but for more <U+017F>uerty, he asked one of his <U+017F>ervants who knew us all, who an<U+017F>wered only with a deep <U+017F>igh: Afterwards as long as the ceromony la<U+017F>ted, he never took his eyes off her. At la<U+017F>t the <U+017F>acrifice being ended, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> returned to her Palace, where when audience was permitted, him he <U+017F>pake thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MADAM,</hi> Though the mourning you <U+017F>ee in my habit, be much blacker in my <U+017F>oul; yet it cannot equall the cau<U+017F>e; but though my lo<U+017F><U+017F>e be extreame, yet I do not thinke I am the only lo<U+017F>er; for you Madam, from among<U+017F>t your faithfull <U+017F>ervants, are le<U+017F><U+017F>ed of one, who perhaps was not the lea<U+017F>t affectionate nor the mo<U+017F>t unprofitable in your <U+017F>ervice. This con<U+017F>ideration gave me <U+017F>ome hopes, of obtaining a revenge of his death again<U+017F>t the homicide: but as <U+017F>oon as ever I entred into the Temple, I lo<U+017F>t all my hopes, thinking that if the de<U+017F>ire of revenge did die in me, who am a Brother to the injured, it would <U+017F>ooner die in you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who have le<U+017F><U+017F>e relation to him. Yet becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ee the armes of my Brothers murderer already prepared again<U+017F>t me, I <U+017F>hall as briefly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, tell you the Fortune of him whom I mourn for.</p>
               <p>Though Madam I never had the honour to be known unto you yet I am confident, that at the name of my Brother, who never lived but in your <U+017F>ervice, you will li<U+017F>t me in the catalogue of your mo<U+017F>t devoted <U+017F>ervants.

My fate was this; that <hi>Childerick</hi> his Son, a warlike Prince and of great hopes, <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>utable with him in age, did mo<U+017F>t particularly favour me with his affection, more then any other: when I came fir<U+017F>t to him, it was then when the great and prudent <hi>Aetius</hi> did treat an agreement with <hi>Merovea</hi> and the <hi>Frankes</hi> (for <U+017F>o he called all tho<U+017F>e who followed him) to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t that fatall <U+017F>courge of Heaven, <hi>Attilla</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> who having gathered together in the de<U+017F>erts of <hi>A<U+017F>ia</hi> an uncredible number of men, even five hundred thou<U+017F>and combatants, he de<U+017F>cended like a <hi>Torrent,</hi> mo<U+017F>t furiou<U+017F>ly ravaging all Countries through which he marched and though this <hi>Aetius,</hi> the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of <hi>Valentinian</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> came with an intention of making war upon <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea,</hi> who during the Government of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> had <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon part of <hi>Gaule;</hi> yet he thought it better to make him, the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians</hi> al<U+017F>o his freinds, rather then hazard a defeat by <hi>Attilla<U+017F>,</hi> who having already pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Germany,</hi> was upon the

It is to no purpo<U+017F>e, to trouble you Madam, and grieve my <U+017F>elfe, with a relation of all particulars that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt us; only this, within two or three dayes after, my Brother was in <U+017F>uch extremity that he had hardly <U+017F>trength enough to breathe: all he had was only <U+017F>ighes and groanes, and nothing under<U+017F>tood to come from him but the name of <hi>Silvia.</hi> I being extreamly perplexed at my Brothers <U+017F>ad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was <U+017F>uch an enemy unto this unknown <hi>Silvia,</hi> as I could not chu<U+017F>e but cur<U+017F>e her: which my brother hearing, and his affection to her being above his malady; he forced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ay thus: unle<U+017F><U+017F>e Brother you will become my enemy, cea<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e imprecations, I be<U+017F>eech you, which ttouble me more then all my mi<U+017F>ery be<U+017F>ides.

The abundance of my affection, and the abundance of <hi>Silvias</hi> vertues, are the armes which her beauty made u<U+017F>e of, to bring me unto my grave: Can you cur<U+017F>e her, who<U+017F>e happine<U+017F><U+017F>e I prefer before my own <U+017F>oul's? he would have <U+017F>aid more but his <U+017F>trength failed him: I an<U+017F>wer'd him thus. Brother, <U+017F>he who thus will ravi<U+017F>h you from us, is the mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on that ever was: If <U+017F>he be fair, the gods them<U+017F>elves are guilty of inju<U+017F>tice in making her <U+017F>o, for they <U+017F>hould have changed either her face or her heart. <hi>Ari<U+017F>tander</hi> hearing this, a<U+017F><U+017F>umed more <U+017F>trength and replied: for Heavens <U+017F>ake <hi>Guyamant,</hi> give over your bla<U+017F>phemy, and beleeve that <hi>Silvias</hi> heart is <U+017F>utable to her face. As the one is all beauty, <U+017F>o the other is all vertue: if I die for Loving her, never wonder at it. As no eye is able to gaze upon the Sun, <U+017F>o my <U+017F>oul is dazled at the rayes of <U+017F>o many Suns as <U+017F>hine in this beauty: it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to gaze upon <U+017F>o many Divinities and live.

but one poor tear of pitty do but drop into that fair bo<U+017F>ome at the news of his death whom you conquered, your victory will be noble, and entire; but if you think <U+017F>o little water too much for tho<U+017F>e flames which you kindled in him, then at lea<U+017F>t receive a zealous ki<U+017F>s which he hath <U+017F>ent you, or rather his <U+017F>oul changed into this ki<U+017F>s, which he pre<U+017F>ents unto you.

                  <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> calling <hi>Silvia</hi> to her, asked her what kind of <U+017F>trange cruelties <U+017F>he had u<U+017F>ed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ari<U+017F>tander,</hi> which had brought him to this extremitie?

Then calling both before her, <U+017F>he asked him whether he would follow his Brothers inclination: He an<U+017F>wered, yes with all his heart. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>hell entreat this Nymph, to admit you to his place and to u<U+017F>e you, better then <U+017F>he did him. <hi>Guyamant,</hi> after a very humble reverence unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> offered to ki<U+017F>s the hand of <hi>Silvia,</hi> in <U+017F>igne of <U+017F>ervitude: but <U+017F>he <U+017F>o <U+017F>lighted the declaration of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had commanded her, <U+017F>he would never have looked upon him.</p>
               <p>When every one began to retire, <hi>Clidaman</hi> returned from hunting, and was told of this new <U+017F>ervant unto his Mi<U+017F>tris. Again<U+017F>t which he made <U+017F>uch loud complaints, that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Guyamant</hi> did hear them: and <U+017F>ince he could not imagine how this <U+017F>hould come about, <U+017F>he told him the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. When <U+017F>he had done <hi>Clidaman</hi> complained more then before that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer a thing <U+017F>o much to his di<U+017F>advantage, and told her that <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the decree of Fate which his lot had given him, and which none <U+017F>hould ever ravi<U+017F>h from him and live. This language proceeded from a heart full of affection, and was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bundance of vehemency, for he did Love <hi>Silvia</hi> extreamly. <hi>Guyamant,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides the edge which his new Love had put upon him, had <U+017F>o good an opinion of him<U+017F>elfe as not to yeild unto any', returned an an<U+017F>wer, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing his <U+017F>peech unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is.</hi> Madam, <U+017F>aid he, it <U+017F>eemes <U+017F>ome would not have me to be a <U+017F>ervant unto the fair <hi>Silvia:</hi> but <U+017F>uch are ignorant what Love is, otherwi<U+017F>e they would never think, that your ordinances, or the ordinances of all the gods together, have power enough to divert the cour<U+017F>e of affection: And therefore I do openly declare, that if any <U+017F>hall offer to forbid me that which is already permitted me, I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>obey and rebell: It is neither duty nor any other con<U+017F>ideration can make me change. Then turning towards <hi>Clidaman:</hi> as for you, Sir, I know what re<U+017F>pects I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53526:20"/>
owe you, but withall, I know what power Love hath over me: as the de<U+017F>tinies did give <hi>Silvia</hi> unto you, <U+017F>o her beauty did give me unto her: Judge you whether of the<U+017F>e gifts ought to be mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing unto her. <hi>Clidaman</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> interiupted him. Sonne, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you have no rea<U+017F>on to complaine, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e our ordinances were altred: you were commanded to <U+017F>erve <hi>Silvia,</hi> but others were not forbidden to do the <U+017F>ame. Smells are mo<U+017F>t odoriferous, when <U+017F>tirred; and a Lover having Rivals has more te<U+017F>timonie's of his merit. Thus <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> ordained that both of them <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve her. And thus is <hi>Silvia</hi> well <U+017F>tored of <U+017F>ervants, for <hi>Guyamant</hi> dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed up his affection in the be<U+017F>t trim, and <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in envie of him, did <U+017F>tudie how to outvie him in court<U+017F>hip. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> he <U+017F>erved her with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion and re<U+017F>pect, that, lea<U+017F>t others <U+017F>hould take notice of his affection, he dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>eldome come neer her: and in my opinion his court<U+017F>hip was much more plea<U+017F>ing then any of the re<U+017F>t; but once, beleeve it, he was almo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>t all his patience. It hapned that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had a bodkin in her hand, which was made in the fa<U+017F>hion of a <U+017F>word, and which <hi>Silvia</hi> was wont to wear in her hair; and <hi>Clidaman</hi> being neer her, <U+017F>he gave it unto him to carry unto his Mi<U+017F>tris: but he kept it all the day, purpo<U+017F>ely to vex <hi>Guyamant,</hi> never <U+017F>o much as dreaming upon <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> but <U+017F>ee how one may wound one for another: the poy<U+017F>on which was prepared for <hi>Guyamant,</hi> did <U+017F>o neerly reach the heart of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that not being able to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble he retired to his lodging, where after he had a while ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed him<U+017F>elfe by his own thoughts, he took pen and writ the<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es.</p>

               <p>Thus was <hi>Ligdamon</hi> cured, not by the <U+017F>ame hand, but by the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>word which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. In the meane time, <hi>Guyamants</hi> affection grew to this height, as it was little <U+017F>hort of <hi>Ari<U+017F>tanders.</hi> On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> under the colour of Complement, did <U+017F>uffer a mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at Love, to plant it <U+017F>elfe in his <U+017F>oul. After that both of them had vyed which <U+017F>hould mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>e <hi>Silvia,</hi> and found that <U+017F>he did equally favour and frown upon them both, they re<U+017F>olved one day to try which of them was mo<U+017F>t in favour, and to that end, they both came to <hi>Silvia,</hi> from whom they both received <U+017F>uch cold an<U+017F>weres, that the controver<U+017F>ie could not be decided. Then by the coun<U+017F>el of a Druide who was grieved to <U+017F>eetwo<U+017F>uch men, unprofitably lo<U+017F>e that time which might better be <U+017F>pent in defence of their countryes, they went unto the Fountain of the veritie of Love. You know, what the property of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, and how it di<U+017F>covers the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret thoughts of Lovers: for he who lookes into it, <U+017F>hall there <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tris, and if <U+017F>he Love him he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elfe by her: but if <U+017F>he Love another, then that other <U+017F>hall appear. <hi>Clidaman</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t which pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elfe before this Fountain: he kneeled downe upon the ground; ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ide of the Fountain; and after he had implored the Angell of the place to be favorable unto him, he leaned a little over: immediatly <hi>Silvia</hi> was <U+017F>een, <U+017F>o admirably fair, that the tran<U+017F>ported Lover could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>toope to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand: but his contentment was <U+017F>oone cooled when he <U+017F>aw no body by her. He retired with a perplexed mind, and after a di<U+017F>contented pau<U+017F>e, he beckned unto <hi>Guyamant</hi> to come and try his fortune. He, having with all requi<U+017F>ite cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies prayed unto the Dietie of the place, did ca<U+017F>t his eye upon the Fountain, but he fared no better then <hi>Clidaman;</hi> for <hi>Silvia</hi> alone appeared, and with her fair eyes <U+017F>eemed to burn the water. Both of them much amazed at the matter, they went to a Druide who was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ver<U+017F>ed in Magique and asked the cau<U+017F>e. He an<U+017F>wered, that the rea<U+017F>on was becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvia</hi> loved neither of them, nor any el<U+017F>e, as being capable of burning others but not of burning, her<U+017F>elfe. They who could not beleeve them<U+017F>elves to be <U+017F>o much out of favour, as they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>everally before, <U+017F>o now they would returne and looke in the water both together: and though both of them leand over on <U+017F>everall <U+017F>ides, yet the Nymph appeared alone. The Druide <U+017F>aw them retire, and <U+017F>miled, telling them that they might certainly beleeve them<U+017F>elves not loved for <U+017F>aid he, you mu<U+017F>t know that as all other waters do repre<U+017F>ent the body, this repre<U+017F>ents the <U+017F>pirits. Now the <U+017F>pirit, which is only the will, the memorie, and the judgment, when it loves, is transformed into the thing loved. And therefore when you pre<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elfe here, it receives the figure of your <U+017F>pirit, and not of your body, and your <U+017F>pirit being changed into <hi>Silvia,</hi> it repre<U+017F>ents <hi>Silvia,</hi> and not you. If <hi>Silvia</hi> loved you, <U+017F>he would have been changed as well into you, as you into her, and <U+017F>o repre<U+017F>enting your <U+017F>pirit you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee <hi>Silvia,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Silvia</hi> changed by Love, as I told you, you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elves al<U+017F>o. <hi>Clidaman</hi> li<U+017F>tned very attentively unto this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering that the conclu<U+017F>ion was an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of that which he mo<U+017F>t feared, he drew his <U+017F>word and <U+017F>truck two or three times as hard as he could upon the Marble of the Fountain. His <U+017F>word broke in two, and left no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or <U+017F>igns of his blows but <U+017F>till <U+017F>triving to break the <U+017F>tone, like an angry dogge, which bites the <U+017F>tone which is thrown at him, the Druide told him that he lo<U+017F>t his labour, for the inchantment of the place would never end

by force, but by extremity of love but if he would make it u<U+017F>ele<U+017F><U+017F>e, he could inform him of a way. <hi>Clidaman</hi> had brought up for rarity in great Iron Cages, two Lyons, and two Unicornes, which he often baited with <U+017F>everall <U+017F>orts of Animals: The<U+017F>e the Druide beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for guards of the Fountain, and <U+017F>o enchanted them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Unicomes have Hornes <U+017F>o <U+017F>harp and <U+017F>trong, as they will pierce the harde<U+017F>t Rock, and do thru<U+017F>t with <U+017F>uch force and nimblene<U+017F><U+017F>e as none can e<U+017F>cape them. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as this guard was placed, <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guyamant</hi> went to travell, and departed <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> nor <hi>Silvia</hi> knew of it, untill they were gotten a great way from them. They went into <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick;</hi> for, finding them<U+017F>elves equally treated by Love, they would try whether Armes al<U+017F>o would be equally favourable unto them. Thus, courteous <U+017F>hepheard, have we lo<U+017F>t the benefit of this Fountain, which did <U+017F>o well di<U+017F>cover all Juglers in love, as if all had been like <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> it had never been lo<U+017F>t. When I heard that <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guyamans</hi> intended to go thither, I advi<U+017F>ed him to make a third, a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elfe, that he would finde mo<U+017F>t favour; but, he made me this an<U+017F>wer, Fair <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>uch as are in doubt of their good or bad Fate, may <U+017F>ometimes hatard the enquitie; but, it were mo<U+017F>t gro<U+017F><U+017F>e folly for <U+017F>uch, as have not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of any hope, to <U+017F>earch for that, which they would mo<U+017F>t unwillingly finde. For my part, I am in no doubt whether <hi>Silvia</hi> do love me or no; alas, I am too well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of it: And when I de<U+017F>ire to know more, I will never make enquirie of any, but her eyes and actions. However, his love was <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame, and Heavens knowes, how cruelly this rigorous piece of Crueltie it <U+017F>elfe hath ever u<U+017F>ed him: the time's to come, when ever <U+017F>he looked upon him without di<U+017F>dam and <U+017F>everitie. For my part, I wondered at his patience, for all her actions towards him, are rather injuries then <U+017F>everities.</p>
               <p>One day when he met her walking with me, I intreated him to <U+017F>ing; and having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent voice, he <U+017F>ung the<U+017F>e lines.</p>

Then, to take away the opportunity of reply, <U+017F>he went away unto one of her Companions which followed.

To which he an<U+017F>wered, that neither heat nor cold could do him much hurt: And asking him why, and what antidote he had again<U+017F>t it? he an<U+017F>wered, that to the one he oppo<U+017F>ed his burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires, and to the other his cold hopes. If it be <U+017F>o, replyed I, how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o often hear you <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>ometimes you burn with heat, and <U+017F>ometimes freeze with cold? Ah! fair Nymph, an<U+017F>wered he with a deep <U+017F>igh, my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is not out wardly, but all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that <U+017F>o deep, that there is not a corner of my <U+017F>oul, but <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ents it. And you mu<U+017F>t know, that in any other per<U+017F>on, heat and cold are incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent together: But I have in my heart a flaming fire, and al<U+017F>o chill ice, and I only, the gods do know, do feel the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvia</hi> all this while was <U+017F>ilent, and u<U+017F>ed none of her accu<U+017F>tomed cruelties; but at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing him turn towards me, and <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o turned, and in a merry manner, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull, thus <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid: Oh! what a happy man is <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that can command both heat and cold when he plea<U+017F>eth? or, at lea<U+017F>t, neither of them ever troubles him; for, if the coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his hopes do freeze, his hot de<U+017F>ires can cau<U+017F>e a thaw; and, if his hot de<U+017F>ires do burn him, he can freeze them up with a few cold hopes. It is but nece<U+017F><U+017F>arie, faire <hi>Silvia,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon)</hi> that I <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e remedies to keep me alive; otherwi<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould live but a little; but ala<U+017F><U+017F>e, the Gods do know they are but poor comforts. Nay, nay replyed the Nymph, you can make your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e ju<U+017F>t as you would have it, either hot or cold.

Nay <hi>Ligdamon</hi> replyed the Nymph, the greate<U+017F>t wonder of all is, that a man, who has the reputation of rationall, <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>uch idle imaginations, and think <U+017F>uch impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, as who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hould credit them, may be taxed with want of as much judgment, as you of wit or truth.

And as this is not one of your I a<U+017F>t effects, <U+017F>o this, wherewith you upbraid me, is not one of my lea<U+017F>t tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I believe, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that your torments and my effects lie mo<U+017F>t in your tongue.

my part an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> I rather think him of a mean <U+017F>pirit, and wants judgment than one that wants apprehen<U+017F>ion, he wants courage to pretend <U+017F>o high: Your perfections and favours cannot rai<U+017F>e his thoughts <U+017F>o high, but the poorne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his merits and qualitie does more deject him; and no wonder, Vines will bear Grapes, and Okes Acornes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing will produce according to its nature.

I do believe (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea)</hi> that the great difference between our qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may beget a great re<U+017F>pect in him; but, I cannot think him <U+017F>o dully ignorant, as not to under<U+017F>tand unto what end I treat him <U+017F>o kindly: the greater fear is, that he is already <U+017F>o far engaged to <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that he cannot retire. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elfe, Madam, replyed <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> it is nothing but a <U+017F>otti<U+017F>h ignorance in him: I do believe as you do, that he loves <hi>A<U+017F>treat</hi> but if he had any Judgment, he would <U+017F>light her for you, who beyond all degrees of compari<U+017F>on does merit more then <U+017F>he. And yet he is <U+017F>o <U+017F>encele<U+017F>ly <U+017F>imple that when<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>peak of you, he an<U+017F>wers me with his <U+017F>orrows for being <U+017F>o farre from <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and thinkes his being here, no better then a torment. This very morning hearing him <U+017F>igh, I asked him the rea<U+017F>on, and he made me <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer as would have moved <U+017F>tones to pitty him: and the conclu<U+017F>ion of all was, that I would be a Mediator unto you for his departure.

Yes Madam (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) he has moved me to pitty him and me thinkes, <U+017F>ince he has <U+017F>uch an extream de<U+017F>ire to go you ought not to keep him by force for Love is never whipped into a heart. I do not meane a matter of pitty (replyed <hi>Galathea)</hi> but tis no matter; perhaps when he is well recovered, he <U+017F>hall feele the effects of that anger which he hath infu<U+017F>ed into me, as <U+017F>oone as tho<U+017F>e ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Love which he hath infu<U+017F>ed into you: meane time let me tell you, he <U+017F>hall not go from hence, when he, but when I will: as for you <hi>Leonida,</hi> (continued <U+017F>he) content you that I <U+017F>ay no more only be gone I care not for your company now you know my mind. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> was put to <U+017F>ilence, and forc'd to go away, taking this affront <U+017F>o to heart, that <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to go unto <hi>Adamas</hi> her Unckle, and never have any more to do with <hi>Galatheas</hi> <U+017F>ecrets. <hi>Galathea,</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time called for <hi>Silvia</hi> who was walking alone in another Alley. Unto whom, contrary to her de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>he imparted that which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely concealed from her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and complayned again<U+017F>t <hi>Leonida.</hi> But <hi>Silvia,</hi> though young yet full of di<U+017F>cretion, did indeavour to excu<U+017F>e <hi>Leonida</hi> all <U+017F>he could; apprehending very wi<U+017F>ely, that if her companion <U+017F>hould be angry, and things come to be knowne, they would prove very <U+017F>candalous unto her Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>e.

You know Madam that you never opened any thing of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me; and yet I can tell you <U+017F>o many particulars, as you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee I was not altogether <U+017F>o igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as I <U+017F>eemed. But <U+017F>uch is my humor, that I never could endure to meddle in matters, unto which I am not called. But perceiving my companion <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous about <hi>Celadon,</hi> I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected that Love might be the cau<U+017F>e, more then her compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon his maladie; and becau<U+017F>e it was a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which neerely concerned us all, I re<U+017F>olved before I <U+017F>poke any more of it, to be a little better a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, and therefore began to ob<U+017F>erve her actions more narrowly then I was accu<U+017F>tomed; <U+017F>o as I got behind the <U+017F>hepherds bed whil<U+017F>t he was a <U+017F>leep, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently <hi>Leonida</hi> entred, who making a little noi<U+017F>e, did waken him: then after much common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he began to talk of his affection unto the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and of hers to him: but beleeve me <U+017F>hepherd (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Love is nothing in compari<U+017F>on of <hi>Galatheas</hi> unto you. To me? (<U+017F>aid he) Yes to you (replyed <hi>Leonida)</hi> you need not wonder <U+017F>o at it, for you know how oft I have told you <U+017F>o though all the language I have, cannot <U+017F>et forth the magnitude of it. Fair Nymph, (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepherd) I neither can merit nor beleeve, <U+017F>o great an honour unto me. For what can her de<U+017F>igne be upon poor me, who am a <U+017F>illy <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and will both live and die <U+017F>o? Your birth (replyed my companion) mu<U+017F>t needs be noble, <U+017F>ince you are owner of <U+017F>o many excellent qualities and perfections. Oh <hi>Leonida</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepherd then) I cannot chu<U+017F>e but think you Jeere me: can you think me <U+017F>o ignorant as not to know who <hi>Galathea</hi> is, &amp; who I am 'Certainly, fair Nymph I know, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <U+017F>o how to mea<U+017F>ure the meane<U+017F><U+017F>e of my qualitie with the grandure of her merits: with the mea<U+017F>ure of duty: Oh <U+017F>hepherd (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida)</hi> do you think that Love u<U+017F>eth the <U+017F>ame mea<U+017F>ures that men do? No no, mea<U+017F>ures are u<U+017F>ed by <U+017F>uch as u<U+017F>e to buy and <U+017F>ellt gifts are never mea<U+017F>ured, and Love being nothing el<U+017F>e but a meere gift, is never conferred by mea<U+017F>ures: never make any que<U+017F>tion of this truth; but not to faile in your duty, pay unto her as much Love and affection as <U+017F>he be<U+017F>towes upon you. I do profe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, that till

now, I thought <hi>Leonida</hi> had <U+017F>poken for her <U+017F>elfe, and her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed me: but <U+017F>eeing with how much di<U+017F>cretion your actions are managed, I did much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the power you have over them; knowing, that it is a thing of greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to command ones <U+017F>elfe, then another. Sweet heart, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea)</hi> did you but know, how I <U+017F>tand in need of <hi>Celadon's</hi> amitie, you would commend and advi<U+017F>e me unto this de<U+017F>igne: For, do you remember the Druide who told us our Fortunes? Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, my memory is not <U+017F>o bad, as to forget a thing of <U+017F>o late an age. Then you remember (continued <hi>Galathea)</hi> how many truths he did foretell, both unto you and <hi>Leonida;</hi> and how he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that if I married any other then <hi>Celadon,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable per<U+017F>on upon earth: Now <U+017F>ince our own experience may well make us credit what he foretells, why <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>light a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which <U+017F>o nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certies me? And therefore I take it very ill from <hi>Leonida,</hi> that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould offer to <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant me. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia,</hi> I would advi<U+017F>e you not to vex her too much, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be provoked to make a di<U+017F>covery of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Friend, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea</hi> (and embraced her) I do apprehend your advice to be both faithfull and good, and therefore promi<U+017F>e you, to carry my <U+017F>elfe towards <hi>Leonida</hi> according to your coun<U+017F>ell. Whil<U+017F>t they were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, <hi>Leonida</hi> went to <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto whom <U+017F>he related word for word, all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt <hi>Galathea</hi> and her; and told him, that though the place where he was, <U+017F>eemed to be a place of freedome, yet, the truth was, it was no better then a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on: Which newes did <U+017F>o pierce him to the heart, that he fell into a Feavour, and in <U+017F>uch a violent degree, that <hi>Galathea</hi> coming to <U+017F>ee him, and finding him <U+017F>o much impaired, <U+017F>he began to doubt his life, e<U+017F>pecially the next day, when he <U+017F>wounded two or three times in their armes: And though the<U+017F>e Nymphs did continually watch with him without any re<U+017F>t, but interrupted <U+017F>lumbers, yet was he but very ill attended, there being in that place no manner of Medicines for one that was <U+017F>ick, nor dur<U+017F>t they <U+017F>end abroad for any, le<U+017F>t the matter <U+017F>hould come to a di<U+017F>covery; <U+017F>o as the Shepheard did run a hazard of his life, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one evening the Nymphs gave him for dead: But at la<U+017F>t he returned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, and after an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive bleeding, he took a little re<U+017F>t; and therefore the Nymphs left him alone with <hi>Merill:</hi> And being retired, <hi>Silvia</hi> much affrighted at this accident, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> and <U+017F>aid, Madam, we <U+017F>hall all be brought into <U+017F>trange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you take <U+017F>ome order; in what a ca<U+017F>e would you be in, if this Shepheard <U+017F>hould die in your hands, for want of help? Alas, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I have con<U+017F>idered all this, ever <U+017F>ince his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e encrea<U+017F>ed; but what remedie is there? We are here de<U+017F>titute of all nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries for him, and as for getting them from other places, for my life I dare not, for fear of di<U+017F>covery. <hi>Leonida,</hi> who<U+017F>e affection made her <U+017F>peak more re<U+017F>olutely then <hi>Silvia,</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto her; Madam, tho<U+017F>e fears are very good, <U+017F>o far as they do not concern the life of a man. Suppo<U+017F>e this <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>hould die, can any imagine his death can be kept without di<U+017F>covery? the Heavens them<U+017F>elves, as a puni<U+017F>hment, will at la<U+017F>t lay all open. But, take every thing at the wor<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it were known that this <U+017F>hepheard were here, cannot you cover your act with a mask of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion? If you will be plea<U+017F>ed to tru<U+017F>t me with the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, I will manage it <U+017F>o, as none <U+017F>hall ever know it: For Madam, I have an Uncle in this Country, <hi>Adamas,</hi> the chiefe of the Druides, as you know very well: No <U+017F>ecret in Nature, or vertue in any Plant, is hid from him; he is a man full of wi<U+017F>dome and di<U+017F>cretion, and I know, he has a particular inclination to do you <U+017F>ervice; if you will employ him in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, I am confident, that all things will <U+017F>ucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your wi<U+017F>h. <hi>Silvia</hi> apprehending this to be the be<U+017F>t expedient and conceiving that by the means of the grave <hi>Adamas, Galathea</hi> might perhaps be diverted from her thoughts of this <U+017F>hepheard; <U+017F>he advi<U+017F>ed her unto it as the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e: Unto which <hi>Galathea,</hi> for want of another, con<U+017F>ented. Then Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> to the end I may keep within the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of your commands, I be<U+017F>eech you tell me what is your plea<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, or conceal, from <hi>Adamas? Silvia</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>tand mute, an<U+017F>wered, That the only way to move him unto <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y, was, to <U+017F>eem as if he were wholly tru<U+017F>ted in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; for nothing will <U+017F>ooner make a <U+017F>ecret come out, then mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t: <U+017F>o as I conceive the way to charm <hi>Adamas</hi> unto privacy, is, to acquaint him before he comes with every thing, that he may di<U+017F>cover when he is here. I am <U+017F>o much be<U+017F>ides my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that I know not what to <U+017F>ay, and therefore I refer the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto your di<U+017F>cretions. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> departed, with intention, though the night was very dark at fir<U+017F>t, not to <U+017F>top, untill <U+017F>he came at her Uncles, who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e was on the <U+017F>ide of <hi>Marcelles</hi> Mountain, towards the Ve<U+017F>talls and Druides of <hi>Laigneau;</hi> but her journey proved longer then <U+017F>he

expected, for when <U+017F>he came at the break of day unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>he found that he was gone to <hi>Feurs,</hi> and would not return, untill three daies, thence; and therefore after halfe an houres re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he went away; yet, <U+017F>o weary, that had <U+017F>he not been very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her <U+017F>hepheard's cure, <U+017F>he would have <U+017F>tayed untill the return of <hi>Adamas:</hi> but, after <U+017F>he had gone a mile of her way, <U+017F>he <U+017F>pied afar off in the <U+017F>ame way a Nymph all alone, whom a little after <U+017F>he knew to be <hi>Silvia:</hi> This encounter put her into a <U+017F>ad perplexitie, fearing that <hi>Silvia</hi> brought the newes of <hi>Celadon's</hi> death; but it proved quite the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for <U+017F>he brought newes, that <U+017F>ince her departure he had re<U+017F>ted very well, and that the Feaver had left him; therefore <hi>Galathea</hi> had <U+017F>ent her, to give a <U+017F>top unto her proceedings, and to tell her, that <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>hepheard was in <U+017F>o good a condition, there was no need of bringing <hi>Adamas,</hi> or di<U+017F>covering the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto him. It is ea<U+017F>ily imagined, how glad <hi>Lemida</hi> was of this newes; and after her thanks to Heaven, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, Si<U+017F>ter, I under<U+017F>tand, that <hi>Galathea</hi> has acquainted you with her de<U+017F>igne upon this <U+017F>hepheard, and therefore in all freedome of language I will tell you, that this kinde of life doth infinitely di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, and that I think it di<U+017F>honourable both for her and us: for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately humorous, that upon every di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>te this <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>hall give her, <U+017F>he will be halfe di<U+017F>tracted; and builds <U+017F>o much upon the predictions of the Druide, as <U+017F>he thinks all her happine<U+017F><U+017F>e depends upon loving him: Al<U+017F>o, as all Lovers do, <U+017F>he thinks him <U+017F>o lovely, as <U+017F>he believes every one does the like, as if all did look upon him with the <U+017F>ame eyes <U+017F>he doth and that's my griefe, for <U+017F>he is growne <U+017F>o jealous of me, that <U+017F>he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure I <U+017F>hould come neer him. Now Si<U+017F>ter, if this kinde of life come once to be known, as que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e it will; <U+017F>ince nothing is <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, but at la<U+017F>t is di<U+017F>covered, judge you how the world will cen<U+017F>ure us: I, for my part, have u<U+017F>ed all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible arguments to divert from it, but all in vain. The <U+017F>cope of all this my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is, that I do think very fit to finde out <U+017F>ome good remedie, and that I can conceive no better expedient, then the interpo<U+017F>ition and mediation of my Uncle, who by his prudence and good coun<U+017F>ell, may happily do <U+017F>ome good upon her. Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia</hi> I do extreamly like your advice and that you may have more time to bring <hi>Adamas</hi> unto her, I will return, and tell her, that I have been at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas;</hi> but found neither him nor you. 'Tis very well, replyed <hi>Leonida,</hi> and it will not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e, if we go and re<U+017F>t our <U+017F>elves under <U+017F>ome hedge, that it may <U+017F>eem as if you had been longer <U+017F>eeking me: Al<U+017F>o, to tell you truly, I am <U+017F>o tired that if I will get to my journeyes end, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>leep a little. Come then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia)</hi> and believe, it is a good work for your <U+017F>elfe, if you can get <hi>Celadon</hi> from among<U+017F>t us; for I do fore<U+017F>ee by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea's</hi> humour, that his <U+017F>tay here in a little time may cau<U+017F>e you a great deal of di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure. And <U+017F>o looking about for a convenient place, where they might pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away part of the day, they <U+017F>pied a place on the other <U+017F>ide of <hi>Lignon,</hi> which <U+017F>eemed to be very fit for that purpo<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over at the Bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> and leaving <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> the hou<U+017F>e of the Ve<U+017F>talls and Druides, on the left hand, and walking down the River, they came to a hand<U+017F>om thicket of wood, where they both <U+017F>lept together. As they were thus repo<U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves, <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did accidentally drive their flocks unto the <U+017F>ame place; and never <U+017F>eeing the Nymphs, they <U+017F>at down by them. And as that friend<U+017F>hip which re<U+017F>eth out of adver<U+017F>itie, is often more firme, then that of pro<U+017F>peritie; <U+017F>o <hi>Diana</hi> had contracted a mo<U+017F>t firme league with <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>ince the di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and <U+017F>uch a corre<U+017F>pondency was grown between them, that they were every day together. And certainly <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>tood in need of all con<U+017F>olation, for almo<U+017F>t at one and the <U+017F>ame time, <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t <hi>Alces</hi> her Father <hi>Hippolita</hi> her Mother; <hi>Hippolita</hi> died of a fright, when <U+017F>he heard that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was fallen into the water: and <hi>Alces</hi> dyed for griefe, at the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of his deer Wife: But, the<U+017F>e lo<U+017F><U+017F>es were a kinde of comfort unto her; for under the umbrage of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Father and Mother, <U+017F>he could lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon.</hi> Now as I told you before, <hi>Diana,</hi> the Daughter of prudent <hi>Belinda,</hi> to perform the rites of neighbourhood, did go often unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and found her humours <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>he hers, and <hi>Phillis</hi> both, that they vowed eternall friend<U+017F>hip, and never <U+017F>ince could <U+017F>eperate. This was the fir<U+017F>t day <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> came out of her Chamber <U+017F>ince her <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters; and <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et down, but <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied <hi>Semires</hi> coming towards her.

For, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> perhaps you have heard of the implacable emnitie that was between <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Hippolyta,</hi> my Father and Mother; and <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> the Father and Mother of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and how their hatred accompanied them to their graves, which have cau<U+017F>ed abundance of trouble among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>hepheards of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in<U+017F>omuch as I beleeve, few or none about the fatall River of <hi>Lignon</hi> are ignorant of it: and yet Love, to <U+017F>hew the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his power, did unite two of the<U+017F>e enemy-fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <U+017F>o firmly, that nothing could di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the knots of their affection but only death. For <hi>Celadon</hi> no <U+017F>ooner arrived at the age of fourteen or fifteen yeares, and I at twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, but at an a<U+017F><U+017F>embly in the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> which is upon the top of a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, neer the Ca<U+017F>tle of Mount <hi>Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> this young <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>aw me; and as he <U+017F>ince hath told me he had long before an extream de<U+017F>ire of it, by <U+017F>ome reports he had heard of me: but the jarres which were among<U+017F>t our Parents was the impediment which hindred him: and I mu<U+017F>t ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I think his de<U+017F>ire of it, was no greater then mine.

the darts of Love, for as <U+017F>oon as ever they told me that he was the Son of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a kind of chang in me, which was not ordinary; then all his actions beg in to plea<U+017F>e me, and <U+017F>eemed much more agreeable unto me then any other young <U+017F>hepheard what<U+017F>oever; and becau<U+017F>e he dur<U+017F>t not yet approach me, al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>peaking with me was forbidden him, his looks and eys by their turning to &amp; fro did utter <U+017F>uch language unto me as I knew he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ay more. And indeed at a Braul which was held at the foot of a Mountain under a plump of antient Elmes which ca<U+017F>t a plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>haddow, he carried it <U+017F>o cunningly, that without any heed of me, and <U+017F>eeming as if it were out of a merry carele<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e he got me by the hand. For my part, I <U+017F>eemed as if I took no notice of it, but carried my <U+017F>elfe to him as to all the re<U+017F>t, but he in taking my hand, did <U+017F>toope with his head as if he would ki<U+017F><U+017F>e his hand but I perceived his mouth upon mine; this did cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome colour to come into my face: but I feigning to take no notice, did turne away my head, as if I only minded the braule which we danced: this cau<U+017F>ed him to <U+017F>tay a while <U+017F>ilent, not knowing I beleeve, how he <U+017F>hould begin to <U+017F>peak: at la<U+017F>t being unwilling to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch an opportunitie as this which he had long longed for, he came very neer me and whi<U+017F>pering <hi>Corilas</hi> (who took me out to dance) in the eare, yet <U+017F>o loud (but <U+017F>eeming to whi<U+017F>per) that I did plainly heare what he <U+017F>aid, Oh <hi>Corilas</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) I wi<U+017F>h with all my <U+017F>oul that the quarrells between this <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es Father and Mine, might be decided by her and me. To which <hi>Corilas</hi> an<U+017F>wered very loud, Nay never wi<U+017F>h that, <hi>Celadon,</hi> for perhaps it is the mo<U+017F>t dangerous wi<U+017F>h, that ever you made. Let the hazard be what it will (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon</hi> very lond) I'le not go from what I have <U+017F>aid, though I were to give my heart, as a pledge. And becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>eemed to take no notice of their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto me and thus <U+017F>aid: And you fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, what opinion have you of this offer? I do not know, an<U+017F>wered I, what you <U+017F>peak of. He told me, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> that to draw a great good from a great evil, he wi<U+017F>hes that the inveterate hatred of your Fathers, were changed into love among<U+017F>t their Children. How, (an<U+017F>wered I, <U+017F>eeming not to know him) are you <hi>Alcippes</hi> Son? Yes, (an<U+017F>wered he) and more then that; I am your mo<U+017F>t devoted <U+017F>ervant. Me thinkes, <U+017F>aid I, that it had been more proper for you to have applied your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto <U+017F>ome other, who may be more agreeable to you then I: I have heard <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Celadon,</hi> that the gods do u<U+017F>e to puni<U+017F>h the <U+017F>inns of the Fathers upon their Children; but this is not the u<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t men, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e your beauty, which is divine, will a<U+017F><U+017F>ume the <U+017F>ame priviledges with the gods: and if you do, then like them, you mu<U+017F>t give pardon when it is asked: how now <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas)</hi> what? Do you begin your combate with crying mercy? In <U+017F>uch a combate as this an<U+017F>wered he, to be vanqui<U+017F>hed is a kind of victory: and for my part, I am mo<U+017F>t wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be <U+017F>o, provided <U+017F>he will be plea<U+017F>ed to take the <U+017F>poile. I think, they had continued their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e longer, had the Brawle, longer la<U+017F>ted: but at la<U+017F>t we parted, and every one returned to his place.</p>
               <p>Not long after the <U+017F>hepheards u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everall exerci<U+017F>es, as wra<U+017F>tling, running, leaping, and throwing the barre; and a Garland to be given unto him, who got the better in the <U+017F>everall activities. <hi>Celadon,</hi> as being too young was admitted only unto that of running, and did win the Garland, compo<U+017F>ed of divers flowers, which was put upon his head by all the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly with high commendations, that being <U+017F>o young as he was, he <U+017F>hould overcome <U+017F>o many other nimble <U+017F>hepheards. He, not valuing him<U+017F>elf did take it from his head, and put it upon mine, <U+017F>aying, This, fair one, is in confirmation of what I <U+017F>aid before. I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this that I could not return any an<U+017F>wer: &amp; had it not been for <hi>Artemis,</hi> your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Phillis,</hi> I had given it unto him again; not but that coming from his hand, it was very acceptable unto me; but it was becau<U+017F>e I feared <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Hippolyta</hi> would be angry with me. But <hi>Artemis</hi> who de<U+017F>ired rather, to extingui<U+017F>h then enflame the<U+017F>e old grudges, did command me to receive it, and thank him. Which accordingly I did, but in <U+017F>uch a hollow manner as made every one think I did it only upon my Aunts command. All that day was thus <U+017F>pent, and the next day al<U+017F>o; in both which, the young <U+017F>hepheard lo<U+017F>t no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of manife<U+017F>ting his affection. And it was the cu<U+017F>tome upon the third day, in the honour of <hi>Venus,</hi> to repre<U+017F>ent the judgement which <hi>Paris</hi> gave of the three godde<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Celadon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to put him<U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t the Maides in the habit of a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e. You know that upon the third day after the banquett, he Grand <hi>Druide</hi> has a cu<U+017F>tome to throw a Golden Apple among<U+017F>t the Maides, upon which are written the names of the three <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es which <U+017F>eem unto him to be the faire<U+017F>t of all the company, with this <hi>Motto, Let this be given to the faire<U+017F>t of the three.</hi> Afterwards the per<U+017F>on that by lot was to repre<U+017F>ent <hi>Paris,</hi> does enter into the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> with the three <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es; where the dores being

Then as if fortune was re<U+017F>olved to favour him, my name, and <hi>Malthea,</hi> and <hi>Stella,</hi> were written upon the Apple, and when they came to draw the name that was to repre<U+017F>ent <hi>Paris,</hi> I heard <hi>Orithea</hi> named, which was the name that <hi>Celadon</hi> took upon him. Heavens knowes whether his <U+017F>oul was not infinitly joyed to <U+017F>ee his de<U+017F>igne thrive <U+017F>o well. At the la<U+017F>t, we were conducted into the Temple, where the Judge being <U+017F>et upon his Throne, the dores <U+017F>hut, and we three only within with him, we began, according to the Law, to undre<U+017F><U+017F>e our <U+017F>elves; and becau<U+017F>e each apart did go and <U+017F>peak unto the Iudge, and offer, as heretofore the three Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es did unto <hi>Paris; Stella</hi> was the quicke<U+017F>t to undre<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elfe, and did fir<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ent her <U+017F>elfe whom the Judge did a while contemplate, and after a full hearing what <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ay for her <U+017F>elfe, he cau<U+017F>ed her to retire, and give place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Malthea,</hi> who was forwarder in undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe then I was; for I being much a<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o naked, I trifled out the time as much as I could. <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto whom time <U+017F>eemed too long, and after he had <U+017F>lightly looked upon <hi>Malthea,</hi> <U+017F>eeing I did not come, he called me; <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince con<U+017F>trained I went: But, Oh Heavens! how much a<U+017F>hamed am I to think upon it?

After I had promi<U+017F>ed that I would, he asked a lock of my hair, for a Bracelet which I gave him; and after he had lapt it up in a paper he <U+017F>aid unto me; now <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I will keep this hair as a te<U+017F>timonie of this oath which you have taken, to the end that if ever you break it, I may offer it unto the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Venus</hi> and beg revenge. That is but <U+017F>uperfluous, an<U+017F>wered I, <U+017F>ince I am fully re<U+017F>olved never to faile in it. Then with a <U+017F>miling countenance he <U+017F>aid unto me, the gods be prai<U+017F>ed, my faire<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that my de<U+017F>igne hath <U+017F>o happily pro<U+017F>pered; for know, that the thing which you have promi<U+017F>ed is, to Love me better then any in the world, and to receive me as your mo<U+017F>t fathfull and vowed Servant, who am <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not <hi>Orithea,</hi> as you imagine: the very <U+017F>ame <hi>Celadon,</hi> that in <U+017F>pight of all old emnities betwixt our Parents, is <U+017F>o infinitly devoted yours, as he will rather die at the dore of the Temple, then not give a te<U+017F>timony of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto you. Imagine, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> in what a perplexitie I was now in: Love did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me from taking revenge; yet <U+017F>hame did animate me again<U+017F>t Love: at la<U+017F>t after a confu<U+017F>ed di<U+017F>pute with my <U+017F>elf, I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly con<U+017F>ent to make him die, becau<U+017F>e his offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from his exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of loving me: but now knowing him to be a <U+017F>hepheard, I could not any longer <U+017F>tay in his <U+017F>ight: but without returning any an<U+017F>wer, I ran to my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom I found to be almo<U+017F>t dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and not well knowing what I did, I dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could: But to be <U+017F>hort; when we were al ready, the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Orithea</hi> <U+017F>tood at the thre<U+017F>hold of the dore, and having all three about him: I do ordaine, <U+017F>aid he, that the pri<U+017F>e of beauty be given unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> in te<U+017F>timonie whereof I do pre<U+017F>ent unto her the golden apple: let none ever doubt of my judgement, for I have veiwed and examined
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53526:26"/>
her, and finds her to be full of all perfection. Upon the<U+017F>e words, he pre<U+017F>ented the apple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, which I received with a troubled mind: but more, when he <U+017F>aid unto me in a low voice, take this apple as a pledge of my affection, which, like it, is pure, and endle<U+017F><U+017F>e: To whom I an<U+017F>wered be contented, ra<U+017F>h youth, that I receive it only to <U+017F>ave thy life, which otherwi<U+017F>e, comming from thy hand, I would refu<U+017F>e. He could not reply for fear of being heard and known. And becau<U+017F>e it was the cu<U+017F>tom, that <U+017F>he who received the Ball, <U+017F>hould by way of thankes, ki<U+017F>s the Judge, I was con<U+017F>trained to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e him. But, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I was at this ceremonie almo<U+017F>t ready to di<U+017F>cover him. Then the grand <hi>Druide</hi> cau<U+017F>ed me to be carried in a chair, through all the croud with loud applauds and acclamations, <U+017F>o as every one did wonder why I did not enjoy this honour with more alacrity for truly I was <U+017F>o confounded betwixt Love and Anger, that I hardly knew what I did. As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> as <U+017F>oone as the ceremonies were done, he thru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepherds and by little and little without any notice taken, got out of the croud and putting off his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed habit, he a<U+017F><U+017F>umed his own, in which he came pre<U+017F>ently unto us with <U+017F>uch confident lookes, as none could ever <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect him: For my part when I <U+017F>aw him again, my heart was <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>hame and anger, that it would <U+017F>carcely let my eyes look upon him: but he who did take a <U+017F>eeming regardle<U+017F><U+017F>e notice of it, did find an occa<U+017F>ion to acco<U+017F>t me, and in a loud voice <U+017F>aid: The Judge who conferred the pri<U+017F>e upon you, hath <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf a very right Judge of beauty, and yet, though your cau<U+017F>e did merit his <U+017F>entence, you are in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged unto him. I think <U+017F>hepheard, an<U+017F>wered I in a low voice, that he is more obliged to me then I to him: for he gave me an apple only, which in <U+017F>ome degree, I de<U+017F>erve and is my due; but I gave him his life, which for his impudent ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e he de<U+017F>erved to lo<U+017F>e. This is no more then was before re<U+017F>olved (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon)</hi> for he does not valew his life fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to pro<U+017F>trate it at your feet. Were it not more in regard of my <U+017F>elf then him, replied I, I <U+017F>hould have puni<U+017F>hed his impudence: but, <hi>Celadon,</hi> no more; let us leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: and, know that the rea<U+017F>on why I did not cau<U+017F>e you to be puni<U+017F>hed according to your merits is, only becau<U+017F>e I would not bring my <U+017F>elfe upon the <U+017F>tage, and not for want of any will to <U+017F>ee you cha<U+017F>tised. If that be the only rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid he, I be<U+017F>eech you tell me what death you will have me die: And you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that I have as much courage to obey you, as I have Love to offend you.</p>
               <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would be very long and tedious, if I <U+017F>hould include every particular. But <U+017F>o it was, he gave me <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies of his affection, that I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly doubt it: but <U+017F>till <U+017F>eeming to be all anger, I <U+017F>aid thus unto him Shepheard, con<U+017F>ider the emnity that is betwixt our Fathers, &amp; believe that mine to thee <U+017F>hal be the <U+017F>ame, if thou do<U+017F>t <U+017F>till thus trouble me with thy follies, which for this time, thy youth and my own honour moves me to pardon. I mentioned a pardon, becau<U+017F>e I would infu<U+017F>e a little courage unto him: for the very truth is, his beautie, and courage, and affection, did plea<U+017F>e me; but to the end he <U+017F>hould not reply, I turned from him and went to <hi>Stella,</hi> who was neer me. He all a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this an<U+017F>wer, went out of the company <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly dejected as in a few dayes after he was grown not knowable, and kept him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o private that, he frequented no places but the mo<U+017F>t retired and wild partes of our woods. Of which, I being adverti<U+017F>ed by <U+017F>ome of my companoins, who did in a clo<U+017F>e manner tell me that I was the only cau<U+017F>e; I began to re<U+017F>ent his condition, and re<U+017F>olved to find out <U+017F>ome way or other to give him a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and becau<U+017F>e, as I told you, he <U+017F>hunned all manner of company, I was con<U+017F>trained to drive my flock towards that place which he mo<U+017F>t frequented: and after two or three times being there in vaine, at la<U+017F>t after a long <U+017F>earch for him, me thought I heard his voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome trees, and I was not mi<U+017F>taken. For going neerer; I found him lying all along upon the ground, his eyes <U+017F>weld with teares, and hands held up to heaven which <U+017F>eemed to be immoveable. This object moved me to <U+017F>o much pitty, that I was re<U+017F>olved to give him a cordiall for his paine. And therefore, after a whiles con<U+017F>ideration, and not willing he <U+017F>hould think I <U+017F>ought for him, I retired a little way from him, where <U+017F>eeming to take no notice I began to <U+017F>ing, <U+017F>o loud that my voice reached both his eares and his heart. As <U+017F>oon as ever he heard me, I <U+017F>aw him leap up and turning his eyes towards the place where I was, he <U+017F>tood like a <U+017F>tatue <U+017F>till in a ravi<U+017F>hing admiration. Which I ob<U+017F>erving, to give him <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e as to approch neerer, I <U+017F>eemed as if I <U+017F>lept, yet held mine eyes halfe open to <U+017F>ee what he would do. And indeed, he did as I did imagine he would: for drawing neerer me with a <U+017F>oft and gentle tread, he kneeled down as neer me as he could; and after a long <U+017F>tay in this po<U+017F>ture I <U+017F>till <U+017F>eeming to be fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep, he <U+017F>tooped down and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed me. Then <U+017F>eeing that he had taken courage enough; I opened mine eyes as if he had wakened me. And ri<U+017F>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53526:27"/>
up as if in a raging anger, thus <U+017F>aid unto him. Uncivill <U+017F>hepherd, how dur<U+017F>t you be <U+017F>o bold as thus to interrupt my <U+017F>leep? He, with a trembling heart, and kneeling <U+017F>till, <U+017F>aid thus unto me; It is your <U+017F>elfe fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that did con<U+017F>train me, and if I have <U+017F>inned, then, bright Starre, you mu<U+017F>t dim your Lu<U+017F>ter, and puni<U+017F>h your own perfections, which are the cau<U+017F>e. This is alwayes your excu<U+017F>e for your pre<U+017F>umption (<U+017F>aid I unto him) but <U+017F>hepheard beleeve it, if you continue in this cour<U+017F>e of offending me, I will not endure it. If you call it an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to love and adore you (an<U+017F>wered he) proceed to <U+017F>entence immediatly, and doome me to what death you plea<U+017F>e: for I do make a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemne vow, that I will <U+017F>o offend you as long as my life is in me. It is neither the rigour of your cruelties, nor the emnity of our Parents, no, nor all the impediments in the whole univer<U+017F>e con<U+017F>pired together <U+017F>hall ever divert me from this re<U+017F>olution. But, Fair <hi>Diana</hi> I mu<U+017F>t abbreviate the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ing di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, as being not <U+017F>utable unto my pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, And will only tell you, that being overcome I <U+017F>aid thus unto him; <U+017F>hepheard what good can you hope for, when tho<U+017F>e who have the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e of you, does di<U+017F>approve of your beginning? How? Said he, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me? Has <hi>Alcippe</hi> more power over my wil then I have my <U+017F>elf. You may di<U+017F>pence with your own wil (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I) but never with that obedience which is due unto a Father, without a mo<U+017F>t horrid crime. The obedience which I owe unto him (<U+017F>aid he) mu<U+017F>t be confined unto po<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities and it is no fault to faile, where power wants to performe: but admit, I mu<U+017F>t obey in al things, <U+017F>ince of two evills, the greater is to be avoided. I will rather faile in my duty to him who is but a man, then in my duty to your fair <U+017F>elfe, who is all Divine. Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o long, and <U+017F>o prevalent he was in it, that I was forced to admit him my <U+017F>ervant: and both of us being too young to <U+017F>hadow our de<U+017F>ignes with any artifice, <hi>Alcippe</hi> did <U+017F>oone find us out; and being loath this amitie <U+017F>hould grow up to any higher pitch, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>end him upon <U+017F>o long a voyage with good old <hi>Cleantes,</hi> as that ab<U+017F>ence might wear out this young impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love, But the <U+017F>eperation did as little good as all the re<U+017F>t of his artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he u<U+017F>ed: for <hi>Celadon,</hi> though yet a Boy, did <U+017F>o fixe his re<U+017F>olution to overcome all difficulties, that though any other would have taken them for torments, yet he looked upon them only as proofes of him<U+017F>elfe, and called them the touch<U+017F>tones of his fidelitie. And becau<U+017F>e he knew that his voyage would la<U+017F>t long, he intreated me leave to bid him adieu. This leave I granted; but, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> had you heard how pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionatly he begged me to Love him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and the vowes he made never to change, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you would have concluded nothing more impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, then that this affection <U+017F>hould ever decay. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince his time of <U+017F>tay was but <U+017F>hort, he thus <U+017F>aid unto me. My <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (for <U+017F>o he phra<U+017F>ed me alwaies in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) I <U+017F>hall leave with you my Brother <hi>Lycidas,</hi> from whom I will never conceale any of my thoughts he knowes how I have vowed my <U+017F>elfe unto your <U+017F>ervice, I be<U+017F>eech you promi<U+017F>e me, (if it be your plea<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould depart with any joy) that you will receive as from me all the <U+017F>ervices which he <U+017F>hall do you and by his pre<U+017F>ence renew the memorie of ab<U+017F>ent <hi>Celadon.</hi> And truly he had good rea<U+017F>on to make this reque<U+017F>t unto me. For <hi>Lycidas</hi> during his ab<U+017F>ence, was <U+017F>o diligent to ob<U+017F>erve his Brothers commands, that many thought that he <U+017F>ucceeded his Brother, in the affection which he bore unto me: this was the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Alcippes</hi> after he had kept him three yeares out of this Country, did call him home, in a confidence that <U+017F>o long a time had worne away that light impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love, which had a little entred into his green heart; and that he being now grown more wi<U+017F>e, would weane <hi>Lycidas</hi> al<U+017F>o from my affection. But his returne was an extreame a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his fidelitie ab<U+017F>ence could not extingui<U+017F>h the ardency ot his Love; no nor all the <U+017F>o much admired Romane beauties, could ever <U+017F>tartle him. He intreated me by his Brother, that I would give him leave to come unto me: Oh Heavens, how gladly did he come when I gave him licence? I think I have his Letters about me, for alas, I have kept them better then him: then pulling a little bundle out of her pocket, like unto that which <hi>Celadon</hi>
u<U+017F>ed to carry, or in imitation of him and in which <U+017F>he very charily pre<U+017F>erved tho<U+017F>e which came from him, <U+017F>he took the fir<U+017F>t, for <U+017F>he kept them in order as they came unto her, then after <U+017F>he had wiped away her pearly teares, <U+017F>he read the<U+017F>e words.</p>

               <p>Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to remember all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we then had unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould open tho<U+017F>e wounds again, which are more dolorous to me then death. During <hi>Celadons</hi> ab<U+017F>ence, <hi>Artemis</hi> my Aunt and Mother of <hi>Phillis,</hi> did come upon a vi<U+017F>it unto us, and brought with her this Fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Phillis:</hi> And becau<U+017F>e our manner of living, <U+017F>eemed more plea<U+017F>ant unto her then the <U+017F>hepherds of <hi>Allier</hi> <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>tay with us, which, beleeve it, was no <U+017F>mall contentment unto me: for her humours were very plea<U+017F>ing unto me, and I have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over many tedious hours with her. When <hi>Celadon</hi> returned his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <U+017F>o good, and he liked her <U+017F>o well, as I may truly <U+017F>ay he was the cau<U+017F>e of the great League, which ever <U+017F>ince hath been twixt her and me. At this time he arrived at the age of <U+017F>eaventeen or eighteen, and I at fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen, and began to manage matters with more prudence: <U+017F>o as, to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e our loves, I did intreat him, or rather indeed con<U+017F>traine him, to be very familiar with all <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es which could pretend unto any <U+017F>hadow of Beauty; to the end his applications unto me might be taken rather as common, then particular. I <U+017F>ay, I con<U+017F>treyned him unto it, for he did <U+017F>everall times upon his knees begge for a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this command; and alas, he had good rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o to do, for he did too well fore<U+017F>ee, that from hence would proceed the cau<U+017F>e of his death.

I know very well that <hi>Celadon</hi> had <U+017F>ome advantages of nature above <hi>Lycidas;</hi> yet I thought, though I knew no rea<U+017F>on for it, <hi>Lycidas</hi> to be much more agreeable unto my fancy. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to her, you bring into my memorle a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which once he had concerning you and this fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and turned towards <hi>Diana)</hi> Fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he to me) the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Belinda</hi> and <hi>Artemis</hi> your Aunt, are infinitly happy in two Daughters; and our <hi>Lignon</hi> is much obliged unto them <U+017F>ince by their meanes it has the honour to have the<U+017F>e two fair ones upon their bankes. And if I have any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they only do merit the amitie of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and therefore I do advi<U+017F>e you to love them, for by that <U+017F>hort acquaintance I have had with them, I do fore<U+017F>ee, you will receive much <U+017F>atisfaction in their familiarity: I wi<U+017F>h that one of them would daigne to look upon my Brother <hi>Lycidas</hi> with as much affection as I do. And then, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> having but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you, I an<U+017F>wered him, that my de<U+017F>ire was, he <U+017F>hould rather become a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto <hi>Phillis:</hi> and it hapned as I did wi<U+017F>h: for ordinarie di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e between them fir<U+017F>t begot a familiaritie, and at la<U+017F>t a Love in good earne<U+017F>t between them. One day finding fit opportunitie for it, he re<U+017F>olved to declare his affection to her, and to couch the mo<U+017F>t Love in the fewe<U+017F>t words he was able. Fair one (<U+017F>aid he to her) I hope you know your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o well, as to beleeve, that tho<U+017F>e who love you mu<U+017F>t needs love you infinitly: It mu<U+017F>t be my actions only which mu<U+017F>t make my affection known unto you; and at the fir<U+017F>t begge no more then an admittance into your favour. <hi>Celadon</hi> and I were <U+017F>o neer, as we could hear this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and al<U+017F>o the an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Phillis</hi> returned, and which indeed was more <U+017F>harp then I expected from her. For <U+017F>he and I did long before know, by the eyes and actions of <hi>Lycidas</hi> that he loved her, and <U+017F>he did not di<U+017F>like of it, that at this time <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered him with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>harpne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> was almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate: and <hi>Celadon</hi> who loved his Brother very much, being extreamly angry he <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>uch a baffle, he was halfe angry with me, at which I could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and at la<U+017F>t tell him: Never be <U+017F>o an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Celadon</hi> at this har<U+017F>h an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath received: <hi>Phillis</hi> could do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>hepheards of the<U+017F>e times, do too much glorie in the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of their Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es: but to the end you may <U+017F>ee that I do very well know the humour of <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will undertake to bring <hi>Lycidas</hi> into favour with her, provided he will but practi<U+017F>e a little patience and continue on his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es.

It's true Si<U+017F>ter, replied <U+017F>he, he has obeyed me; but let me tell you, that I hold this obedience for very great di<U+017F>obedience; and leaving off his adre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, argues his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion very indifferent.

As for my part I would open all my heart unto her, and therefore told her, that <U+017F>ince it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t love <U+017F>ome or other, <U+017F>he could not make a better choice then of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he might already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mo<U+017F>t certain <U+017F>ymptomes of his affection.

And if you do not believe I love you, put me to what Te<U+017F>t you plea<U+017F>e, and you <U+017F>hall finde it better, then by all my weak, though reall, expre<U+017F>sions of words.</hi>

               <p>At la<U+017F>t, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> after many a per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive argument, we brought things to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <hi>Lycidas</hi> was entertained; and ever <U+017F>ince, all foure of us have found much contentment in our lives, and invented many a <U+017F>tratagem to colour our de<U+017F>ignes, both by di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and by writing one unto another. Perhaps you have taken notice of a great Rock, in the high way towards <hi>Rochell,</hi> which without much ado cannot be a<U+017F>cended, but when one is at the top, there is no fear of any eye to di<U+017F>cover. And becau<U+017F>e it was neer the high way, we made choice of it for our rendevouz; if any did meet us, we <U+017F>eemed as if we went on in the high-way; but when the coa<U+017F>t was clear, we a<U+017F>cended. 'Tis true, that this Rock being <U+017F>o neer the high way, we were in <U+017F>ome danger of being heard by pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers, if we <U+017F>poke any thing loud and therefore commonly, <hi>Lycidas</hi> or <hi>Phillis</hi> were placed as guards, to <U+017F>pie when any came: And becau<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e did <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o employ us, as we could not every day meet in this place, we u<U+017F>ed to write one to another, and we made choice of another place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniercy, in which we laid our Letters one to another. In briefe, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> we u<U+017F>ed all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible waies to conceal our <U+017F>elves; and <hi>Celadon</hi> and I, did <U+017F>o <U+017F>eldome conver<U+017F>e together in publick, as many believed that <hi>Celadon's</hi> will was wholly changed; for a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw <hi>Phillis,</hi> then he made all his applications unto her, and <U+017F>he again treated him with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible complacency: Al<U+017F>o as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lycidas</hi> appeared, I left all other company to talk with him; <U+017F>o as in a <U+017F>hort time, <hi>Celadon</hi> him<U+017F>elfe had a conceit, that I loved <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and I believed that he loved <hi>Phillis: Phillis</hi> thought that <hi>Lycidas</hi> loved me, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> believed that <hi>Phillis</hi> loved <hi>Celadon:</hi> And thus unawares were we <U+017F>o intangled with the<U+017F>e opinions, as jealou<U+017F>ie began by degrees to kindle among<U+017F>t us. The truth is (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> we were then but fre<U+017F>h Schollars in the School of Love; for to what purpo<U+017F>e was it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a reall love, and publi<U+017F>h a fal<U+017F>e one? was there not as much cau<U+017F>e to fear the divulging of your love to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as your love to <hi>Celadon?</hi> Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> when a thing is not, we never fear what people think of it: But the contrary, when it is, then the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of it, puts all out of order. But now (continued <U+017F>he, and turned to <hi>Diana),</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie had <U+017F>o <U+017F>eized upon all foure, as I believe our lives had not been long, if <U+017F>ome good Genius had not in<U+017F>pired us to make all clear in the pre<U+017F>ence of one another. It was now <U+017F>even or eight daies <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>aw each other, at our Rocky rendevouz, and the Letters which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed 'twixt <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, were <U+017F>o different from the u<U+017F>uall <U+017F>train, as if they were writ by different per<U+017F>ons. At la<U+017F>t, as I told you, <U+017F>ome good Angel having care of us, all foure did meet in one place, where no other company was: And <hi>Celadon,</hi> who<U+017F>e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had mo<U+017F>t vigour in it, began thus to <U+017F>peak, Fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did I think that time
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53526:29"/>
would cure a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that raignes in me, I would wait for that remedje; but <U+017F>ince I know, the older it growes, the more it will encrea<U+017F>e, I am forced to complain again<U+017F>t you for the wrongs which you have done me, and with more alacritie, <U+017F>ince I can do it before <U+017F>uch Judges as are my peers. When he would have gone on, <hi>Lycidas</hi> interrupted him, <U+017F>aying, that his pain was greater then his. Greater! <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> that's impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for mine is extream: And mine, believe it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> is without any compari<U+017F>on. Whilft the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards were thus debating the matter, I was upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <U+017F>aid, Do you <U+017F>ee, Si<U+017F>ter, how the<U+017F>e Shepheards complain of us? Yes, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; but I believe we have greater cau<U+017F>e to complain of them. Though I am much incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto her, yet, I am much more incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t you, who under a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e of friend<U+017F>hip, which you <U+017F>eemed to bear unto him, has drawn him from that affection which he bare unto me, <U+017F>o as I may well <U+017F>ay, you have <U+017F>tollen him from me. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilently amazed at this, and knew not what to an<U+017F>wer, <hi>Celadon</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto me, and <U+017F>aid, Ahl fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, but as <U+017F>ickle as fair; have you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon lo<U+017F>t the memory of all <hi>Celadon's</hi> <U+017F>ervices, and your own vowes? I cannot <U+017F>o much complain again<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as again<U+017F>t you; for notwith<U+017F>tanding the con<U+017F>anguinity and amitie betwixt us, your perfections might well make him a Traitor, and forget his duty; but me thinks it <U+017F>hould be ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that <U+017F>o long a <U+017F>ervice as mine, and <U+017F>uch a perfect affection, <U+017F>hould ever finde the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>tain of incon<U+017F>tancy in your <U+017F>oul. But admit, that all in me was too little, to de<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o great a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, how can you <U+017F>o far violate and di<U+017F>pence with your vowes, as before my eyes to entertain a new affection? At the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Lycidas</hi> took <hi>Phillis</hi> by the hand, and with a deep <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>aid, Oh fair hand, to whom I had given up my <U+017F>oul! can I live, and <U+017F>ee thee take po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of any heart but my own? my owne, I <U+017F>ay, that did de<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, if ever any did de<U+017F>erve it, by the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>incere and pure affection that ever was? I could not hear any more what <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>aid, becau<U+017F>e I was con<U+017F>trained to an<U+017F>wer <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Shepheard, Shepheard (<U+017F>aid I unto him) the<U+017F>e words, Fidelity and Affection, are more conver<U+017F>ant in your tongue then your heart, and I have more rea<U+017F>on to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t you, then hearken unto them: but becau<U+017F>e now I do not care for any thing that comes from you, I will not take <U+017F>o much pains as grieve at it; that office is more fitly yours, if your di<U+017F><U+017F>embling heart would give you leave to do it. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>ince things are thus love on, love <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>till and <U+017F>erve her, her vertues will de<U+017F>erve it; and if I do afford thee a blu<U+017F>h, it is for anger that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer my <U+017F>elfe to be <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>ly deceived, and for over-loving one that is <U+017F>o much unworthy of it as thy <U+017F>elfe. <hi>Celadon</hi> was <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this, that he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>tock <U+017F>till a long time, &amp; could not an<U+017F>wer one word, which <U+017F>ilence gave me lea<U+017F>ure to hearken unto that an<U+017F>wer, which <hi>Phillis</hi> returned unto <hi>Lycidas: Lycidas, Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, you that can call me <U+017F>ickle, incon<U+017F>tant, and I know not what; you know full well, that the<U+017F>e titles are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable unto your<U+017F>elfe, and your own actions: Do you think that becau<U+017F>e you have got the <U+017F>tart, and complain fir<U+017F>t, you can therefore palliate your faults, and wipe away the wrongs which you have done me? me, I <U+017F>ay, not <U+017F>ickle as your <U+017F>elfe is, who have more rea<U+017F>on to be a<U+017F>hamed of your changing then I have to be vexed at it: But that which mo<U+017F>t vexeth me, is, that you <U+017F>hould charge me with your own faults, and counterfeit a good occa<U+017F>ion for your own infidelity: But 'tis no matter, he that will deceive his own Brother, may well deceive her that is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him. And then turning towards me, And you <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) you that have <U+017F>tollen away the heart of a Servant from me; do you think to keep it any longer then the fir<U+017F>t new object that <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elfe' No, no, though I know your perfections have power enough to keep any heart, but <U+017F>uch a one as is compos'd of feathers, and has wings to flie away; yet, this light Butterflie will give you the <U+017F>lip. <hi>Phillis,</hi> replied I, you talk of <U+017F>ome perfections that <U+017F>hould be in me, but certainly they are much inferiour unto yours, <U+017F>ince they are not able to hold <hi>Celadon</hi> from you. <hi>Celadon</hi> had now a little recollected him<U+017F>elf, and kneeling down, he <U+017F>aid unto me, It is not, my <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to undervalue the merits of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that I make the<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemn vowes before all the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>acred gods, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that <U+017F>he did never kindle the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of love in my <U+017F>oul; and the wrong you have done me in changing, is not greater, then your taxing my pure affection with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy. The <U+017F>tory would be too tedious (<U+017F>age <hi>Diana)</hi> <U+017F>hould I trouble you with every particular of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: But <U+017F>o it was, that before we parted, we were all <U+017F>o well <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es again, that all of us did acknowledge, that we had no rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect one another, and gave thanks unto heaven, for this happy meeting all together, without which, I believe, the roots of jealou<U+017F>ie had never been eradicated. As for my part, I think
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53526:30"/>
it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible ever to have brought me to rea<U+017F>on, had I not heard <hi>Celadon</hi> declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o Ingenuou<U+017F>ly before the face of <hi>Phillis.</hi>

               <p>After this, we were more di<U+017F>cret: but I no <U+017F>ooner got rid of this di<U+017F>temper, then I entred into another no le<U+017F><U+017F>e daingerous: for we could not <U+017F>o well di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; but <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> had a jealou<U+017F>ie that the <U+017F>parkes of his Sons affection were not quit extingui<U+017F>hed, and had <U+017F>uch a curious eye over all his actions, as ob<U+017F>erving how <hi>Celadon</hi> went every day to the place where we were wont to lay our Letters, he him<U+017F>elfe went thither, and ob<U+017F>erving how the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e was troden by our often going thither, a kind of tract did lead him to the very place where I had put a Letter for <hi>Celadon</hi> the night before: it contained the<U+017F>e words.</p>

One day, when he was gone into the woods to <U+017F>eeke a <U+017F>trayed <U+017F>heep, <U+017F>he met with her beloved <U+017F>hepheard: and after <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he laid her armes in a loving po<U+017F>ture upon his <U+017F>houlders, and after <U+017F>he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, thus <U+017F>aid Dear <U+017F>hepheard, what di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing qualities are in me, that I <U+017F>hould never find the lea<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>tration of favour from you? The rea<U+017F>on is, an<U+017F>wered he and <U+017F>miled becau<U+017F>e my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is not worth the having: Should tho<U+017F>e words proceed from any but your <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I would <U+017F>ay the <U+017F>peaker either wanted judgment or was blind. But dear <U+017F>hepherd how mu<U+017F>t I Love you, before I obtaine the bli<U+017F><U+017F>e of being loved againe? How many dayes mu<U+017F>t I <U+017F>pend in courting you, before I find a returne? I beleeve tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es who have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, are not more amiable then my <U+017F>elfe, nor have any advantages above me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in the enjoyment of your favour. <hi>Olimpia</hi> uttered the<U+017F>e words with <U+017F>o much zealous pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>tartled: and, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> as oft as I think upon this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age I cannot chu<U+017F>e but laugh, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter forbid it. But however, <hi>Phillis</hi> had commanded him to counterfeit Love of this <hi>Olimpia,</hi> who thinking his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be in good earne<U+017F>t, became ever <U+017F>ince his <U+017F>corne; and having made <U+017F>o much u<U+017F>e of her as <U+017F>erved his own turn, he fell to <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>daining of her, as that he could not endure to come nigh her. But afterwards he came unto me with <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ignes of di<U+017F>content, as I was per<U+017F>waded that he did repent of his foolery: but pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>Olimpia</hi> proved to have a bigge bellie, and when <U+017F>he began to perceive it, <hi>Phillis</hi> returned from her Journey: and as I expected her with much impatience, <U+017F>o I received her with abundance of joy. But as it is ordinary for one to enquire of that which lyeth neare<U+017F>t the heart, <U+017F>o <hi>Phillis</hi> after the fir<U+017F>t Salute, asked me how <hi>Lycidas</hi> did, and how he had behaved him<U+017F>elfe towards <hi>Olimpia?</hi> Very well, an<U+017F>wered I, and I am <U+017F>ure it will not be long before he make his appearance. I did cut off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as <U+017F>oon as I could, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omthing which might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who for his part was not in a little perplexitie, not knowing how to acco<U+017F>t his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e: but at la<U+017F>t, re<U+017F>olving to endure any torment rather then a bani<U+017F>hment from her pre<U+017F>ence, he came unto her lodging, where he knew to find me. And when <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he runnes with open armes to <U+017F>alute him. But he retreating, thus <U+017F>aid unto her, Fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have not <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e as to come neer you, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will fir<U+017F>t par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a fault which I have committed. The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, thinking he meant his comming no <U+017F>ooner, thus an<U+017F>wered; There's nothing <U+017F>hall debarre me from the Salute of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and though his crimes were more then they are, yet I would pardon them all. Upon this word, <U+017F>he went unto him and <U+017F>aluted him with abundance of affection. But her joyes were a little quelled, when he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto me, and de<U+017F>ired me to accquaint his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>e with his fault, that he might know unto what puni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>he would condenme him: Not, <U+017F>aid he, but that my <U+017F>orrowes for offending her <U+017F>hall accompany me to my grave, but becau<U+017F>e I would know my <U+017F>entence. This word made colour come into the face of <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> beleeving now, that the matter was of more moment then <U+017F>he expected. Of which <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> taking notice, Ah, fair one, <U+017F>aid he, I have not courage enough to hear your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But pardon, fair Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s, if I leave you; if my life di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, &amp; my death will <U+017F>atisfie for my crime, then let me live no longer. At this word he went away, and though <hi>Phillis</hi> called him back, yet he would not returne, but pulled to the dore after him, and left us two alone. You may imagine it was not long before <hi>Phillis</hi> enquired what the matter was, &amp; why he was in <U+017F>uch a perplexity and without any long prologue, I acquainted her, laying all the fault on our <U+017F>elves, who were <U+017F>o much unadvi<U+017F>ed as not to fore<U+017F>ee that it was a piece of difficulty for <U+017F>uch a young man to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a temptation, al<U+017F>o hinting unto her that the <U+017F>in was not of <U+017F>o horrid a degree, as to be impardonable. At the fir<U+017F>t I could not mollifie her implacabilitie; nor obtaine the pardon which I de<U+017F>ired: but a few dayes after, <hi>Lycidas</hi> by my advice came, and threw him<U+017F>elfe at her feet; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not look upon him, <U+017F>he ran into another chamber, and out of that into another, <U+017F>till flying from <hi>Lycidas</hi> who <U+017F>till followed her, and was re<U+017F>olved never to leave her, untill he had obtained either his pardon or his death. At la<U+017F>t, when she could go no further, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed in her clo<U+017F>et, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> entring and <U+017F>hutting the dores after him, he fell down at her feet <U+017F>peaking not one word, but expecting her <U+017F>entence. But the importunity of this affectionate begger was more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53526:31"/>
prevalent, then all my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions: For, after <U+017F>he had a long time been there, and not a <U+017F>yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable proceeded from either of them, at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus, Go, go, trouble<U+017F>ome man, it is thy importunity and not thy <U+017F>elfe, that has obtained a pardon. Upon this ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed word he did ri<U+017F>e, and ki<U+017F>s'd her hand, then came and opened the dore, to <U+017F>hew me that he had got the victory; then was he in as good a condition as ever, and his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did <U+017F>o fully pardon him, as <U+017F>eeing him much troubled to conceal the big belly of <hi>Olympia,</hi> who now did <U+017F>well <U+017F>o, as it was vi<U+017F>ible to the eye, <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf went to vi<U+017F>it and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could. This indeed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted) is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange te<U+017F>timony of affection; this, <hi>Phillis,</hi> was too much; and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my courage could never have brooked it. By this you may judge at the height of my affection, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis.</hi> It was rather a fault, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> then <U+017F>uperabundance of Love, to pardon <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily an injury done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the Lawes of Love. Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you know better how to make others love you, then how to love. If <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I am more obliged unto Heaven for it, then for my life. But however, am I not able to judge of love, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I love my <U+017F>elfe? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you cannot be a competent judge; for otherwi<U+017F>e you will be of too hard a temper, and cannot pardon as love requires: For Love, if it be rightly in tune, re<U+017F>embles Mu<U+017F>ick con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of <U+017F>everall parts, which, if all be well tuned, makes a melodious harmony; but, if one part di<U+017F>cord, then all is har<U+017F>h: So, cruell <hi>Diana,</hi> perhaps you will <U+017F>ay, that after one hath gon through a long and plea<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ervice, the fir<U+017F>t offence will <U+017F>poile all the former <U+017F>ervices. 'Tis very true (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana).</hi> Oh heavens! (cryed out <hi>Phillis)</hi> what a hard task hath he who loves you? He who loves me, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> mu<U+017F>t take heed he never offends me in matter of affection; and believe me, <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have done <hi>Lycidas</hi> more injury than he hath done you. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and laughed, heretofore I <U+017F>aid, that it was love that prompted me unto this act, but hereafter I will <U+017F>ay, it was revenge; and to <U+017F>uch as are the mo<U+017F>t curious, I will <U+017F>ay, it was for <U+017F>uch a rea<U+017F>on as I learned of you. They will judge, added <hi>Diana,</hi> that heretofore you did love; and now, that you know what it is to love. However, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> if it be a fault, it proceeds from ignorance, and not from any defect in Love, for I think my <U+017F>elfe obliged unto it; but you that have been <U+017F>o long mute, I pray tell us, how I a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted to bring this child into the world. Then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> replied thus:</p>
               <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e declared her <U+017F>elfe, <hi>Lycidas</hi> did very confidently accept of her offer, and <U+017F>ent a young Shepheard unto <hi>Moin,</hi> to bring a Midwife from thence, with her eyes blinded, that <U+017F>he might not know whither <U+017F>he went. <hi>Diana</hi> then, as being a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, did put her finger to her mouth, and <U+017F>aid, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, this is not <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ecret as you imagine, for I remember I have heard of it. I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> tell us how you heard it, that we may <U+017F>ee how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports do jump. I cannot tell, added <hi>Diana,</hi> whether or no I do well remember it: the poor <hi>Philander</hi> was the relator, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that he had it from <hi>Lucina</hi> a Midwife. One day as <U+017F>he was walking in the Park, betwixt mount <hi>Bri<U+017F>on</hi> and <hi>Moin,</hi> with <U+017F>everall of her companions, a young man came unto her, whom <U+017F>he knew not, and at fir<U+017F>t brought <U+017F>ome commendations to her from <U+017F>ome of her friends who were at <hi>Feurs,</hi> and afterwards told her <U+017F>ome particulars, purpo<U+017F>ely to draw her from the re<U+017F>t of her company, and when he had her alone, he told her, that a better occa<U+017F>ion brought him thither, and it was, that for all pitties <U+017F>ake <U+017F>he would go and help an hone<U+017F>t woman, who, without her aid, was in very great danger. The good woman was a little <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this, but the young man conjured her to conceale her wonder, for he would rather chu<U+017F>e a death, then this bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould ever be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected. <hi>Lucina</hi> being now a little better a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, and promi<U+017F>ing <U+017F>he would be <U+017F>ecret, <U+017F>he asked him the time when <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be ready. Prepare your <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid the young man, for a voyage of two months; and to the end you may be no lo<U+017F>er by the bargain, here is as much mony as you can get any where el<U+017F>e in that time. Then he gave her <U+017F>ome pieces of gold in a paper, and asked her if <U+017F>he would go in the night: And the woman finding her wages to be very good, did an<U+017F>wer him, that <U+017F>he would go at what time he plea<U+017F>ed. About fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen daies after, as <U+017F>he was comming out of <hi>Moin,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or <U+017F>ix of the clock in the evening, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him return, with his face quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and coming to her, he <U+017F>aid, Mother, the time is come, we mu<U+017F>t depart, the hor<U+017F>es are ready, and nece<U+017F><U+017F>itie requires ha<U+017F>te: She would have gone into her hou<U+017F>e to have taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, but he would not let her, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould tell any: So going into a little private bottom, clo<U+017F>e by the way <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw two hor<U+017F>es, and a hand<U+017F>ome man in black cloths, who kept them: A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as this man <U+017F>aw <hi>Lucina,</hi> he came to meet her with a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53526:31"/>
<U+017F>miling face, and after many thanks, he <U+017F>et her on hor<U+017F>eback behinde him who fetched her; then getting upon another hor<U+017F>e, they <U+017F>et forward through the fields a good pace; and when they were got a little off the Towne, and night grew dark, this young man pulled a handkercher out of his pocket, and do what <hi>Lucina</hi> could, he blindfolded her: Then afterwards turning the hor<U+017F>e halfe a <U+017F>core times round, to the end <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not know which way they took, they travelled a good part of the night, <U+017F>he not knowing which way they carried her, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e as <U+017F>he thought over a River two or three times; then cau<U+017F>ing her to alight <U+017F>he walked a while on foot, and as <U+017F>he could gue<U+017F><U+017F>e, through a Wood, where <U+017F>he got a glimp<U+017F>e of light through the handkerchieffe, which pre<U+017F>ently after they untied, and then <U+017F>he found her <U+017F>elfe in a very fine Tent, hung with Tape<U+017F>try, and made <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, as no winde could come in; on the one <U+017F>ide <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw a hand<U+017F>ome young woman lying in a little field bed groaning and crying out very loud, but masked; at the beds feet <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw another woman masked al<U+017F>o, who by her habit <U+017F>eemed to be well in years, and held up her hands, with tears in her eyes; on the other <U+017F>ide <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw a young Chamber maid masked, holding a candle in her hand: At this Tent dore, <U+017F>tood the man who held the hor<U+017F>es, grieving much for the pain this woman was in; and the other man, behind whom <U+017F>he rid, did fetch all things that was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. You may ea<U+017F>ily imagine how much <hi>Lucina</hi> was amazed at all this; for it is to be thought, that this young woman thus in pain was in Labour, and it was not long before <U+017F>he was delivered of a Daughter; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he being well brought to bed, and the Child put into a Cradle, <hi>Lucina's</hi> eyes were again blinded, and after a full reward for her pains, <U+017F>he was carried the <U+017F>ame way <U+017F>he came: And all this I received from <hi>Philander. A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> harkened unto this tale very attentively, and <hi>Phillis</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, which <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing, asked her the rea<U+017F>on: It is, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, becau<U+017F>e you have told us a <U+017F>tory which we are altogether ignorant of; and for my part, I cannot imagine who this <U+017F>hould be, for it cannot be <hi>Olympia,</hi> but mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>itie be <U+017F>ome other Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e. Truly, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> then I was mi<U+017F>taken; I took that hand<U+017F>om man who held the hor<U+017F>es for <hi>Lycidas;</hi> that old woman, for the Mother of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid for you; and imagined that you were all masked, becau<U+017F>e you would pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unknown. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> it was not <hi>Olympia;</hi> for <hi>Phillis</hi> u<U+017F>ed no other artifice, but only to get <hi>Lucina</hi> unto her hou<U+017F>e, for, as fortune was, <hi>Artemis</hi> was then from home: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <hi>Olympia</hi> was with <hi>Amarillis,</hi> <U+017F>he was to faigne her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ick, which, as the ca<U+017F>e was with her, <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily do, and de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>ome change of aire; <U+017F>o <U+017F>he was to come unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would be glad of her company: <hi>Amarillis</hi> yielded to the de<U+017F>ire, and <U+017F>o <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> came to fetch here And when her time drew neer, <hi>Lycidas</hi> got the Midwife and blinded her eyes, that <U+017F>he might be ignorant which way <U+017F>he went; but when <U+017F>he was come to the hou<U+017F>e, her eyes was then at liberty; nor was <hi>Olympia</hi> or any masked, imagining that the Midwife could not know any of their faces. This was all the artifice that was u<U+017F>ed; and when <hi>Olympia</hi> was well again, <U+017F>he returned home: Al<U+017F>o we have been told <U+017F>ince, that <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed a very fine device, for the bringing up of the child: She hired a woman to <U+017F>ay that it was hers, and then to lay it to the charge of a young fellow who <U+017F>erved her Mother; and becau<U+017F>e the fellow was altogether innocent, he denyed it; but was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>hamed, that he ran away: The woman pur<U+017F>ued even unto <hi>Lupeander's</hi> Chamber, and there, though the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <U+017F>till refu<U+017F>ed it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>et the child down in the mid<U+017F>t of the room, and ran her waies. They <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Lupeander</hi> was very angry, and <hi>Olympia</hi> al<U+017F>o at this fellow. But, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ion was, <hi>Olympia</hi> turning towards her Mother, However, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, this child mu<U+017F>t not be lo<U+017F>t, it mu<U+017F>t not be puni<U+017F>hed for the fault of another; but it will be an act of charity to <U+017F>ee it brought up: Her Mother, who was of a good and charitable di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, con<U+017F>ented unto it. And thus <hi>Olympia</hi> got her Daughter to be in the hou<U+017F>e with her.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Celadon</hi> was with <hi>Forella,</hi> and entertained with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible welcomes; and <hi>Malthea,</hi> at her Fathers command, did curra<U+017F><U+017F>e him as much as <U+017F>he in civilitie, could. But <hi>Celadon</hi> was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at this <U+017F>eparation from us; that all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>weets yielded him but a bitter reli<U+017F>h; and he lived in <U+017F>uch a drooping way, as <hi>Forella</hi> being very angry, that his Daughter <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o <U+017F>lighted did acquaint <hi>Alcippe</hi> with it, to the end he <U+017F>hould not expect any further progre<U+017F><U+017F>e in that match: who knowing the re<U+017F>olution of his <U+017F>on, and, as I think, moved unto <U+017F>ome pitty, he re<U+017F>olved once more to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome other artifice; and after that, never to trouble him any more. Then, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon</hi> was with <hi>Malthea, Phocion</hi> my Uncle, <U+017F>o contrived it, that <hi>Corebes,</hi> a very rich and hone<U+017F>t Shepheard, <U+017F>hould apply him<U+017F>elfe unto me: And <U+017F>ince he had all the good qualities that were de<U+017F>irable, it was already <U+017F>o divulged, as if the Wedding were re<U+017F>olved upon. <hi>Alcippes</hi> thinking to make

There was a Shepheard cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Squilinder,</hi> dwelling upon the borders of the Forre<U+017F>t, in a Town called <hi>Argentall,</hi> a craftie fellow, and very perfidious, who, among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of his knavi<U+017F>h qualities, had this, that he could counterfeit any hand <U+017F>o exactly, as the writer of the Originall could not know it from his Copy.

               <p>This Letter was cunningly conveyed unto <hi>Celadon</hi> by an unknown me<U+017F><U+017F>enger. Oh! how his heart was <U+017F>unk, when he received this <U+017F>ad newes: Now <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> (did he <U+017F>ay) I <U+017F>ee there is nothing in this world that is durable, <U+017F>ince all tho<U+017F>e vowed re<U+017F>olutions betwixt us are <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon vani<U+017F>hed. Now I am a <U+017F>ad witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all women, be they never <U+017F>o full of perfections, can ea<U+017F>ily return to their naturall incon<U+017F>tancy. Now, life end, <U+017F>ince <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> has lo<U+017F>t her affection, and <U+017F>ince I can do nothing el<U+017F>e, but grieve for my great di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. Thus did he breathe out abundance of <U+017F>ad complaints, and he was the <U+017F>ooner per<U+017F>waded to believe <U+017F>uch a change in me might be, by the common reports of my marriage unto <hi>Corebes.</hi> He lay all the day upon his bed, and when night came, he <U+017F>tole out of all company, and got into a thick unfrequented wood, <U+017F>hunning all <U+017F>ociety like a <U+017F>alvage, and re<U+017F>olved never to come into any company again.</p>
               <p>In this de<U+017F>perate re<U+017F>olution, he wandered over all the Mountains of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> and at la<U+017F>t found out a de<U+017F>art unfrequented place, where he intended to fini<U+017F>h the remainder of his di<U+017F>mall daies. The place was called <hi>Lapan,</hi> from whence the fatall <hi>Lignon</hi> hath his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: Upon the banks of this Spring, he built him<U+017F>elfe a little Cabin, where he made a <U+017F>hift to live above <U+017F>ix Months; during which time, his ordinary food was tears and <U+017F>ighs: And his <U+017F>olitude had continued longer, had not <hi>Alcippes</hi> commanded <hi>Lycidas</hi> to go and look him out, re<U+017F>olving (<U+017F>ince all was in vain) never to cro<U+017F><U+017F>e his affection more: But <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> had look'd long enough before he had found him, but for one accident which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that day.</p>
               <p>I chanced to be then by the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> looking upon the water, and condoling the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon; Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> looked al<U+017F>o in the water as well as I, and we ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>omthing which <U+017F>wimmed down the <U+017F>tream; <hi>Lycidas,</hi> to <U+017F>atisfie the curio<U+017F>ity of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, who much de<U+017F>ired to know what it was, did <U+017F>tep into the River, and with a bough brought it out; and finding it to be only a piece of paper, he threw it away upon the ground, being angry he had taken <U+017F>o much pains for a thing of no more value: <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he took it up, and opening it, we read the<U+017F>e words:</p>

this was the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Lycidas</hi> his gazing up the water to look for him: and he u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch diligence that in two or three dayes he found him out in his <U+017F>olitary habitation, <U+017F>o much unlike what he was, that he was not knowable: But when <hi>Lycidas</hi> told him that he mu<U+017F>t come to me, and that I did <U+017F>o command it; he could hardly be per<U+017F>waded but that his Brother would deceive him. At la<U+017F>t, the Letter which he gave him from me did <U+017F>o revive him that in a few dayes he cheered up his countenance, and came unto us, yet not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon but <hi>Alcippes:</hi> dyed before his return, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> followed him, a few dayes after. Then had we <U+017F>ome hopes that fortune had <U+017F>hot her wor<U+017F>t arrowes again<U+017F>t us, <U+017F>ince they two who did mo<U+017F>t cro<U+017F><U+017F>e our de<U+017F>ignes were dead, but it did not <U+017F>o happen: for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Corebes</hi> <U+017F>o continued, that <hi>Alces, Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> did much trouble my tranquillity; and yet our mi<U+017F>ery did not proceed from them, though <hi>Corebes</hi> was partly the cau<U+017F>e of it: for when he came to make his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, being very rich, he brought many <U+017F>hepheards with him, among<U+017F>t which was <hi>Semires;</hi> a <U+017F>hepheard truly of many excellent qualities, but the mo<U+017F>t fal<U+017F>e and cunning man that ever lived: as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw me, his de<U+017F>igne was to <U+017F>erve me, not valuing the friend<U+017F>hip twixt <hi>Corebes</hi> and him and <U+017F>ince <hi>Celadon</hi> and I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it, the better to colour our loves, he to <U+017F>eeme as if he loved all <U+017F>hephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es, and I to admit patiently of all addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, he pre<U+017F>ently did think that my good reception of him did proceed from <U+017F>ome good affection to him. But he had not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon knowne of the affection betwixt <hi>Celodon</hi> and me, had he not by ill luck found <U+017F>ome of my Letters: Now though all knew that he loved me, yet few beleeved that I loved him, <U+017F>o cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did I carry my <U+017F>elfe towards him: and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alcippes</hi> had found our Letters which had co<U+017F>t us <U+017F>o dear, we would not tru<U+017F>t them that way any longer but invented another trick which we thought more <U+017F>afe. <hi>Celadon</hi> was wont to have a hole in the lining of his hat, in which he u<U+017F>ed to put <U+017F>uch Letters as he writ unto me, then he would throw it at me in a je<U+017F>ting manner, or el<U+017F>e leave it by me, that I might take it out, and returne mine the <U+017F>ame way back againe: I know not how, but one day as ill luck was, I let fall one of my Letters, and <hi>Semires</hi> took it up; which when he read, he found the<U+017F>e lines.</p>

               <p>After he had found this Letter, his thoughts were not <U+017F>o much of Love as how to make <hi>Celadon</hi> and me at odds, and he began thus. In the fir<U+017F>t place, he be<U+017F>eeched me to pardon him for being <U+017F>o bold, as to lift up his eyes <U+017F>o high, as upon me, who<U+017F>e beauty had con<U+017F>trained him unto it: &amp; that he was <U+017F>o con<U+017F>cious of his own <U+017F>mal merits, that he would never trouble me any more, only be<U+017F>eeched me to forget his ra<U+017F>h attempt: afterwards he did <U+017F>o much court the friend<U+017F>hip and familiarity of <hi>Celadon,</hi> as if he had loved him above all the men in the world: And the more to blind me lie never met me, but took an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageou<U+017F>ly of my <U+017F>hepheard, covering his intentions with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ubtile cloak, that none could imagine he had a de<U+017F>igne it it; his commends of the per<U+017F>on whom I loved, did, as I <U+017F>aid before, <U+017F>o deceive me that I took great delight in talking with him: &amp; thus two or three Monthes pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed very happily both for <hi>Celadon</hi> and me. But I think it was to make me the more: <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of of my en<U+017F>uing mi<U+017F>ery, which I <U+017F>hall never remember but with warry eyes: here <U+017F>he <U+017F>topped and in lieu of words, did by her tears repre<U+017F>ent her <U+017F>orrowes unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that neither <U+017F>he nor they dur<U+017F>t open their mouthes fearing to augment her teares: for the more one thinkes to <U+017F>top the current of teares by rea<U+017F>on, the more they will flow. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he began to pur<U+017F>ue her former di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: Alas, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I cannot remember this fatall di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter without a tribute of <U+017F>ad teares, <hi>Semires</hi> now had gotten <U+017F>uch familiarity both with <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, as we were <U+017F>eldome a<U+017F>under.

And then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto me, he went on: I <U+017F>ee, fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that my talk had like to have di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed you, but pardon me I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>ince it was only my zeal to your <U+017F>ervice, that I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o much: <hi>Semires,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, I am much obliged to you for your good will to me, and <U+017F>hould be much more if you would fini<U+017F>h that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e which you begun: Oh <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (an<U+017F>wered he) I doubt I have <U+017F>aid too much already, but perhaps time will tell you more, and then you will know <hi>Semires</hi> to be your faithfull <U+017F>ervant. Oh deceitfull man, how good did he make his wicked promi<U+017F>es unto me? For <U+017F>ince that I have known but too much, to know it with any de<U+017F>ire of living: at that time he would tell me no more, purpo<U+017F>ely to whet my de<U+017F>ire of knowing it: but when he thought that my de<U+017F>ire was now eager enough, &amp; after I had very importunately urged him to tell it, he an<U+017F>wered me thus.

However, to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, I an<U+017F>wered <hi>Semires</hi> that I never did nor would beleeve, <hi>Celadon</hi> did more particularly apply him<U+017F>elf unto me then unto others; and that the familiarity which was between them, was only the con<U+017F>equent of a long acquaintance: but as for any matters of love, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of that nature, that they were altogether indifferent unto me. Then this <U+017F>ubtile man an<U+017F>wered me thus, I thank the gods that your humour is <U+017F>uch; and <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, you will take <U+017F>ome delight in hearing <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which he be<U+017F>towed upon his deare <hi>Aminthea.</hi> I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> when I heard <hi>Aminthea</hi> called, his, I changed colour: and becau<U+017F>e he offered to relate their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>eemed willing to heare more of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of <hi>Celadon,</hi> though alas more faithfull, then I was well advi<U+017F>ed. So I accepted of his offer, and indeed he made good his promi<U+017F>es. For a little after, he came running unto me, and told me, he had left them together not farre off and that <hi>Celadon's</hi> head did lie in <hi>Amintheas</hi> lap, and <U+017F>he holding his head; relating the<U+017F>e particulars purpo<U+017F>ely to nettle me the more. Then I followed him, though I neither knew which way I went, nor what I did, until we came very neere, though they neither heard nor <U+017F>aw us. I have <U+017F>ince thought, that it was becau<U+017F>e they cared not who either <U+017F>aw or heard them; but <U+017F>o it was, that I heard <hi>Celadon</hi> an<U+017F>wer her, Beleeve me, fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, never did beautie make a deeper impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in any <U+017F>oul, then it hath in mine: but <hi>Celadon</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Aminthea,</hi> It is not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a heart <U+017F>o young as yours, <U+017F>hould long retaine that impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion which love hath made in it. Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (replyed my <hi>Celadon)</hi> let us leave off the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons; do not mea<U+017F>ure me by the yard or weights of another: but ble<U+017F>s me with your favour, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee whether or no my young heart can pre<U+017F>erve them as long as it lives: <hi>Celadon, Celadon,</hi> replyed <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> you would be but de<U+017F>ervedly puni<U+017F>hed, if your di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations <U+017F>hould become truthes, and if heaven in my revenge <U+017F>hould make you love <hi>Aminthea</hi> in earne<U+017F>t, whom now I know you do but jea<U+017F>t with. Hitherto, all was well enough: but Oh heavens what a <U+017F>trange an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation did he returne? Fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered he, if I do mock or jea<U+017F>t with you, may Love turne all my mockery upon my <U+017F>elf, &amp; if I have merited it that he would puni<U+017F>h me with your menaces. <hi>Aminthea,</hi> not being able to reach the intention of his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e did an<U+017F>wer him only with a <U+017F>igh and in <U+017F>uch a manner, as I in my language did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, that <U+017F>he would not have rejected him, if <U+017F>he could have credited his language. But that which mo<U+017F>t perplexed me, was, that after <hi>Celadon</hi> had been a while <U+017F>ilent, he fetched a deep <U+017F>igh which pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered with another: and when he did ri<U+017F>e up to <U+017F>peak unto her <U+017F>he covered her eyes with her hand &amp; blu<U+017F>ht, as being a<U+017F>hamed that this <U+017F>igh had e<U+017F>caped her: and after a little pau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ilence, <hi>Aminthea</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto him. Come <hi>Celadon,</hi> are you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oone weary of my company?

               <p>The noi<U+017F>e which they made at <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> <U+017F>wouning was <U+017F>o great, that <hi>Leonida</hi> waked, and hearing <U+017F>ome talk <U+017F>o neer her, her curio<U+017F>ity invited her to know who they were.

The company you keep <U+017F>o much, <hi>Phillis,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, does not de<U+017F>erve the title of friend.

And it <U+017F>eemed, as ill luck was, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> intended to change the Livery of his <U+017F>ervants; but <U+017F>o it was, that I having an ob<U+017F>ervant eye of every thing, one night as he was in the <U+017F>treet, I heard him command one of his men to go unto his Taylor, and fetch the Coat that he had made again<U+017F>t the day of Rendevonz, that he might try how it fitted him: And <U+017F>ince he had charged the Taylor to let none <U+017F>ee it, he gave this <U+017F>ervant a Ring as a token, that he came from his Ma<U+017F>ter: I followed the <U+017F>ervant <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that I knew the lodging and the name of the Taylor: The next morning betimes I went unto him, and told him that I came from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to <U+017F>ee in what forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e his clothes were: for <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing to have him go, and his fears of his cloths not being fini<U+017F>hed in time, made me come to bring him the certain truth, for he would not tru<U+017F>t him; he would have given his Ring for a token (<U+017F>aid I) but he told me, this would be <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that I tell you, he <U+017F>ent la<U+017F>t night for the Coat, and he who came for it, brought it again. Thus I deceived the Taylor, and took notice of his cloths as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could. Then I <U+017F>eeming to ha<U+017F>ten him with his work, he told me, that he had time enough; for, he had <U+017F>een a Letter which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did write unto the Maior of the Town, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to <U+017F>ummon all the gallantry of the Town again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a day, on which <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> and <U+017F>uch as went with him, were to depart.

I decked up a Table with a Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>e upon it, <U+017F>etround with Ivy, Mi<U+017F>letoe, and Holline, and <U+017F>trewed my room with Ru<U+017F>hes, Vervin and <U+017F>uch like: I <U+017F>et my Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<U+017F><U+017F>e in the mo<U+017F>t dark part of the room, to the end my Art might not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and oppo<U+017F>ite to this mirrour, I placed my painted Paper, wherein I had <U+017F>o exactly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53526:34"/>
drawn the place which I intended to <U+017F>hew <hi>Galathea,</hi> as none could di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h between the Originall and the Copy. Above this gla<U+017F><U+017F>e did hang a plank, upon which an ugly grim vi<U+017F>age was painted, and hanged by a <U+017F>mall thred, which, with the ob<U+017F>curity of the place, could not be di<U+017F>cerned; at the bottom of this plank was fixed a <U+017F>teel, which, when the plank fell, the <U+017F>teel did hit again<U+017F>t a piece of flint, purpo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>o <U+017F>et, as it never failed of fire; about which place I had <U+017F>et a compo<U+017F>ure of Sulphure, and Salt-peeter, which, when fire did fall into it, did break into <U+017F>trange kinde of flames, in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange manner, and with <U+017F>uch celeritie as might well cau<U+017F>e wonder. All this I invented, that it might be thought either <U+017F>ome Divinity, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Witchcraft. After all things were thus ordered, I did <U+017F>ometimes expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe to <U+017F>ight, but very <U+017F>eldome; and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I perceived any <U+017F>aw me, I pre<U+017F>ently retreated into my Cell, where I made a <U+017F>how, as if I lived only upon roots herbs, and air, though in the night I changed habit, and provided all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. Within a few daies many took notice of me, and my fame was <U+017F>o great, that it reached the ears of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who u<U+017F>ed often to come and walk in the Gardens of <hi>Mount-Bri<U+017F>on.</hi> Upon a time, <hi>Sildres, Silvia, Leonida,</hi> and <U+017F>everall others of their company, did walk along the banks of my little River, where then I <U+017F>eemed, as if I were gathering <U+017F>ome herbs: a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I perceived they <U+017F>aw me, I ran ha<U+017F>tily into my Cabin; they being full of curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee me, and to talk with me, did come after me through the wood: I, by that time had got upon my knees, and when I <U+017F>aw them look through my dore, I went towards it, where the fir<U+017F>t that met me was <hi>Leonida;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had thru<U+017F>t open the dore, and was ready to enter, I <U+017F>harply reprehended her, <U+017F>aying, <hi>Leonida,</hi> the Deities whom I adore, does command you not to prophane their Altar. Upon the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he was a little <U+017F>urprized, and retreated for, my habit of a Druide got me reverence, and my naming (Deitle) did <U+017F>trike with terror: But, aften a little recollection of her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me, The Altars of your Deities be they whom they will, cannot be profaned, by receiving my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which came hither only to render that honour which the heavens demands of us. The heavens indeed (an<U+017F>wered I) doth expect both devotion and honour, but not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from <U+017F>uch as they ordain. If any zeal to the divinity whom I adore, has brought you hither, then you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve what <U+017F>he commands. What is her commandements (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia)? Silvia,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) if you come with the <U+017F>ame devotion that your companion doth, then do as I <U+017F>hall bid you, and your devotion will be acceptable unto my deitie. Before the Moon does enter into her decrea<U+017F>e, wa<U+017F>h your right thigh as low as your knee, and your right arm as low as your elbow, before day, in this River, which runs before this <U+017F>acred Cave; and afterwards come hither with a Chaplet of Vervine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your head, and a Girdle of Fern about your middle; then <U+017F>hall I declare unto you the my<U+017F>teries of this holy place. Then taking her by the hand, I <U+017F>aid thus unto her, Would you have me (for a te<U+017F>timony of that favour, which the deities are plea<U+017F>ed to confer upon me) tell you <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of your life pa<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ome that are to come? No, not I (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for I am not <U+017F>o full of curio<U+017F>ity: but you my Companion (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Leonida)</hi> I have known you heretofore full of <U+017F>uch curio<U+017F>ity. And <U+017F>o I am <U+017F>till (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ented her hand unto me). Then calling to memorie what you told me concerning the<U+017F>e Nymphs in particular, I took her hand, and asked her, whether <U+017F>he was born in the night, or in the day time; and under<U+017F>tanding that it was in the night, I took her left hand, and after a con<U+017F>idering pau<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>aid unto her, <hi>Leonida,</hi> This Line of Life being hand<U+017F>ome, well marked, and long, does demon<U+017F>trate, that you mu<U+017F>t live long, and free from any corporeall maladies; but this little Cro<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the <U+017F>ame Line, almo<U+017F>t at the top of the Angle, does portend <U+017F>ome maladies of Love, which will hinder you from being <U+017F>o <U+017F>ound in minde as in body: and the<U+017F>e five or <U+017F>ix little Points, which are <U+017F>owed like little grainee here and there, upon the <U+017F>ame Line, do <U+017F>ignifie, that you will never hate them that love you, and will much delight in being courted. Then look upon the other Line, which takes its root from that which we <U+017F>poke of before, which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the mid<U+017F>t of the hand, does rai<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elfe up towards the hill of the Moon, it is called the middle natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Line; The<U+017F>e fractions which you <U+017F>ee and <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o little, do <U+017F>ignifie, that you are ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angred, even again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e, over whom Love has given you authoritie: And this little <U+017F>tar which turnes again<U+017F>t the ri<U+017F>ing of the pul<U+017F>e, doth <U+017F>hew, that you are full of goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that your anger is <U+017F>oon over. But ob<U+017F>erve that Line which we call the Table Line, which joynes it <U+017F>elfe with the middle naturall Line, <U+017F>o as both do make an Angle, this doth demon<U+017F>trate various troubles in matter of Love, and which will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten render your life very di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing, and tells me, that it will be very long or never, before

I would have continued, when <U+017F>he pulled back her hand and told me, that this was not that which <U+017F>he did ask of me, but <U+017F>he defired to know what would become of that de<U+017F>igne which <U+017F>he had in hand, and that I would not <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o generally as before, but come to particulars. To which I an<U+017F>wered, that the Divine powers did keep the future to them<U+017F>elves, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>omtimes out of their goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e they revealed them unto their <U+017F>ervants and that <U+017F>omtimes for the publique good, <U+017F>omtimes to <U+017F>atisfie the <U+017F>ervent prayers of tho<U+017F>e who do often importune them at their Altars: and very often to <U+017F>how that nothing is hid from them; but alwayes unto <U+017F>uch as are prudent and di<U+017F>creet: for the <U+017F>ecrets of the gods would not be made common, or divulged, but upon <U+017F>peciall occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I tell you this, that your curio<U+017F>itie may re<U+017F>t contented, though I have not <U+017F>o clearely di<U+017F>covered things unto you, as you de<U+017F>ire. Nor is it either expedient or nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, I <U+017F>hould tell you any more: but to the end you may know, that the gods are not niggards of their favours but <U+017F>peak familiarly unto me. I will tell you of <U+017F>uch things as have happened unto you, by which you may very well Judge, that I do know them.</p>
               <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place, fair Nymph, you know that though I never <U+017F>aw you before, yet at the very fir<U+017F>t entrance I called you by your names; which I did, that you might beleeve me to be above the common degree of knowledge, not that I do a<U+017F>cribe any glory unto my <U+017F>elfe, for that would be high pre<U+017F>umption, but unto the gods whom I do adore in this place. Then you beleeve that all I <U+017F>ay, I learned from my ma<U+017F>ter. (And in this I lyed not, for it was you <hi>Polemas</hi> who told me all) But, continued I, particularities will make my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e very long; it were convenient, if we went under <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hady trees. Upon this we went, and then I began thus; Truly, <hi>Clemanthes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi> to him and interrupted him) you could not carry out this beginning with more artifice. You <U+017F>hall judge, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> whether I did not continue it with as much or more prudence: Then thus I began, Fair Nymph, it is now about three yeares <U+017F>ince the noble <hi>Agis</hi> in a full a<U+017F><U+017F>embly was given unto you for a Servant. At the fir<U+017F>t, you were very indifferent; for then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripene<U+017F><U+017F>e of both your ages, had not made you capable of <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions as Love did conceive: but <U+017F>ince that time, your beautie in him, and his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto you, did by degrees kindle tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ires which nature at the fir<U+017F>t had laid a foundation for: <U+017F>o as that which at the fir<U+017F>t was but indifferent in you both, became now particular; and Love did furni<U+017F>h his <U+017F>oul with all <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions as u<U+017F>ually do accompany it: likwi<U+017F>e you began to bear him <U+017F>o much good will as to accept of his affection and <U+017F>ervices above others. The fir<U+017F>t time he ever made any overtures unto you, was when <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did walk in the gardens of <hi>Mount-Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> when he took you by the hand, and after a long pau<U+017F>e, upon a <U+017F>uddain he broke into the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: Fair Nymph I will no longer di<U+017F>pute with my <U+017F>elfe, whether I <U+017F>hould or I <U+017F>hould not declare, the thoughts of my <U+017F>oul unto you, for now my <U+017F>oul begins to be angry with me, and con<U+017F>traines me to it. Here I <U+017F>topt, and <U+017F>aid, unto her; <hi>Leonida,</hi> will you have me repeat the very <U+017F>ame words to a <U+017F>yllable, that you u<U+017F>ed in an<U+017F>wer to him? Beleeve me, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi> them) you run a great hazard to be di<U+017F>covered. No no, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and to give a te<U+017F>timonie that I have not lo<U+017F>t my memorie, I wil repeat unto you the <U+017F>ame words: But replyed <hi>Polemas,</hi> perhaps I might either forget or mi<U+017F>take them: Oh never doubt that (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleanthes)</hi> for I beleeve <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf cannot remember her own very words; <U+017F>o as having an opinion that I recieved mine from the gods, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he would have beleeved them the <U+017F>ame, though you had never been familiar with her. But remembring that you <U+017F>erved her long, and that your <U+017F>ervices were alwayes well received untill you changed affection and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed it unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> and upon that rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he took part with <hi>Lindamor</hi> again<U+017F>t you, therefore I <U+017F>poke more confidently of the pa<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, knowing well that Love wil not let a lover conceal any thing from the party loved; but to returne to the purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered me; I <U+017F>ee you can tell us what you wil, but we can believe what we plea<U+017F>e, this <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, as being a little nettled in that which perhaps <U+017F>he would have concealed from her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: however I went on True, <hi>Leonida,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I,) you may beleeve what you plea<U+017F>e, but I am <U+017F>ure tell you nothing but what you know is true: you an<U+017F>wered <hi>Agis,</hi> as if you did not under<U+017F>tand his meaning, what<U+017F>oever it be, <hi>Agis</hi> (<U+017F>aid you unto him) out with it: for di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation misbecomes all men, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as you.

At this word, I wa<U+017F>hed my hands, my head, my feet, and all parts over, <U+017F>o entred into my cabin, not <U+017F>peaking a word after unto her: and becau<U+017F>e I did imagine, that their curio<U+017F>itie would invite them to come and <U+017F>ee what I did, I went unto my Altar, and kneeling down; I let down, the plank which had the <U+017F>teel in it, and which immediatly fell upon the flint, and fired my compo<U+017F>ition. The Nymphs fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeing my looking gla<U+017F><U+017F>e which ca<U+017F>t a very re<U+017F>plendent Lu<U+017F>ter, and after <U+017F>uch a flaming combu<U+017F>tion upon a <U+017F>udden, they returned home with a great opinion of my <U+017F>anctitie, and reverence towards the Divinitie whom I adored. Could matters be better executed then

this? No certainly, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Polemas,</hi> for I believe any one that was not acquainted with it, might have been deceived as well as the Nymphs.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Climanthes</hi> talked thus, <hi>Leonida</hi> who heard him, was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed out of her <U+017F>elfe, as <U+017F>he hardly knew whether <U+017F>he was awake or a<U+017F>leep, for <U+017F>he found all he related to be very true; and yet <U+017F>he could not well believe that it was <U+017F>o: But whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was thus in di<U+017F>pute with her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he heard <hi>Climanthes</hi> begin again thus, Then the<U+017F>e Nymphs went away, and what reports they made of me, I know not; but I conjecture they talked very highly of me, and <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange things, that all the Court was full of me: for, as fame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies encrea<U+017F>eth by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing from mouth to mouth; <U+017F>o an infinite number came to <U+017F>ee me, <U+017F>ome out of curio<U+017F>ity, others to know their Fortunes, and many to <U+017F>ee whether all reports of me were true; <U+017F>o as I was put to all my <U+017F>hifts for maintaining my reputation. To avoid <U+017F>ome, I <U+017F>aid, that this was a day on which the deitie would not hear nor an<U+017F>wer; to others I <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>ome had offended the divinity, and therefore they would give no return, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I had appea<U+017F>ed them by fa<U+017F>ting; to others, I did pre<U+017F>cribe a long pennance before I could undertake them: And when all was done, I <U+017F>aid, they had either done too much, or too little, of that which I did impo<U+017F>e upon them, and <U+017F>o I alwaies gained time: As for <U+017F>uch as I knew any thing of their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, I di<U+017F>patched them readily enough; and that was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, why all others, who de<U+017F>ired to know as much as they, did wholly <U+017F>ubmit unto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever I did impo<U+017F>e upon them. At the la<U+017F>t, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> her <U+017F>elfe came to <U+017F>ee me, and brought <hi>Galathea</hi> with her; after I had <U+017F>atisfied <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> in all her demands, which in <U+017F>um was, whether <hi>Clideman</hi> <U+017F>hould be pro<U+017F>perous in his voyage: and I an<U+017F>wered her, that he <U+017F>hould run through much varietie of fortune, that he <U+017F>hould be wounded, and that he <U+017F>hould be in three Battles with the Princes of <hi>France;</hi> but that at la<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>hould return with much glory; Then <U+017F>he went away well <U+017F>atisfied, and de<U+017F>ired me to recommend her <U+017F>on unto the tuition of the deitie whom I adored. But <hi>Galathea</hi> much fuller of curio<U+017F>ity then her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking me a<U+017F>ide, thus <U+017F>aid unto me, Good Father, I be<U+017F>eech you oblige me <U+017F>o far, as to let me know, what Fate I mu<U+017F>t expect. Then I did bid her <U+017F>hew me her hand, I looked her in the face, I made two or three circles on the ground, and turned towards the <U+017F>ame; then I took the mea<U+017F>ure of her hand, of her foot, of her neck, and many other ceremonies did I u<U+017F>e. At la<U+017F>t, looking <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>tly upon her, I <U+017F>aid, <hi>Galathea,</hi> You are infinitely happy, if you can but know how to take the advantage of one houre; and you are extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable, if either out of carele<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, or out of love or out of fear, you let this houre <U+017F>lip: But, the very truth is, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you would make your <U+017F>elfe uncapable of that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the heavens de<U+017F>tined you, you cannot attain unto greater felicity; all your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e, or all your mi<U+017F>ery, depends upon Love. Be advi<U+017F>ed therefore, and take a <U+017F>trong re<U+017F>olution, not to be intangled by the allurements of love; let neither the coun<U+017F>ell of Friends, nor command of Parents, <U+017F>tagger you; for if you do, then there is none under heaven will be more mi<U+017F>erable then your <U+017F>elfe. Oh heavens! (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> then) how you amaze me. Nay, never wonder (<U+017F>aid I unto her) for this which I tell you is only for your good: and to the end you may carry your <U+017F>elfe with more prudence, I will di<U+017F>cover unto you, as much as the deitie will permit me; but be <U+017F>ure you keep all I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret, and do not impart it to any upon earth. After <U+017F>he had promi<U+017F>ed me <U+017F>o to do, I proceeded on. Daughter (<U+017F>aid I) for <U+017F>o my divine office allowes me to call you, you <U+017F>hall be courted and <U+017F>ued unto, by many noble Cavaliers, who<U+017F>e vertues and merits may haply move you to ca<U+017F>t an eye upon <U+017F>ome of them: but, if you do mea<U+017F>ure your affection, either by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or by their loves, and not by what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto you, then you will become as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable, as one, that is out of the favour of the gods, can be. As for me, who am the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of their will, by thus telling you, I do deprive you of all excu<U+017F>es, which can be drawn from ignorance. You know, that heaven requires obedience and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion above all other <U+017F>acrifices, therefore be <U+017F>ure you remember what I <U+017F>ay. Upon the Bacchanalian fea<U+017F>t day, when men are <U+017F>well'd with the enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>ms of their god, you <U+017F>hall be in the great Town of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where many Gallants will <U+017F>ee you; but, take good heed of him who <U+017F>hall wear a <U+017F>uit made of green cloth of gold: If you do love him, I <U+017F>hall lament your <U+017F>ad fate, for you <U+017F>hall be the Butt of all di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters and misfortunes. Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, I do know a good remedie again<U+017F>t all the<U+017F>e, and that is, to love none at all My Child (<U+017F>aid I unto her) there is danger al<U+017F>o in this remedie; for, you may as well offend the gods, in not doing that which they would have you do, as in doing that which they would not have you do; therefore take heed of that. How then mu<U+017F>t I behave my <U+017F>elfe (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he)? I have already told you what you mu<U+017F>t not do, (an<U+017F>wered I); And now I will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53526:36"/>
tell you what you mu<U+017F>t do: In the fir<U+017F>t place you mu<U+017F>t know, that all corporeall or <U+017F>phitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies, have their <U+017F>ympathies and antipathies from the le<U+017F><U+017F>er we may come to the proof of the greater. My aim is, to make you under<U+017F>tand, that you have both a good and a bad Genius waiting upon you, one contrary to the other; and to avoid the bad, you mu<U+017F>t court the good, who will make you infinitely happy, did you but know to hit your houre Oh Father! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do conjure you by the divinity whom you adore to tell me what I <U+017F>hould do. There is another per<U+017F>on, (an<U+017F>wered I) whom if you do marry, you will enjoy more felicitie, then ever any mortall did. I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> who is it? That, fair Nymph (<U+017F>aid I) mu<U+017F>t not come from me, but only from <hi>Hecathe</hi> whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, <U+017F>o as if I do not <U+017F>atisfie you in that, do not think it is for want of any good will, but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he hath not yet revealed it unto me; may be, becau<U+017F>e I had not <U+017F>o much curio<U+017F>ity as to enquire it. But if you would know, then ob<U+017F>erve what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto you, and then you <U+017F>hall know as much as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary: for, as the Gods do liberally di<U+017F>pence their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits unto men when they plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o they would be acknowledged Gods: The <U+017F>acrifices of mortalls are plea<U+017F>ing unto them, as te<U+017F>timonies, that they are not ungratefull for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which they receive. The Nymph much ravi<U+017F>hed then, an<U+017F>wered, That <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired no more, and that <U+017F>he would punctually ob<U+017F>erve what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hould ordain. Now then is the time, <U+017F>aid I unto her, for the Moon is now at the full, or very neer it; and if you <U+017F>hould let her decrea<U+017F>e, it would for ever after be too late. Then I did command her to do the <U+017F>ame things I did <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Leonida,</hi> to wa<U+017F>h her <U+017F>elfe before day in this little River, both thighes and armes, and to come thus, with a Chaplet of Vervine, and a Girdle of Mo<U+017F><U+017F>e or Fem, before my Cell, and that I would prepare all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will come, and bring two of my Nymphs with me, and <U+017F>o privatly, that none <U+017F>hall ever know of my coming but they: but, be <U+017F>ure you be well advi<U+017F>ed what you <U+017F>peak before them of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, for they wil endeavour all they can to divert me. I was very glad of this caution, having my <U+017F>elfe the <U+017F>ame fears; and becau<U+017F>e I perceived, that <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to follow my coun<U+017F>ell, otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not have cared who had known it. Thus <U+017F>he went away, with a full re<U+017F>olution to return the third day after. The rea<U+017F>on why I <U+017F>aid, that it mu<U+017F>t be before the Moones decrea<U+017F>e, was, to the end, that if any came to me in the mean time, I might put them off with an excu<U+017F>e, that the Mocil was not yet at the full. Al<U+017F>o I <U+017F>aid, that it mu<U+017F>t be before day, to the end I might have fewer people come to trouble me And as for the Bacchanalian Fea<U+017F>t, I had computed it to fall upon the <U+017F>ame day, on which <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to take his leave of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and al<U+017F>o, that he <U+017F>hould wear this day a green <U+017F>uit. All things then being thus re<U+017F>olved upon, and prepared, I took order for the <U+017F>acrifice: and though I was not well ver<U+017F>ed in that my<U+017F>tery, yet, I <U+017F>hewed all the skill I had, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould finde me ignorant in any thing.</p>
               <p>The morning being come, and day within little of dawning, I found her in the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture I appointed, with <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Leonida.</hi> I wi<U+017F>hed with all my <U+017F>oul, <hi>Polemas,</hi> that you had been there, that you might have enjoyed the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to have <U+017F>een this fair one, in <U+017F>uch a lovely mode; you had <U+017F>een how the wanton winde did play with her lovely locks, which hung loo<U+017F>e in curious curles upon her alaba<U+017F>ter <U+017F>houlders, and had no other cover, but the Chaplet of Vervine. There you might have ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed your eyes with a <U+017F>ight of her naked armes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ighes, no <U+017F>how <U+017F>o white; and her pretty little feet might have <U+017F>hamed <hi>Thetis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mu<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I wi<U+017F>hed the wings of time had been clipped, that I might have looked longer upon the<U+017F>e beauties, who, as I told them, mu<U+017F>t needs be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the fine<U+017F>t Aromatique <U+017F>mells, le<U+017F>t the vi<U+017F>ions of the deity of <hi>Styx</hi> <U+017F>hould offend them, and to that end <U+017F>hewed them a place more private, where they could not ea<U+017F>ily be <U+017F>een.</p>
               <p>Upon the <U+017F>ide of a hill from whence this little River runs, there was a very clo<U+017F>e and thick thicket of wood, who<U+017F>e branches were <U+017F>o enterwoven with leaves, they did make mo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e and delightfull umbrage; <U+017F>o as the penetrating Sun-beams could not reach into the hollow vault under it: This gloomy <U+017F>hade did encourage them unto much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but yet their curio<U+017F>ity to be informed of what they defired, much more: There then it was where the<U+017F>e three Nymphs began to undre<U+017F><U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, and u<U+017F>e all <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes as I pre<U+017F>cribed; and I knowing the place very well, did <U+017F>teal my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o neer, as I could ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee them naked. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I never <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o lovely a <U+017F>ight in all my life; but above all, I found <hi>Leonida</hi> mo<U+017F>t admirable, both in the <U+017F>traight proportion of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

in the purely whitene<U+017F><U+017F>e of her skin, in the <U+017F>moothne<U+017F><U+017F>e and plumpne<U+017F><U+017F>e of every part <U+017F>he excelled them all by much; <U+017F>o as I began to di<U+017F>commend your judgment, and think you a man unexpert in hidden beauties, <U+017F>ince you quitted <hi>Leonida</hi> for <hi>Galathea:</hi> who, it is true, has <U+017F>omthing that is fair in her face; but, her other parts are <U+017F>o fat <U+017F>hort, of what by her face might be expected, as <U+017F>he may be truly called a deceiver. Oh heavens! <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> who could not endure to hear her whom he <U+017F>o loved thus <U+017F>poken of) leave off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, for <hi>Leonida's</hi> face is not worthy to come in compari<U+017F>on with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea's.</hi> Well <U+017F>ir, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Climanthes)</hi> think what you plea<U+017F>e, but I am <U+017F>ure <hi>Leonida's</hi> face is the lea<U+017F>t fair part about all her body. Then I would advi<U+017F>e her (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas)</hi> to hide her face, and <U+017F>hew us what is more fair: But I believe, <hi>Climanthes,</hi> your eyes were not competent judges; for the ob<U+017F>curity of the place, perhaps, would not <U+017F>uffer you to <U+017F>ee them perfectly. But i be<U+017F>eech you let this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e alone, and go on with your <U+017F>tory. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> who heard all this, and <U+017F>eeing with what <U+017F>corn <hi>Polemas</hi> did <U+017F>peak of her, <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be <U+017F>o much offended with him, as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved never to pardon him. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though <U+017F>he hated the<U+017F>e impo<U+017F>tures of <hi>Climanthes,</hi> yet <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but love to hear her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much commended: for nothing does more tickle a young Lady, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding her beauty, e<U+017F>pecially, when there is no <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of flattery. Whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was in the<U+017F>e thoughts, <U+017F>he heard <hi>Climanthes</hi> continue his <U+017F>tory, on thus, Then the<U+017F>e three Nymphs came unto me, where they found me before my Cell, and preparing all things for the <U+017F>acrifice I lighted up three candles, and I burned incen<U+017F>e three times round the room then I took off their Chaplets of Vervine, and crowned them with Poppy, and put <U+017F>ome falt into their mouths, and bad them chew it: Then I took three black Heifers, the be<U+017F>t I could chu<U+017F>e, and nine Ewes which had never taken the Ramm, who<U+017F>e black and long wool re<U+017F>embled <U+017F>ilk, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>mooth it was I cut off the hair which grew between their hornes, and co<U+017F>t it into the fire, <U+017F>prinkling upon it milk, wine, flower, and honey; and after I had called upon <hi>Hecathe</hi> three times, I thru<U+017F>t my knife into the hearts of the<U+017F>e Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, one after another, and took their blood in a great ba<U+017F>on: Then falling upon my knees, I called again upon <hi>Hecathe;</hi> afterwards I ro<U+017F>e up, and <U+017F>eemed as if I were tran<U+017F>ported, <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Nymphs, See, <U+017F>ee, the deitie! it is time, it is time, it is time! then taking <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoa</hi> by the hand, I <U+017F>tared with my eyes, <U+017F>hook my head, gaped with my mouth, made my brea<U+017F>t to pant, and all my body trembled, as if I were in a holy rapture: Then being neer the altar, I <U+017F>aid, Oh holy deitie, who re<U+017F>ides in this place, give unto me power to <U+017F>atisfie this Nymph in her demands with all truth. The room was dark, and had no light, but <U+017F>uch a hollow gloomine<U+017F><U+017F>e as the candles gave; but the day being now light, and the Sun up, it <U+017F>hined upon the painted paper, and made it repre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elfe much better in the Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gla<U+017F><U+017F>e; afterwards I addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>aying, Oh fair Nymph! thou art the favourit of heaven, thy prayers are heard, and thy <U+017F>acrifice is received<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> It is the plea<U+017F>ure of the deitie, that not only by the ear, but al<U+017F>o by the eye, thou mai<U+017F>t know the place where thou <U+017F>halt finde thy happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Come neer this altar, and <U+017F>ay after me, Oh, mo<U+017F>t mighty <hi>Hecathe,</hi> who<U+017F>e habitation is in the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, at whom the churli<U+017F>h Dog with three heads never barks; may thy altars ever <U+017F>moak with acceptable <U+017F>acrifices, which I do vow annually to pay, <U+017F>o as, great godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, thou wilt let me <U+017F>ee what I de<U+017F>ire. At this word I let down the plank which had the <U+017F>teel in it, which being fallen upon the flint, the fire did fla<U+017F>h pre<U+017F>ently, <U+017F>o as <hi>Galathea</hi> was <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with fear: But I did <U+017F>ay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, Fear not fair Nymph, it is <hi>Hecathe</hi> who <U+017F>hewes you what you de<U+017F>ire. Then the <U+017F>moak by degrees vani<U+017F>hing, the Looking gla<U+017F><U+017F>e was to be <U+017F>een; and, as good luck was, the Sun <U+017F>hined <U+017F>o clearly and directly upon it, as made the painted paper mo<U+017F>t plainly appear in it: After they had a while beheld it, I <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> Know Nymph, that <hi>Hecathe</hi> by me does let thee know, It is in this place which you <U+017F>ee in the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, where you <U+017F>hall finde a jewell, halfe lo<U+017F>t and de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed, out of a thought that it is fal<U+017F>e; and yet it is of an ine<U+017F>timable value, take it and keep it carefully. This River which you <U+017F>ee in it, is <hi>Lignon:</hi> that Grove of Willowes beyond it is towards Mount <hi>Verdan.</hi> Ob<U+017F>erve well the place and remember it. Then taking <hi>Galathea</hi> a<U+017F>ide, I <U+017F>aid unto her, You have, as I told you before, a Genius, that <U+017F>wells with abundance of malevolent influence; and another, the mo<U+017F>t benign and <U+017F>weet, as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly can be de<U+017F>ired From the evill influence guard your <U+017F>elfe, if you do love your own contentment: the good influence is that which you do <U+017F>ee in the mirrour. Ob<U+017F>erve well the place which I have let you <U+017F>ee, and to the end you may the better remember it, I bid you go and <U+017F>ee it, and ob<U+017F>erve it well; for, when the Moon <U+017F>hall be ju<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ame age, that this day <U+017F>he is, a little <U+017F>ooner, or a little later, you <U+017F>hall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53526:37"/>
finde him whom you mo<U+017F>t love: If he <U+017F>ee you before you <U+017F>ee him, he <U+017F>hall love you, and you with much a do will love him: On the contrary, if you <U+017F>ee him fir<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>hall be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to love you, but you will love him immediately: But however, you mu<U+017F>t over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your <U+017F>elfe and love him, yea, and overcome him al<U+017F>o, if need be; for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will at la<U+017F>t bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: If you do not meet him the fir<U+017F>t time, then go again the next Moon, upon the <U+017F>ame day, and <U+017F>ame houre, and <U+017F>o to the third; for come he will, though <hi>Hecathe</hi> will not a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of the day. Then taking a little branch of Hollin in my hand, I went unto the Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and with the end of it, <U+017F>hewed her all the<U+017F>e places: Look, (<U+017F>aid I) <U+017F>ee where the Mountain of <hi>I <U+017F>oures</hi> is; <U+017F>ee where Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> is, <U+017F>ee where the River <hi>Lignon</hi> is, <U+017F>ee, a little beyond it, where the Meadow is, through which you have oft gone to hunt: All the<U+017F>e places you may perhaps know, but I do not know them. Now Nymph, the <U+017F>acred deitie of this place commands me to tell you, that if you do not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ob<U+017F>erve what I <U+017F>ay, and what you have promi<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he will augment all the mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which your de<U+017F>tiny does threaten you with all: For my part, I do think my <U+017F>elfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that before my departure I have given you this advice: for, though I am not of this Country; yet, your vertue and piety does oblige me to love you, and to pray unto <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> to make you fully happy: And with this prayer I will take my leave of you; for the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e whom I adore hath commanded me to depart before the day, to morrow. An this word I did put them all out of my Cabin, after I had taken from them their Vervine, Ferne, and Hollin Chaplets, which I did burn in the fire.</p>
               <p>I did prefix her three Moones, to the end, that if you failed one day, you might be there another. I told her that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw you fir<U+017F>t, then <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily love you; and if you <U+017F>aw her fir<U+017F>t, the contrary; only becau<U+017F>e I knew very well you would be fir<U+017F>t there <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he would finde in her <U+017F>elfe the truth of my prediction, for you know, <U+017F>he loves <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor.</hi> I told her that I was to depart before to morrow, to the end <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not think <U+017F>trange at my departure, if out of <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come again: For having now done as much as my aimes did drive at, my be<U+017F>t way was to ha<U+017F>te away, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome Druide <U+017F>hould hear of me, and puni<U+017F>h me, which, you know, was alwaies my fear. Do you think, <hi>Polemas,</hi> I have omitted any materiall circum<U+017F>tance? No certainly <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> only me thinks you gave her too large a time; I would you had confined her to one day, and then I <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>ure to have met with her. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes,</hi> I know not what to think, but that <U+017F>he hath counted the age of the Moon wrong; and I do verily believe, that but for this Shepheard who was drowned, and who cau<U+017F>ed many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <U+017F>eek about for him, you had met with him that day: But let us have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for I am confident, that the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on which made you retreat, did al<U+017F>o make her do the like. But, me thinks it is time to ri<U+017F>e, to the end we may depart. Then opening the window, he perceived it to be bright day. Away, away, make ha<U+017F>te (<U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes</hi> to <hi>Polemas)</hi> the houre will be pa<U+017F>t el<U+017F>e; you had better be many houres too <U+017F>oon, then a minute too late. Would you have me go thither now (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas)?</hi> do you think <U+017F>he will come, <U+017F>ince it is fifteen daies pa<U+017F>t the prefixed time? No matter (an<U+017F>wered he) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <U+017F>he has mi<U+017F>counted the dayes, who can tell? and therefore let us go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> was afraid lea<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her, and therefore dur<U+017F>t not ri<U+017F>e till they were gone: but when they were out of the hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her<U+017F>elf. And after <U+017F>he had taken leave of her ho<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he continued on her Journey <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed at the cunning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the<U+017F>e two per<U+017F>ons, as <U+017F>he almo<U+017F>t never minded her way and <U+017F>he was touched <U+017F>o to the quick, that <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e her beauty, that to be revenged of him, <U+017F>he would make <hi>Lindamor</hi> acquainted with his treachery, which <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he could not better do then by the meanes of her Uncle <hi>Adamas</hi> unto whom <U+017F>he intended to communicate the, matter. And in this re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he made all the ha<U+017F>te <U+017F>he could unto <hi>Feurs,</hi> where <U+017F>he thought to find him; but <U+017F>he came too late, for he went homwards betimes in the morning, having the day before, fini<U+017F>hed all ceremonies belonging to the <U+017F>acrifice: as he went the day was very hot, therefore when he was in the plain of Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> he turned out of the way where he <U+017F>aw a hand<U+017F>om <U+017F>hade of trees, to re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf a while. And he was no <U+017F>ooner come at it, but he e<U+017F>pied a <U+017F>hepheard comming and <U+017F>eeming as if he intended to take the <U+017F>ame conveniency of <U+017F>hade. And becau<U+017F>e when he came neere, he <U+017F>eemed to be exceeding pen<U+017F>ive, he would not take any notice of him, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>turbe his thoughts, but <U+017F>haded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe purpo<U+017F>ely to heare what he would <U+017F>ay: at la<U+017F>t, he heard him break out thus: Why <U+017F>hould I be <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple as to love this wethercock? in the fir<U+017F>t place her beauty cannot much move, for <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o little as all <U+017F>he has cannot merit the name of Fair: moreover, there are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53526:38"/>
no other con<U+017F>iderations that can help out her merits, or retaine any man of parts in her <U+017F>ervice: Again, her affection is all that can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly oblige me, and that is of <U+017F>uch a mutable temper, as if <U+017F>he have any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love in heart, I beleeve it is but like unto wax and wax <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft as will ea<U+017F>ily take any new impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and deface the old: at the mo<U+017F>t, if I do love her, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it is meerly becau<U+017F>e I think <U+017F>he loves me. This <U+017F>hepheard had gone on his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, had not a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e overtaken him, who it <U+017F>eemes followed after him: and <U+017F>itting down by him thus began to <U+017F>ay: Come, <hi>Corilas,</hi> come, what new di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t is it, that makes you thus pen<U+017F>ive' The <U+017F>hepheard returned as di<U+017F>daining an an<U+017F>wer as he could, and never <U+017F>o much as turning his head towards her, an<U+017F>wered thus; I am thinking what a trick of Legerdemaine you have u<U+017F>ed, to get away from them whom even now you loved; why <hi>Corilas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) can you think I Love any but your <U+017F>elf?

               <p>SInce, Father, you command it <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid the Shepheard) I will relate the whole matter unto you. <hi>Stella</hi> is the Widow of a Husband which Heaven gave her, rather for a name then ought el<U+017F>e: for, be<U+017F>ides his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e: his age, which was above <U+017F>ixtie <U+017F>ix, had <U+017F>o impaired his <U+017F>trength, that he left her a lu<U+017F>ty young Widow, before <U+017F>he was almo<U+017F>t married: And the affection <U+017F>he had unto him was not <U+017F>o much, as to make her grieve too much for her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e; nor indeed was her humour <U+017F>uch, as to take any thing too much to heart. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>elfe ridd of two heavy yokes, both almo<U+017F>t at once to wit, a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from an old, cra<U+017F>y, and peevi<U+017F>h Husband, and from that <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervance which is expected from Ghildren to Parents, <U+017F>he then began to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe, and ruffle in the world with a great noi<U+017F>e: And as <U+017F>he was none of tho<U+017F>e killing beauties, that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves loved by force, <U+017F>o her affectedne<U+017F><U+017F>e did not at all plea<U+017F>e any that looked upon her. Her age was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>eventeen or eighteen, an age that is apt to commit much folly, when liberty is given unto it. This was the rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Saliam</hi> her Brother, a very hone<U+017F>t and di<U+017F>creet Shepheard, not being able to endure the expen<U+017F>ive cour<U+017F>es which <U+017F>he drew upon him, and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to re<U+017F>train her, did get her out of his village, into <U+017F>uch a place, where <U+017F>he might live in le<U+017F><U+017F>e danger of <U+017F>candall: in order to which, he intreated <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> that he would be plea<U+017F>ed to let her accompany his Daughter <hi>Amintha,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>uited <U+017F>o well in age, though <hi>Stella</hi> had a little the <U+017F>tart of her: And <hi>Cleanthes</hi> being content, there grew <U+017F>uch a familiarity betwixt the<U+017F>e two Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and they lived <U+017F>uch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate lives and contented, as they were never out of <U+017F>ight of one another. Many did wonder, that the<U+017F>e two being of <U+017F>uch different tempers, yet they did <U+017F>o well comply; but the <U+017F>weet and loving di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of <hi>Amintha,</hi> and the <U+017F>upple and ea<U+017F>ie nature of <hi>Stella,</hi> were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es; <U+017F>o <hi>Amintha</hi> never cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed the de<U+017F>ignes of her Companion, and <hi>Stella</hi> never thwarted what<U+017F>oever <hi>Amintha</hi> de<U+017F>ired; <U+017F>o as they kept <U+017F>uch a corre<U+017F>pondency together, as nothing was hid from each other. But at la<U+017F>t, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> the Son of the Shepheard <hi>Genetian,</hi> leaving the frozen valleyes of Mount <hi>Luna,</hi> and coming into our more plea<U+017F>ant plaines, and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Stella</hi> at an a<U+017F><U+017F>embly in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> when <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did carry away the pri<U+017F>e of beauty, he fell <U+017F>o in love with <hi>Stella,</hi> as I do not well know whether or no, it hath not <U+017F>ent him to his Grave: And <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o compliant to him, as after <U+017F>everall journeyes and me<U+017F><U+017F>ages, things were come to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> moved her to marriage, unto which <U+017F>he gave as favourable an an<U+017F>wer as he could de<U+017F>ire. At this time, <hi>Saliant</hi> was con<U+017F>trained unto <U+017F>uch a far off journey, as he knew nothing of this treaty: be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he did now take upon her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>olute authority, as <U+017F>he did not communicate her matters unto him. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Amintha</hi> <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon re<U+017F>olved upon marriage, did often ask her, whether or no <U+017F>he was in good earne<U+017F>t; and told her, that it was a matter of <U+017F>o great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as required very great and <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ideration. <hi>Amintha,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, never trouble your <U+017F>elfe, for I am not gon <U+017F>o far, but I can ea<U+017F>ily make a retreat. Mean time, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did make him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure of marriage, as that he <U+017F>et down the day, invited many of his friends, and was at <U+017F>uch charges, as are u<U+017F>uall upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions. But <hi>Stella,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cu<U+017F>tome of many women, who are proud of their own libertie, <U+017F>tarted from her fir<U+017F>t intentions, and broke all off by <U+017F>uch unrea<U+017F>onable demands, as <U+017F>he knew the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would never con<U+017F>ent unto: But, his love being above all difficulties and <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying all her unrea<U+017F>onable demands, <U+017F>he was at la<U+017F>t forced to break off with him upon no other pretence, but the <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his affection to her. You may ea<U+017F>ily imagine how <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> re<U+017F>ented this affront; but however, he could not yet ma<U+017F>ter his love: And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon this <U+017F>ubject, he compo<U+017F>ed the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, which afterwards he gave unto me.</p>

               <p>The cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Stella's</hi> change in her affection, was the court<U+017F>hip of another Shepheard called <hi>Semires,</hi> which did imprint it <U+017F>elfe very deep in her <U+017F>oul, and which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the la<U+017F>t of all men, for <U+017F>he did conceal it more from him than any other. This Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <hi>Semires</hi> was of all men that my conver<U+017F>ation ever met with, the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F><U+017F>embling and crafty; that he was otherwi<U+017F>e a man of very excellent parts, which cau<U+017F>ed this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e to go again<U+017F>t her own promi<U+017F>e, and reject the match with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and to confer all her favours upon her new Lover, who yet did not long triumph in this victory. For <U+017F>o it happened, that <hi>Lupeander</hi> making a great Fea<U+017F>t at the marriage of his Daughter <hi>Olympia, Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> were invited thither; and I being a kin<U+017F>man unto the Bride, I would not <U+017F>ail to be there al<U+017F>o. I know not whether Love did it cut of revenge, or whether it was the naturall giddine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Stella's</hi> wavering temper; but <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> then <U+017F>he had a minde to recall him into her favour; and in order to that, <U+017F>pruced up her <U+017F>elfe in all her affectedne<U+017F><U+017F>e which nature had very imprudently been prodigall of unto her: But, the offended <U+017F>pirit of this Shepheard had armed him with <U+017F>o much courage, as to hide all his affection to her, though he could not extingui<U+017F>h the flames of love. Towards night, when every one prepared for dancing, and to apply them<U+017F>elves unto tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their liking; <hi>Stella</hi> did <U+017F>o pur<U+017F>ue <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> that he being in a corner of a window, he could not hand<U+017F>omely avoid her, but was forced to receive the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of his loving ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Semires</hi> all this while ob<U+017F>erving how <U+017F>he pur<U+017F>ued <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> all the evening, according to the naturall temper of all Lovers, he began to be <U+017F>prinkled with jealou<U+017F>ie, knowing well, that a candle newly extingui<U+017F>hed, will <U+017F>oon light again: And <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he got <U+017F>o neer, as <U+017F>eeming to talk unto another, he heard her ask <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> why he <U+017F>hunned her <U+017F>o much? To which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> replied, The rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e you do <U+017F>o impudently pur<U+017F>ue me. But Shepheard, replyed <hi>Stella,</hi> I know from whence your di<U+017F>contents proceed, and I believe, not from him whom you imagine. For gods-<U+017F>ake (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ly<U+017F>is)</hi> let me alone in quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e; it is enough that thy offence proceeds from your hating me, and your hatred from your own levity: But 'tis no matter, all's forgotten, and now I have no minde to love. Well, well, (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) I know from whence all your anger proceeds, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have <U+017F>ome <U+017F>eeming rea<U+017F>on for it; but, I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider it a little better. Is it <U+017F>uch an impardonable injury, not to take a man to a husband, as <U+017F>oon as ever he hath asked the que<U+017F>tion? Is it not the cu<U+017F>tome of our Country, that he <U+017F>hould ask that que<U+017F>tion twice? The truth is, if I had marryed another, I had done you an injury: But, what likelyhood is there, that I <U+017F>hould ever refu<U+017F>e a man <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tant, that hath loved me almo<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e three months? The offended <U+017F>pirit of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not <U+017F>uffering him to love her, and his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not <U+017F>uffering him to hate her, he did not know in what termes to an<U+017F>wer her; and yet, to <U+017F>top the torrent of words, he thus <U+017F>aid unto her: I have had <U+017F>ufficient experience, <hi>Stella,</hi> that you know better how to <U+017F>ay then do, and that you abound much more in words than rea<U+017F>on: but, take this for an unalterable certainty, that look how much I loved you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, <U+017F>o much, or more, do I hate you now, and <U+017F>hall do as long as I live; <U+017F>o as there <U+017F>hall not be a day, in which I will nor divulge you unto all the world, for the mo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and con<U+017F>ening woman under heaven. Upon this, forcing his affection and the arme of <hi>Stella</hi> away, he broke from her, and left her alone in the window, whil<U+017F>t he went among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of the Shepheards. <hi>Semires,</hi> who, as I told you, heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, was both <U+017F>o amazed and ill <U+017F>atisfied with her, as he re<U+017F>olved ever <U+017F>ince to make no more addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto <U+017F>uch a wavering weathercock; which re<U+017F>olution was much more confirmed by me; for, I having long looked for an opportunity of <U+017F>peaking to her, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53526:40"/>
left her alone, I acco<U+017F>ted her; for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that her allurements had <U+017F>ome power upon my <U+017F>oul, and <U+017F>o much as the affronts which <U+017F>he had put upon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would not let me <U+017F>ee her imperfections, and fleeting di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. And as every one is apt to flatter him<U+017F>elfe in his own de<U+017F>ires; <U+017F>o I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that what the merits of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> could not obtaine from her, my good fortune might. As long as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> courted her, I would not let my affection appeare, for be<U+017F>ides con<U+017F>angunity, there was a great league of amitie betwixt us: but when I <U+017F>aw he was off, and thinking the place vacant (for I never took notice of <hi>Semires)</hi> I thought it a fit time to open my <U+017F>elf, before <U+017F>he entertained any other <U+017F>o addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elfe unto her, and finding her all pen<U+017F>ivene<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>aid unto her, that certainly it was <U+017F>ome great occa<U+017F>ion which thus had altered her; for <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e was <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>een in her plea<U+017F>ant humour. It is that trouble<U+017F>ome <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) who has put me in mind of old <U+017F>tories, and <U+017F>till upbraids me with the refu<U+017F>ing of him: Does that trouble you, (<U+017F>aid I unto her?) can it chu<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered)? how <U+017F>he for affection is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon put off as ones cloaths are but becau<U+017F>e I did a little delay his de<U+017F>ires, he took it for an ab<U+017F>olute di<U+017F>charge: Truly (<U+017F>aid I) <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did not de<U+017F>erve the honour of your favour: for what he could not compa<U+017F><U+017F>e by his merits, he ought to have tryed what all his <U+017F>ervices accompanied with a long patience would do, but his boyling temper, together with perhaps his too little love would not permit him. Had the <U+017F>ame happine<U+017F><U+017F>e hapned unto me as unto him, with what affection <U+017F>hould I have entertained it? And with what patience <U+017F>hould I have waited for it? You would think it <U+017F>trange (reverend Father) to heare me tell you, how <U+017F>uddenly this <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e changed: yet I prote<U+017F>t <U+017F>he entertained the overture of my Love, as <U+017F>oon as ever I made it: and in <U+017F>uch a manner, as, before we parted, <U+017F>he permitted me to call my <U+017F>elf her <U+017F>ervant. You may ea<U+017F>ily conceive that <hi>Semires,</hi> who heard all this, was no better <U+017F>atisfied with me then he was with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but ever <U+017F>ince he hath di<U+017F>continued his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, yet <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly as many think <hi>Stella</hi> to be the cau<U+017F>e, for <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed not to care for it, becau<U+017F>e the place of her affection was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with the new hopes <U+017F>he had of me, which was the cau<U+017F>e that I received many favours from her and which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> quickly perceived. But Love which alwaies will tryumph over freind<U+017F>hip, did keep me from <U+017F>peaking unto him, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould offend the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e: and though he was much offended that I <U+017F>hould thus conceale my my <U+017F>elfe from him, yet I never did <U+017F>peak unto him without <hi>Stella's</hi> leave, who al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eemed de<U+017F>irous it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o. But I who then was ignorant of her tricks, and <U+017F>trived at nothing but how to content her, one night when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and I were together, I had this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) that I have not <U+017F>o clearly opened my <U+017F>elf unto you, as our freind<U+017F>hip required; but now you mu<U+017F>t help me out, or el<U+017F>e I am undon: I (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ly<U+017F>is)</hi> why you may be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that I will never faile the part of a friend, though your mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of me might alter the ca<U+017F>e: and yet do not think but I do know of your Love<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but your <U+017F>ilence <U+017F>o offended me, that I <U+017F>aid nothing of it: Since you did know it, replied I, and never <U+017F>poke to me of it, I have the greater cau<U+017F>e to be offended: for I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I have <U+017F>omthing failed in point of freind<U+017F>hip by my <U+017F>ilence: but you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider that a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not him<U+017F>elfe, and his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is an excu<U+017F>e for all his errours: but you who are not troubled with the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, you have no excu<U+017F>e for your failings in point of freind<U+017F>hip. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing my rea<U+017F>ons, began to <U+017F>mile and <U+017F>aid. You are very plea<U+017F>ant <hi>Corilas,</hi> and I will not contradict you, but I pray you tell me, how I may make amends for my fault: In doing that for me, <U+017F>aid I, which you could not: for your <U+017F>elf, which is that I may obtain the affection of <hi>Stella:</hi>
Oh heavens (cryed out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> then) unto what a dangerous preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice have you brought your <U+017F>elf: Shun it, <hi>Corilas,</hi> <U+017F>hun it, for it is a mo<U+017F>t dangerous pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, which ruines all tho<U+017F>e which ever took it: I <U+017F>peak unto you by experience; you know it, I know, that from any other, your merits can obtaine more then mine; but it is gro<U+017F><U+017F>e folly to hope for any thing from this perfidious woman, whom neither vertue nor rea<U+017F>on will move; to which I an<U+017F>wered that to hear him <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, was no <U+017F>mal contentment: for, <U+017F>aid I, until now I was afraid you had retained <U+017F>ome thoughts for your <U+017F>elf, &amp; therefore I was <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erved but <U+017F>ince, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g>ks be to the fates, it is not <U+017F>o, I wil in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s put you to the tryal of friend<U+017F>hip: I know that the hatred which <U+017F>ucceeds Love is alwaies mea<U+017F>ured according to the grandure of its predece<U+017F><U+017F>or: and that you once loving this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e: and now comming to hate her your hatred will be far greater then if you had never loved her: Yet under<U+017F>tanding from <hi>Stella</hi> her <U+017F>elf, that I can never arrive at my de<U+017F>ires but by your meanes, I do conjure you <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> by our friend<U+017F>hip to aide me, either by advi<U+017F>ing or <U+017F>peaking for me or any other way. I will take it as a mo<U+017F>t extream proof of your fidelity. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this de<U+017F>ire, expecting any other prayer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g> me then this; by which, be<U+017F>ides his di<U+017F>like from this of

<U+017F>peaking unto <hi>Stella,</hi> he had lo<U+017F>t a freind whom he loved mo<U+017F>t. Yet he an<U+017F>wered thus unto me; <hi>Corilas,</hi> I will do as you de<U+017F>ire, you can expect no more from me: but <U+017F>till remember that in me<U+017F><U+017F>ages of Love <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hould be imployed as are not hated. Thus poor <hi>Li<U+017F>is</hi> in lieu of a lover became a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of Love: a difficultie which his affection to me made him undertake, and he had full intentions to <U+017F>erve me, though afterwards he changed his mind; but the violence of his Love mu<U+017F>t plead his excu<U+017F>e, for Love hath a mo<U+017F>t predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power over men: and truly his affection to me is to be both commended and admired, <U+017F>ince he was once willing to part from her he loved to let me enjoy her. One day watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opportunitie of <U+017F>peaking unto her, he found her at home by her<U+017F>elf, none being by to interrupt their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: then calling to memorie the affronts he formerly had received he <U+017F>o armed him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t her charmes, as Love at this time could have no hope of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And though the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>tudied alwaies to tryumph over him, yet he did <U+017F>o oppo<U+017F>e his <U+017F>pleen again<U+017F>t her and his freind<U+017F>hip to me, that at this combate he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer Before he began to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>he went to meet him, and pumped for <U+017F>ome of her affected language; What new happyne<U+017F><U+017F>e is this, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that hath brought back my long'd for <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is</hi> to me?

For my part, I mu<U+017F>t beleeve you are; for none of your humours are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne unto me: but I came to <U+017F>ee and ask how many adorers: you have, and whether you did not <U+017F>ay and prote<U+017F>t and <U+017F>wear unto them, that none <U+017F>hould ever be deceived by you; for if you did, certainly they are in my predicament and rank. The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did not expect the<U+017F>e reproaches yet <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered him, and thus. Shepheard, though you came only with de<U+017F>ignes to wrong me, yet I give you thanks for the vi<U+017F>it, and confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that you have rea<U+017F>on to complaine again<U+017F>t me. I complaine (an<U+017F>wered he)? no I pray you let that alone; I will neither wrong you nor complain again<U+017F>t you: but am <U+017F>o farre from it, that I will rather commend your humour: for had you <U+017F>eemed to love me any longer, I had been longer delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And I pray God, the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your Love bring me no more hurt then it doth <U+017F>orrow, you <U+017F>hall never heare that I complain of you: for injurie and truth cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t together, no more then you &amp; fidelity: can but take this for a mo<U+017F>t certain truth, that you are the mo<U+017F>t deluding and ungrateful <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in all <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> Me thinks, di<U+017F>courteous <U+017F>hepheard, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Stella)</hi> that this language would become any other mouth better then yours. Then <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to addre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf in another dialect: Hitherto (<U+017F>aid he) I have borrowed my language from the ju<U+017F>t anger of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but now I will borrow it of one that hath more to do with you then <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hath; &amp; that is from a di<U+017F>creet <U+017F>hepheard who loves you, and who values nothing upon earth comparable to your favorable acceptance of him &amp; his <U+017F>ervices. She thinking that <hi>Li<U+017F>is</hi> mocked her, an<U+017F>wered him thus; Leave off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> it is enough that you once did Love me without any reviving of the memorie of your errors; 'Tis very true, <U+017F>aid the Shepheard, they were errors indeed that moved me to love you; out you erre as much as I did, if you think that I do love you now, or that I <U+017F>peak for my <U+017F>elfe: No, no I <U+017F>peak in behalfe of poor <hi>Corilas,</hi> who is <U+017F>o wholly your devoted, as nothing can draw him off: I told him how I had tried you, and what little a<U+017F><U+017F>urance there was to be found in your <U+017F>oul and words: I <U+017F>wore unto him, that you would certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and that I was <U+017F>ure you would keep me from being for<U+017F>worn: But, the poor, mi<U+017F>erable, loving thing, is <U+017F>o blinded, as he thinks, what I cannot obtain, his merits can; and yet to undeceive him, I told him, that merit was the greate<U+017F>t impediment to obtain any thing from you. And to the end you may believe what I <U+017F>ay, I pray read this Letter which he hath <U+017F>ent you. But becau<U+017F>e <hi>Stella</hi> would not read my Letter, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did open it, and read it aloud unto her.</p>

               <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had read this Letter, he went on with his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: Come <hi>Stella,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) what death mu<U+017F>t he die, or how mu<U+017F>t he live? For my part, I pitty him with all my heart, and wi<U+017F>h you could do the like. I pray con<U+017F>ider how bitter your deniall will be to him. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e did touch this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e to the quick, and <U+017F>eeing how far <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was from loving her, <U+017F>he interrupted him in this manner, Me thinks <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if <hi>Corilas</hi> were in <U+017F>uch a minde as this paper <U+017F>peaks him, he was very ill advi<U+017F>ed to employ you, <U+017F>ince your mediation is more like to procure him hatred then love, and you rather a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of war then peace. <hi>Stella,</hi> it's true, an<U+017F>wered he, he was very ill advi<U+017F>ed in his choice; but if he had <U+017F>hewed as much judgment in the re<U+017F>t of his actions, as in this, he would not have <U+017F>tood in need of your help; he has had tryall of your di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, he knowes what force your charmes have; and what friend could he have made choice of, without the danger of a competitor, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe, whom you hate even unto death? But, let us leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and pray tell me plainly and in good earne<U+017F>t, whether or no you will <U+017F>hew him any favour; for the truth is, I dare not return to him, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I carry a good an<U+017F>wer with me, unto which I do conjure you, both by his affection that now is, and mine that was: Unto this, the Shepheard added <U+017F>o many arguments, and importunate prayers, as the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e believed him to be in good earne<U+017F>t; and her own naturall di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition did ea<U+017F>ily encline her to it; for, it is the cu<U+017F>tome of <U+017F>uch as ea<U+017F>ily love, to believe as ea<U+017F>ily that they are loved but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> at this time could obtain no further from her, then that the affection of his cou<U+017F>in for want of his, <U+017F>hould not be di<U+017F>agreeable unto her; but time <U+017F>hould advi<U+017F>e her farther. And <U+017F>ince this, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> has <U+017F>everall waies <U+017F>o <U+017F>olici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, that he got from her as much a<U+017F><U+017F>urance as he de<U+017F>ired; and becau<U+017F>e he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her levitie, he obtained from her a promi<U+017F>e in writing under her hand, and knew <U+017F>o well how to turn her, that he obtained of her what<U+017F>oever he de<U+017F>ired. Thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me, and gave me an account of all he had done, except of this promi<U+017F>e: for, knowing <hi>Stella's</hi> humour, he alwaies doubted <U+017F>he would deceive him, and that if he <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me this paper, it would imbarque me the more, and be harder to get me off. All this was unknown unto <hi>Amintha,</hi> from whom <hi>Stella</hi> concealed it more, then from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After I had received <U+017F>o much a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, as I could de<U+017F>ire no more, and after I had given her all humble and hearty thanks, I began, by her permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to take orders for the marriage, and <U+017F>pake it very freely and openly, though <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> alwaies foretold me, that in the end I <U+017F>hould be deceived. But, the very <U+017F>hadow of that good which we de<U+017F>ire does <U+017F>o flatter us, that we lend but a deaf ear unto any that <U+017F>hall tell us the contrary. Whil<U+017F>t this Marriage was preparing, and publickly divulged, <hi>Semires,</hi> who, as I told you, di<U+017F>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and me, he being netled with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which went of him, re<U+017F>olved, at what rate <U+017F>oever, to infinuate him<U+017F>elfe into her favour, with a de<U+017F>igne to quit her afterwards, and make it appear, that this <U+017F>eparation proceeded from him<U+017F>elfe: There needed no great artifice to bring this about, for her <U+017F>ickle humour, according to its fleeting temper, did at the very fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, quit me for <hi>Semires</hi> as a little before <U+017F>he had quitted <hi>Semires</hi> for me: But for all that, the promi<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he had given under her hand, and which <U+017F>he could not deny, did exceedingly <U+017F>tick in her <U+017F>tomack. At la<U+017F>t, the Marriage day being come, and I had a<U+017F><U+017F>embled together all my Parents, my Friends, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I held my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure, as I thought upon nothing but bidding them welcome. But <U+017F>he, who<U+017F>e thoughts were quite another away, when we came to the very point of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tarted back, and formed excu<U+017F>es far wor<U+017F>e then her fir<U+017F>t; at which I was <U+017F>o extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, that I went away without ever bidding her adieu; and ever <U+017F>ince I held her in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>dain, that <U+017F>he could never infinuate her <U+017F>elfe again into my e<U+017F>teem.</p>
               <p>Judge (reverend Father) whether or no I had good rea<U+017F>on to hearken to her, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>peak in my di<U+017F>advantage be not wrongly informed. Truly, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>he is a woman that is unworthy of her name; and I do wonder, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded <U+017F>o many, that any man will ever tru<U+017F>t her. Nay Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> I have not yet told
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53526:41"/>
you all; for after every one was fallen from her except <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> all her artifice was, how to get the promi<U+017F>e which he had out of his hands, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, that it was a great thorn in her <U+017F>ide: Therefore with an impudent and di<U+017F><U+017F>embling brow, <U+017F>he thus <U+017F>poke unto him, Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you <U+017F>hould have lo<U+017F>t all that affection which you have <U+017F>o often vowed unto me? Is there no <U+017F>park of love yet left in you? In me, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Ly<U+017F>is)?</hi> no, I'le <U+017F>ooner die. Upon this word, he went out of the hou<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>he followed him <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he got hold of his hand, and holding it between hers, <U+017F>he brought him back in <U+017F>uch an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous po<U+017F>ture, as any would have judged them to be very loving; and though he knew her deluding humour well enough, yet could he not chu<U+017F>e but be plea<U+017F>ed with her flatteries, although he gave no faith unto them; and therefore thus <U+017F>aid unto her, Oh heavens, <hi>Stella!</hi> why do you <U+017F>o abu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e favours, which the heavens have <U+017F>o prodigally be<U+017F>towed upon you? Did but that fair body contain a <U+017F>oul that had any neer re<U+017F>emblance unto it, who could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t it? She who knew well enough what charms were in her carre<U+017F><U+017F>es, did u<U+017F>e all the artifice of her eyes mouth, tongue, and all the invention <U+017F>he had to make him melt, in<U+017F>omuch as he was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elfe; And at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he came out with the<U+017F>e words, Lovely Shepheard, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if you be the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> who was once <U+017F>o <U+017F>weetly affectionate unto me; I be<U+017F>eech you hearken unto the<U+017F>e words, and believe them: and if you do finde any cau<U+017F>e of complaint, I will make it evidently appear, that this which you e<U+017F>teem as a <U+017F>econd fault, was committed only as a remedy for the fir<U+017F>t, which I will repair with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible and de<U+017F>irable <U+017F>atisfaction. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>mooth words wrought upon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; yet, not to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>imply weak, he an<U+017F>wered thus: <hi>Stella,</hi> I am <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of all you <U+017F>ay, as I believe not a <U+017F>yllable; and if I knew any thing which would di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, I would do it. If you would di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, <U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, then come into the hou<U+017F>e. With that intention, I will, (an<U+017F>wered he). Thus when they were entred into the hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>tood neer the fire, <U+017F>he began thus; Now Shepheard, will I unmask the Riddle of all my di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations with you, and make it mo<U+017F>t apparent, that poor <hi>Stella,</hi> whom you have accounted <U+017F>uch a leight huswife, is much more con<U+017F>tant then you imagine her, and will let you plainly <U+017F>ee, that in <U+017F>atisfaction of tho<U+017F>e wrongs you have done me, that you have rea<U+017F>on to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e them, and be <U+017F>orry: But, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, upon a <U+017F>uddain, what have you done with that promi<U+017F>e which once you had of me, in favour of <hi>Corilas?</hi> for, if you have given it unto him, it will extreamly cro<U+017F><U+017F>e our de<U+017F>ignes. Who could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly imagine, but that after all this, <U+017F>he had loved <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> So this Shepheard having an opinion, that <U+017F>he would do that for him, which <U+017F>he had refu<U+017F>ed me, he re<U+017F>tored back unto her that promi<U+017F>e, which he had <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely kept from me. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw it, <U+017F>he took it, and tore it all in pieces then threw it into the fire: Afterwards, turning towards <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> &amp; laughing, <U+017F>he thus <U+017F>aid unto him, Hone<U+017F>t Shepheard, you may now be gon when you plea<U+017F>e, I know none that will hinder you, and it is very late. Oh heavens! (cryed out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe over-reached) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, as to be gulled three times by one and the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on?

Oh! mo<U+017F>t perfidious woman, (<U+017F>aid he) did you not tell me, that you would make it appear, that your <U+017F>econd fault was committed, only to give <U+017F>atisfaction for the fir<U+017F>t? and to <U+017F>hew me that you were con<U+017F>tant, you would di<U+017F>cover your very heart and intentions to me?
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you are <U+017F>till harping upon the wrong <U+017F>tring; pray tell me, wherein have I wronged you, if I did never love you, am I not con<U+017F>tant, in not loving you <U+017F>till? And do I not di<U+017F>cover my heart and intentions to you, <U+017F>ince now I have gotten that from you which I de<U+017F>ired, I give you free libertie to go home in peace? Could you think that all my words which I have given you for this houre together, tended to any other purpo<U+017F>e, but to get this paper from you? and now I have it, I will bid you good-night, good <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> You may imagine what cre<U+017F>tfallen Shepheard <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was, when he heard all this; he was <U+017F>o damped, that he <U+017F>neaked away, and never gave one word. But <U+017F>ince this, <hi>Semires</hi> revenged all our quarrells, and he who, as I told you was the cau<U+017F>e of my mi<U+017F>ery, or indeed, my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e (for <U+017F>o may my <U+017F>eparation from her be called) he, I <U+017F>ay, re<U+017F>enting <U+017F>till the fir<U+017F>t affront which <U+017F>he put upon him, and con<U+017F>idering her extream levity, as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and I were <U+017F>erved, <U+017F>o <U+017F>erved he her, and broke off the Marriage with her in the mid<U+017F>t of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which gave many an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ay, That often <U+017F>he who hurts another, receives her puni<U+017F>hment by the <U+017F>ame armes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Corilas</hi> concluded: and <hi>Adamas</hi> in a <U+017F>miling manner <U+017F>aid thus unto him, The be<U+017F>t coun<U+017F>ell I can give you is to fly this deluder; to beware of her fallacies, and to plea<U+017F>e your Parents who do <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee you married. When any good match is offered take

it, and never in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon the circum<U+017F>tances of Love; for nothing will <U+017F>ooner wa<U+017F>h off the<U+017F>e i<U+017F>tains which this giddy woman has ca<U+017F>t upon your honour, nor <U+017F>ooner purcha<U+017F>e e<U+017F>teem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t your neighbours, then to marry your <U+017F>elf not by Love but by Rea<U+017F>on: for that is the greate<U+017F>t action of your life; Upon which depends all the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e or mi<U+017F>ery of man. Upon the<U+017F>e words they parted towards their <U+017F>everall homes, for it began to be late.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Leonida</hi> not finding <hi>Adamas</hi> at home, <U+017F>he went away again as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he had dined: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay all that night, with tho<U+017F>e fair <U+017F>hephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een the day before, out of a de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>he had to be more intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, <U+017F>he went to the place where <U+017F>he found them before; and there <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied one a farre off, but could not di<U+017F>cerne who it was: yet drawing neere <U+017F>he perceived it to be the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>he looked for. She might very well e<U+017F>teem this as a happy meeting: for all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, as chance was, were come out of the Town purpo<U+017F>ely to pa<U+017F>s away all the re<U+017F>t of the day together, to the end they might more freeely impart their <U+017F>ecrets unto each other out of the reach of all eares. So as <hi>Leonida</hi> could never have come in a more opportune time to <U+017F>atisfie her curo<U+017F>itie, then <U+017F>he did: and <U+017F>tealing neer them <U+017F>he heard <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>ay unto <hi>Diana;</hi> Now wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e I hope you will performe your promi<U+017F>e unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and me, in acquainting us with your <U+017F>tory, <U+017F>ince we have imparted ours unto you.</p>

If it be not one (replied <hi>Diana),</hi> yet it is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hadow of one, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>emblant as one is oft taken for the other.

The Love I beare unto you both (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana)</hi> may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that I cannot make a wrong judgement of you: and I dare tru<U+017F>t you with my very <U+017F>oul: But <U+017F>hould I impart my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o freely unto <U+017F>ome, I <U+017F>hould find my actions meet with a wrong con<U+017F>truction: And therefore <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure and command, that I <U+017F>hould relate my life unto you, I do conjure you both, by all the <U+017F>acred Lawes of friend<U+017F>hip, never to <U+017F>peak of it again.

I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe, that though you have never <U+017F>eene either <hi>Celion</hi> or <hi>Belinda,</hi> yet you have heard that they were my Father and Mother; and perhaps have heard of the cro<U+017F><U+017F>es which they met withall for the Love of one another, which <U+017F>hall <U+017F>pare me the relating of them, though they were pre<U+017F>ages of my en<U+017F>uing mi<U+017F>eries. And be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that after the heats of Love were a little cool'd by marriage, to the end they might not be idle, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look narrowly into the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of their e<U+017F>tate, and had envolved them<U+017F>elves into <U+017F>o many <U+017F>uites of Law, as they were forced to compo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of them, by mediation of friends. Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, a neighbour of theirs called <hi>Phormion,</hi> did <U+017F>o trouble them, that to <U+017F>top all tho<U+017F>e gaps, their friends advi<U+017F>ed them to make <U+017F>ome alliance with him: and becau<U+017F>e neither of them had any children (neither having been long married) they both <U+017F>wore by <hi>Theutates</hi> upon the Altar of <hi>Belinus,</hi> that if they had but one Son and one Dauyhter, they <U+017F>hould Marry together: and this promi<U+017F>e was confirmed by <U+017F>o many <U+017F>acred oathes, as he who broke them was the mo<U+017F>t perjured man in the world. A little after, my Father had a Son, who peri<U+017F>hed when the Goths and O<U+017F>trogoths did ravage this Province. A little after that, I was born, but in <U+017F>uch an unhappy houre for me, that my Father never <U+017F>aw me, he dying before I was born. <hi>Phormion,</hi> <U+017F>eeing my Father dead, and my Brother lo<U+017F>t, (for

tho<U+017F>e barbarians, took him away, and either killed him, or let him <U+017F>tarve for want) and that my Uncle <hi>Diamis</hi> was gone away in di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure at this lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, he re<U+017F>olved if he had a Son, to accompli<U+017F>h their former promi<U+017F>e. It happened a little after, that his wife was brought to bed, but it was of a Daughter, and fearing le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould have no more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his wife, he cau<U+017F>ed it to be rumored, that it was a Son, and carried it <U+017F>o cunningly that none knew the contrary. And it was the more ea<U+017F>ie to be don, becau<U+017F>e none believed that he would u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch tricks: al<U+017F>o, the better to colour the matter, he cau<U+017F>ed her to be named <hi>Philidas.</hi> Whom, when <U+017F>he was grown to an age of practi<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch excerci<U+017F>es as young <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards u<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was not ill at them. <hi>Phormions</hi> de<U+017F>igne was, that <U+017F>eeing me without Father, Brother and Uncle, to make him<U+017F>elf Ma<U+017F>ter of my e<U+017F>tate, by this di<U+017F><U+017F>embled marriage: and when <hi>Philidas</hi> and I were growen bigger, then to marry me unto one of his Nephews whom he loved very well: and truly he was not fru<U+017F>trated in his de<U+017F>igne: for <hi>Belinda</hi> was too reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to be wanting in any duty to her husband.

This young <U+017F>hepheard did <U+017F>o take this de<U+017F>igne to heart, as he neglected no manner of court<U+017F>hip and complacency towards me.

Things being upon the<U+017F>e tearms, <hi>Phormion</hi> fel <U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>ick, and was <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon <U+017F>tuffed with a cattarh that he could neither <U+017F>peak, nor give any order either about his own bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e or mine. <hi>Philidas</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t was a little troubled; but afterwards <U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he was ab<U+017F>olute Mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elf and me al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to keep up this authority, con<U+017F>idering that the libertie which the name of Man doth carry with it, was much more plea<U+017F>ing then the <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of our <U+017F>ex. Nor was <U+017F>he in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of that wonder which would be over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould declare her <U+017F>elfe to be a woman: upon the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>he continued in the <U+017F>ame name and notion, which <U+017F>he did when her Father was alive; and fearing more then ever, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover what <U+017F>he was, <U+017F>he kept me <U+017F>o neer her, as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never without me. But, Fair <U+017F>hphearde<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>ince you mu<U+017F>t know all my young fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. I mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t begge your excu<U+017F>es, and that you will know, I had <U+017F>o great an inclination to Love, another way: but that my heart was <U+017F>o hardned again<U+017F>t <hi>Philadis</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> as love had not armes or arrowes <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>harpe enough to peirce <U+017F>o much as my skin. But alas, it was the <U+017F>hepheard <hi>Filander,</hi> who had my heart; <hi>Filander</hi> who having given me <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urance of his love, and now not being, has carried with him all that was mine; <U+017F>urely (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and interrupted her) either <hi>Filanders</hi> affection was very little, or el<U+017F>e you did carry it with a great deale of prudence<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for I never <U+017F>o much as heard of it. Which is a thing very <U+017F>trang. That it was not talked of, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> I am more obliged unto your good intentions then our prudence. And as for the affection of this <U+017F>hepheard, you may judge what it was, by my en<U+017F>uing di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. And the heavens, who know our pure and cleere intentions, had a mind to favour them. The fir<U+017F>t time I ever <U+017F>aw him, was upon that day which we celebrated unto <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> when he came into tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ports in the company of a Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>o extreamly like him that the eies of all the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly were upon them. And becau<U+017F>e he was neerely allyed unto my dear friend <hi>Daphnis,</hi> as <U+017F>oone as I <U+017F>aw her, I did <U+017F>o imbrace and carre<U+017F><U+017F>e her as ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf obliged to love me; Her name was <hi>Callirea,</hi> and was married unto a <U+017F>hepheard called <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had never <U+017F>een untill the very day <U+017F>he married him, which was a rea<U+017F>on why there was but a very flender affection between them. My complacence to the Si<U+017F>ter gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion

unto the Brother to <U+017F>tand by me, as long as the <U+017F>acrifice la<U+017F>ted; and I cannot tell, whether to his good or bad fortune, but I had that day dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed up my <U+017F>elfe in my be<U+017F>t trim, conceiving that my very name upon this fea<U+017F>t, did more particularly oblige me to it, then any other. And he, being a <U+017F>tranger, and having no other acquaintance among<U+017F>t the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, than <U+017F>uch as his Si<U+017F>ter brought him, did not leave us all that day: So as, I conceiving my <U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged to entertain him, I did what I could to plea<U+017F>e him, and my labour was not lo<U+017F>t; for, from that time, this poor Shepheard did begin <U+017F>uch affection to me as did not end till he died: And I am mo<U+017F>t confident, that if the dead have any remembrance of the living, he loves me <U+017F>till; and in his a<U+017F>hes pre<U+017F>erves that pure affection which he vowed unto me. <hi>Daphnis</hi> took notice of this, the very <U+017F>ame day, and at night told me of it; but I did <U+017F>o long reject any <U+017F>uch thoughts, as <U+017F>he was forced to <U+017F>ay thus unto me. I <U+017F>ee, <hi>Diana,</hi> you will not believe me; but, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that <hi>Filander</hi> does extreamly love you.

This young Shepheard knew of <hi>Amindor's</hi> humour, and love had taught him <U+017F>o much curio<U+017F>ity, as to finde out, that his jealou<U+017F>y was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than that of <hi>Philidas;</hi> and therefore he conceived, that the be<U+017F>t way to blinde both their

eyes, was, to court their friend<U+017F>hip: and Love had made him <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle and prudent, that in the carriage of the matter, he did not only deceive <hi>Amindor's,</hi> but almo<U+017F>t all eyes el<U+017F>e; for he would never come where we were, but <U+017F>uffered us alwaies to come unto him. 'Tis true, that crafty <hi>Daphnis</hi> did pre<U+017F>ently finde it out; for, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Amindor</hi> is not a man of <U+017F>uch agreeable parts, as to attract unto him <U+017F>uch a well accompli<U+017F>hed Shepheard as <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but there mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome farther reach in all <hi>Filanders</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to him; <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did prompt me to take the fir<U+017F>t notice of it, and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that his di<U+017F>cretion did <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>e me, that if I would <U+017F>uffer any to love me, it <U+017F>hould be him; but, the time was not yet come, that I could be wounded this way, although his actions and carriage did plea<U+017F>e me, and though I did in <U+017F>ome fore approve of his de<U+017F>igne. When we at any time took our leaves of him, he would alwaies wait upon us a long way; and at parting, I never heard <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of friend<U+017F>hip, as he u<U+017F>ed to <hi>Amindor;</hi> nor <U+017F>uch offers of <U+017F>ervice, as he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto <hi>Philidas:</hi> Then would <U+017F>lie <hi>Daphnis</hi> whi<U+017F>per me in the ear, and <U+017F>ay, All the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions are meant unto you, and you do him wrong if you do not an<U+017F>wer him. And when he thanked <hi>Amindor</hi> for any favour, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ay, Oh what a fool is he, to think, that the<U+017F>e offerings are intended to his Altar? And he <U+017F>o well knew how to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, that he <U+017F>erued him<U+017F>elfe into the very heart of <hi>Amindor:</hi> And <hi>Philidas</hi> was <U+017F>o tickled with his high commendations of her, as <U+017F>he would often <U+017F>end, to de<U+017F>ire him he would come &amp; <U+017F>ee her.

As fortune was, one day when <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I were walking under <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hady trees, and talked our <U+017F>elves almo<U+017F>t quite out of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, we heard a voice, which at the fir<U+017F>t we thought to be of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tranger; the de<U+017F>ire of knowing who it was, made us draw towards the place, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> going fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied <hi>Filander</hi> before me, and beckned unto me, that I <U+017F>hould tread gently; and when I was come neer her, <U+017F>he named <hi>Filander</hi> in a low voice, who was laid down, leaning his head again<U+017F>t a tree, and began thus, <hi>I <U+017F>hould defie and <U+017F>corn Love, and all his policies and charms, did he not make u<U+017F>e of my faire<U+017F>t</hi> Diana's <hi>armes again<U+017F>t me.</hi> And <U+017F>o went on.</p>
               <p>When I heard my <U+017F>elfe named, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I trembled, and trode upon the ground, as if a Serpent were under my feet; and without any longer <U+017F>tay, I went away as gently as I could, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een, though <hi>Daphnis,</hi> in hopes to make me come again, did let me go by my <U+017F>elfe: At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing I continued on my way <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o <U+017F>tole <U+017F>oftly off, and afterwards ran after me as fa<U+017F>t me as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could, and, when <U+017F>he could hardly draw her breath, <U+017F>he chid me in a very interrupted manner; but when <U+017F>he had recovered her wind and could <U+017F>peak plain, <U+017F>he thus <U+017F>aid unto me: As I live <hi>Diana,</hi> if the heavens do not puni<U+017F>h you, I <U+017F>hall think they are unju<U+017F>t: Could you be <U+017F>o cruell, as not <U+017F>o much as to lend him a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? What good could I do unto him, (<U+017F>aid I) by <U+017F>taying any longer there? You might have heard what hurt you have don him, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me. I do him hurt, an<U+017F>wered I? you do me wrong, in <U+017F>aying I could hurt one whom I never thought upon. Therein, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you hurt him mo<U+017F>t; for, did you ofter think upon him, you could not chu<U+017F>e but be moved unto pitty. I blu<U+017F>hed at that word, and the changing of my colour did make <hi>Daphnis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I was offended with her, and therefore in a <U+017F>miling manner, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me, I did but jea<U+017F>t, <hi>Diana,</hi> and do not believe he thought upon you; and as for u<U+017F>ing your name, I believe he meant <U+017F>ome other of the <U+017F>ame name that yours is. Thus we went on talking and walking we knew not whither, untill another path had brought us unto the <U+017F>ame place, where <hi>Filander</hi> was; and though I did it out of heedle<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet <hi>Daphnis</hi> perhaps did it out of de<U+017F>igne, however, I was forced to look upon him lying upon the ground, leaning his head upon his arme, and <U+017F>eeming as if he were awake; for he had a Letter before him, all wet with tears which trickled down his cheeks: but, indeed he was a<U+017F>leep and we were more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of it, when <hi>Daphnis,</hi> more con<U+017F>ident then I, <U+017F>tooped gently down, and brought me the Letter, all <U+017F>teeped in tears, which <U+017F>ight did much move me to pitty, and much more the Letter, which was thus written.</p>

Then, <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that I do pitty <hi>Filander</hi> with all my heart, for mo<U+017F>t certainly he loves you; and your own <U+017F>oul, I'me <U+017F>ure cannot deny it. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) let the faulty do the penance. If <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, then I'me <U+017F>ure that <hi>Filander</hi> mu<U+017F>t not: for, I cannot allow it any fault to love you, but, I believe, his fault had been much greater if he had not loved you; for fair ones were made only to be loved. I dare appeal unto your judgment, an<U+017F>wered I, whether I can pretend unto that title. But however, I do conjure you by our friend<U+017F>hip, not to let him under<U+017F>tand that I have any knowledge of his intention; and if you do love him, advi<U+017F>e him never to mention it unto me: For e<U+017F>teeming both him and <hi>Callirea</hi> his Si<U+017F>ter, as I do, I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry to bani<U+017F>h him our company, which, you know, I <U+017F>hould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto, if ever he <U+017F>peak of it unto me. How then would you have him to live, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me? I would have him live, replied I, as he did before he ever <U+017F>aw me. But that he cannot do, replied <U+017F>he, for then he was not <U+017F>corched with tho<U+017F>e flames which now do burn him. Then, <U+017F>aid I, let him <U+017F>eek <U+017F>ome remedy to quench tho<U+017F>e flames, without offending me. The fire is great, added <U+017F>he, and will not be quenched. Be the fire as great as it will, <U+017F>aid I, it will not burn him, if he will not come neer it. Although, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned u<U+017F>e to flie the fire; yet, if he do flie, he will carry his fire with him, and the pain too. In conclu<U+017F>ion I told her, that if it was <U+017F>o, then let him burn on, for I could not help him. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this we returned towards our flocks, and at night to our lodgings, where we found <hi>Filander</hi> <U+017F>o carre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by <hi>Philidas,</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> al<U+017F>o, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he had bewitched them, it not being their humours to u<U+017F>e others <U+017F>o. He <U+017F>tayed many daies among<U+017F>t us, and all that while, he made not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew of any thing unto me, but lived in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>creet manner, that had not <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I<U+017F>een, what we did, we had never entertained the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of his intention. At la<U+017F>t he was forced to depart, and not knowing what to re<U+017F>olve upon, he went unto his Si<U+017F>ters hou<U+017F>e, for he loved her, and had as great a confidence in her, as in him<U+017F>elfe. This Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I told you, was married by force, and had no other contentment, but in the friend<U+017F>hip of her Brother: As <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, after the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>alute, <U+017F>he was very inqui<U+017F>itive to know from whence he came: and he an<U+017F>wering, that he came from <hi>Philidas,</hi> <U+017F>he asked him how <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and I did: And he telling her al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>peaking very highly in my commendations; <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>pered him in the ear, and <U+017F>aid, I am afraid Brother, that you do love her better then you do me. He an<U+017F>wered, that indeed he did love me, as my merits did oblige him to do. Then I have gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed right, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for I know not a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the whole world, that is owner of more merit; and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that were I a man, I would, whether <U+017F>he would or no, devote my <U+017F>elfe her <U+017F>ervant. May I believe Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he, that you <U+017F>peak this in good earne<U+017F>t? Yes truly Brother, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I will <U+017F>wear it, by that which is mo<U+017F>t dear unto me. Then I do believe, replied he, that if you were a man, you would have a hard task in hand; for, I perceive her to be of an humour that is not ea<U+017F>ily bended: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> are <U+017F>o deadly jealous of her, as one or both of them are never out of her <U+017F>ight. Oh deare Brother (cryed <U+017F>he out) I plainly <U+017F>ee that you are taken, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>o preci<U+017F>ely ob<U+017F>erved the<U+017F>e particulars, I do be<U+017F>eech you conceal it no longer from me: for Love, if it be a fault is very pardonable: and <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o importunate, that, after a thou<U+017F>and prote<U+017F>tations and <U+017F>uplications never to impart it, he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed it unto her, and in <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as <U+017F>he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly doubt it. And when <U+017F>he asked him how I received this declaration? Oh heavens, <U+017F>aid he unto her, did you but know her humour you would <U+017F>ay that never any did undertake a more difficult peece of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. All
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53526:45"/>
that I have done hitherto, is to blind the eyes of <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor,</hi> making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is none in the world more theirs then I am; and I have <U+017F>o well thriven in my de<U+017F>igne upon them, as they were never well but when I was with them: then he made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages unto her. But <U+017F>aid he, though I did intend to di<U+017F>cover unto <hi>Diana,</hi> how much I was hers, yet <U+017F>uch an awing power <U+017F>he had over me, as I never dur<U+017F>t, and I am afraid I never <U+017F>hall, only unle<U+017F><U+017F>e a long continued practi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould embolden me, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e it cannot be, but <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> will take notice of it: So as, deare Si<U+017F>ter, to tell you my condition, it is to tell you, that I am the very next dore unto de<U+017F>pair. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirea</hi> who loved her Brother above all the world, was <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his pain, that after <U+017F>he had a while thought upon it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him. Brother, will yoube plea<U+017F>ed to let me contribute my good will towards your <U+017F>atisfaction, and render you a te<U+017F>timonie of my forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>erve you? Dear Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered he, though in this or any other bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I make no doubt of your good will: yet I am afraid of the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e; how ever I <U+017F>hall entertaine any thing which comes from you.</p>
               <p>Then Brother, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will go this way to work; you know what a re<U+017F>emblance there is between our faces, our <U+017F>tatures, and our <U+017F>peech, and were it not for a difference in habit, even tho<U+017F>e that are continually with us, will take the one for the other: Now <U+017F>ince the be<U+017F>t way to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e your de<U+017F>ign, is to keep about <hi>Diana</hi> without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, can a more ea<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>ecret way be devi<U+017F>ed, then for you to be taken for a woman? So may you keep <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> company without giving the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of jealou<U+017F>ie unto <hi>Philidas,</hi> and I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan</hi> in your habit unto whom I will make an excu<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ay that <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> kept you with them by force. All the difficulty will be to get his leave to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which I doubt will be very hardly obtained. Dear Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Filander,</hi> I never made any doubt of your wit or dearne<U+017F>s to me; and now I find you to be the be<U+017F>t Si<U+017F>ter that ever man had, <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to take this paines upon you, which I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you to do, and know, that it is the only way that can keep a Brother alive who loves you above him<U+017F>elfe. Then did he imbrace her with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible acknowledgments of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made her more willing to <U+017F>erve him then before: at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Sweet Brother let us leave words to them that love le<U+017F><U+017F>e, and let us think how to put our bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e into action. I hope, <U+017F>aid he, it will ea<U+017F>ily be effected, if you can but obtain your Husbands leave, which I hope will al<U+017F>o be effected, if you pretend that your journey is only with intentions to bring the match about, betwixt <hi>Amindor</hi> and his Neece, which he does very much de<U+017F>ire, and telling him that you make no doubt, but that you with the help of <hi>Daphnis</hi> <U+017F>hall in time bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. But what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall we take with our hair? for yours is too long, and mine too <U+017F>hort, and therefore I doubt will much trouble us: Never take care for that, <U+017F>aid I unto him: for yours is long enough to be dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed up like mine; and I will circumci<U+017F>e mine into your cut. But, dear Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he unto her, will it not grieve you to part <U+017F>o with your hair? No Brother, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, there is nothing <U+017F>o dear unto me, which I would not part with to procure your contentment, though it were my very skin. At this word he imbraced her, and told her that next unto god <U+017F>he would be his great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer from his torments. Then <hi>Filander,</hi> to lo<U+017F>e no time, tooke the fir<U+017F>t opportunitie that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it <U+017F>elfe, of talking with <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> repre<U+017F>enting unto him the advantage and fea<U+017F>ibilitie of bringing this match about: and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Filander</hi> de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>o much time as to let his hair grow a little longer, he pretended a journey about the di<U+017F>patch of <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and would <U+017F>hortly return. But <hi>Philidas</hi> no <U+017F>ooner heard of <hi>Philanders</hi> return, than <U+017F>he went to vi<U+017F>it him accompanied only with <hi>Amindor,</hi> and would not part with him before they brought him unto us, where he <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>eaven or eight dayes and was not any bolder to declare him<U+017F>elfe unto me than at the fir<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>During which time, to <U+017F>hew how hard a thing it is to con<U+017F>train nature long; although <hi>Philidas</hi> did counterfeit the Man as well as <U+017F>he could for her life, yet was <U+017F>he forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of a woman: and the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es and merits of <hi>Filander</hi> wrought <U+017F>uch effects in her, as he de<U+017F>ired they had wrought in me.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor <hi>Philidas</hi> was <U+017F>o much be<U+017F>ides her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he could not live out of <hi>Filanders</hi> fight, and did apply her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o unto him, as did amaze him, and had not his de<U+017F>ires of being neer me re<U+017F>trayned him, he would never have endured that kind of life. At la<U+017F>t when he thought his hair was rea<U+017F>onably well grown, he returned to <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> and told him that he had already broken the Ice of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, but <hi>Daphnis,</hi> did think it expedient to <U+017F>ee his Neece before <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and likewi<U+017F>e that <hi>Amindor</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aw her, and therefore <U+017F>he thought the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e was to let <hi>Callirea</hi> carry her thither, and <U+017F>he to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53526:45"/>
<U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe as complai<U+017F>ant as <U+017F>he could unto <hi>Amindor</hi> and the re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan</hi> who de<U+017F>ired nothing more then to be rid of his Neece did hearken unto this propo<U+017F>ition with a very willing eare and did peremptorily command his wife to make her <U+017F>elf ready for the voyage, who to make him more eager upon it, did <U+017F>eem to be a little unwilling, and <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignes of <U+017F>orrow to part from her Husband, <U+017F>aying that <U+017F>uch bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e as this, might be wel enough effected without her, and that it would take up a great deale of time, which might better be <U+017F>pent in her hou<U+017F>hould affaires. But <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan</hi> who would have her will to yeeld to his in all things, was <U+017F>o extreamly hot upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that three dayes after, <U+017F>he departed with her Brother and her Neece. The fir<U+017F>t dayes Jorney was to <hi>Filanders,</hi> where they changed habits, which <U+017F>o well fitted each other, that even tho<U+017F>e in their company could not perceive the change: And I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was deceived as wel as they, and found no manner of difference betwixt them. But well might I be deceived, when <hi>Philidas</hi> was, who looked upon him with the eyes of Love, which they <U+017F>ay are more ob<U+017F>ervant then all the eyes of <hi>Linx:</hi> for as <U+017F>oon as they came, <U+017F>he left the faign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Callirea,</hi> I mean <hi>Filander,</hi> and carried the true into a chamber to re<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf. All the way as they came, <hi>Filander</hi> in<U+017F>tructed his Si<U+017F>ter in all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould find the per<U+017F>ons with whom <U+017F>he was to tran<U+017F>act; now though <hi>Callirea</hi> was re<U+017F>olved to undergo all difficulties, for her Brothers contentment: yet thinking <hi>Philidas</hi> to be a man, it went much again<U+017F>t the hair of her mind to talk with her. As for us, when <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I were retired, we treated <hi>Filander</hi> with all the civilities that are u<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t women, I mean, <U+017F>uch as either amitie or privacie requires, which that <U+017F>hepheard did receive with much Jollitie; and as he hath <U+017F>ince <U+017F>worn to me, he was almo<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>ported be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elfe. Had I not been a meer child in matter of ob<U+017F>ervation, certainly his actions and behaviour would have di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him unto me: but the truth was, <U+017F>hee did counterfeit the matter <U+017F>o exceeding well, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> was deceived as well as I: while we retired into our chambers after <U+017F>upper <hi>Callirea</hi> and <hi>Philidas</hi> did walk into the chamber. I know not what their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was, but ours was nothing but a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of amitie and cordiall expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of affection, which <hi>Filander</hi> u<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate way as it was ea<U+017F>ie to judge, that though <U+017F>he would have <U+017F>aid nothing, yet he could not be blamed for want of any good wil, but for the want of boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>For my part I was extreamly free in my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions al<U+017F>o; for beleeving him to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I thought my <U+017F>elfe to be obliged unto it, by his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of good will to me, by his merits, and by the kindred of her and <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this time, <hi>Amindor,</hi> who before bore me much good will, began to change his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; to love the faigned <hi>Callirea:</hi> And <hi>Filander</hi> fearing his demeans would not plea<U+017F>e this young man, did <U+017F>trive as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to comply with him: and the fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour of <hi>Amindor,</hi> would not let him receive <U+017F>uch favours, without being in Love. Which I do not at all think <U+017F>trange: For the beauty, the judgement, and deportment of <hi>Filander</hi> was <U+017F>uch, as that he came nothing <U+017F>hort in the perfections of a woman, <U+017F>o as he might well delude any man.</p>
               <p>Ob<U+017F>erve what a wanton Love is; and how he <U+017F>ports and <U+017F>pends his time! He made <hi>Philidas</hi> who was a woman to love a woman, and <hi>Amindor</hi> who was a man to love a man, and that <U+017F>o extream pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionatly that this very particular was <U+017F>ubject enough to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e of. <hi>Filander</hi> he knew how to play the woman mo<U+017F>t admirably; and <hi>Callirea</hi> did <U+017F>o well counterfeit her Brother, and neither of them wanted prudence to carry out the matter.</p>
               <p>That cold demeanure which <hi>Callirea</hi> <U+017F>hewed unto me, removed all cau<U+017F>es of jealou<U+017F>ie out of <hi>Philidas,</hi> and be<U+017F>ides <hi>Philidas</hi> did love her; and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o fall off from <hi>Philidas,</hi> from <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and from me, we had an opinion, that <hi>Filanders</hi> mind was changed: at which I much rejoyced, by rea<U+017F>on of the amity I bore unto his Si<U+017F>ter. Seaven or eight dayes were thus <U+017F>pent, and none did think them one jot too long; for, every one of us had a particular de<U+017F>igne. But <hi>Callirea,</hi> who feared, le<U+017F>t her Husband <U+017F>hould be angry at this long <U+017F>tay, did <U+017F>olicit her Brother to make known his de<U+017F>ign unto me, telling him, that it was not likely I <U+017F>hould refu<U+017F>e his <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>ince he bad been <U+017F>o fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with me: But for all that, he had not yet the confidence to declare him<U+017F>elfe: Yet, to delude <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> he de<U+017F>ired her to go unto her Husband in that dre<U+017F><U+017F>e wherein <U+017F>he was, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her, that he could not finde any difference between them; and to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand that by the advice of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> <U+017F>he had left <hi>Callirea</hi> with <hi>Philidas,</hi> to treat with <hi>Amindor</hi> about the marriage of his Niece.</p>

This propo<U+017F>ition at the fir<U+017F>t did a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h his Si<U+017F>ter; for, her Husband was a piece of angry fle<U+017F>h, and the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t would move him unto pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. At the la<U+017F>t, her de<U+017F>ires to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her Brother in every thing, did move her to yield unto the motion: And to render this excu<U+017F>e more colourable, they did <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Daphnis</hi> concerning <hi>Amindors</hi> marriage, which, for divers con<U+017F>iderations, <U+017F>he rejected; but, knowing that this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e was their pretence, under which they got leave to come this journey, and without which they never had obtained it; <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who was well plea<U+017F>ed with their company, did communicate the matter unto me; and we all agreed, that the be<U+017F>t way was, to <U+017F>eem, as if the project were fea<U+017F>ible: And in order to that, <hi>Daphnis</hi> did write unto <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> advi<U+017F>ing him to let his Wife to <U+017F>tay a little longer among<U+017F>t us, the better to effect the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that <U+017F>he hoped all things would be brought to a happy i<U+017F><U+017F>ue.</p>
               <p>Upon this Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ie, and thus clad, <hi>Callirea</hi> went unto her Husband, who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled by her dre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as well as the re<U+017F>t, he took her for her Brother, and liked the cau<U+017F>e of his wifes <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o well, that he willingly con<U+017F>ented unto the motion upon tho<U+017F>e termes. Judge, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, whether I might not well be deceived, <U+017F>ince her own Husband was, and could not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Filanders</hi> affection grew to that height, that he could no longer conceal it, do what he could; and therefore he told me, that though he was a woman, yet he could not chu<U+017F>e, but be extreamly in love with me, and <U+017F>hould be much more, were he a man; and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o very pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, that <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who loved me very well, did <U+017F>ay, that untill then, <U+017F>he never knew it; but that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe was al<U+017F>o in love me: which was no <U+017F>tranger, then that <hi>Philidas</hi> <U+017F>hould love <hi>Filander.</hi> And this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Callirea</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted, that the chiefe rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he did con<U+017F>train her Brother to go, was this match which was propounded; for which many <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>ons were <U+017F>hewed me, that I ea<U+017F>ily believed it to be <U+017F>o. Being thus <U+017F>atisfied with this excu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion unto me, without any difficulty, but <U+017F>till as a woman and vowing unto me, that the very <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>entments and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions which u<U+017F>e to be in men that were in love, were in her, and that it was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olation unto her to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e them.</p>
               <p>Twelve or fifteen daies thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, with <U+017F>o much delighting <U+017F>atisfaction unto <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as he hath <U+017F>ince <U+017F>worn unto me, that he never <U+017F>pent his daies more happily, although his de<U+017F>ires did <U+017F>well him with abundance of impatiency, which yet did daily augment his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: And plea<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf in the<U+017F>e thoughts, he would very often walk alone to entertain them: Now, becau<U+017F>e he was <U+017F>eldome from us in the day time, he would often make u<U+017F>e of the night, when he thought all a<U+017F>leep, and go into the Garden, where, under <U+017F>ome trees, he would enjoy his thoughts; and u<U+017F>ing often to go out thus, <hi>Daphnis</hi> took notice of it, who lay in the <U+017F>ame Chamber: And as commonly the wor<U+017F>e, rather then the better, is <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected, <U+017F>he was jealous of <hi>Amindor</hi> and her; but, for her <U+017F>atisfaction <U+017F>he would watch; and watched <U+017F>o, that <U+017F>eeing the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Callirea</hi> go out of his Bed, <U+017F>he followed him by the light of the Moon into the Garden, where ju<U+017F>t under my Chamber window, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>it down, and lifting up his eyes unto heaven, <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>ay thus aloud:</p>

Husband in a mans habit: and, in <U+017F>hort, all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible demon<U+017F>trations of love: So as though <hi>Daphnis</hi> did wonder at the bold attempt of him, and his Si<U+017F>ter; yet, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the grandure of his affection, which might well lead him unto <U+017F>uch follies: Yet, had <U+017F>he been of their coun<U+017F>ell at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he would not have advi<U+017F>ed unto this enterprize; but, <U+017F>eeing things did hit <U+017F>o happily, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to aid him all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, and to <U+017F>pare no pains nor care to effect his de<U+017F>ires: After which promi<U+017F>es, with many a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urances of amitie, <U+017F>he gave him the be<U+017F>t advice <U+017F>he could, which was, to in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elfe by degrees into my affection For, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the very word of Love does more offend a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than the thing it <U+017F>elfe doth; and it is alwaies very welcome unto any, <U+017F>o the name of it be hid. Therefore I think them to be well advi<U+017F>ed, who do make them<U+017F>elves loved of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, before ever they <U+017F>peak of Love; for Love is a thing di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing only in the name, though in it <U+017F>elfe it be agreeable unto all. And therefore, that you may finde a more favourable reception from <hi>Diana,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o much as name Love, no, nor to let her <U+017F>ee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53526:47"/>
it, but mu<U+017F>t carry the matter <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly, that <U+017F>he may fir<U+017F>t love you, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall know that you love her; for, <U+017F>he being once embarqued, <U+017F>he cannot afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Port, although <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee a <U+017F>torm in coming. Me thinks hitherto you have carried it with very much prudence, but you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till continue it: The <U+017F>eeming to be in love with her, although you <U+017F>eem a woman, is to very good purpo<U+017F>e; for certainly, any Love that is once <U+017F>uffered, will in the end produce a reciprocall return.</p>
               <p>We <U+017F>ee, that we do many things with much facility, which would <U+017F>eem full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if the cu<U+017F>tome of doing them, did not render them ea<U+017F>ie unto us. Meats unaccu<U+017F>tomed, are often at the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ted, which afterwards are plea<U+017F>ant by u<U+017F>e. An ear that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed to Mu<U+017F>ick, will tune the voice higher or lower unto a right harmonious caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; when one that is not u<U+017F>ed to the Art, will make a jar.

               <p>I could never have beleeved, Fair Mi<U+017F>tris, con<U+017F>idering the tran<U+017F>cendency of your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that any mortall dur<U+017F>t have loved you, had I not experimentally found in my <U+017F>elfe, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to look upon you and not Love. But knowing the heavens to be more Ju<U+017F>t than to impo<U+017F>e impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities upon any, I tooke it for granted, that they would have you loved, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>uffered you to be <U+017F>een. In this beleefe, I a<U+017F><U+017F>umed the boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e to look upon you, which I had no <U+017F>ooner done, but my heart immediatly <U+017F>ubmitted.

Here he <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to <U+017F>ee if I would an<U+017F>wer him; but in <U+017F>uch a manner, that had not his habit di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him, I could not have doubted but that he was in good earne<U+017F>t.

This, Fair one, <U+017F>aid he, does too much di<U+017F>parage your judgement for it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to make any doubt of your perfections and merit, but I rather think, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you are u<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>uch excu<U+017F>es to deny <U+017F>uch things as you are not plea<U+017F>ed to grant. But I am able and with all truth to <U+017F>wear, by <hi>Teutates,</hi> and all thats holy (and you may know I am not for<U+017F>worne) that you did never in all your life refu<U+017F>e any thing that was given you with a more <U+017F>incere and perect good will. I do know very well, an<U+017F>wered I, that the <U+017F>hepheards of this Country are accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch language as has little truth in it, nor do they think that the gods will puni<U+017F>h all the perfidious oathes of <U+017F>eeming lovers. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be the peculiar vice of your <U+017F>hepheards (<U+017F>aid he) I referre it unto your knowledge. But for my <U+017F>elfe who am not of this country, I am not guilty either of their <U+017F>hame or crime: but will out of your mo<U+017F>t cruell words draw <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction to my <U+017F>elfe. If the gods do puni<U+017F>h the oaths of perfidious lovers, and if I be guiltiy, then the gods will <U+017F>end the puni<U+017F>hment of perjurie upon me: and if they do not, then you mu<U+017F>t be forced to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>ince I am not puni<U+017F>hed, I am no lyer. And if I be no lyer, then you mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I am your lover. So let your wit turne it which way you will, it cannot be denyed but that you are the faire<U+017F>t upon earth, or el<U+017F>e there is none in it; and that your beauty is infinitly adored, by that <U+017F>hepheard who pre<U+017F>ents him<U+017F>elfe before you, and who implores your favour, which he thinks he may merit, if a mo<U+017F>t perfect love could ever do it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am fair or no, replyed I, I will be judged by any indifferent eyes: but how ever you cannot deny that you do di<U+017F><U+017F>emble and are perjured: and I mu<U+017F>t tell you <hi>Callirea,</hi> that the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which you have u<U+017F>ed as a man <U+017F>hall make me re<U+017F>olve, never to credit any words, <U+017F>ince you being a woman do know how <U+017F>o wel to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble.

This was right according to <hi>Amindors</hi> humour, which was ever full of vanitie, and would have all men beleeve, that he could have many good fortunes: At this time <hi>Filander</hi> found out his artifice: and had he not feared the di<U+017F>covery of him<U+017F>elfe, he was <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t him in my behalfe, that I beleeve he would have given him the lye.

               <p>With this re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>he came one day unto me, when <U+017F>he found me alone, and after much other-common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he began thus: <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what <U+017F>hould be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Callirea</hi>'s folly? I verily believe <U+017F>he will run out of her wits; <U+017F>he loves you <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, as, I think, <U+017F>he will not live; All day long <U+017F>he is in your Chamber, and all nights in the Garden; and <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>eth her <U+017F>elfe with her own melancholy fancy, that I cannot <U+017F>hake her out of her mu<U+017F>ings. I would I could give her any con<U+017F>olation, (an<U+017F>wered I) but what would <U+017F>he have me do? do I not repay affection for affection? do I not make it appear in all my actions? am I failing in any point of courte<U+017F>y or duty towards her? All this is true, replied <hi>Daphnis;</hi> but, did you hear her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es to her <U+017F>elfe, I believe you would extreamly pitty her: and I be<U+017F>eech you, unknown to her, let us go one night and hear her. I did promi<U+017F>e her, that I was very willing, and would go with her a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he would; for <hi>Philidas</hi> would ere long make a vi<U+017F>it unto <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> and then would be the fitte<U+017F>t time.</p>
               <p>A few daies after, <hi>Philidas,</hi> according to his intentions, went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Amindor</hi> with him, re<U+017F>olving not to return of <U+017F>even or eight daies: When he was gone, <hi>Filander,</hi> according to his cu<U+017F>tome, went into the Garden halfe dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, when he thought every one was a <U+017F>leep. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who went to bed the fir<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>oon as he was gone, did come to me, and told me: I put on my clothes as fa<U+017F>t as I could, and followed her, untill we came into the Garden. When <U+017F>he found where he was, <U+017F>he beckened unto me, to come a little after her; and when we were <U+017F>o neer as to hear, we <U+017F>at our <U+017F>elves down upon the ground: Pre<U+017F>ently after I heard him <U+017F>ay, But why <U+017F>hould I put my <U+017F>elfe to all this patience? what will all the<U+017F>e delayes do me good? Shall I die, before I di<U+017F>cover my maladie to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon? Then <U+017F>taying a while, he began again with a mo<U+017F>t profound <U+017F>igh, Why <U+017F>hould I fear that <U+017F>he will bani<U+017F>h me her pre<U+017F>ence, and doom me to death? for, if I <U+017F>hould die, it is a comfort to <U+017F>horten <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>erable life, and my death would <U+017F>atisfie for the fault I have committed; if death do not fall upon me, from the incen<U+017F>ed brow of the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> will not the violence of my affection cau<U+017F>e it? What then <U+017F>hould I do, and what <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>ay unto her? Alas, I would not offend her, if I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly help it: And why <U+017F>hould I keep <U+017F>ilence, <U+017F>ince my death will give her mo<U+017F>t certain knowledge? What then, <U+017F>hall I offend her? Ah! alas, injury and amitie are never together. Rather die, there's an end: But, if I <U+017F>hould die, do I not deprive her of the mo<U+017F>t faithfull <U+017F>ervant ever that <U+017F>he had? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I <U+017F>hould offend in adoring her? I will then tell her, and at the <U+017F>ame time open my brea<U+017F>t, that the <U+017F>word may more ea<U+017F>ily puni<U+017F>h my crime, if <U+017F>he condemn me to it.

               <p>Faire Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, when I heard <hi>Filander</hi> thus expre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe, my amazement was <U+017F>o great, that I knew not what in the world to do: I was <U+017F>o vexed, and trembled <U+017F>o extreamly, that I would have gon away, and never have looked upon this impo<U+017F>tor any more: But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> to compleat her trea<U+017F>on, held me by force; and, as I told you, being neer this Shepheard he turned his head at the noi<U+017F>e which we made; and thinking it was only <hi>Daphnis</hi> he came unto us: But, when he <U+017F>pied me, and thought I heard him, Oh heavens, <U+017F>aid he, what torment is little enough for me? Oh <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who could ever have expected this trea<U+017F>on from you? At this he ran away, as if he had been di<U+017F>tracted, though <hi>Daphnis</hi> called him two or three times by the name of <hi>Callirea;</hi> but fearing to be heard by others and more fearing, that <hi>Filander</hi> might do <U+017F>ome hurt unto him<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he left me alone,

As for <hi>Daphnis,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>earched for <hi>Filander</hi> <U+017F>o long, that at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he found him more dead than alive: and after <U+017F>he had chid him, for not clo<U+017F>ing with <U+017F>o good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and yet a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him, that I was not <U+017F>o much troubled at the accident as he was, he took a little heart to him<U+017F>elfe; but yet not <U+017F>o much as to embolden him the next morning to come out of his Chamber.</p>
               <p>I, on the other <U+017F>ide was extreamly offended again<U+017F>t them both, and was forced to keep my bed, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould make my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>een unto tho<U+017F>e about us, and particularly unto the Niece of <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan;</hi> but, as good fortune was <U+017F>he had no more wit then there was need of, <U+017F>o as we did ea<U+017F>ily hide from her this <U+017F>curvy bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which was almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to do, e<U+017F>pecially for <hi>Filander,</hi> who had her company almo<U+017F>t continually. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> <U+017F>he was not a little bu<U+017F>ied in the matter and perplexed, for, at the fir<U+017F>t, I would not look upon her and her excu<U+017F>es: but at the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o overcome me that I promi<U+017F>ed to forget the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury <U+017F>he had done me, yet vowing, that <hi>Filander</hi> <U+017F>hould never look me in the face again: and I do think, he had gone away without a <U+017F>ight of me, had he not feared the danger which <hi>Callirea</hi> would have incurred; for <U+017F>he had a Husband, that was extreamly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e and peevi<U+017F>h, and it was this very con<U+017F>ideration that re<U+017F>trained him.

Then <U+017F>he began to relate unto her all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt <hi>Phormion</hi> and <hi>Celion</hi> our Fathers; the <U+017F>ubtletie of her Father, to let her pa<U+017F><U+017F>e for a man, although <U+017F>he was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and all that I have related already unto you, and then continued in this manner, Now, that which I do require in performance of your promi<U+017F>e, is, that knowing my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affection to you, you would take me to be your Wife, and I will marry <hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Amindor,</hi> whom my Father hath brought up in his hou<U+017F>e, purpo<U+017F>ely to that end: And hereupon <U+017F>he added <U+017F>o many arguments to per<U+017F>wade him, that <hi>Callirea,</hi> amazed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, an<U+017F>wered him, That it was true indeed, he had told her mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange things, and <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>he could hardly believe, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome other a<U+017F><U+017F>urance than words. Then he, unbuttoning his doublet, did <U+017F>hew him in her brea<U+017F>ts, a convincing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of her being a woman. Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for <U+017F>hame <U+017F>hew me no more. <hi>Callirea</hi> then, that <U+017F>he might have the more time to con<U+017F>ult with us, did <U+017F>eem, as if <U+017F>he were glad of the motion; but pretended, that <U+017F>he had Parents from whom he expected all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and, without who<U+017F>e advice, <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>olve upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and therefore <U+017F>he charged him, to keep the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ecret; for, divulging of it, would give the world an occa<U+017F>ion to talk: and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that if nothing was wanting but her con<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>he would give him good te<U+017F>timony of her good-will. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this they ended their walk, and returned to their lodging, where all that day, <hi>Callirea</hi> dur<U+017F>t not come unto us, le<U+017F>t <hi>Philidas</hi> <U+017F>hould think <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak unto us; but, at night, <U+017F>he acquainted her Brother with all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and afterwards, both of them went unto <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and acquainted her. You may imagine how great the wonder of every one was; but <hi>Filander</hi> was mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ed, conceiving it conduced much unto the accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his de<U+017F>ires. In the morning, <hi>Daphnis</hi> de<U+017F>ired me to go and <U+017F>ee the feigned <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and the reall one <U+017F>tayed with <hi>Philidas,</hi> to the end <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any thing. The heavens know, how I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this newes; I prote<U+017F>t unto you, my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <U+017F>o great as I knew not whether I was awake or a<U+017F>leep. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> <U+017F>he complained again<U+017F>t me, for concealing it <U+017F>o long from her: to which I an<U+017F>wered, That I knew nothing of it untill this houre; and when I told her, that though we were Children together, yet, I thought all men to be like <hi>Philidas.</hi> She laughed untill her <U+017F>ides did ake at my ignorance. At the la<U+017F>t, le<U+017F>t <hi>Belinda</hi> <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me according to her plea<U+017F>ure, or, that <hi>Philidas</hi> <U+017F>hould put me upon <hi>Amindor,</hi> and he have ra<U+017F>h attempts upon me, I promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Filander,</hi> at the <U+017F>olicitation of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Callirea,</hi> to marry him. This was the rea<U+017F>on why (after he had a<U+017F><U+017F>umed his own habit, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Philidas,</hi> that he would make the motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Parents) he returned <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon with his Si<U+017F>ter unto <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> who never had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e. Since that time, I permitted <hi>Filander</hi> to write unto me; and he conveyed his Letters <U+017F>o finely unto me, that neither <hi>Philidas</hi> nor <hi>Amindor</hi> ever knew of them.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e had no bitterne<U+017F><U+017F>e in it. But alas, that which followed was <U+017F>o full of wofull wormwood, that I <U+017F>hall never reli<U+017F>h any <U+017F>weet again as long as I live. It chanced, to my fatall misfortune, that a <U+017F>tranger travelling through this Country, did finde me a<U+017F>leep, neer the Fountain of <hi>Sicomores,</hi> whither I was invited by the coolne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <U+017F>hades, and the murmuring of the <U+017F>pring, to <U+017F>it me down, and <U+017F>o fell a<U+017F>leep; he no <U+017F>ooner had ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me, but he found <U+017F>omthing that plea<U+017F>ed him. Oh heavens what kinde of man, or rather, what kinde of mon<U+017F>ter, he was! His face was as black as hell; his hair ruffine like, re<U+017F>embling wool, but much longer, and more di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; his beard like gri<U+017F>ly mo<U+017F><U+017F>e about his chin; his no<U+017F>e crooked and long, his mouth big, and his lips hanging over his chin like unto tripes; but, nothing was <U+017F>o horrid as his <U+017F>taring eyes in all his face there was not one bit of white to be di<U+017F>covered. This lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lover was de<U+017F>igned me by de<U+017F>tiny, and to take from me all thoughts of ever loving again: For, being ravi<U+017F>hed at the <U+017F>ight of me, and tran<U+017F>ported with leud de<U+017F>ires, he could not chu<U+017F>e but come neerer to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e me but, being armed, and onhor<U+017F>eback, the noi<U+017F>e awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, and <U+017F>o, that as he was <U+017F>looping to <U+017F>atisfie his helli<U+017F>h de<U+017F>ire, I opened my eyes:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53526:50"/>
And <U+017F>eeing this Mon<U+017F>ter <U+017F>o near me, I fir<U+017F>t cryed out, and afterwards did <U+017F>trike him upon the face with all my force. He being half up and half down, and not expecting <U+017F>uch re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the blow, as he leaned on the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>o as I had time to ri<U+017F>e. When I was up, he did ri<U+017F>e, and being very heavily armed, and fear adding wings to my heels, he could not overtake me on foot, and therefore he leaped <U+017F>uddenly into his <U+017F>addle, and galloped after me; and when I was almo<U+017F>t quite out of breath, poor <hi>Philidas</hi> who was not far off, hearing my voice, did come running unto me, and <U+017F>aw this cruel fiend pur<U+017F>ue me with a drawn <U+017F>word in his hand; for his anger at this blow which made him <U+017F>tagger, made him al<U+017F>o forget all love. <hi>Philidas</hi> did mo<U+017F>t generou<U+017F>ly oppo<U+017F>e his fury, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appeare by this la<U+017F>t act, that her Love unto me was as great as her Sex would permit. At the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he got hold of his bridle, which <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed this Barbarian, that with enequalled inhumanity, he ran her through the body, and <U+017F>he died immediatly, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between his Hor<U+017F>es feet, who fell <U+017F>o to bound and curvet, that he threw his Rider. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Philidas</hi> upon the fir<U+017F>t receipt of her wound did cry out aloud, and named <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> he not being far off, did hear the voice, and <U+017F>eeing her in <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a condition, he was much moved but much more when he <U+017F>aw this Barbarian running after me with a naked <U+017F>word in his hand, and I, as I told you, <U+017F>o out of breath, that I could hardly <U+017F>et one foot before another. How doe you think this poor Shepheard did now behave him<U+017F>elf? I doe not think ever any enraged Lione<U+017F>s robbed of her young ones, did run <U+017F>o fiercely after him that carried them away, as <hi>Filander</hi> did after this cruel Mon<U+017F>ter; and he being heavily clogged with his Arms, the poor Shepheard <U+017F>oon overtook him, and cryed out. Stay Knight, <U+017F>tay, doe not offer any violence unto her that de<U+017F>erves rather to be adored. And becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>till <U+017F>tayed not, either becau<U+017F>e his fury had <U+017F>topped his ears, or becau<U+017F>e he did not under<U+017F>tand the Language, <hi>Filander</hi> took up a <U+017F>tone and threw it at him, which hit him <U+017F>uch a blow upon the head, that he fell to the ground, and which without his Armour had certainly killed him; but getting up again immediatly, he forgot his anger again<U+017F>t me, and turned it <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly upon poor <hi>Filander,</hi> as he having nothing in his hand for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence but onely a Shepheards hook, he could not avoid that fatal blow which he received upon his body: But yet, feeling his enemies <U+017F>word already entred, <U+017F>uch force and courage did his natural genero<U+017F>ity give him, that in lieu of recoyling, he advanced, and <U+017F>o far, as till the <U+017F>word was up to the hilt, and gave his cruel enemy <U+017F>uch a blow on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with his Shepheards hook that he felled him to the ground, and <U+017F>eizing upon his throat with his hands and teeth he made a <U+017F>hift to kill him. But, ala<U+017F>s, this victory was dearly bought for as this Fiend fell dead on one <U+017F>ide, <hi>Filander</hi> fell on the other, but <U+017F>o, that the point of his <U+017F>word hitting upon a <U+017F>tone, the weight of his body made it come out of the wound. I, who alwaies was looking behind me to <U+017F>ee whether this Mon<U+017F>ter did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake me, when I <U+017F>aw him wounded <U+017F>o dangerou<U+017F>ly, forgetting all manner of fear, I <U+017F>topped; and when I almo<U+017F>t dead as well as he did <U+017F>ee him in this lamentable <U+017F>tate, <U+017F>at down upon the ground calling him in a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ad tone by his name; and u<U+017F>ing all my diligence to help him but hee had lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much blood, that hee could not an<U+017F>wer: Yet <U+017F>ee the force of a pure affection; I who had u<U+017F>ed never to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o much blood without a Faint had now the courage to put my handkerchief into his wound, and to tear my other linnen to <U+017F>top the cour<U+017F>e of blood on the other <U+017F>ide: This officious diligence did him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice for he having his head in my lap, he opened his eyes, and began to <U+017F>peak: and <U+017F>eeing me all in tears, he forced him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ay thus unto me; If ever I hoped for a more favourable End than this, fair Shepherde<U+017F>s. I pray the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens never to have pitty upon me: I did alwaies fore<U+017F>ee, that the meane<U+017F>s of my merit could never bring me to my de<U+017F>ired happine<U+017F>s; and my fears alwaies were le<U+017F>t de<U+017F>pair <U+017F>hould drive me unto <U+017F>ome cruel re<U+017F>olution again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf. The Gods who do know what is good for us, better then we do our <U+017F>elves, did very well know that I had not lived <U+017F>o long but for you; and therefore they would have me al<U+017F>o to dye for you. Judge then what contentment it is to me, <U+017F>ince I do not onely die for you, but al<U+017F>o to pre<U+017F>erve that which is mo<U+017F>t dear unto you, your Cha<U+017F>tity. Oh my mo<U+017F>t fair and deare<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, there wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now, but one thing, to compleat my contentment: And that my <U+017F>oul may <U+017F>ing an Anthem unto you in the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, I doe mo<U+017F>t humbly beg it. He uttered the<U+017F>e dying words with much pain; and <U+017F>eeing him in that <U+017F>ad condition, I gave him as <U+017F>atisfactory an an<U+017F>wer as his heart could de<U+017F>ire: Deare<U+017F>t friend (<U+017F>aid I) <U+017F>urely the Gods never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pired you with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>weet and pure affection, to extingui<U+017F>h it <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon: I hope yet they will lend you <U+017F>o much life, as may give me opportunities to let you <U+017F>ee, that I will not yeeld
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53526:50"/>
unto you in point of amity no more than you doe unto any in point of merit. And for a te<U+017F>timony of my unfeigned affection to you, ask what you will of me, and obtain it; for there is nothing that I will deny you. At the<U+017F>e words he took my hand, and drawing it nearer him, I doe ki<U+017F>s this fair hand (<U+017F>aid he) with a thankful <U+017F>oul, for all the favours it hath done me. But ah, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>ince I doe <U+017F>uffer the pangs of death for your <U+017F>ake, I doe conjure you by my mo<U+017F>t pure affection, and by your own good promi<U+017F>e, to let me carry <U+017F>o much contentment with me out of the world, as to <U+017F>ay, I am your Husband, and then my <U+017F>oul, dye when it will, will be at ea<U+017F>e. I do vow unto you, fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that the<U+017F>e words did <U+017F>o pierce my heart, that I was hardly able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain my<U+017F>elf; and it was onely my de<U+017F>ire of plea<U+017F>ing him which gave me courage; and therefore as <U+017F>oon as he had made his reque<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>aid thus unto him. <hi>Filander,</hi> I do con<U+017F>ent unto what you doe require of me; and doe <U+017F>wear unto you before all the Gods, and particularly the deities of this place, that <hi>Diana</hi> receives you for her Husband, and with her whole heart and <U+017F>oul gives her <U+017F>elf unto you. In <U+017F>peaking the<U+017F>e words, I ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him. And I, <U+017F>aid he, do give my <U+017F>elf and <U+017F>oul unto you, thinking my <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t happy in the glorious Name of Husband unto the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> Ala<U+017F>s, this word <hi>Diana,</hi> was the la<U+017F>t he ever breathed; for drawing me towards him to ki<U+017F>s me, he expired, leaving his la<U+017F>t breath upon my lips. What <U+017F>hould I now doe, fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince he is dead? for I did love him with mo<U+017F>t perfect affection. I fell upon him, and without either pul<U+017F>e or any motion was carried home. Oh heavens, how I did re<U+017F>ent this lo<U+017F>s! and have ever <U+017F>ince pre<U+017F>erved <U+017F>o lively a memory of him in my <U+017F>oul, that me thinks I <U+017F>ee him every hour before my eyes; and me-thinks I heare him every minute bid me love him <U+017F>till: And <U+017F>o I do, fair <U+017F>oul, with an eternal love. And if thou ha<U+017F>t any knowledg of what is don here below, receive, deare<U+017F>t friend, the<U+017F>e tears which I do offer unto thee, as a te<U+017F>timony, that as long as <hi>Diana</hi> lives, <U+017F>he wil love her dear <hi>Filander. A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to interrupt the grieving language of <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto her; I be<U+017F>eech you, fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, who was this mon<U+017F>trous piece of cruelty that was the cau<U+017F>e of this dire di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter? Ala<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I know not what they call him, but I am <U+017F>ure he is the cau<U+017F>e of my eternal tears. But yet, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is it not known who he was? They <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> that he came out of a certain barbarous country beyond the Straits, which (I know not whether I term it right) is called <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars; and the cau<U+017F>e of his coming, <U+017F>o unfortunately for me, was becau<U+017F>e he was in love with a Lady in that Country, who commanded him to <U+017F>earch all <hi>Europe</hi> over, and to <U+017F>ee if he could find any <U+017F>o fair as her <U+017F>elf; al<U+017F>o, if he met with any Lover, that would defend the Beauty of his Mi<U+017F>tris, he was obliged to fight with him, and to <U+017F>end his head, together with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Picture over unto her, and her Name. Ala<U+017F>s, I would to the Gods, that I had not run away when he followed to kil me, that my life might have <U+017F>aved poor <hi>Filander.</hi> Upon the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he <U+017F>hed <U+017F>uch abundance of tears, that <hi>Phillis</hi> to divert her, turned the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and did ri<U+017F>e up. Me thinks (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you have <U+017F>it too long, it would be better to walk a little. Upon this, all three did ri<U+017F>e up, and went towards their village. <hi>Leonida,</hi> who as I told you, was within hearing, did not lo<U+017F>e a <U+017F>yllable of what was <U+017F>aid; and the more <U+017F>he heard, the more de<U+017F>irous <U+017F>he was to hear. But when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them gone, without any mention of <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>he was very angry; yet in hopes to di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>omthing more if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed a while among<U+017F>t them, when <U+017F>hee <U+017F>aw they were gone, <U+017F>hee came out of her Bu<U+017F>h, and followed them, but at a di<U+017F>tance; for, <U+017F>he would not have them think, that <U+017F>he over-heard them. <hi>Phillis</hi> by chance turning about did <U+017F>ee her, and al<U+017F>o knowing her, did <U+017F>hew her unto her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who <U+017F>tayed, and <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he came towards them, they went back to meet her, and to do tho<U+017F>e civilities her quality did merit: <U+017F>o they met and <U+017F>aluted: <hi>Leonida</hi> full of courte<U+017F>ie, after the fir<U+017F>t complements, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her; Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> I came purpo<U+017F>ely this morning from the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas</hi> my Uncle, to wait upon you and the re<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and to <U+017F>ee whether the reports of your virtue <hi>Diana,</hi> of your beauty <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and your merit <hi>Phillis,</hi> be an<U+017F>werable unto what Fame hath trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petted in your commendations. <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing her Companions referred it unto her, <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this an<U+017F>wer. Great Nimph, perhaps it had been much better for us, that fame had been more <U+017F>ilent, and not rai<U+017F>ed your expectation to too great a height; however, <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to do us this honour, we do receive it as is our duty, in all humble grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: At the<U+017F>e words, they conducted her into <hi>Diana</hi>'s village, where <U+017F>he was entertained with <U+017F>uch welcome, and <U+017F>o much civility as <U+017F>he wondred how it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find people <U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>hed in Woods and Pa<U+017F>tures.</p>
               <p>The Afternoon was <U+017F>pent in <U+017F>everal que<U+017F>tions which <hi>Leonida</hi> asked of them and among<U+017F>t

the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he enquired what was become of a Shepheard called <hi>Celadon,</hi> that was the <U+017F>on of <hi>Alcippes? Diana</hi> an<U+017F>wered that not long <U+017F>ince he was unfortunately drown'd in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Lignon.</hi> And his brother <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> is he yet married? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> nor doe I think he is in any ha<U+017F>te; for the lo<U+017F>s of his brother is yet too fre<U+017F>h in his memory. But I pray, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> by what mi<U+017F>chance was he lo<U+017F>t? by endeavouring to help this Shephearde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> who fell into the River fir<U+017F>t: And then <U+017F>he pointed unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nimph, though not <U+017F>eeming, yet taking notice of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>'s actions, did <U+017F>ee that her complexion changed and to hide her blu<U+017F>hes <U+017F>he covered her face with her hand and therefore concluded that <U+017F>he did love him really: And to make a further di<U+017F>covery <U+017F>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her que<U+017F>tions. And was his body never found, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> onely his hat was found, and as it was <U+017F>wiming down the River was <U+017F>tayed by <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>hes. <hi>Phillis</hi> knowing if this talk continued it would draw tears from the eyes of her companion, <U+017F>hee interrupted. I be<U+017F>eech you, great Nimph, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what good fortune for us was it, that brought you unto this place? I told you at the fir<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) it was to be acquainted with you, and to enjoy the happine<U+017F>s of your good company. Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it would not be ami<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o it <U+017F>uit with your plea<U+017F>ure, to goe out with us unto our accu<U+017F>tomed exerci<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o will you be<U+017F>t be acquainted with our way of living, and al<U+017F>o that you give us leave to u<U+017F>e the freedom of our villages before you. With all my heart, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> for I know that con<U+017F>traint is never agreeable and Ile a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that I did not bring with me any intentions of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing you. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> taking <hi>Diana</hi> by one hand, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by the other they walked out, untill they came unto that wood which extends it <U+017F>elf as far as the banks of <hi>Lignon.</hi> They were no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et down, but they heard one <U+017F>ing not far off, and <hi>Diana</hi> who knew the voice turned towards <hi>Leonida,</hi> and <U+017F>aid, Great Nimph, will you plea<U+017F>e to heir the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of a young Shepheard, who has nothing of Rural about him but his Name and Habit? For being educated in great Cities, and among<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons of civility he <U+017F>mels not at all of the Country. Who is it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonidas)</hi> It is the Shepheard <hi>Silvander</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana)</hi> who hath not been among<U+017F>t us much above a year. I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>aid the Nimph, of what Family is he? It is a que<U+017F>tion very hard to be re<U+017F>olved, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana:</hi> for he him<U+017F>elf knows not who were his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely has <U+017F>ome far fetcht conception, that they were of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> and therefore he came hither with a re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>tay.

Your commendations of him, <U+017F>aid the Nimph, is invitation <U+017F>ufficient to goe and <U+017F>ee him, and therefore let us go to him. If he do <U+017F>ee us, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and thinks he <U+017F>hall not be trouble<U+017F>ome unto you, he will be <U+017F>ure to wait upon you pre<U+017F>ently: And as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o, he came. For, as fortune was, the Shepheard as he walked e<U+017F>pied them, and came to them; but becau<U+017F>e he did not know <hi>Leonida</hi> he <U+017F>eemed as if he would have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, when <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him; What <hi>Silvander,</hi> is it the civility of Cities to interrupt good company by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by them, and <U+017F>aying nothing? The Shepheard <U+017F>miled and an<U+017F>wered; Since I have <U+017F>inned in interrupting you, the le<U+017F>s will I <U+017F>tay in my <U+017F>in. That's not it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> which makes you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon gone, but rather becau<U+017F>e you think there is not merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough among<U+017F>t us to <U+017F>tay you; yet if you doe but ca<U+017F>t your eye upon this Nimph, I am confident that if your eyes have any judgement you will finde more merit than any where el<U+017F>e That which draws another thing unto it <U+017F>elf (replied <hi>Silvander)</hi> mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive <U+017F>ympathy with that which it doth draw; but <U+017F>ince there is no <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your high merits Great Nimph, and my poor imperfections, you need not wonder if your perfections did not attract me unto you.</p>
               <p>Your mode<U+017F>ty, Sir (<U+017F>aid <hi>Lemida)</hi> does onely make the di<U+017F><U+017F>imilitude betwixt us: Doe you think it is in your body, or your <U+017F>oul? If in your body, your face and the re<U+017F>t of your parts argues the contrary: if in the <U+017F>oul, me thinks, if you have one that is rea<U+017F>onable, it is not different from ours <hi>Silvander</hi> found that now he had not to deal with Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es, but with one of a higher <U+017F>train and therefore he re<U+017F>olved to an<U+017F>wer her with more <U+017F>olid rea<U+017F>ons than he u<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, therefore thus replied: Every thing in the whole univer<U+017F>e, fair Nimph, mu<U+017F>t be valued according to its own proper quality; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e, Man who is of highe<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem, would be the lowe<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince every animal excels him in <U+017F>ome particular thing or other; one in <U+017F>trength, another in <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s, another in <U+017F>ight, another in hearing, another in <U+017F>melling: and <U+017F>o in many priviledges of body. But when it is con<U+017F>idered, that the gods have made all the<U+017F>e Animals for the <U+017F>ervice of Man,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53526:51"/>
and man for the <U+017F>ervice of the gods, it mu<U+017F>t needs be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that the gods are above all; from hence I argue, that to know the true value of every thing, it mu<U+017F>t be looked into, to what <U+017F>ervice the gods did make them, and it is they that <U+017F>et the value upon things: nor <U+017F>urely the gods could never be <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>taken, as to equall your merit and mine, and yet make you a great Nymph, and me but a poor <U+017F>illy <U+017F>hepheard. <hi>Leonida</hi> did in her mind much commend the wit of this Shepheard, who could put <U+017F>o good a glo<U+017F><U+017F>e upon a bad matter. And therefore to give him more <U+017F>ubject to continue, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him. But allow all this in regard of me, yet why could not the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es invite you, <U+017F>ince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own argument, there is the <U+017F>ame proportion and <U+017F>impathy betwixt you and them? Sage Nymph, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> the le<U+017F><U+017F>e does alwayes <U+017F>ubmit unto the greater part and where you are, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>herhearde<U+017F><U+017F>es mu<U+017F>t do the <U+017F>ame why di<U+017F>dainful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> do you <U+017F>o little e<U+017F>teem of us? I did <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I did e<U+017F>teeme you <U+017F>o much: for if I had an ill opinion of you, I <U+017F>hould never have <U+017F>aid that you were a part of that great Nymph, <U+017F>ince thereby I do not make you her inferiour. Only in that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves to be loved, for her merits, for her beauty, and for her quality &amp; you only for your merits and for your beautie. I <U+017F>hould be glad <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> that I had <U+017F>o much merit or beauty either, as to obtain the Love of <U+017F>o wel an accompli<U+017F>hed Shepheard as you are. She <U+017F>poke this, becau<U+017F>e he was <U+017F>o far from any thoughts of Love that he was called among<U+017F>t them The in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible man: and <U+017F>he was very de<U+017F>irous to make him <U+017F>peake of it. Unto whom he an<U+017F>wered, think and beleeve what you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o you will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you want one of your principall parts. And, which is that? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana):</hi> Your wil, replyed he, for it and the effects of it are contrary. No no (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> and interrupted him) for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Silvander</hi> loves her as much as her will would have him. The Shepheard hearing her <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, turned towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <U+017F>aid that they did him wrong to be two to one. The wrong, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> is offered unto me, for this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>eeing me in combate with a <U+017F>trong enemy; and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting my courage and <U+017F>trength, would needs aid me.</p>
               <p>That is not it which does offend you, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid he, for <U+017F>he has more judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to make any doubt of your victory; but that which does offend you is, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing me already vanqui<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>teal the victorie, and the honour of it in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give me a blow at the latter end of the combate: but I do not know how <U+017F>he did intend it; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, if you had not medled, <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily gotten the glory as <U+017F>he thought. <hi>Phillis</hi> who had a good natural and plea<U+017F>ant wit, &amp; who re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>pend that day with <hi>Leonida,</hi> as plea<U+017F>antly as <U+017F>he could, did an<U+017F>wer him in a haughty manner, Tis very well <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that you thinke it a thing <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irable and honorable to me, to vanqui<U+017F>h you; but let me tell you, I rank the victory among<U+017F>t the meane<U+017F>t, that ever I got. Neither ought you to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e it (<U+017F>aid the Shepheard) <U+017F>ince it is the fir<U+017F>t you ever got of me. As it is honorable, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> to be the fir<U+017F>t, where there is merit; <U+017F>o it is a <U+017F>hame, where there is none Ah Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> never <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o of <hi>Silvander:</hi> for if all Shepheards who are inferior to him in merit, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>corned, I know not who <U+017F>hould be loved. This, this is the very blow that will overcome him, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> nay doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he is yours: Uncivilized and wild <U+017F>pirits are to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the very fir<U+017F>t at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: for not being accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch favours, they recieve them with <U+017F>uch a gu<U+017F>t, as they are not able to make any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>poke thus in way of mockery; but the gratious defence of <hi>Diana</hi> had <U+017F>uch an influence upon this Shepheard, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe obliged by the Lawes of courte<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>erve her and in that opinion, the perfections of <hi>Diana</hi> had <U+017F>o much power over him, that he conceived <U+017F>uch <U+017F>eeds of love, as time and pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice did increa<U+017F>e to a great heights; as afterwards I <U+017F>hall tell you. This di<U+017F>pute pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es with much delight unto <hi>Leonida</hi> who admired their quaint wits. then <hi>Phillis</hi> turning towards the Shepheard, <U+017F>aid unto him: Come, come Shepheard, words are but wind; come to the te<U+017F>t, and tell me truly, Who is the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e which particularly is your adored Saint? Even <U+017F>he, an<U+017F>wered he, whom you <U+017F>ee me adore. That is as much to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you adore none but that proceeds, alas from want of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Rather, replyed <hi>Sylvander,</hi> from want of wil. But you, fair one, who doe <U+017F>o much de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<U+017F>e me, I pray tell me, Who is the Shepheard whom you do particularly Love? All <U+017F>uch, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, as have any wit or courage: And he that <U+017F>ees a perfect beautie, and cannot love; certainly wants wit or courage or both.</p>
               <p>This is an an<U+017F>wer too generall <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> pray come to particulars, and tell us that one whom you do love? I wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, there were any <U+017F>o forward as to attempt it. Then, added <hi>Silvander,</hi> it is for want of courage. Then <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid she it is for want of

will. Why <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> would you have any to think that it is more want of will in you then me I would tho<U+017F>e actions which are decent in you, (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e) were permitted me, do you think it hand<U+017F>ome in me to leap and run as you do? But let us di<U+017F>pute no longer let <hi>Diana</hi> be Judge in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e and thereby you may <U+017F>ee what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have in my cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I make choice of a partiall Judge.

This Prologue, generous Shepheard, mu<U+017F>t plead for an excu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I am forced to tell you that I do love <hi>Tircis:</hi> I <U+017F>ucked in this affection almo<U+017F>t with my milk, and my <U+017F>oul being ever <U+017F>ince nouri<U+017F>hed with this food, did receive, as its own, the accidents of this pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion Neighbours we alwaies were the amity of our Parents, the equalitie of our ages, and the <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition in <hi>Tircis</hi> his younger years, were <U+017F>o many <U+017F>weet allurements, to make me his. But, cur<U+017F>ed Fate would have it <U+017F>o, that almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Cleon</hi> was born, and perhaps with more graces than I, but certainly, with much better fortune for, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he began to open her eyes, the heart of <hi>Tircis</hi> was inflamed by them, for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> began to love her in the Cradle About that time I was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ix years of age, he ten But <U+017F>ee how the heaven di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of us again<U+017F>t our wills; a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever I <U+017F>aw him I loved him, and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw <hi>Cleon,</hi> he loved her: And though the<U+017F>e were yet but green affections, <U+017F>uch as the age was capable of yet, were they not <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, but they knew how to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among<U+017F>t us: Afterwards, growing up with time, they came to <U+017F>uch a height, that, I believe never any exceeded them.</p>
               <p>In the Infancy of my Love, you may think, I took no great notice of his actions; but, being grown unto a more ob<U+017F>erving age, I found <U+017F>uch coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of good-will towards me, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e was armes indifferent, as long as her skin was only a little <U+017F>cratched; but, when the wound was great, then no way, but to throw them away, and acknowledge her <U+017F>elfe vanqui<U+017F>hed Thus was <hi>Tircis</hi> happy in the love of his <hi>Cleon,</hi> and enjoyed all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant

               <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Tircis</hi> found out the good-will of his happy <hi>Cleon,</hi> he received it with <U+017F>o much contentment, as his heart was not able to contain his joyes, but his eyes al<U+017F>o did <U+017F>hare in the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and were <U+017F>o much altered from what they were, as they could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>end forth <U+017F>ignes of their too much joy. <hi>Cleon's</hi> di<U+017F>cretion was <U+017F>uch, that <U+017F>he conferred no more favours upon <hi>Tircis,</hi> in the eye of the world, than ordinary; but, being jealous of her honour, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired him to counterfeit a love unto me, to the end all eyes might be upon me, and off her; and me <U+017F>ooner than any other, it being long ob<U+017F>erved that I loved him. He, who was all obedience unto what<U+017F>oever <hi>Cleon</hi> commanded, did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly apply him<U+017F>elf unto me: Oh heavens! when I think upon the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions he u<U+017F>ed unto me, I cannot chu<U+017F>e, though they were all fal<U+017F>e, but cheri<U+017F>h them, and wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ince I can be no otherwi<U+017F>e happy, that I were <U+017F>o deceived again. And certainly, <hi>Tircis</hi> had no hard task to per<U+017F>wade me, that he loved me: For, I did not think my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o di<U+017F>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that a long continued practice, together with my endeavours to plea<U+017F>e him, might work upon him; at which, the vain-glorious <hi>Cleon,</hi> did oft make her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>port with <hi>Tircis:</hi> but, had Love been ju<U+017F>t, and turned the love of <hi>Tircis</hi> to me into earne<U+017F>t, her mockery might have lightt upon her <U+017F>elfe. This life of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation was <U+017F>o tedious to him, that he was not able to endure it any longer; and had not Love blinded the eyes of all Lovers, certainly I <U+017F>hould have perceived it, as well as mo<U+017F>t did who <U+017F>aw us together; but I would not lend any believing ear unto them, no more, than unto my mo<U+017F>t mortall enemy. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Cleon</hi> and I were very familiar, this <U+017F>ubtle Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e was afraid, le<U+017F>t time <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover my error unto me, which to prevent, <U+017F>he invented this <U+017F>tratagem: Her de<U+017F>igne was, as I told you before, to conceal that affection which <hi>Tircis</hi> bore unto her, under his cloak of <U+017F>eeming to love me; and it was effected accordingly, for every one talked aloud of the love of <hi>Tircis</hi> unto me: But <hi>Cleon</hi> as I told you before, fearing this <U+017F>tratagem would be di<U+017F>covered, did invent another full as <U+017F>ubtle as the other: She advi<U+017F>ed <hi>Tircis</hi> to make me believe, that the world talked very broad of our amitie, and put wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions upon it; and therefore it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to <U+017F>top all <U+017F>candalous tongues by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and in order to that, he would counterfeit a love unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> and tell her (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that you make choice of me rather than any other, becau<U+017F>e of your conveniency, in being neer me, and <U+017F>peaking to me. I, who was all <U+017F>inceritie, and no <U+017F>ubtletie, did think this coun<U+017F>el to be very good, <U+017F>o as from thence forwards, with my permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, when we were all three together, he talked with <hi>Cleon</hi> as he was wont, without any difficultie: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it was good <U+017F>port to them, and would have been to any other, that had known the di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation: For, when I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>o officious about <hi>Cleon,</hi> I thought he had all that while but mocked her, and had much adoe to forbear laughing: On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Cleon</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53526:54"/>
ob<U+017F>erving my actions, and knowing how I was deluded; <U+017F>he could hardly contain her thoughts of mirth. But <U+017F>ee how good natur'd I was, I did extreamly pitty her, for the griefe <U+017F>he would re<U+017F>ent, when <U+017F>he came to know the truth: But alas, afterwards I found, that the pitty belonged unto my <U+017F>elfe; and who, as well as I, might not as well have been deceived? for Love, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he takes entire po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a <U+017F>oul, does pre<U+017F>ently expell all diffidence of the party loved. And this di<U+017F><U+017F>embling Shepheard did per<U+017F>onate his part <U+017F>o well, that had I been in <hi>Cleons</hi> room, perhaps I <U+017F>hould have doubted, whether he acted a fiction or a truth: Sometimes, when he was betwixt us both, and had given <hi>Cleon</hi> <U+017F>ome notable demon<U+017F>tration of affection, pre<U+017F>ently he would turn to me, and ask me in my ear, whether he did not act his part well: but, his grand craft re<U+017F>ted not in <U+017F>uch a trifle; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you hear what an Arts-Ma<U+017F>ter he was in his Art, he talked with <hi>Cleon</hi> in private more often then with me, he would ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand, be down upon his knees two houres together before her, and never hid any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age from me, for the rea<U+017F>ons afore<U+017F>aid: But in publick, he never <U+017F>tirred from me and courted me with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, that mo<U+017F>t had the <U+017F>ame opinion of our Loves: which he did upon de<U+017F>igne, de<U+017F>iring, that I only <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee his court<U+017F>hip unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he knew I did not believe it; but, would not by any means, that any others <U+017F>hould be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. And when I told him, that we could not remove that opinion which the people had of our amitie and that none would believe he loved <hi>Cleon;</hi> then would he an<U+017F>wer me, Why, how <U+017F>hould they ever believe a thing which is not, no, nor well enough di<U+017F><U+017F>embled? But, <U+017F>aid, he, what<U+017F>oever we do, we mu<U+017F>t deceive <hi>Cleon,</hi> let others think what they will; for, if <U+017F>he be but hand<U+017F>omely deluded, our de<U+017F>igne is almo<U+017F>t compleated: Hereupon he de<U+017F>ired me, that I would <U+017F>peak unto her in his behalfe, and become as it were, his confident: She, <U+017F>aid he, who has that opinion alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will the more gladly receive the me<U+017F><U+017F>ages, that you <U+017F>hall bring, and <U+017F>o we <U+017F>hall live in more a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, and freer from all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition. Oh! what a mi<U+017F>erable fortune do we often follow? For my part, I thought, that if <hi>Cleon</hi> did believe I had loved this Shepheard, I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>troy that beliefe, by de<U+017F>iring her to love him, and by <U+017F>peaking for him as his confident. But <hi>Cleon,</hi> knowing the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e between the Shepheard and me, and living in a kinde of con<U+017F>traint, <U+017F>he thought that by this means, <U+017F>he might mo<U+017F>t conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all her Me<U+017F><U+017F>ages and Letters from him; and therefore <U+017F>he bade the propo<U+017F>ition which I made unto her very welcome, and after this treated me as one <U+017F>he loved: And thus I was made u<U+017F>e of, only as a Letter Carryer between them. Oh Love! what a mi<U+017F>ery did<U+017F>t thou put me upon? But, I am not the fir<U+017F>t who has done the like offices for another in thinking to do it for them<U+017F>elves. At that time, the <hi>Franks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> being all up in Armes, we were con<U+017F>trained to live in Townes; and there being a huge concour<U+017F>e of people from all parts, al<U+017F>o wanting their Country-accommodations, a pe<U+017F>tilent di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e did <U+017F>o raign in the Town, as mo<U+017F>t of the people died of it: <U+017F>o it chanced, that <hi>Cleons</hi> Mother was infected; and though the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was <U+017F>o contagious, that hardly either Parent or kindred, would <U+017F>tay with the party infected; yet, <U+017F>uch was the naturall affection of <hi>Cleon</hi> to her Mother, that <U+017F>he would never part from her, but would <U+017F>till <U+017F>tay, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion of friends, who told her, that <U+017F>he offended the gods, in running into a wilfull danger; unto whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>till returned this an<U+017F>wer, If you love me never u<U+017F>e any more of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for, do I not owe my life unto her, who gave me mine? and will the gods be offended with me for helping her, who taught me to <U+017F>erve them? In this pious and filiall re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he would not for<U+017F>ake her Mother, but <U+017F>hut her <U+017F>elfe up with her, and was as bu<U+017F>y in helping her, as if the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e had not been at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. <hi>Tircis</hi> <U+017F>tood all the day at the dore, and wooed to come in; but <hi>Cleon</hi> would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no termes permit him, le<U+017F>t if <U+017F>he had, it might have been <U+017F>candalous unto her: But <U+017F>till he waited at the dore and cau<U+017F>ed all manner of nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries to be brought unto them: yet, <U+017F>o the heavens would have it, that <hi>Cleon,</hi> notwith<U+017F>tanding all antidotes and pre<U+017F>ervatives which <hi>Tircis</hi> brought unto her, was infected. When the Shepheard heard that, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to keep him from entring into the hou<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ince now it was not a time to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, or to fear any teeth of detractors; but he <U+017F>et all things in order, di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed of his e<U+017F>tate, and declared his Will; afterwards, putting it in the charge of a friend to help him, he entred, and <U+017F>hut him<U+017F>elfe up with the Mother and the Daughter, re<U+017F>olving to run the <U+017F>ame fortune with <hi>Cleon.</hi> It is not materiall to relate unto you, what good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he did them, and how officious and <U+017F>ervicable he was unto the Mother, for the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <U+017F>ake: But at la<U+017F>t the Mother dyed, and when none was left in the hou<U+017F>e but he and his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e maladie <U+017F>till increa<U+017F>ed, I do not think the poor Shepheard got one minute
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53526:54"/>
of re<U+017F>t; he held her continually in his armes, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her. She, on the other <U+017F>ide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies loving him did take this la<U+017F>t action for <U+017F>uch an evident te<U+017F>timony of his love, that hers augmented much more; and her greate<U+017F>t griefe was the danger he was in for her <U+017F>ake. He, on the other <U+017F>ide, had <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfaction, as to rejoyce as much as a <U+017F>ad occa<U+017F>ion would permit, that he had the means to te<U+017F>tifie his good will. <U+017F>o it hapned that this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F>s being in a condition to be cut, a Phy<U+017F>ician could not be procured, that would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to touch her, for fear of danger: <hi>Tircis,</hi> who<U+017F>e affection prompted him unto any thing, being taught how to do it, he took the Lancer, and lifting up her Arm, he did cut it, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed it when he had done. To be brief, all things of mo<U+017F>t danger and difficulty, were ea<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>weet unto him, in hopes of doing her <U+017F>ome good. But her malady <U+017F>till encrea<U+017F>ed, and brought his beloved <hi>Cleon</hi> into <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad condition, that <U+017F>he had no more <U+017F>trength left than to utter the<U+017F>e words; I am very forry <hi>Tircis</hi> that the gods are not plea<U+017F>ed to draw the thread of my lamentable life a little longer, onely to te<U+017F>tifie my extreme gratitude: but though I <U+017F>hould live as many yeares, as I have already done dayes, I <U+017F>hould never bee able to <U+017F>atisfie you for the abundance of your affection to me. The<U+017F>e words were uttered with much pain; but her affection to this Shepheard gave her power to utter them. Unto which <hi>Tircis</hi> an<U+017F>wered, My deare<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, all I have done, and all I can ever do; is all far <U+017F>hort of my will to do any real <U+017F>ervice; beleeve me, deare<U+017F>t <hi>Cleon,</hi> my obligations to you are greater than a thou<U+017F>and lives can pay. The heavens which gave me a being only to be yours, would accu<U+017F>e me of mi<U+017F>pending my time, <U+017F>hould I employ one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of my life otherwi<U+017F>e then in your <U+017F>ervice. He would have continued longer but the Shephearde<U+017F>s finding her <U+017F>elf extreamly ill did interrupt him: Cea<U+017F>e my dear friend and leave talking to me, that I may imploy that little time I have to live, in a<U+017F><U+017F>uring you that I can love you as much as ever my <U+017F>oul is capable of: So <U+017F>eeing my time is very near, I bid thee eternal adieu, and de<U+017F>ire three things of you; To love thy <hi>Cleon</hi> for ever; to enterre my corps near my Mothers, and when you do pay the debt which is due unto humanity, let your corps be layd near mine, that though our bodies could not be united alive, yet they may in death. To which he an<U+017F>wered; The Gods would be unju<U+017F>t, if after they have begun <U+017F>o perfect an amity as ours, they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon de<U+017F>trov it: But I hope they will pre<U+017F>erve you, at lea<U+017F>t take me away before you: But if they will not, I will onely beg as much life as to fulfill tho<U+017F>e commands you have laid upon me, and then to let me fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you. Be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, deare<U+017F>t <U+017F>oul, that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e they alwaies tye up my hands, I will not be long after you. Friend, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I command you to live as long as the Gods have ordained, that <U+017F>o whil<U+017F>t I am chanting our perfect amity in the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, you may publi<U+017F>h it unto the living: And <U+017F>o both the dead, and they living will honour ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> memory. But, friend, I perceive my malady is forcing me to leave you: Adieu, adieu, the mo<U+017F>t perfect Lover left among<U+017F>t the living. At the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he dyed, leaning her head in the bo<U+017F>om of her Shepheard. To repeat his <U+017F>orrows, would but open his wounds, and make them bleed afre<U+017F>h. Oh mo<U+017F>t fatal death (cryed out <hi>Tircis)</hi> that hath robbed me of the better part of my<U+017F>elf, either re<U+017F>tore that life which thou ha<U+017F>t taken from me, or el<U+017F>e take the re<U+017F>t. Then, to give way unto tho<U+017F>e tears and <U+017F>ighs which this remembrance did revive in his heart, he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent untill <hi>Silvander</hi> told him, that to grieve for what there was no remedy, was but a te<U+017F>timony of weakne<U+017F>s. Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> I doe grieve becau<U+017F>e there is no remedy; for if there were, I should not grieve. <hi>Laonice</hi> then continued on: This happy Shephearde<U+017F>s being dead, and <hi>Tircis</hi> having performed the la<U+017F>t office of amity, he procured her to be interred next her Mother; but the carele<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e who had it in charge was <U+017F>uch, as they layd her corps in another place. As for him, his <U+017F>orrows were <U+017F>uch, as he never <U+017F>tirred off his bed, as if he lived only to obey her commandements. Some few dayes after, enquiring of tho<U+017F>e who came to <U+017F>ee him, where they had laid his beloved corps, he under<U+017F>tood that <U+017F>he was not enterred by her Mother; at which he was infinitely di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed; and for a great <U+017F>um of mony hired <U+017F>ome to take it up again, and lay it by her Mother, which accordingly was done: They went unto the place, uncovered the earth, and four of them took up the corps, but having carryed it a little way, the Infection was <U+017F>o violent that they were forced to leave it by the way, and could carry it no further: whereof <hi>Tircis</hi> being adverti<U+017F>ed, after he had made great offers unto them to go on, and <U+017F>eeing they would by no means undertake it; What <hi>Tircis</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) did<U+017F>t thou think the love of gain could work more with them than thy affection with thee? Fie, <U+017F>ie, <hi>Tircis,</hi> this is too great an affront offered unto thy amity. So, as if he were tran<U+017F>ported, he ran to the place where the corps lay; and though it had layn in the earth three dayes, and <U+017F>melt extreamly, he took it up in his arms, and carried it unto the Tomb of her Mother, which was already
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53526:55"/>
covered. Then after this high te<U+017F>timony of affection, he returned to the Town, and would not be <U+017F>een of any. When all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages were known unto me, but yet onely hearing <hi>Cleon</hi> was dead, I went unto his chamber, to enquire of all particulars: When I came at the chamber door, which <U+017F>tood half <U+017F>hut, and half open, me-thought I heard him <U+017F>igh; and was not mi<U+017F>taken, for looking in at a chink of the door, I <U+017F>aw him lying upon his bed with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven, and his face <U+017F>wimming all in tears. Judge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Shepheard, whether or no I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed; for I did not think he had loved her, but came rather with intentions to rejoice with him, than to condole. Then, after I had <U+017F>een him in this <U+017F>ad condition, I heard him utter the<U+017F>e words:</p>

               <p>Oh heavens! what a weeping <U+017F>tatue was I turned, when I heard him utter the<U+017F>e words! My a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment was <U+017F>o great, as leaning again<U+017F>t the door, it opened; at which he turning his head, and <U+017F>eeing me, he put out his hand, and bade me <U+017F>it down upon the bed by him; and when he had wiped away <U+017F>ome tears from his <U+017F>welled eyes, he <U+017F>poke thus unto me: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<U+017F>s, <hi>Laonice,</hi> poor <hi>Cleon</hi> is dead, and we are left here below to lament her lo<U+017F>s. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e my grief would not <U+017F>uffer me to return an an<U+017F>wer, he continued on. I know Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F>s, that you <U+017F>eeing me in this condition, doe much wonder, that the feigned amity, which I profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, <U+017F>hould make me mourn <U+017F>o exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively for her lo<U+017F>s. But, ala<U+017F>s, remove your error, I be<U+017F>eech you; for I think it is too great a <U+017F>in again<U+017F>t Love to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any longer under the cover of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, which my affection forced me to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume. And know <hi>Laonice,</hi> that all this while, I did love <hi>Cleon,</hi> and all my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto you were but coverings of that love. And therefore if you did ever love me, for Gods <U+017F>ake <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> turn that love into pitty, and condole with me this <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, which at one blow has cut off all my hopes. If ever I did offend you, I be<U+017F>eech you, pardon me, <U+017F>ince it was committed onely becau<U+017F>e I could not fail in my duty to my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Cleon.</hi> I was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at the<U+017F>e words, that I went out, and could hardly hit the way to my own home, where I kept my chamber a long time, lamenting this <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter: And I did with <hi>Tircis,</hi> whom I <U+017F>till loved, excu<U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e Trea<U+017F>ons he had committed again<U+017F>t me and pardoned the di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations whereby he offended me thinking them no di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations nor trea<U+017F>ons, but onely violencies of love. I was the more ea<U+017F>ily induced to pardon him, <U+017F>ince Love, as a Con<U+017F>ederate with his faults, did flatter me with <U+017F>ome hopes of <U+017F>ucceeding <hi>Cleon</hi> in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. As I was thus <U+017F>oothing my <U+017F>elf in the<U+017F>e thoughts one came to tell me, that <hi>Tircis</hi> was gone, and none knew whither, or where he was. This <U+017F>urcharge of <U+017F>orrow, <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed me as I did immediatly re<U+017F>olve to follow him. And to the end none might hinder me, I departed, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly at the beginning of the night, as before morning I was gotten farre off. Whether I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed when I was alone in the dark, the heavens do know, unto whom my complaints were addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; but however, Love, who was my <U+017F>ecret compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did in<U+017F>pire me with courage enough to go through with my de<U+017F>ign: Following then on my voyage, and taking the path my feet fir<U+017F>t trod upon; for I know not which way <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> went, nor my <U+017F>elf neither; I went wandering like a Vagabond for three months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53526:55"/>
and never heard the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllable of him. At the la<U+017F>t, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over the Mount <hi>Dor,</hi> I met with this Shephearde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and pointed unto <hi>Madonche)</hi> and with her this Shepheard called <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> <U+017F>itting under a <U+017F>hady Rock to pa<U+017F>s away the heat of the day; And it being my cu<U+017F>tom to enquire of all I met concerning <hi>Tircis,</hi> I under<U+017F>tood by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>igns which they gave me, that he was in tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>arts, and went wandring and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Cleon.</hi> Then I related unto them, all the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tory which I have told unto you, and conjured them to give me the be<U+017F>t directions they could. <hi>Madonche</hi> moved with pitty, did give me <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>weet an<U+017F>wer, as I judged her to be <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e I was, and I was not mi<U+017F>taken; for I heard, <U+017F>ince, the <U+017F>tory of her <U+017F>orrows, by which I found, that Love wounds as well in the Court as Country. And becau<U+017F>e there was much re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in our fortunes, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired we might both goe together, <U+017F>ince both were upon the <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>t. I did with open arms embrace the motion, and thought it better to enjoy <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad companion, than to be alone. But this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is impertinent, <U+017F>ince I intend onely to relate the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Tircis,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf. Well, generous Shepheard, after three months que<U+017F>t in this Country, I met with him; and <U+017F>o contrary to his expectation, that hee was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed. At the fir<U+017F>t, he looked upon me with a loving eye; but afterwards, when he <U+017F>aw the occa<U+017F>ion of my voyage was my Love to him, hee openly declared the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he <U+017F>till bore unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> and that it was not in his power to love me. Love, I be<U+017F>eech thee (and not this ungrateful man) If there be any ju<U+017F>tice in thee, let me have <U+017F>ome recompence for all my pains.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Laonice</hi> ended, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf in a <U+017F>ad po<U+017F>ture unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> as if <U+017F>he courted his favour for Ju<U+017F>tice in her cau<U+017F>e. Then <hi>Tircis</hi> began to <U+017F>peak in this manner; Though the <U+017F>tory of my misfortunes be, as this Shephearde<U+017F>s hath related them, yet my <U+017F>orrows are infinitely more pittifull, which I will not relate, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould too much trouble you, and all this company; onely with this, that when we could not <U+017F>upport our <U+017F>orrows, we did with common con<U+017F>ent addre<U+017F>s our<U+017F>elves unto the Oracle to know our dooms from it; and we received this an<U+017F>wer from the mouth of <hi>Arontine.</hi>

And to the end all things might be done according to the will of the Gods, the old Matron who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Oracle told us, that both of us were to chu<U+017F>e our Advocate among<U+017F>t the company by Lot; the fir<U+017F>t Lot to plead for <hi>Laonice,</hi> and the la<U+017F>t for me. Upon this he entreated them all, that they would be plea<U+017F>ed to take the<U+017F>e offices upon them, unto which they all con<U+017F>ented. The fir<U+017F>t Lot fell upon <hi>Hylas,</hi> and the la<U+017F>t upon <hi>Phillis. Hylas</hi> he <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid thus; If I were now, as heretofore I was, a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Laonice,</hi> I <U+017F>hould very hardly be per<U+017F>waded to argue in her behalf, that <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to love her; but now at this time, <U+017F>ince I am all for <hi>Madonche,</hi> I am very willing to obey that God who <U+017F>o ordained it. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> you may by this ob<U+017F>erve the great Providence of this Divinity, who to move one unto change, hath committed the charge of it unto uncon<U+017F>tant <hi>Hylas,</hi> as unto one who be<U+017F>t knows the way; and to move one to a faithful amity, hath ca<U+017F>t the Lot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e that is firm and con<U+017F>tant in her actions: Al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uch a Judge is cho<U+017F>en as will not be partial: For <hi>Silvander</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t fit, <U+017F>ince he is neither con<U+017F>tant nor uncon<U+017F>tant in his affection, becau<U+017F>e he never loved. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> began to <U+017F>peak, and thus <U+017F>aid unto them: Since, <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> you are both willing that I <U+017F>hould be the Judge of your differences, I <U+017F>hall require you both to <U+017F>wear, that you wil inviolably ob<U+017F>erve my Sentence, for otherwi<U+017F>e the Gods may be the more incen<U+017F>ed, and all our labours lo<U+017F>t.

And the Lawes and ordinances both of heaven and nature, do all command him to di<U+017F>pute no further in the cau<U+017F>e. Does not the rules of courte<U+017F>ie and gratitude require, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation for benefits received? Does not heaven it <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ay, that all <U+017F>ervices ought to be remunerated with <U+017F>ome wages? And does not nature force him to love a faire woman who loves him and to abhor rather then to dote upon dead corps? But this man is a grand offend eragain<U+017F>t all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>acred Laws: for in lieu of all the great favour he hath received from <hi>Laonice</hi> he has returned high di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ies; in lieu of all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf confe<U+017F><U+017F>eth <U+017F>he hath done him, <U+017F>erving him <U+017F>o long for a cloak of his amity to <hi>Cleon,</hi> he does pay her the wages of ingratitude: and for that dear affection which <U+017F>he ever bore him even from her cradle, he an<U+017F>wers her only with <U+017F>corne. If thou bee<U+017F>t a man <hi>Tircis,</hi> make it appeare thou do<U+017F>t adore the gods, and recompence this fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who has run <U+017F>o many hazards and mi<U+017F>eries for thy <U+017F>ake.

Alas, <hi>Caron</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wafts any over but once, and is ever after deaf to all cries and calls; No no, <hi>Tircis,</hi> 'tis flat impiety to trouble the tranquillitie of tho<U+017F>e whom the gods have called to them<U+017F>elves: Amitie is ordained for the living, and coffins for the dead: do not then <U+017F>o prepo<U+017F>terou<U+017F>ly, give thy affection unto the dead <hi>Cleon,</hi> and a coffin unto the living <hi>Laonice.</hi> This does not get thee the name of con<U+017F>tant, for <hi>Cleon</hi> now has no intere<U+017F>t in thee: mu<U+017F>t one alwaies go naked becau<U+017F>e their fir<U+017F>t cloathes are worne?

And, to begin, Let me tell you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that all tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons which you have in<U+017F>tanced for a proof that the loving party ought to be loved again, though they be fal<U+017F>, yet <U+017F>hall be allowed as good. But how can you conclude from them, that <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to betray the amitie of <hi>Cleon,</hi> by beginning a new love of <hi>Laonice?</hi> The<U+017F>e are impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, and contradictions: Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, becau<U+017F>e none is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto more then they can do. How would you have this Shepheard love when he has no will? You laugh <hi>Hylas,</hi> when you heare me <U+017F>ay he has none. Faith, I do <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I pray what has he done with it? He that loves an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis</hi> doth give his <U+017F>oul, it <U+017F>elf &amp; all its faculties unto the party loved; and <U+017F>o by con; equenee his wil is not in his power. But this <hi>Cleon,</hi> replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> being dead has nothing, and therefore <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to to take his own again.</p>
                           <p>Ah <hi>Hylas, Hylas,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you talke like an ignorant in Love; for <U+017F>uch gifts as are di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed on by Loves authoritie are for ever irrevocable. Pray then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what is become of this will, <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Cleon?</hi> The le<U+017F><U+017F>e followes the greater, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Phillis,</hi> if plea<U+017F>ure be the object of the will, if that cea<U+017F>e to be a plea<U+017F>ure, where's the will? And <U+017F>o it hath followed <hi>Cleon:</hi> if <hi>Cleon</hi> be not, then there is no will; for he had never had it but for her. But if <hi>Cleon</hi> be in <U+017F>ome certain place, as our <hi>Druids</hi> hold, that <U+017F>he is, then this will is in her hands, <U+017F>o contented in the place where <U+017F>he is, that if <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe would cha<U+017F>e it away, <U+017F>he cannot returne it to <hi>Tircis,</hi> as knowing well it would be in vain, but it goes into the grave, and re<U+017F>ts with her beloved A<U+017F>hes: this being <U+017F>o, why do you tax the faithful <hi>Tircis</hi> with ingratitude, if it be in his power to love any other? Al<U+017F>o you do not only require things impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but al<U+017F>o things in them<U+017F>elves contraries; for if every one ought to love the party that loves, why <U+017F>hould he not then love <hi>Cleon,</hi> who never failed him in amitie? And as for the recompences which you demand, for the Services and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which <hi>Laonice</hi> carried: pray let her remember the contentment <U+017F>he received by them, and how merry <U+017F>he made her<U+017F>elfe as long as this fallacie la<U+017F>ted, who otherwi<U+017F>e would have droned out a dull and melancholy life. So as if <U+017F>he balance the payment which the <U+017F>ervice, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>he will think her <U+017F>elfe very well payed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> You <U+017F>ay, <hi>Hylas</hi> that <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> deceived her; but I <U+017F>ay it was no deceipt, but a ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment of love, who returned her own blows upon her <U+017F>elfe, for her intention was not to <U+017F>erve him, but to delude <hi>Cleon.</hi> Thus <hi>Silvander</hi> have I briefly an<U+017F>wered the fal<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons of this Sheapheard: and there remaines no more, but to make <hi>Laonice</hi> confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he injured <hi>Tircis</hi> in her unju<U+017F>t pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uing of him; which I <U+017F>hall ea<U+017F>ily do, if <U+017F>he will be but plea<U+017F>ed to an<U+017F>wer me.

                           <p>No certainly, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he. Then, Fair <hi>Laonice</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> think it not <U+017F>trange that <hi>Tircis</hi> who knowes that his <hi>Cleon</hi> is in heaven, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees all his actions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in his fidelity, <U+017F>hould not change the affection he bore unto her: nor let this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of place <U+017F>eperate their loves, <U+017F>ince all the hindrances of life could never do it. Do not beleeve what <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>aid, that none ever returnes over the River <hi>Acheron;</hi> many that have been beloved of the gods, have both gone and come; and who knowes, but <hi>Cleon</hi> who was adorned with <U+017F>o many excellencies of <U+017F>oul, may find the <U+017F>ame favour from Love: Oh <hi>Laonice!</hi> were but your eyes permitted to look upon Divinitie; you would <U+017F>ee that <hi>Cleon</hi> to defend her own cau<U+017F>e is in this place, and whi<U+017F>pers the<U+017F>e words into my eares, which I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her defence.

and chiding <hi>Hylas</hi> for the bla<U+017F>phemies he had breathed again<U+017F>t her. What would<U+017F>t thou an<U+017F>wer, <hi>Hylas,</hi> if thy happy <hi>Cleon</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay thus unto thee? Wilt thou offer, O thou incon<U+017F>tant wretch, to <U+017F>tain my <hi>Tircis</hi> with thy own in<U+017F>idelity? If he did heretofore love me, do<U+017F>t thou think it was my Body? If thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer, Yes, I would then reply, that then he ought to be condemned to love the a<U+017F>hes which I have left in my Coffin, as long as they will la<U+017F>t: For, a Lover never ought to retreat from a Love once begun. If thou do<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that it was my Soul he loved, which was my principall part: then, Oh thou fond and uncon<U+017F>tant <U+017F>inner, why <U+017F>hould he now change his will, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is now more perfectly glorious than ever <U+017F>he was? Otherwi<U+017F>e, (<U+017F>uch is the mi<U+017F>ery of the living) I <U+017F>hould be jealous I <U+017F>hould be vexed, and I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een by many eyes as I am by his: But now I am delivered from <U+017F>uch mortall imperfections, and am no more capable of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. And would<U+017F>t thou, <hi>Hylas,</hi> with thy <U+017F>acrilegious per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions, divert him from me, in whom I only lived upon earth? and, by a mo<U+017F>t barbarous cruelty, endeavour to give me a <U+017F>econd death?

And therefore, to let this divinity argue the cau<U+017F>e in your <U+017F>oul, I will be <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent only let me hint thus much unto you, that Love is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, as you your <U+017F>elfe ought to <U+017F>tand in awe of his puni<U+017F>hing hand, if <hi>Laonice</hi>'s pitty, rather then <hi>Cleon</hi>'s rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>hould move you.</p>

                           <p>THe principall point in the cau<U+017F>e debated before us, is, to know whether Love can die, by the death of the party loved Unto which I <U+017F>ay, that the Love which is peri<U+017F>hable is not right Love; for, it ought to follow the <U+017F>ubject which gave it life; and therefore tho<U+017F>e who love only the Body, ought to enclo<U+017F>e their love of that body in the <U+017F>ame Coffin where it is; but, <U+017F>uch as love the Soul, ought, with their love, to flie after this loved Soul, as far as the highe<U+017F>t heavens, and no di<U+017F>tance ought to <U+017F>eparate them. All the<U+017F>e things therefore well con<U+017F>idered, I do ordain, that <hi>Tircis</hi> do love his <hi>Cleon</hi> <U+017F>till; and that the two Loves which are in us, the one do follow the Body into the grave, and the other the Soul into heaven. That <hi>Tircis</hi> do not any more di<U+017F>turb the re<U+017F>t of <hi>Cleon's</hi> Soul, by any compliance unto the importunities of <hi>Laonice.</hi> This is the Will of the gods pronounced by me.</p>
                           <p>Having thus given Sentence, not <U+017F>taying to hear the complaints of <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Hylas,</hi> he made a low congie unto <hi>Leonida</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the company, and went away without any company, but <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would not tarry to hear the <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entments of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e. And becau<U+017F>e it was late, <hi>Leonida</hi> went that night unto <hi>Diana's</hi> hou<U+017F>e, with all the re<U+017F>t of the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, except <hi>Laonice,</hi> who was <U+017F>o extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> as <U+017F>he <U+017F>wore, <U+017F>he would not go out of that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>he had done them <U+017F>ome remarkable di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. It <U+017F>eemes fortune did conduct her as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired; for having left the company, and <U+017F>itting down in the wood where <U+017F>he might with more liberty lament her di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, her better Genius did repre<U+017F>ent before the eyes of her fancy, the in<U+017F>upportable di<U+017F>dain of <hi>Tircis,</hi> how he was unworthy of her Love, and was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>hamed of his fault, as <U+017F>he vowed a thou<U+017F>and times to hate him, and, for his <U+017F>ake, both <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis.</hi> Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in her memory, it hapned, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi> who, of late, was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with <hi>Phillis,</hi> for <U+017F>ome coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e towards him, e<U+017F>pied <hi>Silvander</hi> and her talking together. 'Tis true, this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e was not altogether <U+017F>o full of triviall expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Love to him, as '<U+017F>he was before her frequent a<U+017F><U+017F>ociation with <hi>Diana</hi> for that new amitie together with the delight which <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>he took in being together, did <U+017F>o much take her up, as <U+017F>he minded not tho<U+017F>e fond trifles of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which nouri<U+017F>hed the love of <hi>Lycidas;</hi> <U+017F>o as he had a conceit, that the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>o conver<U+017F>ant with him as before, was <U+017F>ome new Love which had diverted her from him: and not being able to imagine who it <U+017F>hould be, that <U+017F>he now loved, he went wandring up and down in places mo<U+017F>t melancholy and unfrequented, that he might with more freedome lament his mi<U+017F>eries: And as ill luck was, he <U+017F>pied, as I told you before,

                              <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e together, which <U+017F>ight did not a little increa<U+017F>e his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie; for, knowing the merits of the Shepheard and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, he ea<U+017F>ily believed, that <hi>Silvander,</hi> who never yet loved any, had be<U+017F>towed him<U+017F>elfe upon her; and that <U+017F>he, according to the humour of her Sex, did willingly accept of the gift.</p>
                           <p>The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations did much <U+017F>tir up his <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition; but much more, when they pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing by him, and not <U+017F>eeing him, be heard, or thought he heard, the words of a Lover; and tho<U+017F>e perhaps were only <U+017F>ome repetition of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s <U+017F>entence. But, to put him<U+017F>elfe out of all patience, it happened, that having let them pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by, he did ri<U+017F>e out of the place where he was, and becau<U+017F>e he would not follow them, took the contrary way, and as fortune would have it, he did <U+017F>it down neer the place where <hi>Laonice</hi> was, who all this while never <U+017F>aw him. After he had a while nur<U+017F>ed upon his mi<U+017F>haps, and being tran<U+017F>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thoughts of them, he cryed out aloud, Oh Love! is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible thou <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>t <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch an injury to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unpuni<U+017F>hed? Wilt thou recompen<U+017F>e wrongs and <U+017F>ervices with equall favours? Afterwards, being a while <U+017F>ilent, with cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed armes, and eyes turned up to the skies, he breathed out many a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>igh, and then began again.</p>
                           <p>I plainly <U+017F>ee, that there is not any con<U+017F>tancy in any woman: <hi>Phillis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he will <U+017F>hew that <U+017F>he is of the <U+017F>ame Sex, and though otherwi<U+017F>e full of perfection, yet in this <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ubject to her Sexes naturall incon<U+017F>tancy. <hi>Phillis,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, of who<U+017F>e affection I have been heretofore more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, than of my own will. But Oh, my Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, am I not the very <U+017F>elfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ame <hi>Lycidas</hi> that I was before, and who<U+017F>e affection has been <U+017F>o welcome unto you? Mu<U+017F>t I now be ca<U+017F>t off, and <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>ucced in my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e? a <U+017F>tranger a vagabond, a man that all the world de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>eth, and cannot own him for any po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of any part in it. <hi>Laonice,</hi> who overheard, hearing him name <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and being de<U+017F>irous to know more, <U+017F>he began to hearken more attentively, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he heard him utter the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts, both of him<U+017F>elfe and <hi>Phillis:</hi> and from thence <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ooth him up in his opinion, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her <U+017F>elfe, that if <hi>Phillis</hi> loved <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make him jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and if <U+017F>he loved <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>he would <U+017F>o divulge it to the world, that every one <U+017F>hould know it. So when <hi>Lycidas</hi> was gone, for his tormented minde would not let him belong in one place, <U+017F>he came out of her lurking place, and following after, <U+017F>he overtook him as he was talking to <hi>Corilas,</hi> whom he met upon the way; and faigning to enquire <U+017F>ome newes of a di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Shepheard, they an<U+017F>wered, that they knew of no <U+017F>uch. He is a Shepheard, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, who wanders up and down lamenting a dead Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; and I am told he u<U+017F>eth to be every afternoon in the company of the fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Phillis,</hi> and her Servant. Her Servant, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who is that? I know not, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but it is <U+017F>uch a name as <hi>Silander</hi> or <hi>Silvander,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch like; he is of a middle <U+017F>tature, his face <U+017F>omething long, and of a very plea<U+017F>ing humour when he will. But who told you, replied <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that he was her Servant? Both their actions, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; for I know what I have both <U+017F>een and heard of them: But, I pray tell me, if you know any way how I <U+017F>hould meet with him I look for? <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that he could not an<U+017F>wer a word; but <hi>Corilas</hi> told her, that if <U+017F>he followed on that path, it would bring her through the wood into a Meadow, where they u<U+017F>ed to a<U+017F><U+017F>emble; and le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e her way, he would be her companion if <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed. She <U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>he did not know the way, and was very glad of his courteous offer: So bidding goodnight unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> went along with her companion. But <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>o much out of him<U+017F>elfe, that he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till immovable a long while; but at la<U+017F>t, recollecting him<U+017F>elfe, he ruminated upon the words of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, unto which he could not chu<U+017F>e but give much credit. It would be too long to relate his dolefull expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions and injuries he did unto the faithfull <hi>Phillis.</hi> But all the night long he wandred in the thick wood, and in the morning he was <U+017F>o tired out with his woes and walking, that he was forced to lie down under a tree, and with eyes <U+017F>welled with tears, at the la<U+017F>t he fell a<U+017F>leep.</p>

Mu<U+017F>t you needs, <hi>Phillis,</hi> build up your own happine<U+017F><U+017F>e by the ruine of mine? Dare you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis)</hi> be <U+017F>o bold, as to <U+017F>peak of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e before <hi>Diana's</hi> face? I wonder what impudent phra<U+017F>es you will u<U+017F>e behinde her back, who a<U+017F><U+017F>ume to your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much before her face? Would you have my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e to think, that it is not my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>erve her (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)?</hi> and why, I pray, <U+017F>hould I not tell it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince it is nothing but a mo<U+017F>t certain truth? You may as well <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that <U+017F>he does love you, and cannot live out of your <U+017F>ight. I do not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Silvander;</hi> but, let me <U+017F>ay unto you by way of an<U+017F>wer, that I wi<U+017F>h with all my heart, it were <U+017F>o: But, do you think it <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, that I think it a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>erve my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? If you do, I pray let me ask, what happine<U+017F><U+017F>e do you finde in <U+017F>erving her? Though I <U+017F>hould think it a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> yet <U+017F>urely, I would not brag of it. It is ingratitude, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> to receive a benefit and not to give thanks for it; and how is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to love a per<U+017F>on that is ungratefull? From hence I judge (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> and interrupted) that <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love <hi>Diana.</hi> Mo<U+017F>t will concur in that judgment, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> and I believe, <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elf does think <U+017F>o. I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>hew your rea<U+017F>on for this opinion, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you think to bring me into it. The Affirmative part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> mu<U+017F>t alwaies be proved, and not the Negative: The que<U+017F>tion is, whether or no you do love <hi>Diana?</hi> You affirm, and I deny it; and therefore it is your part to prove it. <hi>Phillis</hi> was at a <U+017F>tand for an an<U+017F>wer, when <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aid, Si<U+017F>ter, do you hear and allow of what the Shepheard <U+017F>aies? I do hear, but not allow of it, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for I <U+017F>hould be put upon a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53526:58"/>
hard task to prove it. If <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> I mu<U+017F>t think you do not love me: for, <hi>Silvander</hi> demands nothing but what is rea<U+017F>on. Upon this, the Shepheard addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her, Mo<U+017F>t fair, and no le<U+017F><U+017F>e ju<U+017F>t, Mi<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>e, it is now impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can be <U+017F>o impudent as to <U+017F>ay, that I have not an infinite happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in <U+017F>erving you, you are plea<U+017F>ed to give <U+017F>uch a favourable an<U+017F>wer in my behalfe. By <hi>Diana's</hi> <U+017F>aying, that <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love her, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>he does not thereby <U+017F>ay, that you do love her, or that <U+017F>he loves you. Should I but hear <U+017F>uch heavenly words, an<U+017F>wered he, come from the mouth of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as, <hi>I do love you,</hi> or, <hi>You do love me,</hi> I <U+017F>hould not only think this a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, but be ravi<U+017F>hed with joy, and yet <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ilent, it argues a con<U+017F>ent unto what <U+017F>he heares: Why therefore may I not <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>eth <U+017F>he loves me? Did Love con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in words, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> you are more in love than all men I know, put together; and you can argue a bad Cau<U+017F>e better than any Lawyer. <hi>Leonida</hi> was <U+017F>o delighted with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that had <U+017F>he not been troubled for <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>he could have <U+017F>tayed among<U+017F>t them as long as <U+017F>he had lived: And that was the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired them to walk with her towards the River-<U+017F>ide, homewards; and they were very ready to wait upon her: for, be<U+017F>ides the complement of common courte<U+017F>ie, they were much delighted in her company.</p>
                           <p>So then, <U+017F>he taking <hi>Diana</hi> on the one <U+017F>ide and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> on the other, they walked along; but <hi>Silvander</hi> was further from <hi>Diana</hi> than <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he having taken that place which he de<U+017F>ired; at which the vain-glorious <hi>Phillis</hi> was not a little glad, and laught at the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, <U+017F>aying, that her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e might ea<U+017F>ily judge which of them was mo<U+017F>t ready to <U+017F>erve her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had applied her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o officiou<U+017F>ly to be near her, and he never cared. My Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered he, did admit you to the honour of that place, for your importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities <U+017F>ake, and not your affection for had you loved her, you would have <U+017F>uffered me to enjoy that place which you do. Nay rather the contrary, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> if I had let any come neerer her than my <U+017F>elfe: For, a Lover thinks he can never be neer enough the per<U+017F>on Loved. That Lover, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> who regards his own particular contentment more, then the contentment of the party Loved, does not de<U+017F>erve the title of a Lover <U+017F>o as you regarding your own delight, in being <U+017F>o neer your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, more then her <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it cannot be <U+017F>aid you do love her, but your <U+017F>elfe only; for, were I in your room, I <U+017F>hould lead her, and help her to walk, whereas you do only trouble her. Did my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>cold with me as you do, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> I know not whether I <U+017F>hould love her or no. I am mo<U+017F>t certain, <U+017F>aid the Shepheard, that, were I in lieu of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould never love you. How dare you offer <U+017F>uch an affront, as to <U+017F>ay, you think you <U+017F>hould not love her upon any condition? This, <hi>Phillis,</hi> is a grand maxime in the Law of Love, that tho<U+017F>e who can think they cannot love upon any conditions, are no Lovers: for, Love does not admit of any Ifs or Conditions, but is alwaies ab<U+017F>olute.</p>
                           <p>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I demand ju<U+017F>tice, and require it on the part of Love, that you puni<U+017F>h this crime of <U+017F>o high a nature, and that you will remove her from that place which is too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for her, that thinks <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not love; and place me in the room, who lives on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love you. Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I perceive, that this envier at my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let me alone, untill I quit the place; and I fear he will, with his <U+017F>mooth language, move you to con<U+017F>ent unto it: and therefore, with your favour, I will leave it unto him, upon condition, that he tell you one thing which I <U+017F>hall ask him. <hi>Silvander</hi> never <U+017F>taying for the an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> The condition is ea<U+017F>ie, and I will never refu<U+017F>e it; <U+017F>ince without it, I <U+017F>hould never conceal any thing which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires to know. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> did yield him the place, and <U+017F>aid unto him, Envious Shepheard, though the place is not to be bought and <U+017F>old, yet, you have promi<U+017F>ed more for it than you are aware; for, you are obliged to tell us who you are, and what occa<U+017F>ion brought you into this Country: for, you have been long among<U+017F>t us, and we are all ignorant of what you are. <hi>Leonida,</hi> who was very de<U+017F>irous to know who <hi>Silvander</hi> was, <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Phillis</hi> thus, Believe me, <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have <U+017F>hewed much prudence in this propo<U+017F>ition; for I believe none here, but does much de<U+017F>ire the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>atisfaction. I wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I could <U+017F>atisfie your de<U+017F>ires; but Fortune hath <U+017F>o denyed it unto me, as I may well <U+017F>ay, that I am more de<U+017F>irous, and almo<U+017F>t as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it as you are: For, Fate only <U+017F>ent me into the world, lets me know that I do live, but conceals from me all other knowledge of my <U+017F>elfe: And that you <U+017F>hould not believe that I am any thing unwilling to perform my promi<U+017F>e, I do <U+017F>wear unto you by all the gods, and by the beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> that I will truly tell you all that I know of my <U+017F>elf.</p>

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of</hi> Silvander.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Aetius</hi> was Lieutenant General in <hi>Gaul</hi> unto the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> hee thought it very dangerous unto the Romans, that <hi>Gondeoch</hi> the fir<U+017F>t King of the <hi>Burgundians</hi> <U+017F>hould be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of the greate<U+017F>t part, and therefore re<U+017F>olved to drive him out, and drive him on the other <U+017F>ide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from whence he came a little before, when <hi>Stilico,</hi> for the good <U+017F>ervice he had done the Romans again<U+017F>t <hi>Radagri<U+017F>e</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> gave him the ancient Provinces of the <hi>Authunois,</hi> and <hi>Seguinois,</hi> and <hi>Allobroges,</hi> whom he named <hi>Burgundy,</hi> without the command of <hi>Valentinian:</hi> and it is to be thought he did it, onely to get all the Forces of the Empire into his own hands: But the Emperour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hands full of many enemies, as the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Franks,</hi> who were ready to fall upon him in <U+017F>everal places, he commanded <hi>Aetius</hi> to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in peace which was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon put into execution, but fir<U+017F>t the <hi>Burgundians</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received great routs, and their enemies made <U+017F>uch ravage and wa<U+017F>te, as they carried away with them all they found.</p>
               <p>I then being <U+017F>ome five or <U+017F>ix years of age, was with many others carried away unto the utmo<U+017F>t Town of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> by <U+017F>ome <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who out of revenge went into tho<U+017F>e Countries that were confederate with their enemies, and committed the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they had received. I cannot tell you why they took me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in <U+017F>ome hopes of money for a ran<U+017F>om; but my fortune was <U+017F>o kind unto me, as I fell into the hands of an <hi>Helvetian,</hi> who had an old and very rich Father, and who taking a liking to me, either for my phy<U+017F>iognomy, or <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ing an<U+017F>wer which my young Genius gave him, did take me unto him<U+017F>elf, with intention to educate me in Literature: And though the Son was much again<U+017F>t it, yet the Father continued his de<U+017F>ign, and <U+017F>pared no co<U+017F>t or care to in<U+017F>truct me in all Learning, <U+017F>ending me unto the Univer<U+017F>ities of the <hi>Mu<U+017F><U+017F>ilians,</hi> in the Province of the Romans. So as I may very well <U+017F>ay, that I had been lo<U+017F>t if I had not been lo<U+017F>t. However though nothing was more <U+017F>utable to my Genius than Learning, yet was it a continual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto me, to be ignorant from whence and who I was; thinking <U+017F>till this to bee a greater misfortune than hapned unto any other. And being much troubled at it, a friend advi<U+017F>ed me to enquire the truth from the Oracle, for I was <U+017F>o young when I was fir<U+017F>t taken, that my memory could not inform me any thing of my birth, or parents, or place from whence I came; but this friend had <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive power over me, that both of us went together unto the Oracle, and the an<U+017F>wer which we received was this.</p>

               <p>Judge (fair <hi>Diana)</hi> what <U+017F>atisfaction I received from this an<U+017F>wer.

               <p>My Son (for <U+017F>o have I ever e<U+017F>teemed you, <U+017F>ince the rigour of War brought you into my hands) I do not think you to be <U+017F>o ignorant of what I have done for you, as to make any

doubt of my good will towards you. Yet if my cares to in<U+017F>truct your youth have not given you a knowledge of it, I will; becau<U+017F>e I do intend very well towards you. You know that my Son <hi>Ahazides,</hi> who took you, and brought you to me, hath a Daughter as dear unto me as my <U+017F>elf: And becau<U+017F>e I de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>pend tho<U+017F>e few dayes I have to live, in re<U+017F>t and tranquillity, I do intend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Doe not think, that this is a leight and random de<U+017F>ign, but a thing of mature and long deliberation; for having by a well experienced knowledge found, your inclinations <U+017F>utable unto my mind, I re<U+017F>olved to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h the tranquillity of my old age in you, and therefore <U+017F>ent you to the Univer<U+017F>ities, knowing that nothing renders a <U+017F>oul more capable of rea<U+017F>on than lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge doth: And in your ab<U+017F>ence I have <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed my Grandchild to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, as <U+017F>he out of her complacency to me, is contented, and de<U+017F>ires it as much as my <U+017F>elf. 'Tis very true, <U+017F>he much de<U+017F>ires to know, what, and from whence you are; and for her <U+017F>atisfaction. I have often enquired of <hi>Azahides</hi> who took you, but he could give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an<U+017F>wer, but that he found you about the River <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> and out of the Province of <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noi<U+017F>e;</hi> but perhaps you might better remember, <U+017F>ince you were then <U+017F>ome five or <U+017F>ix yeares old: And asking him, whether your habit could not give him any knowledge of your Parents, he an<U+017F>wered, No; and that you were <U+017F>o young, that there was no ghe<U+017F><U+017F>ing at your Quality by your habit. So as, my Son, if your own memory cannot give you any light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our knowledge, none el<U+017F>e can.</p>
               <p>Then the good old <hi>Abariel</hi> took me by the hand, and prayed me to tell him, all that I knew, or could remember of my <U+017F>elf. To whom, after many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of gratitude and obligations to him for my education, and this propo<U+017F>al of Marriage, I an<U+017F>wered him, that truly I was <U+017F>o very young when I was taken, as I could not remember any thing either of my Parents or Quality. I am extreamly <U+017F>orry for it (replied the good old man); but <U+017F>ince it cannot be helped, I will not <U+017F>o much as mention my de<U+017F>ign unto <hi>Azahides,</hi> until I know how you approve of this my de<U+017F>ign. And I an<U+017F>wering him, that I <U+017F>hould be too ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if I did not wholly obey him in all things, he cau<U+017F>ed me to retire, and <U+017F>ent for his Son, to acquaint him with his intentions, who did ab<U+017F>olutely reject the motion, and would by no means hear of it. Afterwards, the good old man, <U+017F>ince he could not obtain his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent freely told him thus much; <hi>Ahazides</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) if you will not be<U+017F>tow your Daughter upon whom I would, I will be<U+017F>tow my e<U+017F>tate upon whom you would not: Therefore either marry her unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> or el<U+017F>e I will make him my heir. <hi>Ahazides,</hi> who was of a very covetous di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and feared to lo<U+017F>e the e<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>eeing his Father <U+017F>o peremptory, did <U+017F>eem to bend a little, and de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>ome daies of con<U+017F>ideration, which the good old man did con<U+017F>ent unto, de<U+017F>iring to doe all things by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and lenity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to acquaint me, but he needed not; for I found it by the eyes and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of his Son, who begun to chide and u<U+017F>e me <U+017F>o ill as I was not able to endure it. Then during the time of con<U+017F>ideration which was prefixed, he commanded his daughter, who was much better than her father, upon pain of death (for he was a man of a bloody and murtherous temper) to <U+017F>eem unto the good old man, as if <U+017F>he were very <U+017F>orry her father was not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto his will, and that <U+017F>he therefore would obey him, and would be ready to marry me privately: And all this was only a de<U+017F>ign to murder me. The poor Grandchild was extreamly perplexed; for on the one <U+017F>ide the menaces of her cruel father did terrifie her; on the other <U+017F>ide, her affection unto me would not permit her tender years to <U+017F>uch a piece of cruelty, <U+017F>o as in a trembling manner <U+017F>he came to the good old man, and told him, that <U+017F>he would marry me <U+017F>ecretly: And then it was <U+017F>o concluded upon. So as the good man did ab<U+017F>olutely command me to be ready, and I, notwith<U+017F>tanding all my doubts, dur<U+017F>t not di<U+017F>obey.</p>
               <p>The Plot was <U+017F>o laid, that I <U+017F>hould climb up to the window of her chamber, and there marry her <U+017F>ecretly. The hou<U+017F>e was <U+017F>eated upon the Lake <hi>Lemane,</hi> where the waves did beat again<U+017F>t it, and then fell into the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> which runs through the middle of it. The de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Azahides</hi> was to draw me up with a rope to the middle of the wall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to let me fall into the Lake: where being drowned, no news would be heard of me: for, the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> which runs with a mon<U+017F>trous impetuo<U+017F>ity, would have carried me quite away. A thou<U+017F>and to one, but his de<U+017F>ign had been executed; for I was fully re<U+017F>olved to obey the good old <hi>Abariel,</hi> had not his poor Grandchild moved with compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and horrour of the fact, acquainted me with it, the very day before it <U+017F>hould have been done: And in a trembling manner <U+017F>aid thus unto me: You <U+017F>ee, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that in <U+017F>aving your
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53526:60"/>
life, I do run the hazard of my own death; for I know that <hi>Ahazides</hi> will never pardon me, but however, I had rather die innocent, than live guilty of your death. After my many thanks, I told her, that <U+017F>he needed not to fear the fury of <hi>Ahazides;</hi> for I would take a cour<U+017F>e both for her <U+017F>afety and my own, but told her that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ure to be <U+017F>ecret. Again<U+017F>t the appointed night I provided my <U+017F>elf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had taken my leave of the good old man, who came with me to the water <U+017F>ide, I went into the little Boat which hee had provided for me. Then going under the window, I made a <U+017F>hew as if I had tyed my <U+017F>elf unto the rope, but it was only my clothes <U+017F>tuffed full of Sand; then pu<U+017F>hing my <U+017F>elf a little on one <U+017F>ide to <U+017F>ee what would be done, I heard it pre<U+017F>ently fall into the Lake, where, with my Our I beat the water, that they hearing the noi<U+017F>e, might think it was I who was flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the water: But I was quickly forced to put further off; for they ca<U+017F>t down <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <U+017F>tories, as I came hardly off with my life. Pre<U+017F>ently after I <U+017F>aw a light in the window, and fearing to be di<U+017F>covered, I layd my <U+017F>elf all along in the Boat; and <U+017F>o they did not <U+017F>ee me, but thought the Boat floated away of it <U+017F>elf. Then, when every one was gone from the window. I heard a great noi<U+017F>e by the water <U+017F>ide where I left <hi>Abariel:</hi> and as I thought, I heard his cry, cau<U+017F>ed by my fall into the water, and fearing I was drown'd; but I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve not to return, though extreamly <U+017F>orry that I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>erve the good old <hi>Abariel</hi> in his old age: But being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of <hi>Ahazides</hi> his ill will unto me, I knew that though not at this time, yet at <U+017F>ome other he would execute his murtherous intention: So as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Land at the place where I had layd other clothes, and the be<U+017F>t of my things, I took them, and leaving my Boat. I betook my <U+017F>elf to Land, and travelled <U+017F>o long, that, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary, I arrived at <hi>Evians</hi> at the break of day, and was forced there to re<U+017F>t my tyred limbs all the day; where not being known, I went, as many others did upon urgent occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ask advice of the <U+017F>age <hi>Belinda,</hi> who was Mi<U+017F>tris of all the Ve<U+017F>tals about the Lake; and who, as <U+017F>ince I under<U+017F>tand, is Mother unto my fair Mi<U+017F>tris. Having acquainted her with all my di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ulted with the Oracle, and the next day told me, that the gods did command me not to wonder at my afflictions, and that if I would ever come out of them, it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary I <U+017F>hould look into the Fountain of the Verity of Love, becau<U+017F>e in that water was my onely remedy. And that as <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elf in it, I <U+017F>hould know my Father and my Country. And asking her in what place that Fountain was, <U+017F>he told me it was in this Country of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> Then <U+017F>he told me the property and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, <U+017F>o courteou<U+017F>ly, as I thought my <U+017F>elf infinitely obliged unto her.</p>
               <p>Upon this, I re<U+017F>olved to come hither, where at my fir<U+017F>t coming I met with <hi>Celadon,</hi> from whom I had information where this admirable Fountain was: But as I was in my way to it, I fell <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick, as I was forced to keep my chamber <U+017F>ix months: And when I was wel, I under<U+017F>tood from <U+017F>ome about that place, how a Magician, at the in<U+017F>tance of <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> had <U+017F>et two Lyons and two Unicorns to guard it, and that the Inchantment could not be di<U+017F>inchanted but by the death of two of the mo<U+017F>t perfect Lovers that ever came into this Country.</p>
               <p>Heavens know how much I was grieved at this news, <U+017F>ince it had <U+017F>o prevented me in my <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired hopes. However, <U+017F>ince this was the Country which the Heavens had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igned to give me knowledge of my Parents, I thought it be<U+017F>t for me to <U+017F>tay in it; hoping that at la<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e two Lovers <U+017F>o faithful, might be found out: But certainly it was <U+017F>o rare a thing to be found, as I had little rea<U+017F>on for my hopes. But with this de<U+017F>ign I put my <U+017F>elf into the garb of a Shepheard, that I might more freely enjoy the company of tho<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> And to be the more acceptable unto them, I be<U+017F>towed the re<U+017F>t of my mony in a flock of Sheep, and building a little Cabin.</p>
               <p>This, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> is all I doe know of my <U+017F>elf: And this is the price of that Room which I have bought of <hi>Phillis.</hi> I am very glad to know <U+017F>o much (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida)</hi> &amp; do hope your fortune will be good, <U+017F>ince the gods doe <U+017F>eem to have a care of it by their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: and for my part, I am a very zealous wi<U+017F>her of it. So am not I (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> nor do I wi<U+017F>h he may ever come to the knowledge of his Parents: For if he <U+017F>hould perhaps their merits might work much upon my Mi<U+017F>tris: For matter of E<U+017F>tate and Alliance, is more con<U+017F>idered in Mariages, than the love or merit of the party. See <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> how you under<U+017F>tand it; you are not <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t me, but that I hope by your means to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of that which I <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ire.

With <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions as the<U+017F>e <U+017F>he took leave of the fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, after a hundred imbraces and promi<U+017F>es to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very <U+017F>hortly; and went away <U+017F>o very well contented, as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to quit the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Court, for the <U+017F>implicity of this life: but her greate<U+017F>t inducement unto it, was her de<U+017F>igne of getting <hi>Celadon</hi> out of <hi>Galatheas</hi> hand, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently returne unto this town, where <U+017F>he intended to work upon him under the <U+017F>hadow of the<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>This was the voyage of <hi>Leonida,</hi> who in her progre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aw the beginning of two great loves; that of <hi>Silvander</hi> under the umbrage of a wager, and that of <hi>Paris</hi> both unto <hi>Diana:</hi> for <hi>Paris</hi> did ever <U+017F>ince this day, fall <U+017F>o extreamly in love with her, that to get more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with her, he quitted his accu<U+017F>tomed life, and put on the habit of a Shepheard, and would be called <U+017F>o purpo<U+017F>ely to render him<U+017F>elfe more amiable in the eye of his Mi<U+017F>tris, who for her part did honour him, as his merits and good inclination to her did oblige her: but becau<U+017F>e we have much to <U+017F>ay of them, in the <U+017F>equell of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, therefore we will <U+017F>ay no more of them now.</p>
               <p>Returning then unto the Town as they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through the plain where commonly their flocks did feed, they e<U+017F>py'd a far off <hi>Tircis, Hylas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lycidas,</hi> the two fir<U+017F>t of which <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their actions to be in a very earne<U+017F>t argument: for the head, the arms, &amp; every part of <hi>Hylas</hi> did <U+017F>peak as much: As for <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he was all in him<U+017F>elfe, his hat pulled down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his eyes; his armes foulded, and looking upon his feet, did <U+017F>hew there was <U+017F>omthing which much affected his <U+017F>oul. And when they were within the ken of each other, <hi>Hylas</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53526:61"/>
e<U+017F>pying <hi>Phillis</hi> among<U+017F>t the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es; he left <hi>Tircis</hi> and went to her, then without any <U+017F>alute unto the re<U+017F>t of the company, he took her by the hand, and according to the u<U+017F>uall freedom of his humour; in plain tearmes he told her, how great a de<U+017F>ire he had to <U+017F>erve her. <hi>Phillis</hi> being glad to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the time with him, <U+017F>aid thus, I do not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> from whence this de<U+017F>ire of yours <U+017F>hould grow. For there is nothing in me which can invite it: if you do beleeve what you <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered he, then you are <U+017F>o much the more beholding to me; and if you do not beleeve it, then you mu<U+017F>t think me to be a man of judgement, and knowes who de<U+017F>erves my <U+017F>ervice, and <U+017F>o you mu<U+017F>t the more e<U+017F>teem me for it. Never doubt, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but however I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>teem you, and accept of your amitie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merits of its de<U+017F>ert, were it for no other con<U+017F>ideration, but becau<U+017F>e you are the fir<U+017F>t that ever loved me.</p>
               <p>As fortune was, <hi>Lycidas</hi> came in, ju<U+017F>t as the<U+017F>e words were <U+017F>poken, who<U+017F>e jealou<U+017F>ie was already grown to <U+017F>uch a height, as it did <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>e his affection; and as ill luck was, he came time enough to hear the an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Hylas</hi> returned unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> which was this: I know not, Fair <hi>Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> whether you will continue unto me the <U+017F>ame goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e you have begun; but if you do, I am <U+017F>ure <hi>Silvander</hi> will forbid the banes; and, if to plea<U+017F>e you, he do not, yet I am <U+017F>ure, that all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw him ye<U+017F>terday with you, will te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that he is your <U+017F>ervant: I cannot tell whether or no he left his love under his Pillow, but if he did not, you are his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Silvander</hi> never thought of <hi>Lycidas</hi> his love unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> but thinking it were a <U+017F>hame for him to di<U+017F>avow what <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>aid, al<U+017F>o concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he <U+017F>hould offend <hi>Phillis</hi> if he <U+017F>hould; e<U+017F>pecially before her face; he an<U+017F>wered thus unto him: Shepheard, you need not <U+017F>eek for any other te<U+017F>timony in this matter, but my <U+017F>elf: Never think, that the Shepheards of <hi>Lignon</hi> can <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon put on &amp; off their affection they are dull and gro<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>low in all they do; but, as the bigger the Naile is the greater weight it <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and is harder to be pulled out, <U+017F>o the more gro<U+017F><U+017F>e we are in our affections, the longer do they <U+017F>tay in our <U+017F>ouls So as if you have <U+017F>een me the Servant of this fair Shephearde<U+017F>s, very likely you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o again; for, we do not u<U+017F>e to change every time we <U+017F>leep; but, if you u<U+017F>e to do <U+017F>o, who have a hot brain, as the baldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your head, and curling of your hair doth <U+017F>hew, you mu<U+017F>t not judge of us, by your own more nimble and <U+017F>tirring inclination. <hi>Hylas</hi> hearing this Shepheard's freedome of language, and <U+017F>o pat to his own humour, did think, that either <hi>Tircis</hi> had told him <U+017F>omething, or el<U+017F>e, that he had known him formerly: And therefore, Shepheard, <U+017F>aid he, have you heretofore <U+017F>een me, or do you <U+017F>peak this of me by heare<U+017F>ay? I did never <U+017F>ee you before, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander;</hi> but your phy<U+017F>iognomie and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e does prompt me unto what I <U+017F>ay: For, one <U+017F>hall hardly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect another of that fault, whereof them<U+017F>elves are clear. Therefore, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you cannot be exempt from uncon<U+017F>tancy, <U+017F>ince you do <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me. Su<U+017F>pition, replied <hi>Silvander,</hi> proceeds either from <U+017F>ome little appearance, or from no appearance but our own imagination: but, what I <U+017F>ay of you is not upon any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, but upon a certain a<U+017F><U+017F>urance. Do you call it <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, when I heard you <U+017F>ay that you once loved <hi>Laonice,</hi> and then quitted her for another, that other for a third, and that third for <hi>Phillis,</hi> who doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will quit upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of any new commer? <hi>Tircis</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Hylas</hi> at a non-plus, began to fall thus upon him: <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>aid he, you are now plainly di<U+017F>covered, and it boots you not to conceal your <U+017F>elfe any longer; the di<U+017F>cerning eyes of this Shepheard can find out your incon<U+017F>tancy; and therefore your be<U+017F>t way is, to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the truth, again<U+017F>t which, if you contend, you will finde, that <U+017F>he will prove you a lyar, and <U+017F>o you will quite lo<U+017F>e your reputation: Confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it therefore freely and to encourage you, I will break the Ice and begin; Know, generous Shepheard, that this <hi>Hylas</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>tant, the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>loyall, and the mo<U+017F>t perfidious Shepheard that ever promi<U+017F>ed affection. Then added <hi>Phillis</hi> He does much oblige tho<U+017F>e whom he does not love. What Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> will you be al<U+017F>o again<U+017F>t me? Can you give any credit to the impo<U+017F>tures of this malitious man? Do you not <U+017F>ee, that <hi>Tircis,</hi> thinking him<U+017F>elfe obliged unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> for the <U+017F>entence which he gave on his <U+017F>ide, does think to repay it back, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing an ill opinion of me into you? What does that argue, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto <hi>Silvander)?</hi> What does it argue, <U+017F>aid the incon<U+017F>tant Shepheard? do you not know, that it is a greater difficulty to take a place which is already po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed, than one which is not taken up by any? His meaning is, added <hi>Silvander,</hi> that as long as you love him, it will be hard for me to get into your favour. But, my friend <hi>Hylas,</hi> I believe you are much mi<U+017F>taken; for, though I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>he daignes to ca<U+017F>t her eye a little upon you, yet, am I very confident of her amitie; for, out of a <U+017F>ound judgment I do know, that <U+017F>he will alwaies make choice of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53526:61"/>
better. To which <hi>Hylas</hi> an<U+017F>wered, Perhaps you think, vain-glorious Shepheard, that you have <U+017F>ome advantage of me; but, I pray, where does it lye? none can <U+017F>ee it, nor does my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e believe it. What kinde of a <U+017F>illy thing is he, that never had the courage or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to love and <U+017F>erve above one Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? and that too, <U+017F>o faintly and <U+017F>imply, as you would <U+017F>wear he mocked her: whereas I, that have loved as many Beauties as I have <U+017F>een, I have been bid welcome by them all. What pittifull <U+017F>ervice is to be expected from him, that knowes not where to begin? But I, that have courted and <U+017F>erved all <U+017F>orts, of all ages, conditions and humours, I can turn, and winde, and do any thing to plea<U+017F>e or di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e: And, for a proof of what I <U+017F>ay, I pray give me leave to catechi<U+017F>e him a little, that you may <U+017F>ee his <U+017F>illine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Then turning towards <hi>Silvander,</hi> he asked him, what that was, which would mo<U+017F>t oblige a fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e to love? It is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> to love only her. And what is it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> which will mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>e her? It is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> to love her extreamly. Do you <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> what a <U+017F>implician this is: Why, this is the way together <U+017F>corn and hatred; for, to love her only gives her an occa<U+017F>ion to think, that it is for want of courage that you dare not attempt to love any el<U+017F>e, and therefore <U+017F>he will <U+017F>corn <U+017F>uch a faint hearted Lover: whereas, did you love all you look upon, <U+017F>he would not think you come to her, becau<U+017F>e you knew not whither to go el<U+017F>e; but, <U+017F>he will then pri<U+017F>e you the higher, and will be obliged to love you, e<U+017F>pecially, if you particularize her above any other, and tell her <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tories which you have gleaned from others; then, once a week come and profe<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>ervice, or may be oftner, if a good occa<U+017F>ion require, this will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you more plea<U+017F>ing, and invite her to cheri<U+017F>h your company. This is the way, fond No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to oblige her unto love; but, to pule and plea<U+017F>e her continually, is the only way to make her look a<U+017F>quint at you: Nothing is <U+017F>o tiring and tedious, as the<U+017F>e huge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affections; <U+017F>uch as love, <U+017F>o, mu<U+017F>t needs be perpetually impri<U+017F>oned, never at liberty, alwaies pre<U+017F>ent, continually talking to her; <U+017F>he cannot <U+017F>tir a foot but you mu<U+017F>t do the like. To be briefe, you are abominably trouble<U+017F>ome to her. But, the Devill of all is, if <U+017F>he chance to be at any time ill, and do not <U+017F>mile upon you, nor plea<U+017F>e you for<U+017F>ooth, then mu<U+017F>t you put the finger to eye and cry; cry tears, in<U+017F>omuch as you force her to flie you. Do you think this to be the way to make her love you: No, no, it is in Love as in all things el<U+017F>e, the Mean is the be<U+017F>t Mea<U+017F>ure; <U+017F>o as to avoid all the<U+017F>e frivolous follies, the only way is to love but indifferently; and the be<U+017F>t way to plea<U+017F>e her, is to be plea<U+017F>ant, merry, and jocund; and, above all, never to be mute before her. This, <hi>Silvander,</hi> is the way to make a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e love you, and to get her favour. And you, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tra<U+017F><U+017F>e, may by this <U+017F>ee how to value my affection. She would have an<U+017F>wered, but <hi>Silvander</hi> be<U+017F>eeched her to give him leave to <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And then he did examine <hi>Hylas</hi> upon the<U+017F>e Interrogatories. What is it, Shepheard, that you de<U+017F>ire mo<U+017F>t when you do love? To be loved again, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas.</hi> But when you are loved, replied <hi>Silvander,</hi> what do you de<U+017F>ire or expect from this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? that the per<U+017F>on whom I love, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> do prize me above all others, that <U+017F>he tru<U+017F>t me, and endeavour to plea<U+017F>e me. Do you u<U+017F>e poy<U+017F>on to pre<U+017F>erve your life, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi> how can you ever expect <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould tru<U+017F>t you, when you are not faithfull unto her? Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall never know it. Then I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you will do that by treachery, which ought to be done with <U+017F>incerity: As long as <U+017F>he does not know that you love another, <U+017F>he thinks you faithfull, and <U+017F>o you <U+017F>hrond your <U+017F>elfe under this fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>hadow: You talk of <U+017F>corn, can any thing provoke a generous <U+017F>pirit more unto it, than to imagine, that this man whom I <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>e at your feet, adoring you, <U+017F>hould have his lips bli<U+017F>tered with the ki<U+017F><U+017F>es of others; and tho<U+017F>e eyes which <U+017F>eem to adore you, ready to <U+017F>parkle love at every woman they look upon? What <U+017F>hould any woman of any Soul, have any thing to do with a thing common? He will do no more for you, than he will for any one that has the re<U+017F>emblance of a woman; when he <U+017F>peaks to you, his minde is a hundred Leagues off, and is thinking of <U+017F>uch a one, that a thou<U+017F>and to one is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and degrees your inferiour; the words he makes u<U+017F>e of are <U+017F>ome fragments gleaned from another, <U+017F>uch as his heart never ownes: Oh! how horrid a <U+017F>corn de<U+017F>erves <U+017F>uch a man! As to the next point, which he urged to obtain love by, which is, To be jolly, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard, and alwaies laughing: Truly, that is a principall quality for a Buffon, or one that has nothing at his heart; but, for a Lover to be of that temper, is ab<U+017F>urd, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>uch a Lover as your <U+017F>elfe. Again, you <U+017F>ay that a mean in Love is the be<U+017F>t; but let me tell you, that he who is but halfe faithfull, is not faithfull at all; and he that loves not in the highe<U+017F>t point of extremity, does not love one jot, he who can be indifferent, and love all alike, cannot love one as he ought to do. Valourand Love are re<U+017F>emblant, and he that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53526:62"/>
can mea<U+017F>ure them, or thinks any greater than his own, is neither valiant, nor a lover worth a Ru<U+017F>h. So, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you <U+017F>ee, that to injoyn a mediocrity in Love, is to impo<U+017F>e an impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibility: And when you love <U+017F>o, you do as tho<U+017F>e melancholly fools do, that think they are expert in all Sciences, and know nothing: 'Tis ju<U+017F>t your ca<U+017F>e, in thinking you love, when you doe not. But be it <U+017F>o, that one can love a little; Do you not know, that Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath no other Harve<U+017F>t but Amity, and all that is <U+017F>owed, is onely to reap <U+017F>ome fruit? How can you, that <U+017F>ow but a little, ever expect to reap much? Ah, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you little know what belongs to Love: For tho<U+017F>e effects which belong to an extream love, and which you call Troubles, are <U+017F>o indeed, to <U+017F>uch as you, who know not how to love; but <U+017F>uch as are really, and in good earne<U+017F>t in love, and know what <U+017F>acrifices and duties belong unto the Altars of Love, they are <U+017F>o far from calling tho<U+017F>e effects, troubles, as they think them feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and perfect contentments. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I will tell you what it is to love; It is to dye in ones <U+017F>elf, that he may live in another: Never to love any thing but what is plea<U+017F>ing and agreeable unto the party loved. The will mu<U+017F>t be ab<U+017F>olutely transformed into a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tris: And can you think, that one who loves thus, will ever be troubled with the pre<U+017F>ence of her whom he loves? The knowledge <U+017F>he hath of being loved, is a thing <U+017F>o infinitely plea<U+017F>ing, as all things el<U+017F>e in compari<U+017F>on of that, have no reli<U+017F>h. And if you do but know what it is to love, you will never think that he who loves, can do any thing to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e. All his actions are marked with the <U+017F>weet character of love, and cannot be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing. If he chance to commit any fault the fault it <U+017F>elf plea<U+017F>eth, con<U+017F>idering with what intention it was committed. The very de<U+017F>ire of being amiable has <U+017F>uch vigour in a right Lover, as though he cannot chu<U+017F>e but be rough to all the world in general, yet will he be <U+017F>ure to <U+017F>mooth and <U+017F>pruce up him<U+017F>elf towards her he loves. And from hence is the rea<U+017F>on, that many, who are not at all relli<U+017F>hed by mo<U+017F>t in general, are yet loved and e<U+017F>teemed by <U+017F>ome one in particular.</p>
               <p>Do you <U+017F>ee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that hitherto you have been ignorant in the Laws of Love, and have only abu<U+017F>ed the Name of it, and deceived tho<U+017F>e whom you thought you had loved? How, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Have I not loved all this while? What then have I done unto <hi>Carles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muranthe, Laonice,</hi> and a hundred more? You mu<U+017F>t know, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that in all <U+017F>orts of Arts, there are both good and bad proficients in them: And <U+017F>o in Love; for <U+017F>ome do love well as I do, and <U+017F>ome ill as you: So as I may be termed the Ma<U+017F>ter, and you the Changling of Love.</p>
               <p>At this every one <U+017F>miled, except <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who hearing all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e grew higher in his jealous apprehen<U+017F>ions, which <hi>Phillis</hi> did not ob<U+017F>erve, thinking it rather an effect of his affection to her, <U+017F>ince in rea<U+017F>on he could never doubt her. One that is ignorant, and knows not that Jealou<U+017F>ie in Love is a <U+017F>ucker which draws unto it <U+017F>elf that nutriment which <U+017F>hould go into the branches and good fruit, does not know that the greater it is, the more doth it argue the kindne<U+017F>s of the place, and vigour of the plant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> who admired the neat wit of <hi>Silvander,</hi> did not know how to judge of him, but thought, that were he more conver<U+017F>ant among<U+017F>t civilized people, he would be unparaleld; <U+017F>ince living among<U+017F>t Shepheards, he was <U+017F>uch as he found him: And therefore he re<U+017F>olved to contract friend<U+017F>hip with him, to the end he might more freely enjoy his company; and to make them proceed in their di<U+017F>putation, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto him, It <U+017F>eems, <hi>Hylas,</hi> your cau<U+017F>e is naught, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o mute, and has not a word more to <U+017F>ay in the defence of it. No wonder, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana;</hi> for I beleeve he is pricked in con<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Hylas</hi> knowing that he argued all this while again<U+017F>t the truth, &amp; only to put a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om glo<U+017F>s upon his fault, he would not reply a word, but looked very attentively upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was got near unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and talked with him in a low voice; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> would not have him hear what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he did often interrupt him, and <U+017F>o often, as <U+017F>he forced him to <U+017F>ay, that if <hi>Phillis</hi> were as trouble<U+017F>om as <U+017F>he was, he <U+017F>hould not love her. Truly Shepheard, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, purpo<U+017F>ely to keep him from hearing, If you <U+017F>hould be as uncivil to her, as you are to us, <U+017F>he will make no great accompt of you. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> never heeding this talk, continued on her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>aid unto her, what <hi>Phillis</hi> is this all the duty you will pay unto me? Will you let me go, and entertain a Shepheard in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e? To which <hi>Phillis</hi> upon a <U+017F>udden an<U+017F>wered, No, no, I be<U+017F>eech you, Mi<U+017F>tris, but pardon my error; for I thought that the jolly di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> would have kept you from taking any notice of me, who in the mean time, was talking of a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which this Shepheard de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction in.

Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> did you but know again<U+017F>t whom you u<U+017F>e this language, you would rather bee dumb all your daies, than di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e this fair Shephearde<U+017F>s who, did you love her, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the lea<U+017F>t glimp<U+017F>e of her eye to make you the mo<U+017F>t wretched thing that ever loved.

If you do love me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and I have any power of you, then <U+017F>urely <U+017F>he hath much more.

What have I to doe with her pitty? <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> am I at her mercy? Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you are at her mercy; for my will is her will, and I can doe nothing but what <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to command. She is the Mi<U+017F>tris whom I do love, <U+017F>erve, and adore. So as <U+017F>he; and <U+017F>he onely is all my affection, all my <U+017F>ervice, and all my devotion. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Hylas,</hi> how you have offended her, and what mercy and pardon you <U+017F>tand in need of. Then <hi>Hylas,</hi> throwing him<U+017F>elf at <hi>Diana</hi>'s feet, after a little time of con<U+017F>ideration, thus <U+017F>aid unto her: Fair Mi<U+017F>tris ormine, if he that loves could have eyes to <U+017F>ee any thing but the thing loved, certainly, I had <U+017F>een that it is the duty of every one to honour and reverence your merits. But <U+017F>ince my eyes were <U+017F>hut again<U+017F>t all but my fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> I <U+017F>hall think you too full of cruelty, if you doe not pardon a crime, which I confe<U+017F>s, and beg a mercy for. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had a mind to be rid of this man, that <U+017F>he might talk unto <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> did interrupt <hi>Diana</hi> in her an<U+017F>wer, and told him, that <hi>Diana</hi> would not pardon him, unle<U+017F>s upon condition to relate all his Court<U+017F>hips and Adventures which he had ever <U+017F>ince he fir<U+017F>t loved: For it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be very delightful, <U+017F>ince he had <U+017F>uch variety of Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. Certainly <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> you can divine my thoughts; for I did intend not to pardon, but upon the <U+017F>ame condition: And therefore <hi>Hylas,</hi> if you expect any mercy from me, re<U+017F>olve upon it. How, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> will you force me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>uch a Rock, as may chance to <U+017F>plit me; and con<U+017F>train me to relate the <U+017F>tory of my life before my Mi<U+017F>tris?

               <p>WILL you needs have it <U+017F>o, fair Mi<U+017F>tris of my Mi<U+017F>tris, and you noble <hi>Paris,</hi> that I mu<U+017F>t tell all my fortune ever <U+017F>ince I began fir<U+017F>t to Love? I pray doe not think that the refu<U+017F>al which I made, was becau<U+017F>e I had nothing to <U+017F>ay: For, beleeve me, I have loved too many to want <U+017F>ubject; but it was becau<U+017F>e me-thinks we want day. I doe not mean to tell you all, but to tell you one of my Adventures; for all would require a little Age before the <U+017F>tory would be ended. Yet in obedience to your commands, I will begin, and be<U+017F>eech you to con<U+017F>ider, that every one is <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uperiour Power, again<U+017F>t which there is no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: That predominate Power unto which I am <U+017F>o violently devoted, is Love: otherwi<U+017F>e perhaps you will wonder, that there <U+017F>hould be no chain, either of duty or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <U+017F>trong enough to hold me. I mu<U+017F>t freely confe<U+017F>s, that as every one has a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, that mine is unto Incon<U+017F>tancy, for which I ought not to be blamed, <U+017F>ince it is the decree of Heaven upon me. Among<U+017F>t all the fine Scituations which the River <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> doth in his impetuous cour<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>it, after it hath taken in <hi>Arar, I<U+017F>eres, Durance,</hi> and <U+017F>everal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rivers, it da<U+017F>heth it <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t the old walls of the Town of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Metropolis of its Country, the be<U+017F>t peopled, and riche<U+017F>t of all the Roman Provinces: Near unto this good Town did encamp (as I have heard our <hi>Druides</hi> <U+017F>ay) the great Commander, called <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> a little before that <U+017F>ignal Victory which he obtained again<U+017F>t the <hi>Cimbres,</hi> the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi> and the <hi>Celts,</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who being gone through the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thique</hi> Ocean with intentions to <U+017F>ack <hi>Rome,</hi> were <U+017F>o defeated by this great Captain, that not one of them came off with life: And if the Roman Arms did <U+017F>pare any, the barbarous fury of their courage did turn their own hands again<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, and being a<U+017F>hamed to live, killed one another. Then, the Roman Army, for the <U+017F>ecurity of their Allies and Friends, came to encamp before this Town; and according to the cu<U+017F>tome of that Nation, did circle about their Camp with a mo<U+017F>t profound and deep Trench, which extended to the very banks of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> who<U+017F>e impetuous <U+017F>ource was <U+017F>uch, as entring into tho<U+017F>e Trenches, did divide its chanel into two wales: The ancient River ran its old cour<U+017F>e, and the new had <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F>s by the<U+017F>e Trenches, as did equal the greate<U+017F>t Rivers, and made a mo<U+017F>t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant &amp; fertile I<U+017F>land between them: And becau<U+017F>e of the Trenches of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> the people call it corruptively, <hi>Carmargue;</hi> and the<U+017F>e two Armes of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> running into the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea, they call the I<U+017F>le between them <hi>Camargue.</hi> I <U+017F>hould not have derived the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree of this place <U+017F>o high, had it not been the place which gave me birth, and where my Ance<U+017F>tors have long continued: Where by rea<U+017F>on of the places abundant fertility, many Shepheards re<U+017F>ort; and my Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors ever held a con<U+017F>iderable rank among<U+017F>t them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes e<U+017F>teemed both rich and virtuous; and when they dyed, left me enough to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and indeed too <U+017F>oon for me did my Father dye, <U+017F>ince it was the very <U+017F>ame day that I was born; and my Mother, who had the education of me, did doat upon me as her only child, or rather <U+017F>poyled me. Judge what a fine Ma<U+017F>ter of a hou<U+017F>e I was: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of my young imperfections, I could not avoyd that of Pride, thinking that all the Shepheards in <hi>Camargue</hi> ought of duty to reverence me: And when I was grown to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years, I thought every Shephearde<U+017F>s was in love with me, and that any of them would bee beholding to me for my affection. I was mo<U+017F>t fortified in that opinion by a fair and wi<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F>s, my neighbour, called <hi>Carlis,</hi> who carre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me extreamly. I was yet <U+017F>o young, that the pangs of Love could not much torment me, <U+017F>o as I did onely re<U+017F>ent the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of her favours, and that was all. My age did not permit me to know whether or no it was Love; but however I was infinitely plea<U+017F>ed in the company of this Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s, and u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch court<U+017F>hip as they doe who are in love: So as this continual practice made many think that I knew more than my age permitted: And therefore when I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at eighteen or nineteen years of age, I found my <U+017F>elf deeply engaged to <U+017F>erve her: But <U+017F>ince I never affected that vainglorious humour which mo<U+017F>t Lovers u<U+017F>e to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them<U+017F>elves, which is, to be reputed con<U+017F>tant; the kind treatment of <hi>Carlis</hi> obliged mee much more than that imaginary duty. And therefore, one of my chiefe<U+017F>t and familiarie<U+017F>t friends took an occa<U+017F>ion to divert mee from her; his name was <hi>Hermantes,</hi> who, ere I was well aware, was <U+017F>o deeply and de<U+017F>perately in love with <hi>Carlis,</hi> that hee had no felicity or contentment, but in being near her.

Upon the<U+017F>e grounds, I di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Carlis</hi> from any <U+017F>hare in my thoughts, and made choi<U+017F>e of one whom I thought more de<U+017F>erving: and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I was not mi<U+017F>taken, for <U+017F>he was one that had beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to make one love her, and prudence enough to behave her<U+017F>elfe, her name was <hi>Still ana,</hi> e<U+017F>teemed to be the faire<U+017F>t and wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t in all the I<U+017F>le, and <U+017F>uch a one as did draw me out of my former error. But, <U+017F>ee the fondne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my proud fancy, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had been courted by very many, and all of them ba<U+017F>tled, I did the more willingly fall on, to the end my merits might be the more noted. <hi>Carlis,</hi> who did really love me, wondred at the alteration, not knowing what occa<U+017F>ion I could have for it; but to reduce me to her <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <U+017F>he began to ca<U+017F>t about, and u<U+017F>e all manner of allurements <U+017F>he could devi<U+017F>e; yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now upon the main Ocean, could not think upon any landing <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon. But, though <U+017F>he was much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at this <U+017F>eparation; yet, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>hortly after revenged, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>ame that cau<U+017F>ed her mi<U+017F>ery. For, imagining with my<U+017F>elfe, that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I gave <hi>Stillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> any a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my love, <U+017F>he would freely re<U+017F>igne her<U+017F>elfe unto me; therefore the fir<U+017F>t time that I met her at a dancing meeting, I <U+017F>aid thus unto her as we danced together; Faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I cannot tell what power it is which you have, nor what kinde of charmes they are which <U+017F>parkle from your fair eyes: but, I am <U+017F>ure <hi>Hylas</hi> is <U+017F>o much your <U+017F>ervant, that no mortall can be more. She thought I mock'd her, knowing how I loved <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and therefore in a <U+017F>miling manner, an<U+017F>wered thus: Is this the language, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you learned in the School of <hi>Carlis?</hi> I would have an<U+017F>wered, when by the order of the Ball we parted, <U+017F>o as I was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>tay till the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly parted; then <U+017F>eeing her go out the fir<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>tepped to her and took her by the hand At the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled, afterwards <U+017F>aid thus unto me, Is it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> out of re<U+017F>olution, or out of command, that you apply your <U+017F>elfe this night unto me? I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid I, why do you ask that que<U+017F>tion? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he I <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o little rea<U+017F>on for it, as I mu<U+017F>t needs think it one of the<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions. It is, <U+017F>aid I, out of a re<U+017F>olution never to love any but the fair <hi>Stilliana,</hi> and your beauty commands me never to love any other. I believe, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that you are mi<U+017F>taken, and does not think you <U+017F>peak unto me, or el<U+017F>e you do not know me but, not to let you run on any longer in your error know, that I am not <hi>Carlis,</hi> but my name is <hi>Stilliana.</hi> He mu<U+017F>t be blinde, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered I, that takes you for <hi>Carlis,</hi> <U+017F>he comes infinitely too much <U+017F>hort of you, to take her for you, or you for her: But I do know, too well for my liberty, that you are <hi>Stilliana;</hi> and it would be more my tranquillity if I knew it le<U+017F><U+017F>e. Thus I talked her to her lodging, not knowing whether I was welcome to her or no. It was no <U+017F>ooner day the next morning, then I went unto <hi>Hermantes,</hi> to tell him the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the la<U+017F>t night. I found him in Bed; and perceiving me to be netled at <U+017F>omething, Well, <U+017F>aid he, what newes? is the victory gotten before the combat? Ah friend, <U+017F>aid I, I have been pittifully bafled, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>daines me mocks me, and at every word <U+017F>ends me to <hi>Carlis</hi> <U+017F>he will treat me as a cruell Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and laughs at me. But <hi>Hermantes</hi> knowing my fleeting di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and fearing that indeed I would return to <hi>Carlis,</hi> al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he would entertain me, he an<U+017F>wered me thus, Why, friend, did you ever expect any le<U+017F><U+017F>e from her? would you e<U+017F>teem her worthy of your love, if <U+017F>he give her<U+017F>elfe unto you, before <U+017F>he knowes whether you do really love her? How could <U+017F>he po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly, at the very fir<U+017F>t, give any credit to you, <U+017F>ince all the I<U+017F>le knowes, you heretofore loved <hi>Carlis?</hi> Certainly, <U+017F>he were very ea<U+017F>ily vanqui<U+017F>hed, if <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall an attempt <U+017F>hould win her. But friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, is it not fir<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>ite I acquaint her with my <U+017F>lighting of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> before I do declare my love unto her? It <U+017F>eemes, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hermantes,</hi> that you are ignorant in Love<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I mu<U+017F>t tell you, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that when a declaration of Love is made unto a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he never well believes it at the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e it is the common cu<U+017F>tome and garb of all Shepheards, to be courteous and civill, and the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of their Sex, does
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53526:64"/>
oblige men to <U+017F>erve and honour them in generall. On the contrary, upon the lea<U+017F>t appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any hatred, they do ea<U+017F>ily think them<U+017F>elves to be hated; becau<U+017F>e amitie is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and enmity the contrary. From hence I argue, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that it is much more ea<U+017F>ie to make <hi>Carlis</hi> believe you hate her, than to per<U+017F>wade <hi>Stilliana,</hi> that you love her. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e you finde, that your affection unto <hi>Carlis</hi> does <U+017F>tick upon her <U+017F>tomack, your be<U+017F>t way is, to make her know that you do not love this <hi>Carlis,</hi> which you mu<U+017F>t do by <U+017F>ome action, made known, not only unto <hi>Carlis,</hi> but unto <hi>Stilliana</hi> and many others. To be briefe, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, he knew <U+017F>o well how to turn me any way he plea<U+017F>ed, that I writ this Letter unto the poor <hi>Carlis.</hi>

To be brief, Fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I flattered up this old woman with <U+017F>uch candid language, that <U+017F>he loved me, none better; and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me, <U+017F>he did contrary to her cu<U+017F>tom, command her Daughter in Law to Love me al<U+017F>o.

The Ma<U+017F>ter of the Boat being very civill, did very kindly receive her; and <U+017F>o the next morning <U+017F>he went into the Boat with us: She was fair, and <U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t and di<U+017F>creet, as <U+017F>he was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e commendable for her vertue than her beauty; but, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad and melancholly, as <U+017F>he moved all the company to pitty her: And I being ever very compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate towards the afflicted, I did, among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, extreamly pitty her al<U+017F>o, and cheered her up as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could: at which <hi>Floriante</hi> was nothing plea<U+017F>ed, nor <hi>Aymea</hi> neither. Now, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, that though a woman do put a fained glo<U+017F><U+017F>e upon it, yet, <U+017F>he cannot for her life choo<U+017F>e, but re<U+017F>ent the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of any Lover, as thinking it an affront unto her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and beauty being a thing mo<U+017F>t deer unto that Sex, it is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible thing that is in them. However, I, that began to blend a little Love with my compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, not <U+017F>eeming to regard the<U+017F>e two Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, did continue on my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto this; and among<U+017F>t otherthings, to the end we <U+017F>hould not let down di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and al<U+017F>o to have more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with her, I did intreat her to tell me the occa<U+017F>ion of her <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e; and <U+017F>he being fluent in courte<U+017F>ie, began thus:</p>
               <p>The compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you <U+017F>eem to have of my griefe, obligeth me, courteous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, to give you that <U+017F>atisfaction which you de<U+017F>ire; and I <U+017F>hould think it a great crime to refu<U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a thing: But yet, I do be<U+017F>eech you to con<U+017F>ider the condition I am in, and excu<U+017F>e me, if I do abbreviate my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e into as little room as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I can. Know then, Shepheard, that I was born upon the coa<U+017F>t of the River <hi>Loire,</hi> where I have been educated with as much tender care, as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly one of my quality could be, untill the fifteenth year of my age. My name is <hi>Cloris,</hi> my Father's <hi>Leonces,</hi> Brother to <hi>Gere<U+017F>tan,</hi> into who<U+017F>e hands I was transferred after the death of my Father and Mother. And here I began to re<U+017F>ent the blowes of fortune; for, my Uncle having more care of his own Children than of me, did think him<U+017F>elfe overcharged with me. All the comfort I had was in his Wife, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Callirea,</hi> for <U+017F>he loved me, and furni<U+017F>hed me with all things that I wanted, unknown to her Husband. But the heavens had decreed to afflict me; for, when <hi>Filander, Callirea's</hi> Brother, was killed, <U+017F>he took his death <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly, that within a few daies after <U+017F>he died, and I was left, with her two Daughters, <U+017F>o young, as could afford me no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. It happened, that a Shepheard of the Province of <hi>Viennoi<U+017F>e,</hi> called <hi>Ro<U+017F>idon,</hi> came to vi<U+017F>it the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which is upon the coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Furan,</hi> <U+017F>eated upon a high Rock, which elevates its head above all the re<U+017F>t of the Mountains: That day on which he came thither, was a day of great <U+017F>olemnitie, and many Shepheards and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were there al<U+017F>o. It would be impertinent to relate all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and the manner how he declared his Love unto me: but <U+017F>o it was, that ever <U+017F>ince that day he has <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted him<U+017F>elfe to me, as he became wholly mine. He was young and hand<U+017F>ome; and as for his E<U+017F>tate, it was much better than ever I could hope for: Moreover, his Spirit and his Body were <U+017F>o re<U+017F>emblant and <U+017F>utable, as did make up a mo<U+017F>t perfect compo<U+017F>ure. His court<U+017F>hip continued four years, in all which time, I cannot <U+017F>ay, he ever did or thought any thing, which he did not render me an account of, and asked my advice This extream <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion and long continuance, did a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of his Love and merits, and obliged me to love him extreamly. We lived and loved thus above a year, in as much perfect amitie, as could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be between two Lovers, and at la<U+017F>t, our joyes were compleated in our Marriage. Now were we as happy as Mortalls could be, conducted we were to the Temple, the Songs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53526:66"/>
of <hi>Hymen</hi> did <U+017F>ound on all <U+017F>ides; and being returned to our lodgings, nothing was to be heard but In<U+017F>truments of joy; and when we were in the height of felicity, we were <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the mo<U+017F>t aver<U+017F>e fate that ever chanced unto any. We were then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the greate<U+017F>t part of <hi>Ro<U+017F>idor's</hi> E<U+017F>tate did lie. It hapned, that <U+017F>ome debauched young fellowes of tho<U+017F>e Townes about <hi>Lyons,</hi> where our Druides u<U+017F>e to keep the mis<U+017F>ltoe which they got in the great Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>Mars,</hi> would needs commit <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>orders, which my Husband could not brook but after <U+017F>ome gentle di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions, did hinder them in the execution; at which they were <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed, that (thinking they could not anger <hi>Ro<U+017F>idor</hi> wor<U+017F>e, then to affront me) one of them offered to throw a gla<U+017F><U+017F>e of Inke in my face: but, I <U+017F>eeing the blow coming, turned a<U+017F>ide my head, <U+017F>o as I had none of it light upon me but in my neck, the marks whereof are yet very fre<U+017F>h. My Husband <U+017F>eeing my brea<U+017F>t full of Inke and blood, did think that I was wounded, and therefore drew his <U+017F>word, and ran it through the body of him that gave me this affront, and afterwards, with the help of <U+017F>ome friends, did drive them away. Judge, Shepheard, how much I was troubled; for, I thought my <U+017F>elfe wor<U+017F>e wounded than I was, and when I <U+017F>aw my husband all bloody, with a wound which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on his <U+017F>houlder. But, after this fir<U+017F>t fray was parted, and his wound <U+017F>earched, he had no <U+017F>ooner dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe, but Officers came to <U+017F>eize upon him, and carried him away with <U+017F>uch violence, that they would not permit me <U+017F>o much as to bid him adieu; but, my affection was <U+017F>o much above their denyall, that I did come unto him, and held him about the neck <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that they could hardly pull me off. On the other <U+017F>ide, he <U+017F>eeing me in this condition and chu<U+017F>ing rather to die, than to part from me, did <U+017F>o <U+017F>hew both his love and courage, that though wounded, yet he broke from them, and got out of the Town: This kept him from an Impri<U+017F>onment, but it made his cau<U+017F>e wor<U+017F>e in the eye of Ju<U+017F>tice, which cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everall Proclamations to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out again<U+017F>t him: During all which time, his greate<U+017F>t griefe was, that he could not be with me; and his de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing me being very great; he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe, and in the night came unto me, and there <U+017F>tayed: God knowes how great my joyes were, and al<U+017F>o how great my fears for, I knew, that his pur<U+017F>uers, knowing his love to me, would have all eyes about the hou<U+017F>e, and do all they could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him: And it hapned as I alwaies feared: for there he was taken, and carried to <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither pre<U+017F>ently I followed, and very opportunely for him: for, the Judges, whom I continually <U+017F>olicited, had <U+017F>o much pitty of me, that they <U+017F>hewed him favour: and <U+017F>o, maugre all the pur<U+017F>uit of his enemies, he was delivered. As I had abundance of trouble in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o, courteous Shepheard, I had abundance of joy to <U+017F>ee him out of all danger: But, becau<U+017F>e his Pri<U+017F>on had made him very <U+017F>ick, he was forced to <U+017F>tay a few daies in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and I with him, endeavouring to cheer him up as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could. At la<U+017F>t being out of danger, he entreated me to go unto his hou<U+017F>e, and prepare all things for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his friends, whom he would invite to rejoyce with him, for his good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e in his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e: When I was gone, the<U+017F>e debauched fellowes <U+017F>eeing they could not revenge them<U+017F>elves by Law, they re<U+017F>olved to murder him in his bed and entring into his lodging, gave him two or three <U+017F>tabbs with a Dagger, and leaving him dead as they thought, fled. Judge, kinde Shepheard, what cau<U+017F>e have I to grieve at this fatall accident.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Cloris</hi> her <U+017F>tory, with eyes <U+017F>wimming in tears, which dropped upon her fair brea<U+017F>t like links of Pearl. Now, generous Shepheard, this which I am now about to tell you, is a fre<U+017F>h gale of Love: The <U+017F>orrowes which I <U+017F>aw in this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, moved me unto <U+017F>o much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that though her face perhaps was not able to cau<U+017F>e love, yet plain pitty touched me <U+017F>o to the quick, that I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, neither <hi>Carlis, Stilliana, Aymea, Floriana,</hi> nor all of them together, ever tyed me in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong chaines, as this poor de<U+017F>olate <hi>Cloris;</hi> not that I did not love tho<U+017F>e, but becau<U+017F>e there was yet a place void in my <U+017F>oul for this Thus <U+017F>ee me re<U+017F>olved upon <hi>Cloris</hi> as upon the re<U+017F>t; but I knew it was to no purpo<U+017F>e to mention my love unto her, untill <hi>Ro<U+017F>idor</hi> were either dead or recovered, for her <U+017F>orrowes had taken up all her <U+017F>oul. Thus came we to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where every one parted, and my new affection unto <hi>Cloris</hi> moved me to wait upon her to her lodging, where I did vi<U+017F>it <hi>Ro<U+017F>idor,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to be acquainted with her; for I knew, the way to get into the favour of the Wife, was, to begin with the Husband. She thought, he had been much more wounded than <U+017F>he found him, (for what one fears, is alwaies apprehended in the wor<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>e) and changed colour when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him up, and walking about the Chamber. But <U+017F>ee how things happen, the <U+017F>orrowes of <hi>Cloris</hi> in the Boat was the ground of my affection; and now her joyes and contentment makes it die, which argues, that a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e may be cured by its contraries: for, I entred into the hou<U+017F>e a captive, and went out a man of liberty, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53526:67"/>
Ma<U+017F>ter of my <U+017F>elfe: But, con<U+017F>idering this accident, I called <hi>Aymea</hi> and <hi>Floriante</hi> into my memory again. Now am I pre<U+017F>ently in que<U+017F>t of their lodgings, and enquiring of every one I met with; at la<U+017F>t by fortune, I found them both together. The next morning was the great Fea<U+017F>t of <hi>Venus,</hi> and according to the cu<U+017F>tome of the day, the preceding day unto the Fe<U+017F>tivall, the Maids do <U+017F>ing in the Temple Authems, unto the honour of that godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and remain there untill midnight: I heard, that the Step-mother of <hi>Aymea</hi> would be then there in performance of her vow; <hi>Floriante,</hi> at the earne<U+017F>t reque<U+017F>t of <hi>Aymea,</hi> promi<U+017F>ed to be there al<U+017F>o: And I re<U+017F>olved to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe in the habit of a Virgin, and to get in when it was dark: and when I was in, I <U+017F>tayed in the mo<U+017F>t blinde and lea<U+017F>t frequented cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Temple till it was nine or ten of the clock. Then was the dores <U+017F>hut, and not a man but my <U+017F>elf in, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ome that might be as full of curio<U+017F>ity as my <U+017F>elfe and <U+017F>o di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ed: but when the Hymnes began, then came I out of my lurking corner: And becau<U+017F>e the Temple was very large, and had no lights but <U+017F>uch as was about the Altar, I might the more <U+017F>afely mingle among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of the Virgins, without fear of being knowne. Then looking about me where <hi>Aymea</hi> was, I <U+017F>aw her carry a taper unto a young Virgin, who ri<U+017F>ing up, aprpoached the Altar; and after <U+017F>ome certain ceremonies <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome <U+017F>taves, which at the end of every <U+017F>tave was an<U+017F>wered by all the company as a <hi>Chorus:</hi> I know not whether it was the dimne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the light. (For it does often hide the imperfections of a complexion) or what it was, or whether <U+017F>he was really very faire, but <U+017F>o it was, that as <U+017F>oone as ever I <U+017F>aw her, I loved her. Some affirme that Love proceeds from the eyes of the party loved but this cannot be; for her eye never looked upon me, nor did mine <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>o much as to know her againe; and this was the rea<U+017F>on that I thru<U+017F>t in among<U+017F>t the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es that <U+017F>tood neere<U+017F>t her. But, but as ill luck was, after I had with much dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gotten neere her, <U+017F>he ended her Anthem, and carried her taper into its wonted place, <U+017F>o as it became <U+017F>o darke that though neere her, yet could I not well <U+017F>ee her. Yet in hope that eyther <U+017F>he or <U+017F>ome other would ere long <U+017F>ing again, I <U+017F>tayed there a little longer, but I perceived the light was carried into another Quire, and pre<U+017F>ently after, one that was there began to <U+017F>ing, as my new, and unknown Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s had done before: the difference betwixt them both in voice and face, was very great, for neither was comparable unto her that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to love: <U+017F>o as not being able to hold out any longer, I addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe unto a Lady was the further off from any company, and counterfetting my voice as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I could, I asked her who it was that <U+017F>ung the la<U+017F>t before. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you are a meere <U+017F>tranger that askes this que<U+017F>tion, and does not know her. Perhaps, <U+017F>aid I, I <U+017F>hould know her, did I heare her named. Who does not know that, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, by her face, does ask that que<U+017F>tion in vain; but to <U+017F>atisfie you, her name is <hi>Cyrcenna,</hi> the faire<U+017F>t Virgin that is in all the Country, and <U+017F>o known unto every-one, that if you do not know her, certainly you are of another world. Hitherto I counterfeited my voice <U+017F>o well, that as the night deceived her eyes, <U+017F>o my words did her eares, but not forgetting my <U+017F>elfe I told her, that in recompence of that favour <U+017F>he had done me no man could be more her <U+017F>ervant then my <U+017F>elfe. How's this <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, who are you that u<U+017F>eth any <U+017F>uch lauguage unto me? then ob<U+017F>erving me a little more neerely, <U+017F>he found by my dre<U+017F><U+017F>e and Garb, what I was<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Then in a great amaze <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me? how dur<U+017F>t you be <U+017F>o bold, as thus to break the holy lawes of this <U+017F>acred place? do you not know, that you mu<U+017F>t expiate this crime with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your life? The truth is I did not think the puni<U+017F>hment had been <U+017F>o great: but <U+017F>eeming unto her, to be a <U+017F>tranger, and ignorant of their <U+017F>tatutes, <U+017F>he took pitty upon me and <U+017F>aid that it was a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to obtain a pardon, <U+017F>o rigorous was the law. Yet <U+017F>eeing that I did not come with any bad intention, <U+017F>he would do what <U+017F>he could to <U+017F>ave me. And in order to that, I mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tay untill th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But now the dore was <U+017F>hut, yet <U+017F>he would try if <U+017F>he could get it open; then putting a vaile upon my head and lending me her Mantle, it did <U+017F>o muffle me up as in the night none could know whether I was man or woman: being thus equipped, <U+017F>he told one of her neighbours that came with her <U+017F>he was not well <U+017F>o they went both together to de<U+017F>ire the key of the dore upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion.

Tis true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but I did never feare being more obliged, unto tho<U+017F>e who already have entirely obliged me; your obligations <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> are none of the longe<U+017F>t dates, for you can break loo<U+017F>e from them when you plea<U+017F>e. It's good, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered he, to have two <U+017F>trings to a bow, for if one fail the other may do <U+017F>ervice: and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>Phillis</hi> is glad I am of that humour, for otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might <U+017F>leight my <U+017F>ervice.

               </p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Lycidas</hi> was talking with <hi>Phillis;</hi> and his jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Silvander</hi> did <U+017F>o torment him, that he was not able to bear the weight of it upon his heart untill the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: he was <U+017F>o much out of him<U+017F>elfe, as he never minded whether any eares could overhear; but thinking he was alone with her, after a hundred deep <U+017F>ighes, he thus began to ea<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Phillis,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) that the heavens <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>erve my life <U+017F>o long as to make me re<U+017F>ent your infidelity? The Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e who expected any other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>ooner than this, was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized at it, that <U+017F>he could not an<U+017F>wer; and the Shepheard <U+017F>eeing her mute, and thinking it was onely to pump for <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on: You have rea<U+017F>on indeed, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e not to give me any an<U+017F>wer; for your eyes do too well <U+017F>peak the truth to let me ever hope for any happine<U+017F><U+017F>ie: and your <U+017F>ilence does but too well an<U+017F>wer and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of what I de<U+017F>ire to know. The Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e being extreamly offended at this language, did in a very angry maner give him this an<U+017F>wer Since my eyes can <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o wel for me, why would you have me an<U+017F>wer you any otherwi<U+017F>e? &amp; if my <U+017F>ilence can <U+017F>o wel inform you of my infidelity, that all my former actions cannot a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of my affection, do you think I can ever hope that words wil be a better te<U+017F>timony? but I perceive, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that you would gladly make an hone<U+017F>t retreat: you have a de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where el<U+017F>e, and not daring it without <U+017F>ome colorable excu<U+017F>e of your levitie, you faign the<U+017F>e Chimeras of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, that your fault may reflect upon me. But, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> bring out your rea<U+017F>ons to the Te<U+017F>t, let us <U+017F>ee what they are; and if you will not, then get you gone and do not accu<U+017F>e me with your own crimes: let your continuall complaints wherewith you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both heaven and earth, reflect upon <U+017F>ome body el<U+017F>e not me, who am mo<U+017F>t mortally di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed at them. My doubts did much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, replyed the Shepheard, but this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which your tart language gives me, makes me die. I pray you <U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F>s, what are your feares? Not little ones, an<U+017F>wered he, <U+017F>ince the complaints which proceed from them does trouble both heaven and earth, as you do upbraid me. And if you would know them I will in few words tell you, that I fear <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Is it <U+017F>o Shepheard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Phillis;</hi> can you think that I do not love you. Yet remember what you did for me and <hi>Olimpia?</hi> Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>ider my former actions, yet make any <U+017F>uch doubts? I do know, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, that you did love me; and had I doubted it, my griefe had not been <U+017F>o great as it is: but I feare a great wound though it do not kil, yet it wil leave a <U+017F>carr: and that which love made in you, does only leave a mark that it was a wound.</p>

which heretofore you have given of your affection, for it may be that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me in your Love, as it <U+017F>eemes you do your <U+017F>elfe in mine.

               <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> were talking thus, thinking the<U+017F>e words were heard only by them<U+017F>elves, and that Trees have no ears, <hi>Silvander</hi> was behind a Tree, and lo<U+017F>t not a <U+017F>yllable: <hi>Laonice</hi> al<U+017F>o, who was a<U+017F>leep there, <U+017F>he wakened at the beginning of their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, and knowing them both, was very glad <U+017F>he was there <U+017F>o opportunely, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her <U+017F>elfe, that before they parted, they would impart many <U+017F>ecrets unto each other, which <U+017F>he might employ to their ruine; and it happened according to her hopes, for <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>ay, that he was jealous, asked him, Of whom? and Why? Oh Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the wounded <hi>Lycidas,</hi> do you ask me this que<U+017F>tion? I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, from whence proceeds all that faint and hollow coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, which you have u<U+017F>ed towards me of late? and that great familiarity with <hi>Silvander,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e your affection to me had been withdrawn and conferr'd upon him. Ah Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, you mu<U+017F>t not think, but my heart is very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of <U+017F>uch blowes, <U+017F>ince it hath re<U+017F>ented tho<U+017F>e from your fair, but fal<U+017F>e eyes: how came you to fall off from me? why would not you <U+017F>peak as familiarly unto me as you were wont? where is all the care which heretofore you u<U+017F>ed, in enquiring how I did? and your griefe, when I was at any time ab<U+017F>ent? You can remember, when the name of <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> founded <U+017F>weetly in your ears? and I do remember, when out of the abundance of your heart, you named him when you <U+017F>hould have named another: But now, who but <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Silvander</hi> is in the <U+017F>ame heart and tongue, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> had once a con<U+017F>iderable room; but now, the verie<U+017F>t <U+017F>tranger in all the Country, is preferred before him, that is <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Lycidas</hi> that ever he was, and was born only unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> whom he now <U+017F>u<U+017F>pects.</p>
               <p>The extream di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Lycidas</hi> did force out <U+017F>o many words, as <hi>Phillis</hi> could not put in one by way of interruption; for, if <U+017F>he opened her mouth to <U+017F>peak, he <U+017F>till continued on with more vehemency, not con<U+017F>idering, that the more he complained, the more his mi<U+017F>ery encrea<U+017F>ed, and that if any thing could cure him, it was that an<U+017F>wer which he would not hear: And, never con<U+017F>idering that it was his torrent of words which hindred the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e from an<U+017F>wering, he conceived, that her <U+017F>ilence proceeded from her guilt, <U+017F>o as every action that <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed, did more and more augment his jealou<U+017F>ie. The Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e all this while was <U+017F>o amazed and offended, that <U+017F>he had not time to convince him of his error; but, though <U+017F>omething dark, he <U+017F>aw her blu<U+017F>h, at lea<U+017F>t thought <U+017F>o, which then did put him out of all; taking that for granted now, which he did but doubt of before. Thus, after he had called upon the Gods, that were ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hers of all infidelitie, he ran away from her through the wood, and would not hear her, when <U+017F>he call'd him back; <U+017F>he followed, intending to convince him of his error, but it was in vain; for, he ran <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>he quickly lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of him in the thick wood. In the mean time, <hi>Laonice</hi> was very glad that <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>covered this affection, and to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o good a beginning of her de<U+017F>igne, and therefore <U+017F>he retired: <hi>Silvander</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>o apt to be jealous, he re<U+017F>olved for the future to be the bellowes, that would blow it into a greater flame, and would <U+017F>eem, as if he loved <hi>Phillis</hi> in earne<U+017F>t, the next time he <U+017F>aw him with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> in the mean time came to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and letting him under<U+017F>tand, that <hi>Galathea</hi> had extraordinary bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with him; he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>et out as <U+017F>oon as the Moon began to <U+017F>hine, which would be about an houre before day, and accordingly they did <U+017F>o: When they were come to the bottom of the Hill, and had only a long plain to go through, before they came to the Pallace of <hi>I<U+017F>aure,</hi> the Nymph, at the reque<U+017F>t of her Uncle, began to relate the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e thus.</p>

               <p>DO not wonder, I be<U+017F>eech you, Father (for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he called him) I <U+017F>hould entreat you to hear me with patience, and when you <U+017F>ee occa<U+017F>ion, to remember, that it is the very <U+017F>ame Love which is the cau<U+017F>e of all this, which in former times has driven you upon the like, if not <U+017F>tranger accidents. I dur<U+017F>t never have <U+017F>poken to you about it, had I not had both permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion and a command to do it: But <hi>Galathea,</hi> whom the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s concerns, doth earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he hath made choice of you for the Phy<U+017F>ician to cure her, that you <U+017F>hould be acquainted with it, both the beginning and progre<U+017F>s, and that it may be kept <U+017F>ecret from all the world. The <hi>Druide</hi> (who knew what reverence was due unto his Lady (for <U+017F>o he reputed her) did an<U+017F>wer, that his Prudence taught him to conceal any thing that concerned <hi>Galathea,</hi> and therefore any promi<U+017F>e concerning that, was <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Upon that a<U+017F><U+017F>urance (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. It is a long time <U+017F>ince <hi>Polemas</hi> fir<U+017F>t begun to love <hi>Galathea:</hi> To tell you how it came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, is to no purpo<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>o it was, he did love her. This love proceeded <U+017F>o on, that <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> her <U+017F>elf could not be ignorant of it, but did many times in private make it appear, that his <U+017F>ervice was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her: And truly he was a man of very high de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. As for his Pedigree, it is, as you know, derived from the ancient Line of <hi>Surieu,</hi> which in Noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e is not inferiour unto <hi>Galathea</hi> her <U+017F>elf. As for his Per<U+017F>on, he is very hand<U+017F>om; every way <U+017F>o compo<U+017F>ed, as to move Love. Above all, he is a great Scholar, and in any Learning can <U+017F>ilence the greate<U+017F>t Doctors. But, Father, all the<U+017F>e things are known unto you, better than I can relate them. But <U+017F>o it was, that the<U+017F>e qualities did <U+017F>o recommend him unto the con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <U+017F>he was more favourable unto him, than unto any in the Court of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is;</hi> yet it was with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion, that none could ever take any notice of it. Then <hi>Polemas,</hi> having <U+017F>uch a favourable wind, did <U+017F>ail <U+017F>o contentedly in the <U+017F>ea of his hopes, as no man could live more happily than hee. But this incon<U+017F>tant Love, or rather incon<U+017F>tant Fortune, would have <hi>Polemas,</hi> as well as the re<U+017F>t of the world, feel the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e Arrows which are <U+017F>hot from his Bow. You may remember the time when <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> permitted <hi>Clidaman</hi> to be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>ervants upon us all. Upon that occa<U+017F>ion, Love, like <U+017F>warms, did ri<U+017F>e both in Court and Country; &amp; among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Lindamor's</hi> lot did fal upon <hi>Galathea.</hi> His merits al<U+017F>o were very high; yet <U+017F>he did look as <U+017F>hily upon him, as the ceremony of that Fe<U+017F>tivall would permit her. But he, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had before that <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch intention, though he dur<U+017F>t not let it break out beyond the limits of his di<U+017F>cretion was very glad of this occa<U+017F>ion, under which he might veyl his real pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as under a fiction. As <hi>Polemas</hi> did <U+017F>tomack this new Amity at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o the progre<U+017F>s of it proved much more vexatious to him. Though <hi>Galathea</hi> did receive him with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hew of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, by way of common courte<U+017F>ie, and after the example of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nimphs, yet this in any rea<U+017F>on could not be offen<U+017F>ive to him, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was obliged to it both by the Law, and the example of others. But when this Court<U+017F>hip went further than the bounders of courte<U+017F>ie and civility, then did he perceive it to be in good earne<U+017F>t; and then did he re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>uch pangs of Jealou<U+017F>ie, as are u<U+017F>uall in a <U+017F>oul that is really in love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galathea</hi> for her part, never thought of any <U+017F>uch thing, or at the lea<U+017F>t did not beleeve, it was <U+017F>o far on: But occa<U+017F>ions, which, like drops of rain, do follow one another did <U+017F>o apparently appear, that <hi>Polemas</hi> might well be excu<U+017F>ed for <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <U+017F>o <U+017F>harp a Sword as Jealou<U+017F>ie. <hi>Lindamor</hi> was Generous and Noble, and adorned with all de<U+017F>irable qualities, that a per<U+017F>on well born could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible be: as courtly among<U+017F>t Ladies, as brave in Martial matters, and as full of Courage and Valour, as any that our Court produced many years. He had arrived to the age of five and twenty yeares, before ever he felt any <U+017F>uch effects as Love u<U+017F>eth to produce in hearts of his age. Not but that he was, of his natural inclination, a much devoted <U+017F>ervant unto Ladyes but being continually exerci<U+017F>ed in bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es much different from idlene<U+017F>s, he had not lei<U+017F>ure to let Love <U+017F>ow any <U+017F>eeds in his <U+017F>oul; for ever <U+017F>ince hee was able to bear Armes moved by a Generous in<U+017F>tinct, which invites Noble <U+017F>pirits unto dangerous enterprizes, he was perpetually in Wars, where he did mo<U+017F>t heroickly <U+017F>ignalize him<U+017F>elf. Afterwards, coming to <U+017F>ee <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and to pay that homage unto which he was obliged, at one and the <U+017F>ame time he devoted him<U+017F>elf unto two: To <hi>Clidaman</hi> as his Lord, and to <hi>Galathea</hi> as his Lady; comming to Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any de<U+017F>ign upon either. But the <U+017F>weet affability of the young <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and the merits of the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> were Load<U+017F>tones of <U+017F>uch attractive virtue, as did draw him to their <U+017F>ervice. Thus did <hi>Lindamor</hi> begin to love, and <U+017F>o that he could not umbrage his affection under the veil of courte<U+017F>ie and complement. <hi>Polemas,</hi> as one that had intere<U+017F>t, did pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive it; yet being friends, he <U+017F>eemed to take no notice, but <U+017F>til courted his friend<U+017F>hip, to the end he might ruin him by Artifice, as afterwards he attempted: And having, as I told you, made profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of amity already unto him, it was the more ea<U+017F>ie to continue it. At this time <hi>Clidaman,</hi> began to affect Tilting and Ju<U+017F>ts, wherein for a beginner he got <U+017F>ome honour. But <hi>Lindamor</hi> was the man that <U+017F>till carried away all the glory and applau<U+017F>e of all. At which <hi>Polemas</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>tung at the heart, that he could no longer di<U+017F><U+017F>emble his grudge; <U+017F>o as hee would needs have a turn with him at Tilting, thinking that he being elder, and having a <U+017F>tronger Arm, he might wel enough undertake his Rival, and get the glory; but he proved to be only a foil unto <hi>Lindamors</hi> lu<U+017F>tre. The la<U+017F>t day of the Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when the young <hi>Clidaman</hi> held a Turnement in maintaining the beauty of <hi>Silvia, Guyemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamor</hi> did get as much glory as mortal men could do, but e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who had the favour and good fortune that though <hi>Galathea</hi> was not the Judge, yet, In <U+017F>pite of Love, <U+017F>hee gave <U+017F>entence again<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas.</hi> The Nimph, who<U+017F>e eyes could hardly look upon any but <hi>Polemas,</hi> could not now chu<U+017F>e but highly applaud <hi>Lindamor:</hi> And ob<U+017F>erve how Love does play and mock at the Prudence of Lovers; that which <hi>Polemas</hi> imagined, would get him the advantage of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> did mo<U+017F>t hurt him, and made him almo<U+017F>t his inferiour; for, every one <U+017F>pending their judgments, and comparing the actions of the one with the other, did finde <U+017F>uch a difference between them, that it had been better for him to have <U+017F>it quietly at home. That <U+017F>ame night, <hi>Lindamor</hi> in<U+017F>pir'd by <U+017F>ome good Genius (which makes me believe, that there are <U+017F>ome daies fortunate, <U+017F>ome unfortunate) declared him<U+017F>elfe in good earne<U+017F>t a Servant unto the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> and <U+017F>uch opportunities did fall upon him, as he could not wi<U+017F>h for better: For, dancing a kinde of a Dance, which the <hi>Franks</hi> had newly brought out of <hi>Germany,</hi> in which, every one catched her whom they mo<U+017F>t fancyed; <hi>Lindamor</hi> guided by Love, but, as I think, thru<U+017F>t upon it by Fate, did <U+017F>teal away <hi>Galathea</hi> from <hi>Polemas,</hi> who being more intent upon his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e than dancing, never heeded it, but went pre<U+017F>ently, and twitted the Nymph with her affection unto <hi>Lindamor.</hi> She, who did not yet think <hi>Lindamor</hi> to be in earne<U+017F>t, was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and took his language <U+017F>o ill, that it made <hi>Lindamor</hi> more plea<U+017F>ing unto her: al<U+017F>o, thinking upon <U+017F>ome revenge for his jealou<U+017F>ie. I am the freer to <U+017F>peak it, for none was better acquainted with all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages than my <U+017F>elfe, who was de<U+017F>tined to be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of all the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e: For, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as all were retired to their lodgings, &amp; <hi>Galathea</hi> in bed, <U+017F>he commanded me to <U+017F>tay by her &amp; hold a Candle, whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he read <U+017F>ome Letters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which came to her. This night de<U+017F>iring to be alone, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed all the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs and when they were all gone, <U+017F>he commanded me to <U+017F>hut the dore; afterwards <U+017F>he made me <U+017F>it down upon her Bed; then, after a little <U+017F>miling to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but laugh, <hi>Leonida,</hi> at an encounter which I met with this night at the Ball, you know that <hi>Polemas</hi> has long profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf my <U+017F>ervant and (let me tell it unto you, from whom I wil conceal nothing) that as long as he behaved him<U+017F>elf towards me with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; re<U+017F>pect, his <U+017F>ervice was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto me, but I received him into more favour, then any other in this Court; yet, not out of any love on my <U+017F>ide, I will not <U+017F>ay, but perhaps love did flatter him with <U+017F>ome hopes of obtaining what he de<U+017F>ired; but, the very truth is, I never yet found any thing in him which could force me <U+017F>o far as Love: I know not what may be in the time to come, but hitherto there is no likelyhood of it. Now <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>eeing I allowed him freedome of talk, and heard him with patience; al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erving, that I did not expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o freely unto any other he is grown <U+017F>o bold, that he knowes not what he does, <U+017F>o much is he tran<U+017F>ported be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elfe: This very night he danced with me, in <U+017F>uch a dull mu<U+017F>ing manner, that I could not chu<U+017F>e but ra<U+017F>hly ask him, what he ailed. Shall it not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, <U+017F>aid he unto me, if I <U+017F>hould tell you? No, <U+017F>aid I, for I never u<U+017F>e to ask a thing which I would not know. Upon this, he went on: I cannot chu<U+017F>e, Madam, (<U+017F>aid he) but be extreamly <U+017F>ad at <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, which are very frequently in my eyes, and which touch me <U+017F>o to the quick, that had I but halfe as much a<U+017F><U+017F>urance as I have <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, I know nothing that is able to keep that life which yet is in me. I do prore<U+017F>t, I was <U+017F>o ill advi<U+017F>ed, that I could not imagine what he meant; yet, conceiving that his former amitie obliged me a little unto a farther curio<U+017F>ity, I asked him, what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages tho<U+017F>e were which touched him <U+017F>o to the quick? Then looking gha<U+017F>tly upon me a long while, Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,

Madam, (<U+017F>aid he upon a <U+017F>uddain) you <U+017F>hould ask me any <U+017F>uch que<U+017F>tion? Why not, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered I)? Becau<U+017F>e, replied he, all the<U+017F>e things are addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto you, and it is only from you that they do proceed. Then <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>tand <U+017F>ilent, for I did not know his meaning, he begun to walk and <U+017F>ay; I do wonder you <U+017F>hould not blu<U+017F>h, and I mu<U+017F>t tell you as much, though at the rate of my life: You know, Madam, with what zealous affection I have <U+017F>triven to make my <U+017F>elf appear a mo<U+017F>t reall <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> ever <U+017F>ince the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens devoted me to become hers you may well <U+017F>ay, that hitherto you never <U+017F>aw the lea<U+017F>t or greate<U+017F>t of any action, that did not tend unto your <U+017F>ervice that was the mark which all my thoughts did aim at: <U+017F>o as unle<U+017F><U+017F>e fortune be extreamly aver<U+017F>e unto me you cannot chu<U+017F>e, but afford me <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfaction at the lea<U+017F>t, as to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I am <U+017F>olely yours, and none but yours: And <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, I be<U+017F>eech you judge how great my griefe mu<U+017F>t needs be, when I <U+017F>ee, contrary to all rea<U+017F>on in Love, and when I might well have expected <U+017F>ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my affection; when, I <U+017F>ay, I <U+017F>ee in my room another Favourit, and heir po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of my e<U+017F>tate before I die: I be<U+017F>eech you excu<U+017F>e the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which flowes from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and forceth ju<U+017F>t complaints from my <U+017F>oul, which cannot any longer hold <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>eeing one triumph over me, that hath got the victory, more by de<U+017F>tiny than merit: It is <hi>Lindamor</hi> I mean, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices you entertain and favour above mine; my griefe is not to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o happy as he him<U+017F>elfe can wi<U+017F>h, but to <U+017F>ee him happy in my raine. I be<U+017F>eech you Madam excu<U+017F>e me, or rather excu<U+017F>e the grandure of my affection, if I do complain, <U+017F>ince it is only an argument of that power which you have over your mo<U+017F>t humble <U+017F>ervant. I <U+017F>peak thus, to ob<U+017F>erve unto you, Madam, that you u<U+017F>e the very <U+017F>ame language, and treat him in the very <U+017F>ame manner, you were wont to u<U+017F>e towards me, at the beginning of your goodwill to me, and at that time, when, me thought you knew my affection: This puts me beyond all patience, and <U+017F>o much beyond my <U+017F>elfe, that I am not able to command tho<U+017F>e extravagancies which proceed from my <U+017F>oul, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>port me beyond the limits of my di<U+017F>cretion. He would have talked on, but his violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did <U+017F>o <U+017F>top his breath, that he was not able to continue any longer. Judge you, whether I was not much offended at the<U+017F>e words, for they were <U+017F>o full of vanitie and ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as were not to be endured: yet, becau<U+017F>e I would not give any knowledge of it into <U+017F>uch, who have no eyes, but to prie into the actions of others, I was forced to give him an an<U+017F>wer le<U+017F><U+017F>e tart than otherwi<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould, and <U+017F>aid thus unto him: <hi>Polemas,</hi> what<U+017F>oever you are, and what<U+017F>oever I be, I never doubted, but that you were my <U+017F>ervant, as long as you dwelt in my Mothers hou<U+017F>e, and did my Brother any <U+017F>ervice but I mu<U+017F>t needs wonder at tho<U+017F>e fooli<U+017F>h termes you u<U+017F>e in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Heir, and your E<U+017F>tate truly I know not by what night you can pretend <U+017F>o much unto my amitie, as to call it youre. My intentiond, <hi>Polemas,</hi> were ever to love and e<U+017F>teem you according to your merits, and never with you any more. And as to what you <U+017F>ay concerning <hi>Lindamor,</hi> let me draw you out of that error for, if I did behave my <U+017F>elfe towards him as I did to you, I would have you think, I did no more then what I will do unto all <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hall merit it: for without any further de<U+017F>igne, I mu<U+017F>t and will love and e<U+017F>teem worth where<U+017F>oever I do finde it. Why Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, and interrupted her, do you think this to be <U+017F>o mild an an<U+017F>wer? I cannot tell how in any civility it could have been more <U+017F>harp: 'Tis true I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that he is a little too pre<U+017F>umptuous, but it cannot be denied, that this pre<U+017F>umption in him is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <U+017F>ome colour of rea<U+017F>on. Of rea<U+017F>on? <U+017F>aid the Nymph pre<U+017F>ently, why, what rea<U+017F>on can he alledge for it? Very many, Madam, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) but to be <U+017F>ilent in all but one, I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that you have permitted him to <U+017F>erve you with more particularitie, then any other. It was, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he plea<U+017F>ed me better, then any of the re<U+017F>t of my Brothers <U+017F>ervants. I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, an<U+017F>wered I, and therefore when he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elfe more favoured than any other, could he hope for le<U+017F><U+017F>e, than to obtain you love? He hath heard of many examples of Love between per<U+017F>ons of unequall degree, and might therefore very well flatter him<U+017F>elfe with the like hopes; and I do remember <U+017F>ome Lines which he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed upon this <U+017F>ubject, and <U+017F>ang them before you, when you commanded him to conceal his affection: The Lines were the<U+017F>e.</p>

But, he does mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>tly merit this puni<U+017F>hment, for that perfidie which he hath u<U+017F>ed towards a Nymph, who<U+017F>e beguiled affection had ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e for revenge, which Love at the la<U+017F>t did execute upon him. The truth is, he is the ba<U+017F>e<U+017F>t impo<U+017F>tor, the mo<U+017F>t ungratefull, and the mo<U+017F>t unworthy to be loved, that is under heaven, for his ingratitude; and if he do re<U+017F>ent that pain which others have endured for him, he de<U+017F>erves no pitty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o exa<U+017F>perated again<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas,</hi> asked her, who that Nymph was which he had deceived; for, <U+017F>aid he to her, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs be one of your friends, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the offence which was done unto her. She now <U+017F>aw, that her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had carried her too far, and that <U+017F>he had unawares bolted out a thing, which had been kept long a <U+017F>ecret: yet, having a quick wit, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o di<U+017F><U+017F>embled the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <hi>Adamas</hi> took no notice of it. Do you not know, Daughter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas)</hi> that the aimes of all men is, to overcome and compa<U+017F><U+017F>e the de<U+017F>igne which they attempt; and the amitie which they <U+017F>hew unto you women when they love you, is but to make the way more ea<U+017F>ie: You <U+017F>ee, <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> all Love is but a de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>omething which is wanting; that de<U+017F>ire being <U+017F>added and cloyed, is no more de<U+017F>ire; and there being no more de<U+017F>ire, there is no more love; and therefore tho<U+017F>e that would be loved long, are tho<U+017F>e that give lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfaction unto the de<U+017F>ires of their Lovers. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>he whom I do <U+017F>peak of, is one of my intimate friends, and I know, <U+017F>he never treated <hi>Polemas,</hi> but with all the coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he could. That, replied <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> did <U+017F>tifle de<U+017F>ire; for, de<U+017F>ire is nouri<U+017F>hed by hopes and favours: As, a Lamp, when Oyle is wanting, doth extingui<U+017F>h; <U+017F>o does de<U+017F>ire die, when that which <U+017F>hould nouri<U+017F>h it, is taken away: Thus does many Loves die, <U+017F>ome, by too many, <U+017F>ome, by too few, favours. But let us returne unto the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt <hi>Galathea</hi> and you, What was it which <U+017F>he did <U+017F>ay unto you? She <U+017F>aid thus, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> If <hi>Polemas</hi> had been <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet, as to mea<U+017F>ure him<U+017F>elfe aright, as he was pre<U+017F>umptuous in loving me, he had taken the<U+017F>e favours

What do you mean, <U+017F>aid I unto him? I mean, <U+017F>aid he, that in this Dance I have <U+017F>tolne you, and in the very truth, you have <U+017F>tollen my <U+017F>oul and my heart. Then blu<U+017F>hing at this, I returned this <U+017F>eeming angry an<U+017F>wer, Fie, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> what <U+017F>trange language is this? do you not con<U+017F>ider who you are, and who I am? I do <U+017F>o, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, and that does invite me to this language: for, are not you my Lady, and I your <U+017F>ervant? Yes, an<U+017F>wered I, but not <U+017F>o as you do intend it; for, it is your duty to <U+017F>erve me with reverence, and not love; or, if it be with any affection, it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch as proceeds from your duty. To which he pre<U+017F>ently replyed, Madam, if I do not <U+017F>erve you with all humble reverence, never was any deitie reverenced by any mortall; but this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence mu<U+017F>t be either the Father or the Child of my affection; and, call it what you plea<U+017F>e, I am re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>erve you, to love you, and to obey you; your merits, your perfections, and my own fate has made me eternally yours he that <U+017F>ees and does not love you, de<U+017F>erves not the name of Man: and <hi>Clidaman's</hi> Lottery, though it was <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e, yet was it only a cover of my <U+017F>oules affection. The<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were uttered with a vehemency, as made it plainly appear, that his heart and tongue agreed; and I be<U+017F>eech you ob<U+017F>erve one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; for, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> to me, I never took any notice of this affection, thinking it to be only in jea<U+017F>t, and I never had perceived it, untill the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Polemas</hi> did hint it unto my thoughts; but ever <U+017F>ince, I have <U+017F>o <U+017F>et my thoughts upon <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and I have <U+017F>ound him as well capable of cau<U+017F>ing love as jealou<U+017F>ie; and <hi>Polemas</hi> ever <U+017F>ince that time hath <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed me in all his actions, as I could hardly endure him: On the contrary, all <hi>Lindamors</hi> actions did <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o plau<U+017F>ible unto me, as I wondred that I <U+017F>hould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve them no <U+017F>ooner; <U+017F>o as the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Polemas</hi> did quench my love of him, and tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my affection upon <hi>Lindamor.</hi> This change had <U+017F>uch an operation upon

When <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>poke thus again<U+017F>t him, I was not at all <U+017F>orry, by rea<U+017F>on of his ingratitude; but, on the contrary, the more to prejudice him, I <U+017F>aid thus unto her, I do not at all wonder, Madam, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>hould win more upon you than <hi>Polemas,</hi> for their qualities and parts are not comparable, and every one that <U+017F>ees them, are of the <U+017F>ame judgment you are: It is true indeed, I do fore<U+017F>ee much jangling will ari<U+017F>e; fir<U+017F>t, betwixt them two; and <U+017F>econdly, betwixt you and <hi>Polemas.</hi> And why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> to me, do you think he has <U+017F>uch an influence upon my actions or <hi>Lindamors?</hi> That is not it, Madam, that I do mean, <U+017F>aid I unto her; but, I am <U+017F>o well acquainted with the humour of <hi>Polemas,</hi> that he will try all manner of waies leave no <U+017F>tone unturned, and will conjure both heaven and earth, to ingratiate him<U+017F>elfe unto that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which he hath lo<U+017F>t; and will commit <U+017F>uch gro<U+017F><U+017F>e follies, as will be vi<U+017F>ible unto all, but <U+017F>uch as will not <U+017F>ee them, and <U+017F>uch as will offend both you and <hi>Lindamor.</hi> No, no, <hi>Leonida,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, if <hi>Lindamor</hi> do love me, he will do as I <U+017F>hall command him; and if he do not love me, he will never care what <hi>Polemas</hi> does: And as for <hi>Polemas,</hi> I know how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Upon the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he commanded me to draw the Curtain, and took her re<U+017F>t, at lea<U+017F>t, as well as the<U+017F>e new de<U+017F>ignes would permit her. But when the Ball was ended, <hi>Lindamor</hi> ob<U+017F>erving the di<U+017F>contented looks of <hi>Polemas,</hi> when he took <hi>Galathea</hi> from him, he had an opinion that he did love her; yet, having never ob<U+017F>erved it by any former pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages, he re<U+017F>olved to ask him, and if he did finde him in love, then to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade him from it and this he thought him<U+017F>elfe obliged unto by their former friend<U+017F>hip: therefore comming unto him, he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak a word with him in private. <hi>Polemas</hi> being as <U+017F>ubtle as ever was any, did colour his countenance with a glo<U+017F><U+017F>e of good will, and <U+017F>aid, What is it which <hi>Lindamor</hi> is plea<U+017F>ed to command me? Oh Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I never u<U+017F>e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands where intreaties may prevail, and at this time I will make u<U+017F>e of neither; but only as a friend ask you a que<U+017F>tion, which our friend<U+017F>hip obliges you to an<U+017F>wer.

of Love; for the truth is, after I had <U+017F>erved her according to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of fortune, who ca<U+017F>t me upon her great merits, <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uch an influence upon my affection, as I did ratifie it by the dedication of my <U+017F>elf unto her; and therefore mu<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ume to my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to <U+017F>ay, that I do love her: yet, that friend<U+017F>hip, which is betwixt you and me, being contracted long before this love began, I re<U+017F>olved to tell you, that if it be <U+017F>o, that you do Love her, and have any pretentions unto her, I hope that I have <U+017F>o much command over my <U+017F>elfe, as to make a retreat, and make it appeare that my love is le<U+017F><U+017F>e then my friend<U+017F>hip, and that the follies of the one ought to give place unto the wi<U+017F>dome of the other: Tell me therefore, freely, how your <U+017F>oul is affected, to the end the lawes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip between you and me may be ob<U+017F>erved: My intention is not to di<U+017F>cover your <U+017F>ecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes; and <U+017F>ince I do thus ingenuou<U+017F>ly open my <U+017F>elfe unto you, I conceive you need not feare doing the like: for it is not out of any curio<U+017F>itie, but onely a de<U+017F>ire to pre<U+017F>erve our friend<U+017F>hip, that I ask you this que<U+017F>tion. <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>poke unto <hi>Polemas</hi> in <U+017F>uch a dialect as did become a friend, but like an ignorant lover, that thought <U+017F>uch a thing as a friend was to be found in matter of Love But <hi>Polemas</hi> the Grand di<U+017F><U+017F>embler an<U+017F>wer'd thus: <hi>Lindamor,</hi> this fair Nymph you <U+017F>peak of, de<U+017F>erves the Love and adoration of the whole univer<U+017F>e: but as for me, I have no pretentions unto her But withall I mu<U+017F>t tel you, that for matter of Love, I conceive every one ought &amp; wil do what he can for him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Lindamor</hi> did now repent him<U+017F>elf of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and civill language, <U+017F>ince he had received <U+017F>uch an od an<U+017F>wer: and re<U+017F>olved to do what he could to advance him<U+017F>elfe into the favour of this Nymph, yet he an<U+017F>wered him thus: Since <hi>Polemas,</hi> you have no pretentions unto her, I will endeavour to preferre my <U+017F>elfe, unto a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which to recede from, would be death it <U+017F>elfe unto me. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> my pretentions unto her in matter of Love, are only with an eye of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and re<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>uch as we are all obliged to render unto her. For my part, replyed <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> I do honour <hi>Galathea,</hi> as our great Lady; and al<U+017F>o do Love and adore her as my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris: I do think my fortune may wel pretend unto <U+017F>uch a height, as to ca<U+017F>t my eyes upon her, and do conceive it is no offence unto a Divinity, to Love her. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this they parted, both of them very ill <U+017F>atisfied with one another: but upon different grounds: for <hi>Polemas</hi> was <U+017F>tung with jealou<U+017F>ie, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at the perfidie of his friend; from this day they lived at a di<U+017F>tance: for though indeed they were alwaies together, yet they did hide and di<U+017F>gni<U+017F>e their de<U+017F>igues and actions, one from another: but <hi>Lindamor</hi> did not neglect a minute that could be imployed to make his affection appear unto this fair Nymph: and certainly he did not lo<U+017F>e eyther his time or paines; for it was <U+017F>o aceptable unto her, that though much love did not appear in her eyes, yet <U+017F>he was ful of it in her heart; and becau<U+017F>e it was a hard matter to conceale <U+017F>o great a fire but <U+017F>ome flame will be fla<U+017F>hing out, do what they could, therefore <hi>Galathea</hi> re<U+017F>olved to talke to <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he could, and to devi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome way or other, for conveying letters <U+017F>ecretly betwixt them: And in order to that, her de<U+017F>igne was upon <hi>Flurial</hi> Nephew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nur<U+017F>e of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and Brother unto hers, who<U+017F>e good will unto her, <U+017F>he had been long accquainted with for he being the Gardiner at <hi>Mount-Bri<U+017F>on</hi> as his father was before him, when <hi>Galathea</hi> was brought thither to walk, he would often take her in his armes, and gather her what flowers <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed: and you know that <U+017F>uch infant amities as are <U+017F>uckt in with the milk, do become almo<U+017F>t naturall: al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he knowing that all old people are covetous, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o liberal unto him that <U+017F>he made him wholly hers.

what I intend for the Future: but be <U+017F>ure thou bee<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret; and remember that if thou bee<U+017F>t not, I <U+017F>hal become thy mo<U+017F>t mortal enemy; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf nothing le<U+017F>sthen thy life <U+017F>hal <U+017F>atisfy me.

Upon the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Galathea</hi> came to us and laughing told us, that <hi>Flurial</hi> and <U+017F>he, had been in a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Love; but, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it was upon love of the Garden, and the love of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Flurial,</hi> for his part, after two or three turnes in the Garden, <U+017F>eeming as if he had <U+017F>ome imployment, went out, with a mind full of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e: for he was not <U+017F>o ignorant, but he knew well enough the dainger he <U+017F>hould incurre from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> if he were di<U+017F>covered, and from <hi>Galathea,</hi> if he did not execute her commands; imagining the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, to be a matter of Love: and he had often heard <U+017F>ay, that all offences again<U+017F>t Love do wound the very heart; At la<U+017F>t, his affection to <hi>Galathea</hi> and de<U+017F>ire of gaine together, made him re<U+017F>olve, <U+017F>ince he had promi<U+017F>ed to keep his word, and thereupon went pre<U+017F>ently to <hi>Lindamor</hi> who expected him For the Nymph told him that <U+017F>he would <U+017F>end <hi>Flurial</hi> unto him, and by him he might let her under<U+017F>tand any thing he plea<U+017F>ed. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>aw him, he <U+017F>eemed as if he knew nothing, but asked before the company, if he had any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with him? Unto which he an<U+017F>wered aloud, that he came to be<U+017F>eech him, he would be plea<U+017F>ed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with his long <U+017F>ervice, and the little wages he had received which was due unto him, and thereby he would create him his va<U+017F><U+017F>al: then in a low voice he acquainted him with the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e he came about, and offered to do him what <U+017F>ervice he was plea<U+017F>ed to command him. <hi>Lindamor,</hi> gave him thankes, and, acquainting him freely what he <U+017F>hould do, he conceived the way was hand<U+017F>omly contrived. So as from hence forward, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> would write unto her, <hi>Flurial</hi> <U+017F>eemed to pre<U+017F>ent a Petition unto the Nymph and when <U+017F>he would returne an an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he would give it unto him lapped up in that order, which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> appointed in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the Petition. And becau<U+017F>e it is ordinarie for many old Servants to have many things to Petition for; he wanted not occa<U+017F>ion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent every hour a Petition unto her, who often obtain'd <U+017F>uch advantageous an<U+017F>wers to them as were beyond all hopes. All this while the affection of this Nymph unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> did <U+017F>o wither, that <U+017F>he could hardly <U+017F>peake unto him without di<U+017F>daine: which he not being able to endure, and knowing well enough that all did proceed from her Love of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported that though he dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>peak much again<U+017F>t <hi>Galathea,</hi> yet he gave out many di<U+017F>advantageous <U+017F>peeches again<U+017F>t <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>aid, that though <hi>Lindamor</hi> was a very brave man, and accompli<U+017F>hed with many remarkable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet his over good opinion of him<U+017F>elfe did not take his mea<U+017F>ures aright, <U+017F>ince he was <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umptuous as to lift his eyes <U+017F>o high as <hi>Galathea;</hi> and that not only to Love her in his heart, but al<U+017F>o to vaunt and bragge of it, in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Which language came at la<U+017F>t to the eares of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and indeed had <U+017F>o <U+017F>pread it <U+017F>elfe that all the Court was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. The Nymph was <U+017F>o much offended at this, as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to treat <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> <U+017F>o for the future, as he <U+017F>hould have no occa<U+017F>ion to publi<U+017F>h her vanities &amp; this was the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>peake unto him, and tho<U+017F>e who ob<U+017F>erved her actions and behaviour, were per<U+017F>waded that there was no <U+017F>uch thing as Love betwixt them: And <hi>Lindamors</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture pre<U+017F>ently after did much help on that belief; for <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ent him upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of great importance, as far as the banks of the River <hi>Rhine:</hi> Yet his departure was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddain, but he found an opportunity of talking with <hi>Galathea,</hi> before he went to know the cau<U+017F>e of her change: and watching for his time that morning when <U+017F>he went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple with her Mother, he came to her, when <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o in the mid<U+017F>t of us, that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> could hardly <U+017F>ee him. As <U+017F>oone as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he would have changed place, had he not held her by the Gown, and <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Madam, what is my offence? and why this alteration in you? She an<U+017F>wered as <U+017F>he was going away: There is neither any offence in you nor alteration in me: for I am <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Galathea,</hi> and you are <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Lindamor,</hi> a <U+017F>ubject too low for me to be offended with. His actions did make it appear, how the<U+017F>e words went to his heart for though he was ju<U+017F>t upon his departure, yet he could not give any orders of any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o much was his mind taken up with the thoughs of this matter: At la<U+017F>t, finding him<U+017F>elfe cleerely innocent, he writ this Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>Do not, Madam, bid my pen complain again<U+017F>t you, but only to deplore that fatall mi<U+017F>hap which hath rendred me <U+017F>o <U+017F>corned by her, who was wont to treat me far otherwi<U+017F>e.

I have called my Soul to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for all its action; when you plea<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>play them all before you: As for me I cannot taxe it without fault: and if when heard you can, it will not be a <U+017F>mall comfort unto a poore condemned <U+017F>inner, to know the cau<U+017F>e of his puni<U+017F>hment.</hi>

               <p>This Letter was brought her, as the cu<U+017F>tom was, by <hi>Flurial</hi> and at <U+017F>uch a time, that though <U+017F>he would, yet <U+017F>he could not refu<U+017F>e it, becau<U+017F>e we were all about her: and the truth is, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any <U+017F>hould carry the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e better then <hi>Flurial</hi> did. For he pre<U+017F>ented his Petitions with <U+017F>uch reverent and pittiful language, <U+017F>o <U+017F>utable unto the thing petitioned for, as he might deceive any who<U+017F>oever; as for me had not <hi>Galathea</hi> acquainted me, I <U+017F>hould never have taken any notice of it. But it being very hard or indeed impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for the young heart of this Nymph to endure without <U+017F>ome Confident, unto whom it might impart it <U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he did me the honour to make choice of me, as mo<U+017F>t affectionate, &amp; as <U+017F>he thought mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret. So that as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he receiv'd this Letter, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeming to have forgotten <U+017F>omething in her clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, <U+017F>he went thither and called me, telling the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs, <U+017F>he would returne pre<U+017F>ently to them again. She <U+017F>tayed a good while in her clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, and <U+017F>poke not a word, <U+017F>o as I perceived <U+017F>omthing did much trouble her: but yet I dur<U+017F>t not aske her for feare of vexing her: Yet <U+017F>he did <U+017F>it down, and ca<U+017F>t <hi>Flnuials</hi> pettion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, <U+017F>aying unto me, this fool <hi>Flurial</hi> is continually troubling me with Letters from <hi>Lindamor:</hi> I pray <hi>Leonida</hi> tell him that I would have him bring no more: I was a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this charge: yet I knew that Love cannot be long without <U+017F>ome triviall quarrells, which in the end does but prove a pair of bellowes to blow the fire into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flame: therefore I <U+017F>aid thus unto her: When did he give you any, Madam? Not long replyed <U+017F>he, do not you know of it? No certainly Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her; Then with a frowning brow <U+017F>he told me that indeed it was true, he was much in her favour; but now he had <U+017F>o much abu<U+017F>ed her favour, by his ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e and pre<U+017F>umption, that <U+017F>he was quite out with him. I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>aid I unto her, what is his fault? The fault, <U+017F>aid the Nymphs, is no great bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth me more then if it were of greater importance. What a gro<U+017F><U+017F>e peece of vanitie was it in him to report it, that he was in love with me, &amp; that he had profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed it unto me? Oh, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, this can never be true; his enemies certainly have invented it, onely to ruine him, both in your favour and the favour of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is.</hi>
This may be, replied <U+017F>he; but <hi>Polemas,</hi> reports it every where, &amp; yet he is <U+017F>ilent and gives a check unto none of the<U+017F>e reports, But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he do hear the report how can he help them? Said I unto her, what remedy would you have him u<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t them? what remedy? <U+017F>aid the Nymph, why a <U+017F>word, and death to the reporter. Truly Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, I have heard <U+017F>ay that matters of love are <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubject unto cen<U+017F>ure, that the le<U+017F><U+017F>e it is medled with, it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, are but excu<U+017F>es, but might he not very well have asked me, what cour<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould take? Had he done <U+017F>o I <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>atisfied. Have you <U+017F>een the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, which he writ unto you? No, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he: and more then that, let me tell you, that I never will; but will avoid all occa<U+017F>ions of ever <U+017F>peaking unto him. Then, I took the Petition of <hi>Flurial</hi> and read it aloud unto her; then <U+017F>aid thus; but good Madam, ought you not to love one that is wholly devoted unto you? and can you be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily offended again<U+017F>t him, that perhaps never offended you? Come, come, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if he does love me, I will make him pay deare intere<U+017F>t for the plea<U+017F>ure he takes in vaunting of our love: if I have heretofore given him any occa<U+017F>ion to think I ever loved him, I <U+017F>hall for the future give a <U+017F>top unto all <U+017F>uch conceipts; and, to begin, I pray charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Flurial,</hi> that he never pre<U+017F>ume to bring me any thing from this ra<U+017F>h and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man. Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, I <U+017F>hall do what<U+017F>oever you are plea<U+017F>ed to command me; but give me leave to tell you, that I think it requi<U+017F>it to con<U+017F>ider a little better upon the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; for you may do your <U+017F>elfe an injury by thinking to <U+017F>pite another: you know what kind of fellow this <hi>Fluriall</hi> is, who<U+017F>e wit cannot reach beyond his Garden; <U+017F>hould you let

him know of this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age betwixt <hi>Lindamor</hi> and you; I am afraid he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe: For gods <U+017F>ake, Madam, con<U+017F>ider what a di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure this would be unto you; were it not much better you did expo<U+017F>tulate the matter with <hi>Lindamor?</hi> or, if that do not plea<U+017F>e you, then let me do it; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe, he will give you <U+017F>atisfaction, or el<U+017F>e you may tell him your <U+017F>elfe when he departs, the occa<U+017F>ion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> your breaking off with him, without making it known unto <hi>Fluriall.</hi> As for <U+017F>pea king with him, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I cannot do it, my courage will not permit it; nor will I permit any other, for I wi<U+017F>h him not <U+017F>o well. When I <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t him, I told her, that <U+017F>he could do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than write unto him. By no means, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, too many of my Letters has made him thus pre<U+017F>umptuous. At la<U+017F>t when I could obtain no more from her: <U+017F>he permitted me to lap up a piece of paper in the manner of a Letter, and to put it into <hi>Flurialls</hi> Petition; <U+017F>o he to carry it unto him, and this purpo<U+017F>ely, that <hi>Fluriall</hi> might not perceive this di<U+017F><U+017F>ention: Oh, how <hi>Lindamor</hi> was amazed, when he opened this blank paper; but the greate<U+017F>t affliction to him was, that he mu<U+017F>t depart in the morning betimes, unto a place, where the affairs of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> did of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity oblige him to <U+017F>tay a long time: to defer his journey he could not, and to go upon the<U+017F>e tearmes was even death unto him. At la<U+017F>t, he re<U+017F>olved to di<U+017F>patch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter to her pre<U+017F>ently, more as a thing of hazard, than any hopes of good fortune. <hi>Fluriall</hi> did his be<U+017F>t indeavour to deliver it pre<U+017F>ently unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> but he could not do it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he being extreamly vexed at this fraction, was forced to go into her bed, and did not ri<U+017F>e out of it many daies. <hi>Fluriall</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Lindamor</hi> was gone, took upon him <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to go into her Chamber; and becau<U+017F>e I was, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, an ill-willer unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> I u<U+017F>ed my be<U+017F>t invention, to piece up this affection between <hi>Lindamor</hi> and her, and therefore gave <hi>Fluriall</hi> an opportunity to enter. Judge you, whether or no <hi>Galathea</hi> was <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, for <U+017F>he expected nothing le<U+017F><U+017F>e then this; yet, <U+017F>he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <U+017F>et a good face upon the matter, and to take what he pre<U+017F>ented unto her, which in appearance was only a Po<U+017F>ie of flowers. I would by all means be pre<U+017F>ent, that I might put in the be<U+017F>t advice I could in the behalfe of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and certainly my being there, was not unprofitable to him; for after <hi>Fluriall</hi> was gone, and <hi>Galathea</hi> was alone, <U+017F>he called me unto her, and told me, that <U+017F>he had thought not to be any more troubled with Letters from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> now he was gone; but, for ought <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, he was as impudent as ever. I, who was a reall well-wi<U+017F>her unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> though he knew it not, <U+017F>eeing the Nymph in an humour of talking to me, did <U+017F>eem to be very <U+017F>lack in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, knowing, that to contradict her at the fir<U+017F>t, was the way to <U+017F>poile all, and that to <U+017F>ooth her in all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid was the only way to bend her: And though <U+017F>he was much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at him, yet Love was <U+017F>till the mo<U+017F>t predominant in her minde, and <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe was glad that I took <hi>Lindamor's</hi> part, that <U+017F>he might have occa<U+017F>ion of talking of him, and give the anger of her <U+017F>oul <U+017F>ome vent: So as having all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations in my minde, I was <U+017F>ilent when <U+017F>he talked of him; at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he not being plea<U+017F>ed at my <U+017F>ilence, <U+017F>aid thus unto me: <hi>Leonida,</hi> what do you think of the pre<U+017F>umption of this man? Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, I know not what no <U+017F>ay or think, farther then this, that if he have offended, he will be extreamly <U+017F>orry for it. But what can I think of his ra<U+017F>h impudency, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? has he no other <U+017F>ubject for his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e but me? Then (looking upon the Letter which he writ) were it not a madne<U+017F><U+017F>e in me, if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer him to continue his Letters unto me? To this I an<U+017F>wered nothing. And when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me a long while <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me, What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, <hi>Leonida,</hi> you do not an<U+017F>wer me? have I not good rea<U+017F>on for all my complaints? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, will you give me leave to <U+017F>peak my minde freely? With all my heart, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he. Then <U+017F>aid I unto her, I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that I think you to be rea<U+017F>onable in all things, but in looking for rea<U+017F>on in Love, for you mu<U+017F>t know, that to reduce Love unto the Lawes of ju<U+017F>tice and rea<U+017F>on, is to take away its principall prerogative, which is to be a <U+017F>ubject only unto its <U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>o as I conclude, that if <hi>Lindamor</hi> have failed in matter of Loving you, he is to blame; but if he have failed only again<U+017F>t the Lawes of rea<U+017F>on and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then it is you that de<U+017F>erve to be puni<U+017F>hed, for offering to bring Love, which is free, and commands all others, under the <U+017F>ervitude of a Superior. But why <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I have heard, that if Love be laudable, it is vertuous, and if <U+017F>o, then it is <U+017F>ubject unto the Lawes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Love, an<U+017F>wered I, is above that vertue whereof you <U+017F>peak, and gives Lawes unto it <U+017F>elf, without any <U+017F>ub<U+017F>erviency unto any: But, Madam, <U+017F>ince you command me to <U+017F>peak freely, I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, are not you more culpable than he is of that whereof you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e him, and of matter of Love? For <U+017F>ay he were <U+017F>o bold as to tell it, that he loved you,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53526:73"/>
you your <U+017F>elfe is the cau<U+017F>e of it, <U+017F>ince you permitted him. Though I had, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; yet out of di<U+017F>cretion, he <U+017F>hould have concealed it. Then, <U+017F>aid I, complain of his indi<U+017F>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not of his Love; but, believe me, he hath more occa<U+017F>ion to complain again<U+017F>t your love, <U+017F>ince upon the very fir<U+017F>t report, and before you can ju<U+017F>tly tax his affection, you have repul<U+017F>ed that Love he bore unto you. Excu<U+017F>e, Madam, the freedome of my language, if I tell you, that you do him the greate<U+017F>t wrong in the world, in treating him thus, and condemning him before he have an<U+017F>wered for him<U+017F>elfe, and is convinced of his crime. She <U+017F>tayed a good while before <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, and at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid thus unto me, Well <hi>Leonida,</hi> there is time enough to make him amends when he returnes; not that I am in any minde to love him, or let him love me, but then I <U+017F>hall tell him wherein he is faulty, and in that, <U+017F>atisfie you, and oblige him to trouble me nomore, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he be impudence it<U+017F>elfe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, you may deceive your <U+017F>elfe, in thinking that his return will be time enough for all this; for, did you but know the violencies of Love, you would never think delaies unto a Lover <U+017F>o tolerable as unto others; therefore the lea<U+017F>t you can do, is to <U+017F>ee his Letter. That is to no purpo<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; But, to <U+017F>atisfie you, give it me. Upon this, <U+017F>he took it, and found it thus penned.</p>

               <p>This alteration in <hi>Galathea's</hi> courage, was an effect of Love; for I plainly perceived her heart to melt, but withall, it was no <U+017F>mall argument of her high <U+017F>pirit for, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he would not give any knowledge of it unto me, and not being able to hold her countenance, which grew pale, <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o tie up her tongue, that <U+017F>he did not utter one word, which did argue any inclination to bend, but went out of her Chamber into the Garden, and <U+017F>pake not one <U+017F>yllable of this Letter: for the Sun began to grow low, and her maladie, which was a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e of the minde, might better divert and <U+017F>olace it <U+017F>elfe abroad, than in bed; <U+017F>o as after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>leightly dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he went into the Garden, and would have none but me with her: I asked her, by the way, whether <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed to return any an<U+017F>wer unto his Letter? And <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wering, No: Will you then Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, be plea<U+017F>ed, to give me leave to write unto him? You, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what will you write?

The Herauld at the Gates of the Town, de<U+017F>ired to be conducted unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is;</hi> and every one, out of curio<U+017F>ity to hear what newes, went along with him. The Guards of the Town did let them in, and after <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, they were conducted unto her, who had <U+017F>ent for <hi>Clidaman</hi> to entertain the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers: After the Knight had made a low Reverence unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> the Herauld <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words in a kinde of a <U+017F>trange language: Madam, this Knight whom you <U+017F>ee here, being one of the highe<U+017F>t qualitie in all his Country, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that any man of honour, might freely demand <U+017F>atisfaction of any that <U+017F>hould wrong him he comes here to ask the <U+017F>ame favour from you, which you never denyed unto any, which is, to permit him in your pre<U+017F>ence, and in pre<U+017F>ence of all the<U+017F>e fair Nymphs, to draw a <U+017F>atisfaction from the man that hath injured him, by <U+017F>uch waies, as are allowed unto per<U+017F>ons of his qualitie. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> after a little con<U+017F>ideration with her<U+017F>elfe, returned this an<U+017F>wer, That it was true, this way of defending honour had ever been the cu<U+017F>tom of her Court; but <U+017F>he, being a woman, never permitted any to try the matter by Armes: yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, her Son being now at an age able to decide a greater bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e than this, <U+017F>he would refer it wholly unto him. <hi>Clidaman</hi> never <U+017F>taying for the Herauld's reply, <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Madam, this is the way, not only to be honoured by all tho<U+017F>e who inhabit in tho<U+017F>e Provinces, over which the gods have placed you the great Lady, but it is al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t to puni<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch as are faulty, and to honour <U+017F>uch as do de<U+017F>erve it; and the be<U+017F>t way of all, is that of Armes, e<U+017F>peciallly in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, as cannot otherwi<U+017F>e be decided: <U+017F>o as if you do not allow of this mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t way of di<U+017F>covering the villanies of wicked men, you will encourage all wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and ba<U+017F>e men will not care what villany they commit, <U+017F>o they can do it <U+017F>ecretly. Moreover, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, who are the fir<U+017F>t that ever had recour<U+017F>e unto you, would have great rea<U+017F>on to complain, if they <U+017F>hould be the fir<U+017F>t that are refu<U+017F>ed and denied ju<U+017F>tice: And therefore, <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to refer the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me. I <U+017F>hall give this Knight free liberty, to accu<U+017F>e and defie whom he will, and will promi<U+017F>e him a fair tryall in the field. The Knight then kneeled down, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his hand, and gave him humble thanks. Sir, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o noble, I mu<U+017F>t acquaint you, that the Knight I am in que<U+017F>t of, his name is <hi>Polemas,</hi> whom I be<U+017F>eech you to produce, that I may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h my end that I came for. <hi>Polemas</hi> hearing him<U+017F>elfe named, <U+017F>tepped forward, and in his lofty garb, <U+017F>aid, Who is he that is in que<U+017F>t of me? I am the man he looks for. Then the unknowne Knight went to him, and gave him his Gauntlet, and the Herauld <U+017F>aid, Sir, this Knight pre<U+017F>ents that unto you as a gage, promi<U+017F>ing, that tomorrow morning by Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>e he will meet you, and prove, that you have mo<U+017F>t villanou<U+017F>ly invented all tho<U+017F>e lyes which you have <U+017F>poken of him. Herauld, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> I do accept the gage, and though I do not know this Knight, yet I am certain to have ju<U+017F>tice on my <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>ure, that I never <U+017F>aid any thing again<U+017F>t Truth, and let tomorrow be the day to try it. Then the Knight, after a low reverence unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and all the Ladies, went unto his Tent, that he had cau<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>et up without the Gates of the Town. You may well imagine, how this filled all the Court with di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who loved <hi>Polemas</hi> very well, and were very <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee him in this danger; however, a promi<U+017F>e had obliged them to allow the field. As for <hi>Polemas,</hi> he, like a man of great courage, prepared him<U+017F>elfe for Combat, not knowing his enemy. And for <hi>Galathea,</hi> who had almo<U+017F>t forgotten the injury that <hi>Polemas</hi> had done unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> <U+017F>he thinking, that he did not know his harm came from thence, <U+017F>he never thought of <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
nor I neither, who thought him to be a hundred miles off; and yet it was he, who having received my Letter, re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53526:74"/>
to <U+017F>eek revenge this way. But to be <U+017F>hort, for I am no good fighter, and therefore can make but a bad relation of the Combat; but let me tell you as well as I can, that after a long Combat, wherein both <U+017F>ides had equall advantages, and both of them <U+017F>o full of wounds, that death was much more likely to be both their <U+017F>hares, than life, in<U+017F>omuch as every one began to pitty the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of two <U+017F>uch valiant men, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> told <hi>Clidaman,</hi> that it was be<U+017F>t to part them, and none could be thought more fit for it, than <hi>Galathea;</hi> <U+017F>he being al<U+017F>o much moved unto pitty, was glad to do the good office, and <U+017F>o with three or foure of us, <U+017F>he went into the li<U+017F>ts: When <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t entred, the victory <U+017F>eem'd to incline more unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Polemas</hi> was reduced into <U+017F>uch a bad condition, as he was almo<U+017F>t quite <U+017F>pent. Unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe, and pulling him by the Scarfe which hung behinde him <U+017F>he drew him a little back: When he felt him<U+017F>elf touched, he turned <U+017F>uddenly about, thinking he was betrayed, &amp; with <U+017F>uch fury, as the Nymph recoyling, for fear of being hurt, was intangled in her Gown, and fell in the mid<U+017F>t of the Li<U+017F>ts. <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who knew her, ran pre<U+017F>ently to take her up: But <hi>Polemas,</hi> without regard unto the Nymph <U+017F>eeing this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, gave <hi>Lindamor</hi> two or three <U+017F>uch blowes upon the head behind, as made him <U+017F>toop to the ground; but he got up again <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t his enemy, that maugre all <hi>Galathea's</hi> prayers, he would not leave him, till he laid him under his feet: then getting upon him, he di<U+017F>armed his head, and when he was ready to give him his di<U+017F>patching blow, he heard the voice of his adored Lady crying out, Oh Knight, I do conjure you by her whom you love mo<U+017F>t, to give me the life of this Knight. I will, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lindamor</hi> unto her, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that he hath fal<U+017F>ly reported things of me, and of her, by whom you conjure me. <hi>Polemas</hi> being as he thought, at the la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>p of life, did confe<U+017F><U+017F>e what they would. Thus <hi>Lindamor</hi> got the day, and went away, after he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of his Mi<U+017F>tris, who knew him not, though he <U+017F>poke unto her, his Helmet, and her own fears, kept her from taking any notice of his voice; but, as he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by me, he <U+017F>aid thus unto me in a low voice, Fair <hi>Leonida.</hi> I am too much obliged to you to conceal my <U+017F>elfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>ee the effect of your Letter. Then without any more <U+017F>tay, he got on Hor<U+017F>eback, though much wounded, and galloped pre<U+017F>ently out of <U+017F>ight: this over-much <U+017F>tirring of his body by riding, did him much hurt, and brought him to that extreamity, that being come into the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Eluriall's</hi> Aunt, where he re<U+017F>olved to lodge, in ca<U+017F>e he was wounded, he was <U+017F>o weak, that it was three weeks before he could <U+017F>tirr out of his bed. In the mean time, <hi>Galathea</hi> was extreamly angry with this unknown Knight, for not leaving the Combat when fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired him, being more offended at his refu<U+017F>all, than obliged by what he had given her. And <hi>Polemas</hi> being, as you know of a high rank, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Clidaman</hi> cau<U+017F>ed him with much griefe to be carried off the field, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care, in<U+017F>omuch as they began to be in <U+017F>ome hopes of his life.</p>
               <p>Every one was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know who this unknown Knight was, who<U+017F>e cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and valour had got him the e<U+017F>teem of very many; <hi>Galathea</hi> was the only per<U+017F>on that had an ill opinion of him: for this proud Beauty remembred the offence, and forgot the courte<U+017F>ie; and becau<U+017F>e it was to me only, that <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed to vent her mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret thoughts, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me in private with her: Do you know this di<U+017F>courteous Knight, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, unto whom Fortune, and not his Valour, hath given the advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat? Madam, <U+017F>aid I, I do know him to be both a valiant and a courteous Knight. He has not <U+017F>hew'd it in this action, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; for if he had, he would have left fighting at my fir<U+017F>t reque<U+017F>t. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, you do blame him for that, which you ought to e<U+017F>teem him for, <U+017F>ince in doing honour unto you, he thereby was in danger of his life. But, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he would not leave <U+017F>ighting when I de<U+017F>ired him. Had he not all the rea<U+017F>on in the world, <U+017F>aid I unto her, to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e the ba<U+017F>e act of <hi>Polemas,</hi> who would not fir<U+017F>t ceafe: for my part, I think he did very well, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> could not in honour do le<U+017F>s then he did. How, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, was it <hi>Lindamor</hi> who fought? The truth is, I was <U+017F>orry that I had unawares named him, but <U+017F>eeing it was out, I thought be<U+017F>t to tell her; Yes, Madam, (<U+017F>aid I) it was <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi> who being offended at the report of <hi>Polemas,</hi> would try the truth of them by Armes. She was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it, and after <U+017F>he had awhile con<U+017F>idered upon this accident, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me; Then I <U+017F>ee it is <hi>Lindamor</hi> who hath done me this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courte<U+017F>ie, that is <U+017F>o <U+017F>hallow in his re<U+017F>pects unto me: Was he <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>iderate, as to put my Honour to the hazard of Fortune and Armes? Upon this <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ilent, and extreamly vexed. And I, who would by any means make her know, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was in no fault, did thus an<U+017F>wer her; Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, Madam, that you <U+017F>hould thus complain again<U+017F>t <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and not <U+017F>ee the wrong you do your <U+017F>elfe? What di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>y has he done you? Has he not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53526:74"/>
vanqui<U+017F>hed <hi>Polemas</hi> your enemy? How, my enemy, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <hi>Lindamor</hi> is much more for he gave <hi>Polemas</hi> the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e. Oh heavens, Madam, <U+017F>aid I then unto her, what do you mean? <hi>Lindamor</hi> more your enemy, who has no <U+017F>oul but to adore you, nor one drop of blood that he would not <U+017F>pend in your <U+017F>ervice? And can he be more your friend, who by his <U+017F>ubtle di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e endeavours to <U+017F>tain your honour? But <hi>Leonida,</hi> replied <U+017F>he, Who knowes whether <hi>Lindamor,</hi> out of his accu<U+017F>tomed arrogance and pride, did not <U+017F>peak tho<U+017F>e words, wherwith <hi>Polemas</hi> did tax him. But Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, how much are you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for making your enemy confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that he did invent them? Oh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I be<U+017F>eech you pardon me, if I do accu<U+017F>e you of great ingratitude, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> hazzards his life, to make it appear <hi>Polemas</hi> lyed: You accu<U+017F>e him of incon<U+017F>ideration, and his making the Lyar to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e his Lye; you tax him with di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie: Had he not taken him<U+017F>elfe to Armes, how <U+017F>hould the truth ever have appeared? and had he left fighting when fir<U+017F>t you commanded him, <hi>Polemas</hi> had then never confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed what you and every one heard. Ah, poor <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how I pitty thy fortune? What can<U+017F>t thou po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly do to plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal <U+017F>ervices are looked upon as offences and crimes. Well, well, Madam, perhaps you will not have long to u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e cruelties; for I beleeve, death, more pittifull than you, will put an end unto your ingratitude and his torments; and may be, at this very hour he is dead, which if he be, then the Nimph, <hi>Galathea,</hi> is the cau<U+017F>e of it. Why do you accu<U+017F>e me? (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he.) Becau<U+017F>e, replied I, when you went to part them, and fell upon the ground, he helped you up, and in the mean while the courteous <hi>Polemas</hi> whom you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol <U+017F>o highly, did mo<U+017F>t ba<U+017F>ely wound him in two or three places; and I <U+017F>aw <hi>Lindamors</hi> blood run upon the ground after it; but if he doe die upon it, it is the lea<U+017F>t evil he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you for, to be <U+017F>corned after <U+017F>o much duty, is, me-thinks, a mi<U+017F>ery never equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But, Madam, I pray remember, the time was, you <U+017F>aid there was no way to <U+017F>top the<U+017F>e reports of <hi>Polemas,</hi> but by <U+017F>word and blood: He has done what you deemed the be<U+017F>t, and yet you mu<U+017F>t needs tax him for doing ill. Had not <hi>Sylvia,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Nymphs interrupted us, I beleeve I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>omewhat tempered the animo<U+017F>ity of this Nymph: But <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o much company coming in, we changed di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; yet my words were not without their effect, though <U+017F>he would not make it appear unto me; but yet I <U+017F>aw it by a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ymptomes. For <U+017F>ince that day, I re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>peak unto her no more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t asked me. She on the other <U+017F>ide expected that I <U+017F>hould begin: And thus eight dayes pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and not a word pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt us of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. In the mean time, <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> was not without his cares, to know what reports went of him at Court, and what <hi>Galathea</hi> thought. He <U+017F>ent <hi>Flurial</hi> unto me upon the <U+017F>ame bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and to bring me a <U+017F>hort Letter: And <hi>Flurial</hi> was <U+017F>o ingenuous, that he did his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and <hi>Galathea</hi> never took any notice of it. The Letter was this.</p>

               <p>I enquired very particularly of <hi>Flurial</hi> how he did, and whether any knew him: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood he had lo<U+017F>t much blood, and that did mo<U+017F>t retard his cure, but that he was not in any danger. I perceived he could not be known, becau<U+017F>e his Herald was a <hi>Frank</hi> of <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>'s Army, far off; and tho<U+017F>e about, were not permitted to <U+017F>tir out of the hou<U+017F>e: And that <hi>Flurials</hi> Aunt knew no more of him but that he was the unknown Knight that fought with <hi>Polemas,</hi> who<U+017F>e valour and bounty, made them all very diligent about him. Al<U+017F>o that he had commanded <hi>Flurial</hi> to come and know of me, how reports went at Court, and what he <U+017F>hould do. I commanded him to tell <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that all the Court was full of his valour, though he was unknown; that he <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe, and have a care of his cure, and that I would <U+017F>tudy his contentment as much as I could: But, I told him, it was convenient before he went, 'to ask <hi>Galathea's</hi> leave, pretending to <U+017F>ee his Aunt. So
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53526:75"/>
the next morning when <hi>Galathea</hi> was in the Garden, <hi>Flurial</hi> made a low reverence unto her, and offered to <U+017F>peak with her: But <hi>Galathea,</hi> thinking it was to deliver <U+017F>ome Letter unto her from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> was <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed, as <U+017F>he grew as pale as death it <U+017F>elfe: and, le<U+017F>t <hi>Flurial</hi> <U+017F>hould take any notice of this alteration in her face, I <U+017F>tepped forward and <U+017F>aid unto her, Madam it is <hi>Flurial</hi> who hath been with his Aunt that is <U+017F>ick and be<U+017F>eecheth you will be plea<U+017F>ed to give him leave to go againe unto her for <U+017F>ome certain dayes. <hi>Galathea</hi> then turned towards me and asked what <U+017F>he was <U+017F>icke of: and I an<U+017F>wered, that it was a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of many yeares continuance, and <U+017F>uch a one as was out of all hopes of any cure. Then <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Flurial</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto him. Go <hi>Flurial</hi> &amp; return again as<U+017F>oon as you can, but not before your Aunt be recovered, for I ever loved her very well, for her con<U+017F>tant good affection to me, Then <U+017F>he continued on her walk, I talked with him and <U+017F>eemed as if I were di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed, though I was not, that the Nymph might take notice of me: but <U+017F>aid I unto him be <U+017F>ure <hi>Flurial,</hi> thou bee<U+017F>t both <U+017F>ecret and prudent; for there upon depends either thy happine<U+017F>s or thy ruine; &amp; above al be <U+017F>ure thou do<U+017F>t, what<U+017F>oever <hi>Lindamor</hi> commands thee: after a promi<U+017F>e of al fidelity, he went away, &amp; I began to put on a face of extream <U+017F>orrow: And when I was in any place; where, the Nymph might heare me, I would <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>igh, lift my hands pu to heaven, &amp; clap them both together; &amp; u<U+017F>ed all the ge<U+017F>tures I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>eeme the mo<U+017F>t grieved <U+017F>oul that ever breathed. She hearing me often mention <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> untomy <U+017F>elf, &amp; never <U+017F>o much as name him unto her, but on the contrary did <U+017F>hun all occa<U+017F>ions of it; and in lieu of that frolique humour I u<U+017F>ed in all company, to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a lump of melancholy, <U+017F>he began by degrees to be of that opinion I wi<U+017F>hed, but not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for my de<U+017F>ign was to make her beleeve, that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as he went off from the combate, was <U+017F>o wounded that he dyed, to the end that pitty might obtaine from this proud <U+017F>oul, what affection and <U+017F>ervice could not. Now my plot was <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly carried, that it took almo<U+017F>t according to my wi<U+017F>h for though <U+017F>he <U+017F>et as good a face upon it as <U+017F>he could, yet <U+017F>he was touched to the very quick for <hi>Lindamor.</hi> So as perceiving me thus mute and <U+017F>ad, <U+017F>he imagined him to be very ill, or wor<U+017F>e; and was <U+017F>o extreamly troubled in this conceipt that <U+017F>he was not able to hold any longer.</p>
               <p>Two dayes after <hi>Flurial</hi> was gone, <U+017F>he called me into her clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, and <U+017F>eeming to talk of <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he asked me, whether I knew how <hi>Flurials</hi> Aunt did? I an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>ince he went I heard nothing. Truly, <U+017F>ayes <U+017F>he, I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry if that good old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <U+017F>hould dye. You have rea<U+017F>on Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, for <U+017F>he ever loved you and was alwaies very <U+017F>erviceable to you. If <U+017F>he live, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I <U+017F>hal requite her; and if <U+017F>he die I <U+017F>hall love <hi>Furial</hi> for her <U+017F>ake. Then I an<U+017F>wered that indeed it was very true, the <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices both of the Aunt and Nephew de<U+017F>erved recompence, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Flurial,</hi> for his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and affection could not be corrupted. 'Tis very true, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he: but for <hi>Flurial,</hi> what long and <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was that which you had with him when he went away? I an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a faint and <U+017F>ad tone, nothing but de<U+017F>ired him to commend me to his Aunt. Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do not u<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>o long. Then <U+017F>he came neare me, and laying her hand upon my <U+017F>houlder, Tel me truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, did you talke of nothing el<U+017F>e? What <U+017F>hould I talke of el<U+017F>e except that, replyed I; for I have no other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with him? Now do I know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you do di<U+017F><U+017F>emble. Why do you <U+017F>ay, you have no other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with him? have you none that concernes <hi>Lindamor?</hi> Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid I, I did not think, you could have any memorie now of one that was <U+017F>o unfortunate; then <U+017F>tanding in a <U+017F>ilentand dejected po<U+017F>ture, I <U+017F>ighed very profundly two or three times. What is it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that cau<U+017F>eth you to <U+017F>igh thus? Tell me truly, where is <hi>Lindamor? Lindamor,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, alas, he is not now a man of this world. How, cryed <U+017F>he out, is <hi>Lindamor</hi> dead? Yes certainly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered I, and your cruelty did kill him more then the blowes of his enemy. For going off from the combate, and knowing by <U+017F>everall reports how ill you were <U+017F>atisfied with him, he would never <U+017F>uffer him<U+017F>elfe to be dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and if you will needs know it, this was the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e I had with <hi>Flurial,</hi> whom I commanded to try, if he could hand<U+017F>omly get away tho<U+017F>e Letters which you have written unto him, that you might burn them, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of him both together. Oh my god, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he then unto me, what <U+017F>ad <U+017F>tory is this you tell me? is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould be thus lo<U+017F>t? you <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid, replyed I, that it was your <U+017F>elfe that kil'd him, and that it is you that has the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e: for as for him, he is a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his death, &amp; he finds that re<U+017F>t there which your cruelty would never let him enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Ah <hi>Leonida</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I hope all this is onely to vex me, Tel me truly, is he alive? I would he were, an<U+017F>wered I, but why <U+017F>hould you be <U+017F>o inqui<U+017F>itive? I am <U+017F>ure life and death was both a like indifferent to you. And <U+017F>ince your love to him was <U+017F>o little, me thinks you <U+017F>hould
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53526:75"/>
be glad to be rid of that trouble which he was unto you. For you mu<U+017F>t think that had he lived he would have been perpetually giving you <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timonies of his affection, as this with <hi>Polemas</hi> was. Truly, <U+017F>aid the Nimph, then I do mo<U+017F>t heartily lament the lo<U+017F>s of poor <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <U+017F>wear unto you, that his death wounds me deeper than I could have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it would. But tell me, had he no remembrance of us at his la<U+017F>t end? And did hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s no <U+017F>orrows to leave us? This que<U+017F>tion, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, is <U+017F>omthing <U+017F>trange; he dyed for the love of you, and yet you ask, whether he had you in his memory? Ala<U+017F>s, ala<U+017F>s, his memory, and his <U+017F>orrows, were too much for his health; but I be<U+017F>eech you let us talk no more of him: I am confident he is in a place where he receives the wages of his fidelity and where, perhaps, he will <U+017F>ee revenge upon you. You are angry, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me. I be<U+017F>eech you pardon me, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her. I have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on for what I <U+017F>ay; for there is none can give a better te<U+017F>timony of his affection and fidelity than my <U+017F>elf, and of your ingratitude wherewith you have recompenced <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices. Let us leave that, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph; for I do acknowledge you are in the right but I be<U+017F>eech you by the affection you have unto me, to tell me whether he had any remembrance of me in his la<U+017F>t <U+017F>peech? and what words he u<U+017F>ed? Will you needs triumph, Madam, in his la<U+017F>t breath, <U+017F>aid I, as you have in all the re<U+017F>t of his life? If you would I will give you full <U+017F>atisfaction. As <U+017F>oon as ever he heard, that you did endeavour by your words to blemi<U+017F>h the honour of his Victory, and that in lieu of plea<U+017F>ing you by his Combat, he had gotten your hatred, he pulled off all clothes that lapped his wounds, and leaving them all open, hee would never <U+017F>uffer the hand of any Chirurgeon to come near them. His wounds were not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but when they were putrified, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he felt he could not live any longer, he called for <hi>Flurial,</hi> and when he was alone with him, he <U+017F>aid thus; <hi>Flurial,</hi> my good friend, thou mu<U+017F>t now lo<U+017F>e one that had a de<U+017F>ire to doe thee <U+017F>ome good, but thou mu<U+017F>t arm thy <U+017F>elf with patience, <U+017F>ince it is the will of heaven. I would reque<U+017F>t one peece of <U+017F>ervice more from thee, which is the be<U+017F>t thou ever did<U+017F>t me: And having got a faithful promi<U+017F>e from him that hee would doe it, he went on with his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. As <U+017F>oon as ever I am dead, open my brea<U+017F>t, take out my heart, carry it unto the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> and tell her, I <U+017F>ent it, to the end, that after my death I may not retain any thing which was not my own. As as <U+017F>oon ever the<U+017F>e words were <U+017F>poken, he lo<U+017F>t both <U+017F>peech and life. Now this fool <hi>Flurial,</hi> in performance of his promi<U+017F>e unto him he loved <U+017F>o dearly, brought hither the heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and, but for me, would have pre<U+017F>ented it unto you. Ah <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he then, is it certain he is dead? Oh heavens, I <U+017F>hould never know of his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s? Would none tel me of it? Oh <hi>Leonida,</hi> you were much too blame. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I I did not know any thing of it; for <hi>Flurial</hi> <U+017F>tayed all the while with him becau<U+017F>e he brought none of his own <U+017F>ervants with him: But if I had known of it, I think I <U+017F>hould never have acquainted you, <U+017F>ince I knew you to be <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e unto any thing that came from him. Then leaning her head upon her arm, <U+017F>he commanded me to leave her by her <U+017F>elf, as I think, that I might not <U+017F>ee her tears, which began already to trickle from her eyes: Yet I was no <U+017F>ooner gone, but <U+017F>he called me back, and never looking up, bade me command <hi>Flurial</hi> to bring what <hi>Lindamor</hi> had <U+017F>ent unto her; for <U+017F>he would by any means have it. Then I went out in <U+017F>ure hopes that my plot would take effect according to my expected de<U+017F>ires. Mean while, when <hi>Flurial</hi> was returned unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he found him full of impatient longing for him, but my Letter gave him full <U+017F>atisfaction. It was thus penned.</p>

               <p>My an<U+017F>wer in <U+017F>hort was, becau<U+017F>e I will not trouble you with too many Letters, that as <U+017F>oon as he found him<U+017F>elf able to travail, he <U+017F>hould finde <U+017F>ome way or other to come and <U+017F>peak with me; and as briefly as I could I let him under<U+017F>tand all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e between <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> and me; al<U+017F>o how <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented the news of his death, and de<U+017F>ired to have his Heart. But ob<U+017F>erve the force of a great affection: <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that had <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everall wounds, and lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much blood, as did narrowly endanger his life; yet, beyond all hopes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he received my la<U+017F>t Letter, he did ri<U+017F>e out of his bed, dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe, and within two or three dayes after got on Hor<U+017F>eback to come unto me; and becau<U+017F>e he dur<U+017F>t not come by day, for fear of being <U+017F>een, he put him<U+017F>elfe into the habit of a Gardiner, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him<U+017F>elfe Cou<U+017F>en unto <hi>Fluriall,</hi> and re<U+017F>olved to come into the Garden, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have him<U+017F>elfe as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould require: Telling the Aunt of <hi>Fluriall,</hi> that he had made a vow before the Combat, and mu<U+017F>t needs go and perform it, before he went out of the Country; and fearing the friends of <hi>Rolemas,</hi> he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>uch a habit, and de<U+017F>ired her not to <U+017F>peak of it: The good old woman would have di<U+017F><U+017F>waded him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed him to defer his voyage untill another time. But he being inflamed with zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, told her, that if he did not perform it before he went out of the Country, he <U+017F>hould think him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ubject unto all the cur<U+017F>es of all the gods. So to prevent meeting with any, he went in the night, and came <U+017F>o happily into the Garden, as he was un<U+017F>een of any. <hi>Fluriall</hi> carried him into the hou<U+017F>e, in which there was then none but a drudge that helped him to dig, whom he made believe that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was his Cozen, whom he would teach the trade of a Gardiner. Thus <hi>Lindamor</hi> expected the morning with a longing de<U+017F>ire, and the night <U+017F>eemed longer than ordinary unto him, that waited for effecting his de<U+017F>ires. Morning was no <U+017F>ooner come, but <hi>Lindamor</hi> was in the Garden with a <U+017F>pade in his hand: Had you but <U+017F>een him with this tool in his hand, and how aukwardly he handled it, you would have known, that he was not much ver<U+017F>ed in it, but knew better how to wield a Spear than a Spade; and I have heard him <U+017F>ince <U+017F>wear a hundred times, that he was never in all his life <U+017F>o a<U+017F>hamed, as when he did pre<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elfe before his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e in that habit, and that he was in two or three mindes, whether he <U+017F>hould return or no: but at la<U+017F>t, Love <U+017F>urmounted the <U+017F>hame, and kept him there untill we came.</p>
               <p>As fortune was, the Nymph came that day into the Garden, with many of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panious; a<U+017F>soon is <U+017F>he <U+017F>pied <hi>Flurial,</hi> <U+017F>he trembled like an A<U+017F>pen leaf, and ca<U+017F>t her eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but though I endeavoured to <U+017F>peak with him, yet I could not, becau<U+017F>e this new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner was <U+017F>o neer him, who was <U+017F>o altered in his habit, that none of us knew him. As for me; I might as well as any of the re<U+017F>t be excu<U+017F>ed, for <U+017F>ince he never acquainted me with his de<U+017F>igne, I <U+017F>hould never have believed he would have attempted it, untill he had fir<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me; but he has <U+017F>ince told me, that he did conceal it from me, becau<U+017F>e he knew I would not have permitted him to come thither in that manner. Dreaming then of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than him, I did as inqui<U+017F>itivly ask <hi>Flurial</hi> who this <U+017F>tranger was, as any in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and he an<U+017F>wered me in a faint voice, that he was his Aunts <U+017F>on, whom he intended to in<U+017F>truct in the trade of Gardening. Upon this an<U+017F>wer, <hi>Galathea,</hi> as inqui<U+017F>itive, but not <U+017F>o couragious, as I, <U+017F>eeing me in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, came to us, and hearing that he was <hi>Fluriall's</hi> Oozen, did ask him how his Mother did? Now was <hi>Lindamor</hi> put to his <U+017F>hifts, fearing lea<U+017F>t his tongue, though not his habit, <U+017F>hould betray him; yet, counterfeiting his Tone as well as he could, he an<U+017F>wered in a Country-like language. That, ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed be God, <U+017F>he was now pa<U+017F>t the wor<U+017F>t, and then made <U+017F>uch a Leg, <U+017F>o like his Language, that all the Nymphs could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh: but he <U+017F>eeming to take no notice of them, nor <U+017F>tirring his cap, but giving it a <U+017F>curvy remove with both his hands, he fell ill-favour'dly to his work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Galathea,</hi> in a <U+017F>miling manner, told <hi>Fluriall,</hi> that if his Con<U+017F>en were as good a Gardiner, as he was an Oratour, he would be very u<U+017F>efull unto him. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Fluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53526:76"/>
he can <U+017F>peak no better than he was taught; Country people all <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o, Yes, yes, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, and perhaps he is held for a prime fellow among<U+017F>t them. After this, <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her walk. This gave me an opportunity of talking to <hi>Flurial,</hi> for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were all got about <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and every one had their que<U+017F>tions to him, unto which he an<U+017F>wered, but <U+017F>o ill-favour'dly, that he forced them all to laugh, for it was in <U+017F>uch a manner, as made them all believe he was in good earne<U+017F>t; and though he did an<U+017F>wer unto every que<U+017F>tion, yet hee never <U+017F>tirred his cap nor head, but <U+017F>eemed very intent upon his work. In the mean time, I asked <hi>Flurial,</hi> how <hi>Lindamor</hi> did And he an<U+017F>wered, that truly he was yet very ill; for <hi>Lindamor</hi> had commanded him to tell me <U+017F>o. But where lies his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I unto him, for thou <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t, his wounds are almo<U+017F>t whole? You will know, Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto me, by this Letter which he hath writ unto my Lady. His Lady, an<U+017F>wered I, hath an opinion that he is dead, but give me the Letter, and I will carry it unto her. I dare not indeed Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, for he hath expre<U+017F>ly forbidden me, and tyed me unto it by an Oath. How, <U+017F>aid I does <hi>Lindamor</hi> mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t me? No, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but on the contrary, de<U+017F>ires you to make the Nymph <U+017F>till believe that he is dead: But, it will be both advantageous unto him and me, that I do deliver it with my own hands. I was now very angry with him, and had continued in longer di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, had I not feared notice would have been taken: Yet, I could get nothing more out of him; but for a conclu<U+017F>ion, the Nymph mu<U+017F>t receive it from his hand: But when I told him, that he had been long with the Nymph, and he might have pre<U+017F>ented the Letter unto her: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered me only with a <U+017F>hake of his head, whereby I perceived, that he would not give it unto me. <hi>Galathea</hi> perceiving our long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and de<U+017F>irous to know upon what <U+017F>ubject it was, did leave her walk <U+017F>ooner then u<U+017F>uall, and calling me unto her, asked me what it was? I told her freely the re<U+017F>olution of <hi>Fluriall;</hi> but, in lieu of the Letter, I told her it was the Heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and how he was <U+017F>worn to deliver it to none but her, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould betray the tru<U+017F>t of the dead. Then <hi>Galathea</hi> an<U+017F>wered me he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it unto me, under colour of pre<U+017F>enting me with a Basket of Fruit, in which the Heart may be put in the bottome. I an<U+017F>wered, that this might well be done; but I know, <hi>Fluriall</hi> the fool will deliver it with his own hands, in expectation of <U+017F>ome reward for the <U+017F>ervices he hath done you. Oh, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if that be all, let him ask what he will, and I will give it unto him. This, Madam, <U+017F>aid I, will <U+017F>eem a kinde of ran<U+017F>ome, with which you redeem the heart. No, no, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, the Ran<U+017F>ome I am to pay for it, is Tears, and tho<U+017F>e drawn from my hearts blood. Perhaps <U+017F>he was <U+017F>orry for <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o much; but however, <U+017F>o it was, <U+017F>he commanded me to <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Flurial,</hi> which I did, and u<U+017F>ed all the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I had to get this Letter from him, even as far as threatnings, but all in vain for he told me once for all, that neither heaven nor earth <U+017F>hould make him for<U+017F>worn: If my Lady, <U+017F>aid he, will have it, let her come in the evening to the bottom of the back <U+017F>taires which comes from her Chamber into the Garden, the Moon <U+017F>hines, the way is not <U+017F>o far, and I have known her come the <U+017F>ame journey as late; when <U+017F>he heares me, I am confident <U+017F>he will allow of my rea<U+017F>ons. When I heard this, I was extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at him, and told him, it was his duty to obey <hi>Galathea</hi> before <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that <U+017F>he was his Mi<U+017F>tris, and that it was in her power to do him good or harm: and to be <U+017F>hort, that it was not likely <U+017F>he would take <U+017F>o much paines for it: but he <U+017F>till re<U+017F>olutely told me thus; Nymph, it is not <hi>Lindamor</hi> whom I do obey in this; but it is my oath which I have vowed unto the gods; and if I cannot performe it, there is no, remedy; I can returne to the place from whence I came. When I <U+017F>aw him thus re<U+017F>olute, I was almo<U+017F>t out of all patience: for had I been acquainted with <hi>Lindamor's</hi> de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>ince it was gone <U+017F>o far, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>econded him; but being ignorant of it, I thought <hi>Flurial</hi> <U+017F>o far from all rea<U+017F>on, as I knew not what to <U+017F>ay: At la<U+017F>t, I returned to the Nymph with his an<U+017F>wer, who was <U+017F>o extreamly angry at him, as <U+017F>he could have found in heart to have turned him out of her Mothers <U+017F>ervice, had I not hinted unto her the danger that might have en<U+017F>ued by his di<U+017F>covery. Three or foure daies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus, before the Nymph would be brought to do as <hi>Flurial</hi> de<U+017F>ired: At la<U+017F>t, Love, that commands all, forced her to tell me in the morning, that <U+017F>he had no re<U+017F>t all night, that <hi>Lindamor's</hi> Gho<U+017F>t haunted her all the night, and told her, that it was the lea<U+017F>t thing <U+017F>he could do for his memory, to go down a pair of <U+017F>tairs, to get his heart out of the hands of another; and that I <U+017F>hould acquaint <hi>Fluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> <U+017F>he would be there that night. Oh heavens! what joy was this unto the new Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he hath <U+017F>ince told me, his heart was never in his life <U+017F>o <U+017F>well'd with joy, as then; for he began to de<U+017F>pair of his plot taking effect, and <U+017F>eeing the Nymph never came into the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53526:77"/>
Garden, he feared that <U+017F>he knew him. But when <hi>Flurial</hi> acquainted him with the re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that was taken, this was <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>urrection of Love, as if one <U+017F>hould die to make another mourn, and revive to make them rejoyce. The night being come, and every one retired to their lodgings, the Nymph did put her <U+017F>elfe into her night dre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and cau<U+017F>ing me to open the dore, <U+017F>he went fir<U+017F>t; and, I <U+017F>wear, <U+017F>he trembled <U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he had much ado to go; <U+017F>he told me, that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uch an unu<U+017F>uall beating at her <U+017F>tomack, as took away all her <U+017F>trength; whether it was her being in the dark without light, or her going out at an undue time, or her apprehen<U+017F>ion of <hi>Lindamor's</hi> heart, I know not; but what<U+017F>oever it was, <U+017F>he was much unlike her <U+017F>elfe: At la<U+017F>t, growing a little more confident, we came to the bottome of the <U+017F>taires, where we pre<U+017F>ently found <hi>Flurial,</hi> who had waited long for us: The Nymph went before, and going into a Je<U+017F><U+017F>emine Arbour, which was <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, as to keep out the Moon-<U+017F>hine, or any <U+017F>ight from the windowes of the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>ay thus to <hi>Fluriall</hi> in a great rage: 'Tis very well, <hi>Flurial,</hi> are you grown <U+017F>o <U+017F>tiffe in your own opinions, that you will not do what I command you? Madam, an<U+017F>wered he undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, it was to obey you that I have failed in this, if it be a fault; for did not you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, that I <U+017F>hould punctually do what<U+017F>oever <hi>Lindamor</hi> commanded me? Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, be<U+017F>ides your command, I am obliged by oath unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to put his heart into no hands but yours. Well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>ighed, where is his heart? Here Madam, <U+017F>aid he; if you plea<U+017F>e to come hither into this corner, you will better <U+017F>ee it than where you are. When <U+017F>he came to the place, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw a man <U+017F>tanding upon his feet, and without <U+017F>peaking a word, bowed him<U+017F>elfe unto her. Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid the Nymph, what's here? <hi>Flurial,</hi> <U+017F>ee, here's a man. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Flurial,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, it is a heart that is pre<U+017F>ented unto you. How? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, a heart: Then would <U+017F>he have run away for fear; but he took hold of her Gown, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and held her. I hearing the<U+017F>e words, came neerer, and pre<U+017F>ently knew him to be the <U+017F>ame that <hi>Fluriall</hi> called Gozen. Upon a <U+017F>uddain I knew not what to think: I <U+017F>aw <hi>Galathea</hi> and I my <U+017F>elf with two men, the one of which was unknown unto us; <U+017F>o as we knew not what to do. Cry out, we dur<U+017F>t not; fly, <hi>Galathea</hi> could not; to put any hopes in our own <U+017F>trength, we could not. At la<U+017F>t, all I could do, was, to lay hold on his hand that held <hi>Galathea</hi> by the Gown, and not able to do more, I began to <U+017F>cratch and bite him, which I did <U+017F>o upon a <U+017F>uddain, that the fir<U+017F>t thing he <U+017F>aw was his hand bitten. Oh <U+017F>weet <hi>Leonida</hi> (<U+017F>aid he then unto me) how would you u<U+017F>e your enemies, if you u<U+017F>e your <U+017F>ervants thus <U+017F>harply? Though I was almo<U+017F>t quite out of my <U+017F>elfe, yet me thought I <U+017F>hould know that voice, and asked him, who he was? I am, <U+017F>aid he, one that comes to bring <hi>Lindamor's</hi> Heart unto this fair Nymph. Then kneeling down upon the ground, he thus addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto her: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, that this pre<U+017F>umption is great, but yet not equall unto that affection which produceth it. Here, Madam, is the heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> which I pre<U+017F>ent unto you; I hope the pre<U+017F>ent will finde as good a reception from the hand of the Donor, as from a <U+017F>tranger. But, if my dia<U+017F>terous Fate do deny me that which Love doth promi<U+017F>e me, having offended again<U+017F>t a Divinity whom I only adore, then condemn this heart which here I do bring unto you, unto what cruell tortures you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e; for, <U+017F>o his pain may plea<U+017F>e you, he will endure with contentment, <U+017F>ince you do ordain it unto him. Now I knew him to be <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> al<U+017F>o, but not without abundance of wonder to us both, to <U+017F>ee at her foot him, whom <U+017F>he thought dead; and I, in lieu of a Gardiner to finde a Cavalier, who yielded unto none in all the Country. Perceiving <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>peak, I began to talk unto him, and <U+017F>aid: Is it <U+017F>o <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that you delight to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e and affright Ladies? this is not an Art, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <U+017F>uch a Cavalier as you profe<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, <U+017F>weet Nymph, <U+017F>aid he unto me, that it is not a becomming act of a Cavalier, but it is of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and I am no le<U+017F><U+017F>e. Love that in<U+017F>tructs all, has taught me to be a Gardiner. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this extream affection which you have cau<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>hould be<U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto you, as you mu<U+017F>t needs delight more in the death of him that owes it, then his life? Will not this heart I have brought, finde as good a reception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live as dead? But, if you will needs have me die, here's a Ponyard will do that, which no time can ever do, for it will put an end to all. The Nymph an<U+017F>wered nothing unto all this, but <U+017F>aid, Oh <hi>Leonida,</hi> have you betrayed me? Upon this, <U+017F>he went in to another Walk, where <U+017F>he did <U+017F>it down; for <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o much tran<U+017F>ported out of her <U+017F>elfe, as <U+017F>he knew not what <U+017F>he did. Then <hi>Lindamor</hi> did fall upon his knees again, and I went to her, and <U+017F>aid, Why Madam, do you <U+017F>ay, I betrayed you? how can you accu<U+017F>e me for this? I vow unto you, that I knew nothing of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e: but it is <hi>Flurial</hi> that hath deceived us both.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53526:77"/>
But, I thank God, we are all deceived the better way. Thanks be to God, here that heart of <hi>Lindamor</hi> which <hi>Flurial</hi> promi<U+017F>ed; he is here al<U+017F>o ready to do you any <U+017F>ervice: And have you not good rea<U+017F>on to be glad of this Trea<U+017F>on? It would be over tedious to relate all our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e at this time: out at the conclu<U+017F>ion, peace was made between all parties, and <U+017F>o, as this Love was tyed with a harder knot then ever it was before; but upon this condition, that he <U+017F>hould at this very houre depart unto the place, whither <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> had <U+017F>ent him. This departure went hard, yet obey he mu<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>o after a parting ki<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Galathea's</hi> fair hand, he went away, in full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance to finde her the <U+017F>ame he left her. But it would be impertinent to particularize every circum<U+017F>tance: <hi>Lindamor</hi> returned to his charge, did his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e and with the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> returned unto <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> where giving a good account of his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he was honoured and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<U+017F><U+017F>ed according to the merit of his vertue. But all this did not halfe <U+017F>o much revive his <U+017F>oul, as the favourable a<U+017F>pect which this Nymph did afford him, who ever <U+017F>ince his la<U+017F>t departure <U+017F>o increa<U+017F>ed in affection to him, as <hi>Lindamor</hi> might well <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he did equall him in Love: And this Court<U+017F>hip came to that height, as one night, when they were in the Garden together, he did often move her for leave, to ask the con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> unto their Marriage, being confident, that <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices as he had done, both unto her and her Son would invite her to grant him that favour. To which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered; You have more rea<U+017F>on to doubt their good-will than your own merit; and be le<U+017F><U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of your own de<U+017F>ervings, then my good will: But yet, I would not have you mention it unto them, till <hi>Clidaman</hi> be married I am younger than he and I may well <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, but <U+017F>o cannot the violence of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: But, if you will not grant me this remedy, yet grant me another, if your affection be <U+017F>uch as you <U+017F>ay unto me. If I can without prejudice to my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will. Then after he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand; Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, Promi<U+017F>e me, before <hi>Leonida</hi> and the gods, who are witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that you will be my Wife, as I do vow, by all that is <U+017F>acred, to be your Husband, and never look upon any other. <hi>Galathea</hi> was <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this, yet <U+017F>eeming as if it were by my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, though indeed it was by her own affection, <U+017F>he gave him that <U+017F>atisfaction, and <U+017F>wore unto him; upon condition, that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to avoid <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, <U+017F>hould never return into the Garden, untill their Marriage was declared. Now was <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> the mo<U+017F>t contented man that ever was, being full of hopes, and wanted nothing but the promi<U+017F>ed conclu<U+017F>ion of all his de<U+017F>ires. But Love, or rather Fortune, did mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly thwart him. Oh <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how vain are all thy purpo<U+017F>ed hopes? At that time <hi>Clidaman</hi> went with <hi>Guyemant,</hi> to try their fortunes in Armes, and went into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovea's</hi> Army but though he went away <U+017F>ecretly, yet was he quickly di<U+017F>covered. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> would not let him be there in that <U+017F>ort, <U+017F>he levied all the Forces <U+017F>he could, to <U+017F>end unto him, and committed the charge of them unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> con<U+017F>tituting <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Governour under her in all the Provinces, untill her Son's return; and this <U+017F>he did, as well to <U+017F>atisfie two <U+017F>uch eminent men, as to <U+017F>ever them; for <U+017F>ince <hi>Lindamor's</hi> return, they were alwaies jarring. <hi>Polemas</hi> was very well contented and <hi>Lindamor</hi> went not with an ill will: The one was glad he was to <U+017F>tay with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and the other hoped by his <U+017F>ervices <U+017F>o to oblige <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> as to facilitate the way unto that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which he a<U+017F>pired unto. But <hi>Polemas</hi> finding him<U+017F>elfe in disfavour of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall had robbed him of all, he put no confidence in any of his <U+017F>ervices or merits, but had recour<U+017F>e unto cunning and artifice: In order to this, he procured the mo<U+017F>t crafty fellow that ever was of that trade, whom he acquainted with every one about the Court, <U+017F>hewed him in <U+017F>ecret <hi>Amalis, Galathea, Silvia, Selires,</hi> my <U+017F>elfe, and all the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs; and did not only <U+017F>hew him their faces, but acquainted him with all the <U+017F>ecrets which he knew betwixt any of them: And after a full information of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, he de<U+017F>ired him to take upon him to <U+017F>eem a great Druide, and a mo<U+017F>t learned Conjurer: He <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elfe in the great wood of <hi>Savignew,</hi> neer the plea<U+017F>ant Gardens of Mount <hi>Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> and clo<U+017F>e by a little River which runs through the Wood: He <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>ome certain daies, giving him<U+017F>elfe out to be the greate<U+017F>t Diviner that ever was; in<U+017F>omuch as his fame reached unto us, and <hi>Galathea</hi> went unto him to know her fortune. This crafty Impo<U+017F>tor did know <U+017F>o well how to carry him<U+017F>elfe, and delude others, with <U+017F>o many circum<U+017F>tances and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, he deceived me as well as the re<U+017F>t. The main aime and conclu<U+017F>ion of all his craft was, to tell <hi>Galathea,</hi> that the influence of the heavens had given her choice of a great happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, or a great mi<U+017F>ery, and that it mu<U+017F>t be her own prudence that was to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h betwixt them; that both the<U+017F>e two extreams did depend upon Love; that if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53526:78"/>
<U+017F>he contemned his advice, <U+017F>he would be the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable woman in the world: And on the contrary, the mo<U+017F>t happy, if <U+017F>he followed his coun<U+017F>el. Then looking in her hand, and then her face, he <U+017F>aid unto her, Such a day when you are in <hi>Marcelles,</hi> you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee a man clothed in <U+017F>uch a colour; if you marry him, you will be the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable woman upon earth. Afterwards he <U+017F>hewed her in a gla<U+017F>s, a certain place upon the banks of the River <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her, See here is the place, go unto it <U+017F>uch an hour and then and there you <U+017F>hall find a man, whom if you marry, will make you infinitely happy.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Climanthes</hi> (for that was this Conjurers name) had <U+017F>ubtilly got knowledg of the day that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to depart, and the colour of his clothes he would wear; and his de<U+017F>ign was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> under a colour of going to Hunt, <U+017F>hould goe unto the place which he had <U+017F>hewed her in the gla<U+017F>s. Now hear, I be<U+017F>eech you, how things hapned. <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> was clothed as <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her, and <hi>Galathea</hi> remembring it, was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <U+017F>he could not give him one word by way of any an<U+017F>wer. Poor <hi>Lindamor</hi> thought it to bee his departure which made her <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad, and <U+017F>o ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her hand, hee went his wayes better contented than his fortune allowed him any rea<U+017F>on for.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, the day approaching on which <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould meet with the man that would make her all happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> <U+017F>hee would not fully acquaint me with her de<U+017F>ign, but only <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he would try whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the <hi>Druide</hi> were true. So <U+017F>hee took with her onely <hi>Silvia</hi> and me, her Nur<U+017F>e, and little <hi>Meril.</hi> The Nur<U+017F>e was <U+017F>he that mo<U+017F>t fortified her in opinion of the<U+017F>e predictions, as commonly all old women are very <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious in <U+017F>uch things<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> So as this Nymph ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving the day that <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her of, <U+017F>he prepared her <U+017F>elf the night before to goe unto that place, and in the morning dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf to the be<U+017F>t advantage <U+017F>he could, and al<U+017F>o commanded us to make our <U+017F>elves ready. Thus we went in a Chariot to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where being come at the very <U+017F>ame hour that <hi>Climanthes</hi> named, we found a Shepheard almo<U+017F>t drowned, whom the waves had ca<U+017F>t upon our <U+017F>ide. This Shepheard was one <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who accidentally was fallen into the River, and had doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e been drowned, if wee had not <U+017F>aved him: So <hi>Galathea</hi> apprehending him to bee the man that was to make her happy, began then to love him <U+017F>o, that <U+017F>hee would needs have us carry him in the Chariot unto the Palace, before he revived; for then the <U+017F>and and mud had <U+017F>o choaked him, that he looked as pale as death, and had no kind of motion or beauty in him. For my part, I cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed the Conjurer, and did fore<U+017F>ee we <U+017F>hould be put to abundance of trouble with him; for I <U+017F>wear unto you, I was never <U+017F>o put to it in all my life: But <U+017F>ince the Shepherd revived, &amp; his complexion came into his face<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he appeared to be a very hand<U+017F>om man, and of a wit above the capacity of a Shepheard. I never <U+017F>aw any in our Court more civiliz'd, nor more de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving love: So as no wonder <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately in love with him, as <U+017F>hee cannot be ab<U+017F>ent from him either night or day. But certainly <U+017F>he is much mi<U+017F>taken in him; for he is mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perately in love with a Shephearde<U+017F>s called <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> So as all the<U+017F>e things make not a little again<U+017F>t <hi>Lindamor:</hi> For the Nimph finding all true that this Impo<U+017F>tor told her, <U+017F>he is re<U+017F>olved rather to dye than to marry <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <U+017F>tudies all waies to win upon the affection of this Shepheard, who does nothing even in her very pre<U+017F>ence but <U+017F>igh for his ab<U+017F>ence from <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> I know not whether his impri<U+017F>onment be the cau<U+017F>e (for <U+017F>hee will not let him goe out of the Palace) or whether it be the abundance of water which hee <U+017F>wallowed when he was in the River; but <U+017F>o it is, he is fallen into a mo<U+017F>t violent Feaver: So as not knowing what to doe for his health, <hi>Galathea</hi> commanded mee to come in all ha<U+017F>te unto you, to the end you might <U+017F>ee him, and tell us what was be<U+017F>t for him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> <U+017F>tood very attentive unto this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and had <U+017F>everal conceits according to the <U+017F>ubject of his Neeces words; and perhaps, <U+017F>ome not far off the truth; for he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <U+017F>he was not altogether exempted either from love or blame. Yet he did very di<U+017F>creetly di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it, and told her he was very glad to <U+017F>erve either <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Celadon,</hi> who<U+017F>e Parents he ever loved; and who though he was a Shepheard, yet he was de<U+017F>cended from the be<U+017F>t of our Knights, who<U+017F>e Ance<U+017F>tors made choice of that kind of life as more tranquill and happy, than that of the Court, and therefore he honoured him, and would be glad to <U+017F>erve him. But yet this kind of living with him was neither <U+017F>afe nor honourable for either <hi>Galathea</hi> or her. And when hee came to the Palace and <U+017F>aw their deportments, then he would tel her how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould demean her <U+017F>elf. <hi>Leonida</hi> being a little a<U+017F>hamed, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that <U+017F>he did intend long <U+017F>ince to tell him of it, but truly <U+017F>he had neither the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence nor the conveniency to do it: Yet of a truth, <hi>Climanthes</hi> was the cau<U+017F>e of all this. Oh, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> could I but catch him, I <U+017F>hould with u<U+017F>ury pay him for fal<U+017F>ly u<U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53526:78"/>
the title of a <hi>Druide.</hi> That Sir, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, will be an ea<U+017F>ie matter by the means that I <U+017F>hall finde out: For he told <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come four or five times to the place where <U+017F>he was to meet with this man that would make her happy, in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did not meet with him the fir<U+017F>t day: And I know that <hi>Polemas</hi> and he coming too late the fir<U+017F>t day, will not fail to be there the dayes following: And who<U+017F>oever will catch this Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, mu<U+017F>t hide them<U+017F>elves in a place where I <U+017F>hall direct, and they will be <U+017F>ure to find him. As for the daies of his comming, I can bee informed from <hi>Galathea,</hi> though for my part I have forgotten them.</p>
               <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, the <hi>Druide</hi> and the Nymph beguiled the length of the way, and they were both <U+017F>o attentive, as they were at the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F>aures</hi> before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. But the <hi>Druide</hi> extreamly di<U+017F>liking this kind of life they led, did in<U+017F>truct <hi>Leonida</hi> what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> but what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hee did, not to let her know that hee di<U+017F>approved any of her actions: for, <U+017F>aid hee, <U+017F>uch courages and <U+017F>pirits as the Nymphs mu<U+017F>t be wonne upon by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and lenity, not by rigour and force. And you Neece, I pray con<U+017F>ider and remember your duty, and know that the<U+017F>e follies of love are di<U+017F>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable both for tho<U+017F>e that own them, and tho<U+017F>e that favour them. He had continued on his In<U+017F>tructions had they not met <hi>Silvia</hi> at their Palace gates, who conducted them unto <hi>Galathea:</hi> At that time <U+017F>he was walking in the Garden whil<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon</hi> repo<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf: As <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them, <U+017F>he went unto them; the <hi>Druide</hi> kneeled down, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand; <hi>Leonida</hi> did the <U+017F>ame. Afterwards the Nymph embraced them both and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adamas</hi> for his paines in comming to her, promi<U+017F>ing requital upon the fir<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion. Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, all my <U+017F>ervices are but ju<U+017F>t duties, and the very be<U+017F>t of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit half this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: I am <U+017F>orry onely that I want occa<U+017F>ions to make the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of my affection known unto you, and if I have not at any time been deficient, it was onely want of opportunities, not of any will to <U+017F>erve you. <hi>Adamas,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the Nimph, the <U+017F>ervice which you have done unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I take as done unto my <U+017F>elf: And what I have received from your Neece, I accept of as from you: And therefore, con<U+017F>idering all circum<U+017F>tances, I have had <U+017F>ufficient tryal of your goodne<U+017F>s. I do acknowledge your <U+017F>ervices pa<U+017F>t to be great, but this which I am now to imploy you in, is the greate<U+017F>t, and will be the mo<U+017F>t acceptable unto me, for no greater cure can be than of a wounded <U+017F>pirit. We wil talk more of it at lea<U+017F>ure; in the mean time goe and re<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf: <hi>Silvia</hi> will conduct you to your chamber, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Leonida</hi> does give me an accompt of what <U+017F>he hath done. Thus the <hi>Druide</hi> was di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and <hi>Galathea</hi> carra<U+017F><U+017F>ing <hi>Leonida</hi> more than u<U+017F>ual, asked her what <U+017F>he had done in her journey? Unto which <hi>Leonida</hi> gave her a <U+017F>atisfactory an<U+017F>wer: Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he I thank the gods that I have found you more joyful than I left you. Friend, <U+017F>aid the Nimph, <hi>Celadons</hi> recovery is the cau<U+017F>e: for you mu<U+017F>t know, that you were not gone a mile from hence before the Feaver left him, and ever <U+017F>ince he hath <U+017F>o mended, as he him<U+017F>elf hopes within two or three daies hee <U+017F>hall be able to ri<U+017F>e. This, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> is the be<U+017F>t news I could de<U+017F>ire, and had I known as much, I <U+017F>hould not have brought <hi>Adamas</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But to the purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> What does he <U+017F>ay to this accident? For I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf you have acquainted him with it. Pardon me, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I told him no more than what I thought could not be concealed from him when he came: He knows of the affection you beare unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> which I told him was onely an effect of your pitty. Hee knows the Shepheard very well, and all his family, and is confident he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade him unto what he plea<U+017F>eth: For my part, I think, that if you doe imploy him, hee will doe you good <U+017F>ervice, but then you mu<U+017F>t be ingenuous and <U+017F>peak freely and openly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Oh my God, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, do you think this po<U+017F><U+017F>ible? Certainly when hee under<U+017F>tands the whole <U+017F>tory he will never apprehend it unto my contentment; for his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and judgement is <U+017F>o great, as I doubt he will rather condemn, than further the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I do not <U+017F>peak without <U+017F>ome ground; you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee if you do imploy him, what <U+017F>ervice he will doe you. Thus the Nimph was the mo<U+017F>t contented per<U+017F>on in the world, fancying her <U+017F>elf already at the very top of all her de<U+017F>ires. But whil<U+017F>t they were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Adamas</hi> were talking of the <U+017F>ame bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: For this Nymph being at the fir<U+017F>t very familiar with him, did at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak openly unto him. <hi>Adamas</hi> much de<U+017F>iring to know whether all his Neece had related was true, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to relate unto him all <U+017F>he knew, which <hi>Silvia</hi> did without any di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and as briefly as <U+017F>he could, in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of</hi> Leonida.</head>
               <p>KNow, that for the better under<U+017F>tanding of what you de<U+017F>ire, I am forced to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the particulars of <hi>Leonida</hi>'s life, who<U+017F>e De<U+017F>tiny <U+017F>eems to twi<U+017F>t together all her de<U+017F>ignes with tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Galathea.</hi> What I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay concerning her, is not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ion or blame, nor with any intention to divulge her faults; for in telling them unto you, I think them to be as <U+017F>ecret as if they had never been told. You mu<U+017F>t know then, that the beauty and merits of <hi>Leonida,</hi> had long <U+017F>ince gotten the affection of <hi>Polemas;</hi> and the merits of that Cavalier being very high, your Neece gave his affection a kind reception, yet behaved her <U+017F>elf with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion, that it was long before <hi>Polemas</hi> knew it. I know that your <U+017F>elf have loved in your time, and knows better than I doe, how hard a thing it is to hide love. And <U+017F>o it was, that the vaile being taken away, both of them did know that both of them were lovers and both loved. However, they dur<U+017F>t not of a long time declare it. After the Fe<U+017F>tivall which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did Solemnize every yeare, as her day of Marriage with <hi>Pimander:</hi> So it was, that after dinner we all walked in the Garden at <hi>Mont-bri<U+017F>on,</hi> and <U+017F>he and I <U+017F>et our <U+017F>elves down under <U+017F>ome Trees to <U+017F>helter our <U+017F>elves from the heat of the Sun. No <U+017F>ooner were we <U+017F>et, but <hi>Polemas</hi> came to us, <U+017F>eeming as if but accidentally; though I ob<U+017F>erved, that he followed us by the eye, a good way di<U+017F>tant. And becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>at <U+017F>ilent a long while together, al<U+017F>o he having an excellent good voice, I told him he would much oblige us if he would <U+017F>ing. I <U+017F>hall do <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid he (pointing at <hi>Leonida)</hi> if this fair one wil be plea<U+017F>ed to command me. Commands, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, would <U+017F>hew indi<U+017F>cretion; but if you have any Song that is new, I <U+017F>hall think my entreaties very well be<U+017F>towed. I <U+017F>hall, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Polemas;</hi> and moreover, I will promi<U+017F>e you, that this which you <U+017F>hall hear, is <U+017F>o new, as it was made during the time of the Sacrifice this morning, whil<U+017F>t you were at your Prayers. How <U+017F>aid I unto him, is my companion the <U+017F>ubject of the <U+017F>ong? Yes certainly, an<U+017F>wered he, I am a witne<U+017F>s of it, and then he began thus.</p>

               <p>Wee were both very attentive unto his air, and perhaps I <U+017F>hould have heard more, had not <hi>Leonida</hi> feared le<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>hould out with <U+017F>omething which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>hould be kept <U+017F>ecret; and therefore as <U+017F>oon as ever he had done <U+017F>inging, <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>peak. I dare lay a wager, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I doe know her of whom this Song was made; then whi<U+017F>pering him in the ear, as if <U+017F>he would name her, <U+017F>he bade him take heed what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid before me. He very cunningly an<U+017F>wered aloud, No, no, you are mi<U+017F>taken, I <U+017F>wear it is not <U+017F>he whom you named. Then I perceived, that <U+017F>he did conceal her <U+017F>elf from me; and therefore <U+017F>eeming as if I would goe and gather <U+017F>ome flowers, I parted from them, but not <U+017F>o farre di<U+017F>tant but <U+017F>till I held an eye upon their actions. Now <U+017F>ince <hi>Polemas</hi> and <U+017F>he fell off, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ed all unto me, but when they were in league together, I could never make her tell mee any thing. But being then together, they fell to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he did fir<U+017F>t begin it. Come, come, <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, why doe you je<U+017F>t thus with your Friends? Tell mee truly, upon whom was tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es made? Fair Nymph, <U+017F>aid he, your own <U+017F>oul can tell you as well as I, for whom they were made. How <U+017F>hould I know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do you think I can divine things? Yes certainly, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Polemas,</hi> and I doe think you one of tho<U+017F>e who does not obey that god who <U+017F>peaks by your mouth, but rather will be obeyed by him. How do you explain this aenigma? (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) I do explain it thus, replyed he; The god of Love doth <U+017F>peak by your mouth, otherwi<U+017F>e your words could not be <U+017F>o full of Fire, as to kindle <U+017F>o many flames as they doe in the hearts of all tho<U+017F>e that hear them: And yet you do not obey that god when hee commands, That all tho<U+017F>e who love, <U+017F>hould be loved again; but you, all di<U+017F>obedience, doe make all tho<U+017F>e who love you, to think you infinitely fair, but not at all loving, no not <U+017F>o much as pittifull. I <U+017F>peak, Madam, for my own particular, and can <U+017F>afely <U+017F>wear, without the lea<U+017F>t danger of perjury, that never any beauty under the Sun
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53526:80"/>
was, and is more loved than you by me. When he uttered the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, he blu<U+017F>ht, and with a <U+017F>mile <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered thus; <hi>Polemas, Polemas,</hi> old Souldiers can <U+017F>hew their valour by wounds and never u<U+017F>e to brag of it, but you that talk <U+017F>o much of yours, would be put to your <U+017F>hifts to <U+017F>hew them, if Love your Captain General <U+017F>hould ask you where they are. Cruel Nymph, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> you are much mi<U+017F>taken; for I would onely bid him look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fair eyes of my enemy, and fully <U+017F>atisfie him; for then he would receive <U+017F>uch wounds as I have in my heart, and never complain of me. However, it is my glory to have <U+017F>uch a worthy author for my wounds. Should Love enter into argument with me, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>atisfie him than you; for he would be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of my pain, which you never can, becau<U+017F>e a fire cannot burn it <U+017F>elf. You can never be <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of our tears, who are <U+017F>o full of rigour, that though we do adore you as fair, yet we can hardly commend you as humane. <hi>Leonida</hi> did love <hi>Polemas,</hi> but as yet <U+017F>hee would not let him know it: On the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he feared, that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould put him quite out of hope <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould then quite lo<U+017F>e him; and therefore <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered him thus; <hi>Polemas,</hi> if your affection be <U+017F>uch as you <U+017F>ay, then time will give me better knowledge of it, than all your well <U+017F>poken words can, which are too eloquent to proceed from affection; for I have heard <U+017F>ay, that affection cannot be without pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion will not permit a <U+017F>pirit the freedome of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: But, when time has told me as much as you have done, you may think, I am not <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tone, but I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of your merits, and your amity may perhaps finde a favourable reception; untill then, never hope for any more from me, then what you may from all the re<U+017F>t of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in generall. <hi>Polemas</hi> would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand, by way of a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, but <U+017F>he forbad him, <U+017F>aying, Cavalier, be di<U+017F>creet, many eyes are upon us; if you u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch things, you will lo<U+017F>e me. Upon this <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up, and came to us, who were gathering flowers. Thus was the fir<U+017F>t overture of any affection between them, which gave occa<U+017F>ion unto <hi>Galathed,</hi> to intermeddle in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; for <U+017F>eeing this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in the Garden, and having a de<U+017F>igne upon <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>he would know that night what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida</hi> and him. And being ever very familiar with your Niece, <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not ab<U+017F>olutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth of this addre<U+017F><U+017F>e; but <hi>Galathea</hi> pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the matter further, and would needs know the very <U+017F>ame words which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between them; unto which your Niece did partly an<U+017F>wer truth, and partly di<U+017F><U+017F>emble; but <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid enough to exa<U+017F>perate <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>o much, as from that very day <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to get his love, and went to work with <U+017F>o many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. Fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he began with <hi>Leonida,</hi> and charged her, to let this love betwixt <hi>Polemas</hi> and <U+017F>he, go no further; then told her, that it was her be<U+017F>t policy to root it out for <U+017F>he knew, that <hi>Polemas</hi> had another aime, and made u<U+017F>e of her only to laugh at: Further, if <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hould come to know of it, <U+017F>he would be much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Leonida</hi> who then had no more <U+017F>ubdety in her than a little Child, received the words of the Nymph us from her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and never penetrated into the depth of her de<U+017F>igne, but was for <U+017F>ome daies <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> as he could not chu<U+017F>e but wonder what the matter was. This, at the beginning, made him more hot upon this addre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for young <U+017F>pirits to be mo<U+017F>t violent upon that which is mo<U+017F>t difficult unto them. And indeed, he did <U+017F>o continue his court<U+017F>hip that <hi>Leonida</hi> had much ado to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble the affection which <U+017F>he bore unto him, in<U+017F>omuch as <hi>Polemas</hi> perceived well enough that <U+017F>he loved him. But <U+017F>ee how love had ordained it: After three or foure months continuance, in his mo<U+017F>t violent pro<U+017F>ecution: of his court<U+017F>hip, and when he had attained to as much a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urance, as almo<U+017F>t he could de<U+017F>ire, his affection began to <U+017F>lack, and lo<U+017F>e its violence, and by degrees grew <U+017F>o faint and bold, as it was quite dead.</p>
               <p>The Nymph did not take any notice, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ingle in this affection; the truth is, <hi>Galathea</hi> was partly the cau<U+017F>e; for having a de<U+017F>ign upon <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>he did u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch artifice, and was <U+017F>o indulgent towards him as it may be <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>teal him: for when <hi>Leonida</hi> was <U+017F>hurp with him, <hi>Galathea</hi> was <U+017F>weet; when the one did flie his company, the other carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed him; and all this <U+017F>o long together, and <U+017F>o openly, that <hi>Polemas</hi> began to ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon <hi>Galathea,</hi> and a little after, his heart followed; for, he <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe favoured by the greater, and <U+017F>leighted by the inferiour, he began to embrace the <U+017F>miling fortune. But Oh! wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>ee how it plea<U+017F>eth Love to play with hearts. At this time, <hi>Agis,</hi> at the motion of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> became a Servant unto your Niece, not <U+017F>o much, as you know, by election, as by in<U+017F>tigation. At the fir<U+017F>t, this new Cavalier did apply him<U+017F>elfe in all becomming court<U+017F>hip unto his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he was <U+017F>till wholly devoted unto <hi>Polemas: Agis,</hi> who like a Mi<U+017F>er, that has <U+017F>till his eye upon his trea<U+017F>ure, did take notice of it, and complained unto his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, but her faint and hollow an<U+017F>wers, in lieu of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui<U+017F>hing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53526:80"/>
his jealou<U+017F>ie, did by little and little <U+017F>tifle his love: for, con<U+017F>idering what loo<U+017F>e hold he had of her <U+017F>oul, he re<U+017F>olved to let it go, and be gone him<U+017F>elfe. The be<U+017F>t receipt (as I have heard <U+017F>ay) for the cure of a Lover. For, as Love has its beginning from the eyes, <U+017F>o its decay mu<U+017F>t needs be, from not <U+017F>eeing them; which cannot be but in ab<U+017F>ence, where obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion <U+017F>wallowes up all memory of the party loved: And <U+017F>o it did in <hi>Agis,</hi> he was no <U+017F>ooner gone but all love vani<U+017F>h'd out of his <U+017F>oul, and entertained di<U+017F>dain in lieu of it, <U+017F>o as <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida,</hi> in <U+017F>triving to get <hi>Polemas,</hi> lo<U+017F>t him, who perhaps would have been entirely hers. But the rallerie of Love re<U+017F>ted not here, <hi>Polemas</hi> mu<U+017F>t have his <U+017F>hare as well as the re<U+017F>t; for ju<U+017F>t about this time, the affection of <hi>Lindamor</hi> began to break out; and, as <hi>Leonida</hi> had lo<U+017F>t <hi>Agis</hi> for <hi>Polemas,</hi> and <hi>polemas Leonida</hi> for <hi>Galathea;</hi> <U+017F>o <hi>Galathea</hi> ca<U+017F>t off <hi>Polemas</hi> for <hi>Lindamor.</hi> It is a task too hard to relate all their particular follies: but <U+017F>o it was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe paid in the <U+017F>ame coin that he payed your Niece, would not for all that, be out of either hope or love; but on the contrary, did u<U+017F>e all inventions to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate him<U+017F>elfe, but all to this very houre in vain; But yet, this <U+017F>atisfaction he found, that he, who was the cau<U+017F>e of his mi<U+017F>ery, did not enjoy that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e he aimed at: For, whether it was by rea<U+017F>on of his <U+017F>tratagems, or the will of the gods, I know not, but <hi>Lindamor</hi> is out of favour as well as he: And it <U+017F>eemes, Love could never finde any re<U+017F>t in the brea<U+017F>t of <hi>Galathea,</hi> the memory of one was no <U+017F>ooner out, but another was pre<U+017F>ently in; and now, at this very time, her thoughts are all upon a Shepheard, who<U+017F>e qualities as a Shepheard may indeed merit much, but never to be <hi>Galathea's</hi> Servant; and yet <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o extreamly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate and tender of him, that if his-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould continue, I know not what would become of her; for I never <U+017F>aw one <U+017F>o carefull, nor <U+017F>o troubled, as <U+017F>he hath been, ever <U+017F>ince he was ill. But this is not all, mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas;</hi> Your Niece is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o taken with <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I know not whether <hi>Galathea</hi> or <U+017F>he be more, and hereupon great jealou<U+017F>ie is grown betwixt them: and though I qualifie the matter as well as I can, yet <U+017F>o it is, that I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair of it for the future: And therefore I thank the gods that you are come; for really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; I know not how to carry my <U+017F>elfe betwixt them. Excu<U+017F>e me in <U+017F>peaking thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto you, <U+017F>ince it is upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e that concerns you; the affection I do bear unto you, con<U+017F>traines me to it.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Silvia</hi> end her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, with abundance of demon<U+017F>tration of her hatred, again<U+017F>t this kinde of life, for which <hi>Adamas</hi> did much e<U+017F>teem her. And to begin the cure of this Shepheard, and the<U+017F>e Nymphs (for the la<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e was the greater difficulty) <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> asked her advice. For my part, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I would fir<U+017F>t take away the cau<U+017F>e, which is this Shepheard, and the effects may of them<U+017F>elves follow; but this mu<U+017F>t be done with much artifice, el<U+017F>e <hi>Galathea</hi> will never let him go. 'Tis very true, an<U+017F>wered the Druide; but in the mean time, untill that can be hand<U+017F>omly contrived, care mu<U+017F>t be taken, that he do not fall in love with them; for there is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ympathy between Youth and Beauty, that if they <U+017F>hould conjoyne affections once, all <U+017F>eparations will be in vain. Oh <hi>Adamas!</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> did you but know <hi>Celadon</hi> as well as I do, this would be the lea<U+017F>t of all your fears; for he is <U+017F>o rooted in the love of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that all the beauty in the world except hers cannot <U+017F>hake him, e<U+017F>pecially now he is <U+017F>ick, for his care may well be more of his cure than any thing el<U+017F>e. Fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the Druide, you <U+017F>peak as one that is ignorant in Love, and never knew the force of it; this little god can do <U+017F>uch miracles, that when there is lea<U+017F>t appearance of any effects, even then will he <U+017F>hew his power: Be not therefore <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecure, for there is no kinde of vertue what<U+017F>oever, that is Armour-proof again<U+017F>t Love. Cha<U+017F>tity it <U+017F>elfe cannot do it, witne<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Endymion.</hi> Away, away, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia.</hi> Oh! wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> why do you terrifie me with <U+017F>o great a dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, I would have you arme your <U+017F>elfe again<U+017F>t the forces of this god, le<U+017F>t being too <U+017F>ecure in your opinion of that which you judge impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed before you be prepared. I have heard <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Celadon</hi> is <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet, and <U+017F>o every way accompli<U+017F>hed, as he is furni<U+017F>hed with all perfections which cau<U+017F>e Love, and therefore there is danger: Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons of Love are <U+017F>o hard to be di<U+017F>covered, that not one of a thou<U+017F>and can <U+017F>ee them. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> let me alone for that, and tell me only what I <U+017F>hould do in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, that we have already di<U+017F>covered. I do conceive, <U+017F>aid the Druide, this cure mu<U+017F>t be wrought very much by the eye; and when I have <U+017F>een how the world goes, we <U+017F>hall order things to the be<U+017F>t advantage we can, and in the mean time, let us keep our de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>ecret. Hereupon <hi>Silvia</hi> left <hi>Adamas</hi> to his re<U+017F>t, and went to <hi>Galathea,</hi> who with <hi>Leonide</hi> was by <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's</hi> bed <U+017F>ide; for they hearing he was awake, they could neither of them hold from him: He e<U+017F>teemed <hi>Leonida</hi> very much, her carra<U+017F><U+017F>es did oblige him to it; but <hi>Silvia's</hi> humour
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53526:81"/>
plea<U+017F>ed him much better. A litter after, they fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his wi<U+017F>dome, prudence, and goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e: Upon which, <hi>Celadon</hi> asked, whether it was not he who was <U+017F>on unto great <hi>Pelion,</hi> of whom <U+017F>o many wonders are reported? The very <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and he is come hither purpo<U+017F>ely to be your Phy<U+017F>ician. Oh Madam, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, he mu<U+017F>t have abundance of Art if he can cure my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: but, I am of opinion, that when he knowes it, he will <U+017F>o de<U+017F>pair of my recovery, as he will not undertake the cure. <hi>Galathea</hi> thought, that he had <U+017F>poke of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in his body: But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you <U+017F>hould finde your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o ill? I am confident, that if you would but help your <U+017F>elfe, you would be able to quit your bed in two or three daies. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> for <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o inwardly <U+017F>ick, as they them<U+017F>elves do not know of it, untill it be at the height. Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had la<U+017F>ted longer, had not the Druide come, to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>quares went; and he found him well enough di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed in body, for the Malady was pa<U+017F>t the height, and in its Decline; but when he talked with him, he found the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to be mo<U+017F>t in the minde, though he did not believe it was for any of the<U+017F>e Nymphs: Yet like a prudent Phy<U+017F>ician, he would feel how the pul<U+017F>e of his minde did beat: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to begin the cure, he would try how he <U+017F>tood affected fir<U+017F>t to <hi>Galathea;</hi> and in order to this, when all the Nymphs were retired he <U+017F>hut the dores, and began thus: I <U+017F>ee, <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, that your a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment is not little, to finde your <U+017F>elfe exalted <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly unto <U+017F>uch a height of fortune, as this you enjoy; for I am confident it was above your hopes, <U+017F>ince being born a Shepheard, and brought up in a Village, you are now carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed, and waited upon by Nymphs, and <U+017F>uch as are accu<U+017F>tomed to command; and more then that, <U+017F>uch as command the whole Country: You have great rea<U+017F>on to be thankfull unto the gods for it, and pray, that it may continue. <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>poke in this manner, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely as an invitation, to make him <U+017F>peak the truth of his affection, thinking by this means, &amp; <U+017F>eeming to approve of it, he would di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf. Unto which the Shepheard an<U+017F>wered with a deep <U+017F>igh; Father, <U+017F>aid he, if this be <U+017F>uch a high fortune, then certainly my mouth is out of ta<U+017F>t; for I did never in all my life reli<U+017F>h more bitter Wormwood than this, which you call good-fortune, and <U+017F>ince I came into this condition wherein you find me. Why, (<U+017F>aid the Druide, the better to di<U+017F>cover his <U+017F>ubtlety) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as not to <U+017F>ee the Grandure unto which you are advanced? Alas, alas, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> all this does but <U+017F>hew me a Precipice and menace me with the greater fall. Are you afraid, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> that this good fortune will not la<U+017F>t? I fear (<U+017F>aid the Shepheard) that it will la<U+017F>t longer than I would have it. Why <U+017F>hould Sheep langui<U+017F>h and die in a great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where Fi<U+017F>hes thrive and play? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the Druide, it is again<U+017F>t their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And do you think, Father, (<U+017F>aid the Shepheard) that it is not again<U+017F>t the nature of a Shepheard, to live among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many great Nymphs? I was born a Shepheard, and <U+017F>o habituated to a Village-life; as nothing but things of my own condition and quality can plea<U+017F>e me. But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid the Druide, that Ambition, which is <U+017F>o naturall unto men, cannot invite you to quit your woods? Cannot beautie allure a young heart unto it, and divert you from your fir<U+017F>t intentions? The ambition which every one ought to have, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, is, to do that well which is their duty to do, and in that, to be the prime among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e of their own rank; and that beauty which becomes us to look upon, and ought to attract us, is that which we may love, and not that which we ought to reverence, nor look upon, but with eyes of re<U+017F>pect only. Why do you imagine, <U+017F>aid the Druide, that there is any <U+017F>uch Grandure among<U+017F>t men, which merit and vertue may not arive at? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, I know, that all things ought to keep them<U+017F>elves within the limits and bounds that nature hath placed them: A Ruby, though never <U+017F>o excellent in its kinde, can never become a Diamond; and he that hopes to elevate him<U+017F>elf too high, or, to <U+017F>ay better, to change his nature, and to make him<U+017F>elfe more then he is, will but <U+017F>pend both his paines and his time in vain. The Druide now ama<U+017F>ed at the wi<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations of this Shepheard, and very glad to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o far from any thoughts of <hi>Galathea,</hi> began to deal with him in this manner: Son, <U+017F>aid he, I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad to find <U+017F>o much wi<U+017F>dome in you, and do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that as long as you continue in this minde, the heavens will <U+017F>houre all manner of felicities upon you. Many are <U+017F>o taken up with vanities, and tran<U+017F>ported with them, that they run out of their wits, and that upon much vainer hopes than the<U+017F>e I propound unto you: And what becomes of them at la<U+017F>t? ju<U+017F>t nothing, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e after long and intolerable paines, a <U+017F>ad repentance, for <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them<U+017F>elves to be <U+017F>o long deluded. You have rea<U+017F>on to thank the heavens, that have endued you with this knowledge, before you come to repentance; and you have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on

al<U+017F>o to pray, that they will pre<U+017F>erve you in the <U+017F>ame minde, in the <U+017F>ame tranquility, and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e of life, in which you have hitherto lived. But <U+017F>ince you do not a<U+017F>pire unto any Grandure nor Beauty, what is it then, <hi>Celadon,</hi> that will <U+017F>tay you here among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Nymphs? Alas, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, there is nothing can <U+017F>tay me by my good will; it's only <hi>Galathea</hi> that keeps me here in the nature of a Pri<U+017F>oner, and the truth is, I would have tryed all waies to make an e<U+017F>cape, had not my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e prevented me; and if no way would have hit, I <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>o unmannerly, as to have gone away by force When I would <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Galathea</hi> about it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemes <U+017F>o extreamly angry, as I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e; I dur<U+017F>t not mention it any more unto her: But, in the mean time, my <U+017F>tay here has been <U+017F>o tedious unto me, that I do accu<U+017F>e it to be the principall cau<U+017F>e of my malady. And therefore, Father, if ever you will compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate the mi<U+017F>erable condition of an extreamly afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, I do conjure you by the great gods, whom you do mo<U+017F>t reverence and adore, by your own good genius, by the memory of your worthy Father, great <hi>Pelion,</hi> that you will take <U+017F>ome pitty upon my life, and by your prudence, added unto my earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire, to help me out of this weari<U+017F>ome Pri<U+017F>on, for <U+017F>o I <U+017F>hall call it as long as I <U+017F>tay here. <hi>Adamas</hi> extreamly glad to hear how pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe, did embrace him, and after he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his cheek, <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Yes, dear Son, be confident I will do as you de<U+017F>ire; and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e will permit, I will u<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible means to facilitate your get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of this place; continue only in this minde, and recover as <U+017F>oon as you can. Then after much other <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, he left him, <U+017F>o much contented, that if <hi>Adamas</hi> would have <U+017F>uffered him, he would have quitted his bed that very houre.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Leonida,</hi> who would not <U+017F>uffer <hi>Galathea</hi> to run on any longer in that errour, which <hi>Climanthes</hi> had infu<U+017F>ed into her, one night, when <hi>Silvia</hi> and the little <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> were retired, <U+017F>he <U+017F>at down by her beds-<U+017F>ide, and after <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto her; Madam, I have met with <U+017F>ome newes in my journey, newes that concernes you, and I would not upon any termes conceal it from you, becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly undeceive you. What is it, <U+017F>aid the Nymph? It is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle piece of knavery that ever Love invented, and I believe, you will not be <U+017F>orry for my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, though it were for nothing el<U+017F>e, but the di<U+017F>covery of it. This Druide that re<U+017F>ided here, is the mo<U+017F>t wicked fellow, and the cunninge<U+017F>t knave, that ever deluded any one. Then did <U+017F>he relate all that <U+017F>he heard, from the mouth of <hi>Climanthes</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> and all the plot that was invented, only to di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ingratiate <hi>Polemas</hi> in his room. At the fir<U+017F>t, the Nymph was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed; afterwards, the love of this Shepheard did <U+017F>o flatter her, that <U+017F>he was per<U+017F>waded, <hi>Leonida</hi> <U+017F>poke this out of de<U+017F>igne, to divert her affection from this Shepheard, and to enjoy him her <U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he did not give any credit to what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid; but on the contrary, turning it into laughter, <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Go, go, <hi>Leonida,</hi> go to bed, and to morrow perhaps you will be more <U+017F>ubtle, and know how to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e your tricks better: Then <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled, and turned to the other <U+017F>ide. This did <U+017F>o extreamly offend <hi>Leonida,</hi> as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved, what<U+017F>oever came of it, to <U+017F>et <hi>Celadon</hi> at liberty: In order to this de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>he went the <U+017F>ame night unto her Uncle, unto whom <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon</hi> is now recovered, why <U+017F>hould he <U+017F>tay any longer here? I pray con<U+017F>ider what prejudice it may bring upon us all hereafter. I would gladly have undeceived <hi>Galathea,</hi> and divert her from the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of the impo<U+017F>tor <hi>Climantes;</hi> but <U+017F>he does <U+017F>o dote upon <hi>Celadon,</hi> as who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hall motion his departure, is her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemy: but I do conceive, the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t way is to get him gone, which we can never do without you; for her eye is <U+017F>o continually upon me, as I cannot <U+017F>tir a foot, but <U+017F>he takes notice of it, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pects me. <hi>Adamas</hi> did a little wonder to hear his Niece <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, and had an opinion, that <U+017F>he was afraid that he perceived the good-will <U+017F>he had unto this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and therefore <U+017F>he would blinde him: However, conceiving to cut up Love by the roots, the be<U+017F>t way would be, to get <hi>Celadon</hi> away; he told his Niece, that he did very much de<U+017F>ire the <U+017F>ame, but knew not how. The way, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is the ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t in the world: Get the habit of a Nymph, put it upon him, he is young, and has not a beard; this way he may get out, unknowne who helped him, nor can <hi>Galathea</hi> tell whom to blame. <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> found this invention to be good, and the <U+017F>ooner to put it in execution, would pre<U+017F>ently go and get this habit made, under colour of going to fetch <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>ick for <hi>Celadon,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Galathea</hi> to under<U+017F>tand, that though he was out of a Feavour, yet he was not out of danger to relaps, which he could ea<U+017F>ily prevent; and did communicate the de<U+017F>igne unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> who did very well approve of it, <U+017F>o he would not <U+017F>tay too long before his return. <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner awake, but <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went into his Chamber, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53526:82"/>
of <U+017F>eeing how he did. <hi>Adamas</hi> perceiving how a<U+017F><U+017F>iduou<U+017F>ly indulgent the<U+017F>e Nymphs were, did think delay to be very dangerous; and after <U+017F>ome ordinary que<U+017F>tions concerning his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, he turned towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> and de<U+017F>ired her to give him leave to enquire of <U+017F>ome particulars, which he dur<U+017F>t not do before her. <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it to be <U+017F>omething that related to his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, withdrew, and gave <hi>Adamas</hi> an opportunity to acquaint the Shepheard with his de<U+017F>igne, and promi<U+017F>ed him to return within two or three daies at the furthe<U+017F>t. <hi>Celadon</hi> conjured him unto it, by all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible intreaties, knowing, that without him his impri<U+017F>onment would la<U+017F>t long. After he had a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him that he would, he took <hi>Galathea</hi> a<U+017F>ide and told her, that though the Shepheard was at that pre<U+017F>ent very well, yet there was great fears of a relaps, and therefore it was requi<U+017F>ite to prevent it in order to which, he would go and provide <U+017F>uch Medicines as were proper for it, and return again. The Nymph was very glad of this; for, on the one <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired the Shepheards cure; and on the other, the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Adamas</hi> began to be very trouble<U+017F>ome unto her, fore<U+017F>eeing, that <U+017F>he could not be <U+017F>o free with her friend <hi>Celadon</hi> in his pre<U+017F>ence. <hi>Adamas</hi> knew her minde well enough; however, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as dinner was done, he went his way, leaving the Nymphs in perplexity enough; for all three had different de<U+017F>ignes, and each of them aiming at their <U+017F>everall ends, of nece<U+017F><U+017F>itie they mu<U+017F>t deceive one another: And this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, that they were commonly all three about his bed together, but e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Silvia,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely to keep them from talking with him in private; but for all her vigilancy, <hi>Leonida</hi> found a time to tell him the re<U+017F>olution of her and her Uncle, and had this further talk with him: I hope, <hi>Celadon,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) that when you are at liberty, you will not be <U+017F>o ungratefull, as to forget this good office, but will then con<U+017F>ider of it, and of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which now I do bear unto you; at lea<U+017F>t, you will remember the injuries I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Galathea</hi> for your <U+017F>ake: And if Love which in any other would produce a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall love again, have not the <U+017F>ame effects in you; yet I <U+017F>hall be extreamly glad to hear from your mouth, that I am not di<U+017F>agreeable unto you. <hi>Celadon,</hi> who already knew of this growing affection, had a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>tifle it in the cradle; but fearing, le<U+017F>t if he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould fall off from that cour<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he had re<U+017F>olved upon with her Uncle, he would give her <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer, as <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till keep her in the <U+017F>ame minde; and therefore <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> what a <U+017F>trange opinion would you have of me, if forgetting <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom I have <U+017F>o long <U+017F>erved<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I <U+017F>hould begin a new affection unto you?

Oh <hi>Celadon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> you need not hide it from me, for I know as much of your affairs as you your <U+017F>elfe does. Then, Fair Nymph an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>ince you do know it <U+017F>o well, how can you think I <U+017F>hould force my love from her, that has the <U+017F>ole power of my <U+017F>oul, my life, my <U+017F>elfe, and all I have? I pray, look upon all the actions of my life, and then tell me how I <U+017F>hould give you <U+017F>atisfaction, and what I <U+017F>hould do. <hi>Leonida</hi> could not hide her fears at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; yet, being wi<U+017F>e, and con<U+017F>idering how again<U+017F>t her duty it was to live in this manner, al<U+017F>o that all would be in vain, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to become a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of her own will; but this being a work of greater difficulty, than to be done as <U+017F>oon as thought upon, <U+017F>he thought it be<U+017F>t to take a little time, and con<U+017F>ult with her pillow upon it: In this re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke thus unto the Shepheard; <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I cannot now take that coun<U+017F>el with my <U+017F>elf which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, I had need to have a little time to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter up all the powers of my <U+017F>oul before I can re<U+017F>olve. Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued longer, had not <hi>Silvia</hi> interrupted, and <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> Doe you not know Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that <hi>Flurial</hi> is come? and hath <U+017F>o e<U+017F>caped the guards of the gates, and came to <hi>Galathea</hi> before any of us knew of it? Hee gave her <U+017F>ome Letters: I know not from whence they came, nor from whom, but I am <U+017F>ure they made her change colour two or three times. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> pre<U+017F>ently imagined that it was from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and therefore <U+017F>he left <hi>Silvia</hi> with <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> and went to <hi>Galathea</hi> to be <U+017F>atisfied. <hi>Silvia</hi> then <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elfe alone with him, <U+017F>hee began to talke <U+017F>o kindly unto him, that if any there could have made him in love, doubtle<U+017F>s it had been <U+017F>he. And <U+017F>ee how Love is plea<U+017F>ed to thwart our de<U+017F>ignes: The other two Nymphs who courted him with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible artifice to make him in love, could not do it; and this who never aimed at it, did come nearer the mark than either of the re<U+017F>t: By which is to be ob<U+017F>erved, That Love mu<U+017F>t bee free, and will not be obliged by any, but it <U+017F>elf and whom it plea<U+017F>eth.</p>

with your company; and I <U+017F>wear, that if <hi>Galathea</hi> be of my mind, we will have more of it than formerly we have; for I finde by you there is abundance of delight to bee taken in your villages, and in your hone<U+017F>t freedom, <U+017F>ince you are exempted from all ambition, and by con<U+017F>quence from envy; and doe live without any artifice and <U+017F>lander, which are the four Pe<U+017F>ts of our Court-life. Wi<U+017F>e Nymph, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, all this is mo<U+017F>t true, if we were out of the power of Love; but you mu<U+017F>t know, that the very <U+017F>ame effects which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition produceth in Courts, Love does produce in the Country; the envy of a Rival is no le<U+017F>s than a Courtiers; and the Artifices of Lovers and Shepheards are nothing inferiour unto my others; and <U+017F>o detraction and cen<U+017F>uring of others is as ri<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t us as you. The truth is, we have this advantage of you; for in lieu of two enemies which you have, which are Love and Ambition, we have but one of them. And from hence it is that there are <U+017F>ome particular men among<U+017F>t us which may be called happy; and none, I believe among<U+017F>t you Courtiers: For, <U+017F>uch as doe e<U+017F>cape being in Love, doe not e<U+017F>cape the allurements of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and <U+017F>uch as doe e<U+017F>cape Ambition, have not <U+017F>uch frozen <U+017F>ouls, as can re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the flames of <U+017F>o many Fair eyes; whereas wee that have but one enemy, may the more ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, as <hi>Silvander</hi> hath hitherto done; a Shepheard truly full of excellent perfections, but more happy than wi<U+017F>e; for he having yet never met with any beauty that plea<U+017F>ed, or could attract him, he never holds familiarity with any Shephearde<U+017F>s, which is the rea<U+017F>on that he pre<U+017F>erves his liberty; for my part I beleeve, that unle<U+017F>s one do love <U+017F>ome where el<U+017F>e, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be long with an amiable beauty, and not love her. <hi>Silvander</hi> an<U+017F>wered, I am <U+017F>o little ver<U+017F>ed in this <U+017F>cience, that I <U+017F>ubmit unto what you <U+017F>ay; yet I doe believe it is <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el<U+017F>e than beauty which cau<U+017F>eth Love, otherwi<U+017F>e one Lady that is loved of one man <U+017F>hould be loved of all. There are (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon)</hi> <U+017F>everall an<U+017F>wers to this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition. All beauties are not looked upon with one and the <U+017F>ame eye: Colours, <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>e one eye, <U+017F>ome another none all: So of Beauties, all eyes do not judge alike; but <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> rea<U+017F>on me-thinks is above all. If any ask him why hee never was in Love, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer, that he has not yet found his Load<U+017F>tone; and when he has found it, then he <U+017F>hall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly love as others do. What does he mean, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> by his Load<U+017F>tone? I know not, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> whether I can well inform you; but hee is a man very well <U+017F>tudyed, and held among<U+017F>t us for a good Scholar: Hee <U+017F>ayes, that when great <hi>Jupiter</hi> fir<U+017F>t formed man, and all <U+017F>ouls he touched every one with a <U+017F>everal peece of a Load<U+017F>tone, and afterwards put all the peeces in a place by them<U+017F>elves: Likewi<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ouls of women, after he had touched them, he put them in a Magazine by them<U+017F>elves: Afterwards when he <U+017F>ent the <U+017F>ouls into bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he brought tho<U+017F>e of the women to the place where the Load<U+017F>tones were, which touched the <U+017F>oules of the men, and likewi<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ouls of the men into the place where the load<U+017F>tones were which touched the women, and made every one to take one peece: If there were any theevi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ouls, they took <U+017F>everal pieces and hid them. Now when that man meets with that woman that has that piece which touched his <U+017F>oul, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but hee mu<U+017F>t love her; the Load<U+017F>tone <U+017F>hee hath, doth attract his <U+017F>oul: And from hence proceeds the <U+017F>everall effects of Love: For tho<U+017F>e who are loved of many, are tho<U+017F>e theevi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ouls who took many peeces of the Load<U+017F>tone: If any doe love one who loves not him again, that was one who took her Load<U+017F>tone, but <U+017F>he not his. Many que<U+017F>tions upon this were put unto him, unto which hee an<U+017F>wered very well: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t I put this, How comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid I) that one Shepheard loves many Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es? Thus, an<U+017F>wered he, the peece of Load<U+017F>tone which touched him being among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> did mingle them all together, it broke; and being in <U+017F>everal peeces, all tho<U+017F>e who have them, doe attract his <U+017F>oul; but perhaps tho<U+017F>e who are taken with <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal Loves, will never love much, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e little bits cannot have <U+017F>o much force as if it were a whole one. Moreover, <U+017F>aid he, from hence it comes to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that we do often <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons love others, who in our eyes are nothing amiable. Al<U+017F>o from hence proceeds tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>trange loves which <U+017F>ometimes fall out; As that a <hi>Gaule</hi> brought up among<U+017F>t many beauties, <U+017F>hould fall in love with a barbarous <U+017F>tranger. <hi>Diana</hi> asked him, what he could <U+017F>ay for <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who never loved any, nor any loved him? His Load<U+017F>tone (an<U+017F>wered he) is either <U+017F>till in <hi>Jupiters</hi> Magazine, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he who took it, dyed in her cradle: So as when we doe <U+017F>ee any one who does not love, wee u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, his Load<U+017F>tone was forgotten. But, <U+017F>ayd <hi>Silvia,</hi> what could hee <U+017F>ay unto this, that none did love <hi>Timon?</hi> That <U+017F>ometimes (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon) Jupiter</hi> did count the pieces that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and finding the number come <U+017F>hort, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome theevi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ouls had taken more than they <U+017F>hould, he <U+017F>ent tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouls into their bodies without <U+017F>tones; and hence it comes to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that many Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who are accompli<U+017F>hed with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

qualities, yet are disfavoured, and none loves them. But <hi>Corilas</hi> put this que<U+017F>tion to him; One loves another a long time, How comes hee to quit her, and love another? <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> an<U+017F>wered unto this, That his Load<U+017F>tone, who changed, had been broken; and hers, whom hee loved la<U+017F>t, was a greater peece than the other; as wee <U+017F>ee a peece of Steel between two Load<U+017F>tones, will goe to that which hath the greater force, and <U+017F>o the <U+017F>oul will goe to that party who hath the mo<U+017F>t attractive power. Truly <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> this mu<U+017F>t needs bee an admirable Shepheard, that is full of <U+017F>uch fine conceptions; But, I be<U+017F>eech you, tell me, Who is he? I <U+017F>hall hardly tell you that, Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> for he cannot tell him<U+017F>elf; yet by the judgement we can make of him by his good qualities, he is from <U+017F>omegood place; for you mu<U+017F>t know that he came into our village not long <U+017F>ince with a very <U+017F>hort pittance of e<U+017F>tate, and without any acquaintance onely this hee <U+017F>aid, that hee came from about the Lake <hi>Lemane,</hi> where he had been brought up of a child, Since he has got acquaintance, every one is ready to help him: Be<U+017F>ides, being an excellent Herbali<U+017F>t, and having great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the nature of Animals, his Flock <U+017F>o increa<U+017F>es under his hands, and he thrives <U+017F>o well, as at this hour he may be called Rich, at lea<U+017F>t in content. And, fair Nymph, it is no great difficulty to attain unto <U+017F>o much wealth; for Nature is contented with a little, and we who live according to her Rules are Rich, if contented; and our contentment being ea<U+017F>ily obtained, our Riches are quickly gotten. You are, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> much richer in happine<U+017F>s than we are. But you <U+017F>poke of <hi>Diana;</hi> I know her onely by <U+017F>ight; Pray tell me, who was her Mother? The Mother was <hi>Belinda,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, Wife unto the <U+017F>age <hi>Celion,</hi> who dyed young. And <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> who is <U+017F>he, and what humour is <U+017F>he of? She is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> one of the faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and let mee but except <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi> and I will <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he is the faire<U+017F>t: for, be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e that are obvious unto the eye, <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o many beauties of mind, as no more can be <U+017F>aid or de<U+017F>ired than is in her. Oftentimes we have been three or four of us Shepheards together, looking and admiring her, and alwayes concluded, that there was no perfection which could be wi<U+017F>hed, but was to be found in her. And though her genius be not very inclinable to love, yet <U+017F>he is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>incere lover of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as <U+017F>hee does oblige more that way, than others doe by their mo<U+017F>t violent affections How comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> Has <U+017F>he not many <U+017F>ervants? No, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon;</hi> <U+017F>he will not entertain any: The deceit which the Father of <hi>Philidas</hi> did put upon her, does hinder her. And truly it was the mo<U+017F>t notorious trick that ever I heard of. Were it not too much trouble to you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> I <U+017F>hould bee very glad to under<U+017F>tand it from you, and al<U+017F>o to know who <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinda</hi> were. I feare, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> that the <U+017F>tory will bee <U+017F>o long as to weary you. No, no <U+017F>aid the Nymph, we cannot better employ the time, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Galathea</hi> is reading her Letters. Then, in obedience to your command, an<U+017F>wered hee, I <U+017F>hall do it as briefly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I can: And thus he began.</p>

               <p>IT is mo<U+017F>t certain, fair Nymph, that Virtue, be it never <U+017F>o naked, is yet mo<U+017F>t lovely in it <U+017F>elf; and has <U+017F>o many attracting Adamants in it, that as <U+017F>oon as any <U+017F>oul is touched with it, it mu<U+017F>t needs love and follow it.

To which <hi>Celion</hi> pre<U+017F>ently an<U+017F>wered: I do ki<U+017F><U+017F>e this fair hand by way of thanks, for <U+017F>o great a favour, and by way of promi<U+017F>e of that faithfull <U+017F>ervice which <hi>Celion</hi> vowes unto you, as long as he lives. <hi>Belinde</hi> perceived by the zealous utterance of his words, and the ki<U+017F><U+017F>e which he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately imprinted upon her hand, that he meant of another kinde of affection then <U+017F>he intended and therefore would not let him go on in his errour: <hi>Celion</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) you are very far off that which you do fancy to your <U+017F>elfe you can finde out no readier way to bani<U+017F>h me your company than this; if you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire I <U+017F>hould continue the <U+017F>ame affection to you, which I promi<U+017F>ed, continue you al<U+017F>o with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <U+017F>ame compa<U+017F><U+017F>e, which your vertue did ever promi<U+017F>e me; otherwi<U+017F>e I will break off all manner of familiarity with you, and protest never to love you: I could (as the cu<U+017F>tome of tho<U+017F>e that are loved is) chide and brawl with you, but I will not, becau<U+017F>e I would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have you know that if you behave your<U+017F>elfe otherwi<U+017F>e than becomes you, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any hopes in my affection. She added many other bitter expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which did <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h <hi>Celion,</hi> that he knew not what to an<U+017F>wer; only he ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe upon his knees at her feet, and without any capitulation, but <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, asked pardon, and prote<U+017F>ted, that his affection <U+017F>hould proceed no further; but, as <U+017F>he did cau<U+017F>e it, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould regulate it. If you do behave your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Belinde,</hi> you will oblige me to love you, otherwi<U+017F>e, the contrary Fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, replyed he, my affection is now born, and <U+017F>uch as it is it mu<U+017F>t live; for it cannot die but with me, <U+017F>o as I cannot remedy it, but with time but I will promi<U+017F>e to give it <U+017F>uch a check, as you <U+017F>hall command; and let me never be ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed with any favour from you, if you finde any action of my life that can di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <U+017F>he permitted him to love her upon the<U+017F>e termes. And thus the<U+017F>e two Lovers lived long in <U+017F>uch contentment, as they had good cau<U+017F>e to thank their Fates for it: Sometimes he would <U+017F>end Letters unto her, by his Brother <hi>Diamis</hi> who pre<U+017F>ented them unto her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour of pre<U+017F>enting her with <U+017F>ome fruit.

Till now, this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e never had the lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment of any love, no, nor <U+017F>o much as any minde of being loved; but, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw this Letter, whether out of envie to her companion, whom <U+017F>he thought no <U+017F>uperiour in beauty; or becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was of that age which is mo<U+017F>t apt to take fire; or whether this Letter contained <U+017F>uch hot and <U+017F>ervent expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as would thaugh a piece of Ice: <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>well with de<U+017F>ire, not only to love, but to be loved again, by this Shepheard: And then <U+017F>he read over the Letter again <U+017F>everall times, which was thus penned.</p>

And though our Sex has not an ab<U+017F>olute authority over Love, yet thanks be to the gods <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in this condition, I have, and wil give you a cleer te<U+017F>timony of my being your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend.

I think, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he) that he is yours, if you will be plea<U+017F>ed to do me the honour to accept of him; but it is no wonder he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o obedient unto you, for he knowes, that if he had not, I <U+017F>hould have di<U+017F>owned him for mine, having heard me often <U+017F>ay and <U+017F>ing, that, All I had was more yours than mine. 'Tis very well, <U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I will try whether I have <U+017F>o much power over you, as you <U+017F>eem to give me; and will not only command, but earne<U+017F>tly entreat a thing from you. There is nothing, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, which you may not more ab<U+017F>olutely command. Then <hi>Belinde,</hi> <U+017F>eeing this fit opportunity, began to open her minde thus: Since that day we fir<U+017F>t began our friend<U+017F>hip, <hi>Celion,</hi> I have ever thought my <U+017F>elfe obliged to love and honour you, more than any per<U+017F>on living and I would not have you think I do intend to le<U+017F><U+017F>en this love, for it <U+017F>hall accompany me to my grave; and yet perhaps you would make it dimini<U+017F>h, did I not adverti<U+017F>e you before hand, that my life and my friend<U+017F>hip <U+017F>hall le<U+017F><U+017F>en together. The<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions made <hi>Celion</hi> admire, not knowing what <U+017F>he intended: At la<U+017F>t he told her, that he waited to know her plea<U+017F>ure in much joy and much fear: Joy, becau<U+017F>e he could think upon no greater honour then her commands; and Fear, becau<U+017F>e he knew not what <U+017F>he meant yet, death it <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould be welcome, if it came by her command. Then <hi>Belinde</hi> went on thus: You have ever, as well as now, given me <U+017F>uch full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I cannot doubt of it; and therefore I <U+017F>hall not only intreat, but conjure <hi>Celion,</hi> by all the amity he bears unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> that he will obey her in this one thing: I will not impo<U+017F>e any impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities upon him, nor to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the love which he bears unto me, but on the contrary, would have him rather to augment it. But before I go any further, I pray you let me know, whether your affection was ever of any other quality then it is at this time. Then <hi>Celion,</hi> looking more cheerfully than before, an<U+017F>wered, That heretofore he did love her with <U+017F>uch affection and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and with the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ignes, that youth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth to produce in hearts, mo<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>ported with Love, and in this, he would not except one that did exceed him; but <U+017F>ince, that her commands had <U+017F>uch power over him, as he hath moderated his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and his friend<U+017F>hip has <U+017F>o <U+017F>urmounted his love, as he hath had no thoughts of her, but <U+017F>uch as would not offend a Si<U+017F>ter. I prote<U+017F>t, Brother, replyed <U+017F>he, for <U+017F>o I will hold you to be as long as I live; you could never have obliged me more than by this. Know then what it is I do de<U+017F>ire from you, only this, that pre<U+017F>erving <U+017F>till inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this affection which you do now bear unto me, you will place your love upon one of the faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es about <hi>Lignon</hi> Perhaps you will think this a <U+017F>trange office from <hi>Belinde,</hi> but your wonder will vani<U+017F>h, when I tell you, that <U+017F>he is one whom I do mo<U+017F>t love; for it is <hi>Amaranthe:</hi> Her, I do command you to love, by all the power that I have over you, for <U+017F>he has earne<U+017F>tly begg'd it of me. She was thus ha<U+017F>ty in her command, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he feared, that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have retarded it any longer, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not have had power to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t his <U+017F>upplications, which <U+017F>he fore<U+017F>aw he would make. What do you think, fair Nymph (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon</hi> to <hi>Silvia)</hi> became of poor <hi>Celion?</hi> he looked as pale as death it <U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>o much out of him<U+017F>elfe, as he could not <U+017F>peak one <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>yllable: But at la<U+017F>t, when he had a little recovered the u<U+017F>e of his langui<U+017F>hing tongue, and in a Tone, like one in the mid<U+017F>t of Torment, he cryed out: Oh cruell Nymph! have you pre<U+017F>erved my life hitherto, thus inhumanely to ravi<U+017F>h it away? This command is too ful of cruelty, to be heard &amp; live; and my love is too great, to let me die without de<U+017F>pair. Alas, if I mu<U+017F>t die, let me die faithfull; and if there be no other way to cure <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> but by my death, I will mo<U+017F>t freely <U+017F>acrifice my <U+017F>elfe unto her health, <U+017F>o you will but change the doom of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and bid me die loving only you. <hi>Belinde</hi> was much <U+017F>tartled at this, but not altered:
<hi>Celion,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, leave off all the<U+017F>e vain expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, you will give me cau<U+017F>e el<U+017F>e not to believe what you told me, if you do not <U+017F>atisfie me in the fir<U+017F>t command that I do impo<U+017F>e upon you. Cruell Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ad <hi>Celion)</hi> mu<U+017F>t you needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities? for though I dare not love you beyond your commanded limits; yet, command what you will, I cannot love any other.</p>
               <p>Pitty did begin a little to melt her heart, and it was abundance of content unto her, to <U+017F>ee, that he whom <U+017F>he loved mo<U+017F>t, did mo<U+017F>t certainly love her: And this perhaps had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her re<U+017F>olution, had <U+017F>he not been re<U+017F>olutely fixed to take away all thoughts from <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>tung with the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; therefore <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained all her pitty to retreat, which began already to draw tears into her eyes; and to the end they

<U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>een, <U+017F>he went away, and at parting <U+017F>aid unto him; Think well upon it, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and be certain, I will never <U+017F>ee you again, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will effect my entreaty, and your own promi<U+017F>e.

               <p>It was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <hi>Bolinda</hi> <U+017F>hould not re<U+017F>ent the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which <U+017F>he knew pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a mo<U+017F>t perfect affection; withall, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any thing could divert her from her de<U+017F>igne She did adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> that <hi>Celion</hi> would love her, and that <U+017F>he would know it as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was recovered: Which adverti<U+017F>ment did <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ten her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as <U+017F>he did make it appear, that to the cure of the body, the cure of the minde is not unprofitable. But Oh! what a lamentable con<U+017F>traint did <hi>Celion</hi> live in, and how intolerable was his torment? He grew <U+017F>o lean, and was <U+017F>o altered, as he was not knowable. But <U+017F>ee the extream <U+017F>everity of this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he was not contented with what <U+017F>he had done; but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought <hi>Amaranthe</hi> had <U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>ie of their affection, <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to drive the Naile <U+017F>o to the head, that neither of them <U+017F>hould think, <U+017F>he jea<U+017F>ted The Shepheards addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <hi>Amaranthe</hi> was ob<U+017F>erved by every one, for it was openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Father al<U+017F>o of this Shepheard being acquainted with the commendable vertues of <hi>Leon,</hi> and knowing his family to be honourable, he did not di<U+017F>approve of this Match. <hi>Belinde</hi> her <U+017F>elfe did propound the Marriage, and it was almo<U+017F>t made up before <hi>Celion</hi> knew of it but when he heard of it, he could not forbear <U+017F>peaking unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> and was <U+017F>o plain with her, that <U+017F>he was halfe a<U+017F>hamed: but the Shepheard <U+017F>eeing words would not do, he re<U+017F>olved upon another cour<U+017F>e, and a better way, which was, to apply him<U+017F>elfe unto his Father: Sir, <U+017F>aid he, I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry to di<U+017F>obey you in anything, and more in this than any other thing. I <U+017F>ee, Sir, that you do like of this alliance with <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> and as becomes me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I have made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her, and I do know no Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e more affectionate than <U+017F>he: But, Sin, give me leave to tell you, that I do love her better for a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e than a Wife; yet I do humbly be<U+017F>eech you, command me not to tell you my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. Upon this, the Father had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, that he knew of <U+017F>ome ill quality in the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and did heartily commend the prudence of his Son, who he thought had <U+017F>uch a command over his own affections. Thus this Match was broken off, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages being publickly known, many did ask the que<U+017F>tion, from whence this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould proceed: The Father, he could not hold from <U+017F>peaking of it unto his familiar friends, and they unto others, <U+017F>o as <hi>Amaranthe</hi> at the la<U+017F>t came to hear of it, who at the fir<U+017F>t was much grieved; but afterwards <U+017F>eeing her own folly, in thinking to make her <U+017F>elfe loved by force, <U+017F>he did by degrees fall off, re<U+017F>olving to entertain the next
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53526:86"/>
motion of marriage that was offered. Thus were the<U+017F>e Lovers ea<U+017F>ed of an intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but it was to be loadned with one much more heavie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belinde</hi> was now at an age full fit for Marriage, and <hi>Philemon</hi> very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee her well be<U+017F>towed; he would have been very glad to entertain <hi>Celion;</hi> but <hi>Belinde,</hi> hating marriage as much as death, had charged him not to <U+017F>peak unto her; yet promi<U+017F>ing him, that when<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>elfe forced to marry, <U+017F>he would acquaint him, to the end, that then he might put in for a <U+017F>hare of her, and demand her in Marriage: And this was the rea<U+017F>on, that <hi>Philemon</hi> perceiving the coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celion,</hi> he would not offer her unto him. In the mean time, <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> the prime Shepheard of all the Country, and one who was generally e<U+017F>teemed for his many vertues, did make an overture of Marriage with her; and becau<U+017F>e he would not have the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e talked of, untill he was <U+017F>ure of <U+017F>peeding, he, who did treat about the matter, did carry it <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely, that a promi<U+017F>e was made of the Marriage as <U+017F>oon as asked; for <hi>Philemon</hi> making him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ure of his Daughters obedience, did fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>e his word, and then acquainted her. At the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>olve what to do becau<U+017F>e he was a man whom <U+017F>he had never <U+017F>een: However, this lofty <U+017F>pirit, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would <U+017F>ink under the burthen of any mi<U+017F>ery, did pre<U+017F>ently rou<U+017F>e up it <U+017F>elfe, and did not <U+017F>eem the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>contented at it for her own <U+017F>ake, which was more than <U+017F>he could do for <hi>Celion;</hi> and now her error of ob<U+017F>tinate hatred again<U+017F>t marriage, mu<U+017F>t be wa<U+017F>hed away with tears. So it was, that to be as good as her promi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he acquainted poor <hi>Celion,</hi> that <hi>Philemon</hi> intended to marry her. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Celion</hi> had this <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he did <U+017F>o <U+017F>olicite his Father, that the very <U+017F>ame day he made the motion unto <hi>Philemon;</hi> but it was too late, for which <hi>Belinde's</hi> Father was very <U+017F>orry for he loved <hi>Celion</hi> much better then <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes.</hi> Oh heavens! what griefe, when he heard the doom of his misfortune; he went immediately out of the hou<U+017F>e, and never re<U+017F>ted till he found <hi>Belinde.</hi> At his fir<U+017F>t acco<U+017F>t, he could not <U+017F>peak, but his looks did <U+017F>ufficiently tell what was <hi>Philemon's</hi> an<U+017F>wer. Though <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood in as great need of <U+017F>ome good coun<U+017F>ell as he, and <U+017F>trength to <U+017F>upport this blow: yet <U+017F>he would <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>tout, as not to <U+017F>toop to any dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter: but <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as not to <U+017F>hew how <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented the Shepheards mi<U+017F>ery, but made it appear unto him, that it did di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her: Whereupon <U+017F>he asked him, how her Father reli<U+017F>hed the motion? The Shepheard related the very <U+017F>ame an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Philemon</hi> gave, adding <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighs and <U+017F>ad lamentations, that <U+017F>he had been a very Rock, had <U+017F>he not been moved at them; yet <U+017F>he did interrupt him, <U+017F>urmounting her <U+017F>elfe with as much vertue as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and told him, that lamentations were only for poor weak <U+017F>pirits, and did not become per<U+017F>ons of courage; and therefore he did both him<U+017F>elfe and her wrong, if he u<U+017F>ed any <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. <hi>Celion,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) where is that brave re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you <U+017F>aid, you had armed your <U+017F>elfe withall, again<U+017F>t all accidents what<U+017F>oever, except at the change of my affections can any thing el<U+017F>e make you <U+017F>tagger? Con<U+017F>ider, that words do no good at all, only make tho<U+017F>e that hear them, think wor<U+017F>e both of you and me? For heavens <U+017F>ake, do not <U+017F>tain my honour with that pusillanimity, which hitherto I have with <U+017F>o much pain avoided; and <U+017F>ince there is no better remedy be patient as I am: perhaps the heavens will hereafter contrive things better to our contentment, then we at this time ought to de<U+017F>ire<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> For my part, I will avoid the misfortune as much as I can po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and if there be no better remedy, we will re<U+017F>olutely fly from it, and leave one another. The<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words made him almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate, imagining, that her great courage proceeded from the faintne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her affection. Could I as ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>olve upon this accident as you, (an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard) I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe unworthy of your Love; for a hollow faint affection de<U+017F>erves not <U+017F>uch a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. For a reward of all my <U+017F>ervices you bid me re<U+017F>olve to lo<U+017F>e you and does implicitely bid me not de<U+017F>pair, if I <U+017F>ee you, Another's. Ah <hi>Belinde!</hi> with what face can you look upon your new friend? with what kinde of heart can you love? and how can you ever carra<U+017F><U+017F>e him, <U+017F>ince you have promi<U+017F>ed a thou<U+017F>and times never to love any but me, <U+017F>ince your heart has <U+017F>o often <U+017F>worn never to be any but mine? Well, you do command me to leave you, and to obey you, I will do <U+017F>o; for the la<U+017F>t minute of my life, <U+017F>hall be the fir<U+017F>t of my di<U+017F>obedience. I pray the heavens, you may be as happy in your new choice, as I <U+017F>hall be mi<U+017F>erable. Live and enjoy all contentment with <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes;</hi> and may you enjoy as much good fortune together, as I have will to do you <U+017F>ervice; may this new affection <U+017F>well with all delights, and la<U+017F>t as long as life, whil<U+017F>t I am <U+017F>ure my mo<U+017F>t faithfull affection will be <U+017F>moothered with extream griefs. <hi>Belinde</hi> did let <hi>Celion</hi> <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o long together becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he feared, that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke, her tears would do the office of words, and that would argue too little power over her <U+017F>elfe. Oh proud beauty, that had rather be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53526:86"/>
cen<U+017F>ured for want of love than re<U+017F>olution? But at la<U+017F>t, finding her <U+017F>elfe confident enough<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: <hi>Celion,</hi> you think that all this is an argument of your affection<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but I think the contrary; for how can you love me, and have <U+017F>uch an ill opinion of me? If you took this opinion up <U+017F>ince this la<U+017F>t accident, it is to be believed, that that affection is not very great which can <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly change: If you have not an ill opinion of me, how can you po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly think, that once I did love you, and now do not? Con<U+017F>ider how unlikely it is, that <hi>Celion,</hi> whom I loved above all the world, and who<U+017F>e humours were ever as agreeable to me, as my own, <U+017F>hould be changed for <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes?</hi> whom I never <U+017F>aw, and whom rather then I will marry, I will marry a Grave. If I be forced, it is by the commands of a Father, whom neither in duty nor honour I ought to di<U+017F>obey. But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon forget all tho<U+017F>e vowes and prote<U+017F>tations which I have made unto you, never to marry? How comes this change to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e? For if you did love me without marrying me, why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you love me <U+017F>till without marrying me? And when I have a Husband, who can forbid me to love a Brother <U+017F>till, with as much affection, as is due unto a Brother? Adieu, adieu, my <hi>Celion,</hi> live, and love me, who will love you to the la<U+017F>t, what<U+017F>oever becomes of <hi>Belin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:</hi> At this word <U+017F>he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, which was a greater favour than ever yet <U+017F>he did him, and left him <U+017F>o much out of him<U+017F>elfe, that he could not utter one <U+017F>yllable. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him<U+017F>elfe, and con<U+017F>idered that love ought to bend unto duty, and that there was not one <U+017F>park of hope left, which could help him out of his griefes, like a man that ravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his re<U+017F>olutions, he wandred up and down Woods and unfrequented places, where he did nothing but lament his cruell dyfa<U+017F>ter; do what all his friends could, they could not per<U+017F>wade him from this errant life.</p>
               <p>Thus he lived many daies, in which he moved the very Rocks unto pitty. And to the end, <U+017F>he who was the cau<U+017F>e of his mi<U+017F>ery, might a little re<U+017F>ent it, he <U+017F>ent her the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es.</p>

Surely, the gods do puni<U+017F>h me for loving you too much, or rather indeed, for not loving you enough, yet I do love you as much as ever any other in the world can: And yet, for gods-<U+017F>ake tell me, why I <U+017F>hould love you, <U+017F>ince you do love a per<U+017F>on whom I do not?

               <p>Whil<U+017F>t this Shepheard was thus talking to him<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o troubled at this dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, as he talked loud enough to be heard a long way off, <hi>Belinde,</hi> who had not forgot the time and place of appointment, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he had rid her <U+017F>elf of her company, <U+017F>hee came unto him, <U+017F>o troubled at the thought of lo<U+017F>ing him, as <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>o hide her <U+017F>orrows, but <U+017F>ome appeared in her face. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> who was that morning got up betimes to walk, by fortune <U+017F>pied her afarre off, and <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>hee was by her <U+017F>elf, as if <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought for <U+017F>ome clo<U+017F>e place, hee had a minde to <U+017F>ee whither <U+017F>hee intended to goe; and following her at a di<U+017F>tance, he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he went towards the Fountaine of Sicamours; then looking a little further, hee <U+017F>aw, though it was very early, a Flock feeding: <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> not being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e and <hi>Celion,</hi> had a conceipt that it was his Flock, and that <hi>Belinde</hi> was going unto him. Although hee did not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the Cha<U+017F>tity of his Mi<U+017F>tris; yet he was ea<U+017F>ily induced to beleeve that <U+017F>he did not hate him, imagining that <U+017F>o large a Court<U+017F>hip had never been, if it had been di<U+017F>agreeable unto her. And <U+017F>o, to <U+017F>atisfie his curio<U+017F>ity, as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw her among<U+017F>t the Trees, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he could not perceive him he crept nearer, and hid him<U+017F>elf in a bu<U+017F>h, from whence he could <U+017F>ee the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>itting upon the gra<U+017F><U+017F>ie <U+017F>eats about the Fountain, and <hi>Celion</hi> upon his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her. Oh how he was <U+017F>tartled as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw this! Yet becau<U+017F>e he would hear what they <U+017F>aid, he crept clo<U+017F>e under the hedge which was about the Fountain, and <U+017F>o heard every <U+017F>yllable what the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid. What, <hi>Celion,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee, is this your profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to plea<U+017F>e mee? Hath this accident more force upon you, than the power which you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, hath? Where is your courage <hi>Celion,</hi> or indeed where is your affection? Have you not out of your love to me <U+017F>urmounted greater difficulties than this? Where is your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? What is become of tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olves which you once profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed? Would you have me beleeve that you have le<U+017F><U+017F>e affection unto me now, than at that time? Oh Shephead, rather rob mee of my life, than of that good will which you long <U+017F>ince have promi<U+017F>ed unto mee. How comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that hitherto I have had as much power over you as I could de<U+017F>ire? And why <U+017F>hould I have any le<U+017F><U+017F>e for the future? <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> heard al<U+017F>o what <hi>Celion</hi> an<U+017F>wered. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Belinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid hee) that you can make any que<U+017F>tion of my affection, or the power you have over me? Can you be <U+017F>o forgetfull of all tho<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies which I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you of it? And mu<U+017F>t I <U+017F>urvive that good opinion which you ought to have of mee? Can you, <hi>Belinde,</hi> tax mee in any of my actions, or ever doubt of my obedience unto all your commands? I pray, before you doe entertain any <U+017F>uch ill opinions of mee, aske <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranthe</hi> what <U+017F>he thinks: Nay, ask <hi>Belinde</hi> her <U+017F>elf, if ever <U+017F>he impo<U+017F>ed any difficulty upon mee, which my affection has not <U+017F>urmounted? Even at this very time, when I <U+017F>ee you are giving your <U+017F>elfe unto another, I am ready to leave you in the arms of one more happy than my <U+017F>elfe, by putting an end to my dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous love, and bani<U+017F>hing my <U+017F>elfe for ever

from you. Ala<U+017F><U+017F>e, can you <U+017F>ay, that this is any want of affection or will to obey you, <U+017F>ince I doe re<U+017F>ent it more di<U+017F>mally than death it <U+017F>elf? Oh Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, what <U+017F>trange mi<U+017F>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tandings are betwixt you and me? For if you doe doubt of my affection becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>upport this dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter and live, I will tell you that your extreme re<U+017F>olutene<U+017F>s is too certain an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your <U+017F>mall affection. But to what purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould I retain any hopes of you, <U+017F>ince another (O fatal word) another mu<U+017F>t enjoy you. At this word, the poor Shepheard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <U+017F>trength or thought leaned upon <hi>Belinde</hi>'s knee, and there <U+017F>wooned: Whether <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde</hi> was toucht to the heart at this, I leave you to judge, fair Nymph, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did love him as well as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to love, and <U+017F>eemed onely as if <U+017F>hee did not re<U+017F>ent this <U+017F>ad <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him in this <U+017F>wounding fit, and thought there was no witne<U+017F>s but the Sicamours and Fountain, <U+017F>he would not conceale from them what <U+017F>hee had kept <U+017F>o <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from her all companions: Ala<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and held up her hands) Oh ye <U+017F>overaigne powers, either deliver me from this mi<U+017F>ery or from my life; either remove this cruel dy<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter, or let this cruel dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter remove me. Then ca<U+017F>ting her eyes upon <hi>Celion,</hi> and thou, O too faithfull Shepheard (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee) who had<U+017F>t not been <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable if thou had<U+017F>t not loved me, Oh that the heavens would either give thee that contentment which thy affection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erveth, or el<U+017F>e take mee out of the world, <U+017F>ince I am the onely cau<U+017F>e that thou endure<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries, which thou doe<U+017F>t not de<U+017F>erve. Then pau<U+017F>ing a while, <U+017F>he went on; O how hard a thing it is to love well, and be wi<U+017F>e both together? I know very well that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has good rea<U+017F>on to be<U+017F>tow me upon the prudent Shepheard <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance is convenient for him; but ala<U+017F>s, what's that to mee, as long as my love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lookes another way. I know <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> de<U+017F>erves very well, and I could never hope for a more advantageous match than him; but how <U+017F>hould I give my <U+017F>elfe unto him, when as Love hath di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of me unto another? Rea<U+017F>on is on my Fathers <U+017F>ide, but Love is on mine: And not a love newly begun, but a love even from my cradle, by a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance hath <U+017F>o in<U+017F>inuated it <U+017F>elf into my <U+017F>oul, that he is more my <U+017F>oul than my <U+017F>oul it <U+017F>elf is. Oh heavens! Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to lo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>oul and live? Tell me, <hi>Belinde,</hi> wilt thou not be utterly undone, when it is gone? As <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words, a river of tears ran from her eyes, and fell upon the hands and cheeks of the Shepheard, who coming to him<U+017F>elfe by little and little, cau<U+017F>ed the Shephearde<U+017F>s to be <U+017F>ilent, and wipe away her teares from her eyes le<U+017F>t hee <U+017F>hould take any notice of them: And changing her countenance and voice, <U+017F>pake thus unto him; Shepheard, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I am very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of your pain, and did I doubt of your affection, I were the mo<U+017F>t ungreateful per<U+017F>on in the world. But, ala<U+017F>s, what will my acknowledgements and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibilitie avayl, <U+017F>ince heaven hath <U+017F>ubjected mee unto the will of him who gave mee my being? Would you wi<U+017F>h me to requite him with di<U+017F>obedience? But admit I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer my affection to tran<U+017F>port me beyond my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Will that, <hi>Celion,</hi> <U+017F>et us in any more tranquillity? Can it be any contentment unto you if you doe love me, to <U+017F>ee me grieve and mourn away all my dayes? Doe you thinke my di<U+017F>obedience to my Father will not be a terrour to my con<U+017F>cience as long as I live? Yes, yes, and more unto me than any other, who have ever di<U+017F>allowed it in others; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for very <U+017F>hame fall into that <U+017F>inne my <U+017F>elf. Let us arme our <U+017F>elves therefore, O Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, with this re<U+017F>olution, that as hitherto, our loves though extream, could never make us commit any crime again<U+017F>t our duties, <U+017F>o for the future let us never <U+017F>uffer it to force us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: Be<U+017F>ides, where there is no remedy, complaints are but unprofitable: My Father hath be<U+017F>towed mee upon <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> and this gift can never be revoked but by <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> him<U+017F>elfe: And what <U+017F>mall hopes is there in that? But <U+017F>ince I had di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of my affection before my Father, I doe promi<U+017F>e you, and vow before all the gods, e<U+017F>pecially before them of this place, that in affection I will be yours unto my grave: And neither Father, nor Husband, nor the Tyrant, Duty, <U+017F>hall ever be able to make me break my Vow. Heaven has given me unto a Father, this Father has given my body unto a Husband, and my Duty commands obedience unto my Father; but neither Heaven, nor Father, nor Husband can hinder mee from having a Brother, whom I will love, as I have promi<U+017F>ed you, what<U+017F>oever becomes of me. Upon the<U+017F>e words, fore<U+017F>eeing that <hi>Celion</hi> would break out into complaints and teares, <U+017F>hee did ri<U+017F>e up, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing his cheeks as <U+017F>hee bade him Adieu, <U+017F>aid thus unto him, I be<U+017F>eech the gods, Shepheard, give you as much contentment in your voyage, as I <U+017F>hall want when you are gone. <hi>Celion</hi> had neither power to an<U+017F>wer, nor courage to follow her, but lifting up his hands, and looking after her as long as he could <U+017F>ee her, at la<U+017F>t the trees interpo<U+017F>ed: Then lifting up his watry eyes unto heaven, after many a deep and <U+017F>ad <U+017F>igh he turned the other way, not caring what became of either Flock, nor any thing he had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53526:88"/>
left in his Cabin. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> who lay hid all this while under a thick bu<U+017F>h, heard all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and was more <U+017F>atisfied with the vertue of the fair and wi<U+017F>e <hi>Belinde,</hi> and more admired the <U+017F>trength of her courage, and excellency of her re<U+017F>olution, then is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. After he had been a long time in a ravi<U+017F>hing contemplation of all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and con<U+017F>idering upon the extream affection that was between the<U+017F>e two Lovers; he thought, that it would be an act unworthy of him<U+017F>elfe, if he <U+017F>hould be the cau<U+017F>e of their <U+017F>eparation, and that heaven had brought him <U+017F>o opprotunely to this <U+017F>ad farewell, purpo<U+017F>ely to let him <U+017F>ee that errour which unawares he was going to commit. Being then re<U+017F>olved to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour their contentment, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, he began to follow <hi>Celion;</hi> but he was already <U+017F>o far gon, that he could not overtake him; but thinking to finde him in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, he took a little path which conducted to it: but <hi>Celion</hi> was gone another way, and without <U+017F>peaking to any of his kindred or friends, he wandred up and down like a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond many daies, without any de<U+017F>igne, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>hun all men, and to gather <U+017F>uch wild fruits, as extream hunger made him gather in the woods. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>eeing his de<U+017F>igne fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trated that way, after a day or two's <U+017F>earch after <hi>Celion,</hi> he came unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> hoping to under<U+017F>tand from her which way he went, and as good fortune was, he found her in the <U+017F>ame place where <U+017F>he bad adieu unto <hi>Celion,</hi> being alone by her <U+017F>elfe at the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide, and thinking upon the la<U+017F>t accident in that place, which had drawn into her eyes abundance of tears even from the very root of her heart. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> who <U+017F>aw her afar off, came neerer and neerer as clo<U+017F>ely as he could, purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e her; and <U+017F>eeing tears trickle from her eyes like two Fountains, this <U+017F>ight moved <U+017F>o much pitty in him, as he <U+017F>wore, not to <U+017F>leep, untill he had given a remedy to her griefs; and to lo<U+017F>e no time, <U+017F>tep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to her, he <U+017F>aluted her very kindly. She being-thus <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, with tears flowing from her eyes, to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble the matter, faigned, as if <U+017F>he were wa<U+017F>hing her <U+017F>elfe at the Fountain, and putting her hand pre<U+017F>ently into the water, <U+017F>he wa<U+017F>hed her face; <U+017F>o as if <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> had not <U+017F>een her tears before, he could hardly have known <U+017F>he had cryed: That which made him mo<U+017F>t admire her vertue was, that pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>he put on a countenance of laughter, and turning towards him in a very courteous manner, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: I had thought, kinde Shepheard to have been alone: but I <U+017F>ee you are come hither upon the <U+017F>ame occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I did, I mean, to take the fre<U+017F>h air, and wa<U+017F>h your hands and eyes at this clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and truly it is the be<U+017F>t and cleare<U+017F>t Spring in all the Plain. Wi<U+017F>e and fair Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, you have good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, that the <U+017F>ame occa<U+017F>ion brought us both hither, for it is very true; but in <U+017F>aying, that both of us come hither with intention to wa<U+017F>h our <U+017F>elves in this water, I mu<U+017F>t needs contradict you, for it was neither of our de<U+017F>ignes. As for me, <U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I hope you wil give me leave to tel you, that none knowes better than my <U+017F>elf with what intention I came. I do agree, <U+017F>aid <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> that you do know it better than any other; but for all that, you cannot make me believe, that the <U+017F>ame occa<U+017F>ion which you <U+017F>ay brought you hither, was really and truly the occa<U+017F>ion. What then, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do you think it was? As <U+017F>he asked this que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>he put her hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face, <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he rubbed her forehead; but indeed, it was to hide that colour, which <U+017F>he perceived came into her face: Which <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> taking notice of, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous to put her out of that pain, in which he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he was, did an<U+017F>wer her thus: Fair and di<U+017F>creet Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, never think to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble any longer with me, who knowes as well as you do the very <U+017F>ecrets of your <U+017F>oul; and that you may the better believe me, I will tell you, that you were now thinking upon the la<U+017F>t farewell which you gave unto <hi>Celion</hi> in this place. Who I? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, in a great amazement. Yes, you an<U+017F>wered <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> but never be <U+017F>orry that I know it: for I do <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teem your vertue and merit, as I will do all I can to give you full contentment. I know of all the <U+017F>ervices this Shepheard hath done you, and with how much honour he hath courted you; I know with how much affection he hath continued it this many years and more then that, how you have affected him. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the<U+017F>e things makes me de<U+017F>ire death, rather then be any cau<U+017F>e of your <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not imagine, that any matter of jealou<U+017F>ie makes me <U+017F>peak thus, for I never had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of your vertue; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince with the<U+017F>e ears, I heard all the wi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e you had with him. Neither think but that I believe, I <U+017F>hall lo<U+017F>e my be<U+017F>t fortune in loving you; but the only rea<U+017F>on which reduceth me to give you unto him, who<U+017F>e you ought to be, Oh wi<U+017F>e <hi>Belinde,</hi> is becau<U+017F>e I will never <U+017F>uffer my contentment to be with your eternall griefe. And, becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe culpable both to god and man if I <U+017F>hould be a cau<U+017F>e, why <U+017F>o pure and vertuous a Love <U+017F>hould be broke betwixt you; I mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o tell you, that in thus doing, I deprive my <U+017F>elfe of the be<U+017F>t alliance I ever could have, and <U+017F>hall lo<U+017F>e

my own content, for the <U+017F>atisfaction of yours. Me thinks I do in this, but what my duty commands me, and it will be no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>atisfaction unto me, to think, that if <hi>Belinde</hi> be contented, <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> is an in<U+017F>trument of it. Only this I <U+017F>hall require, and in it you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, that <U+017F>ince I am a cau<U+017F>e of your reunion, you will be plea<U+017F>ed to take me in, as a Third among<U+017F>t you two; and that I may have the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hare in your affection, which you promi<U+017F>ed unto <hi>Celion,</hi> when you thought to have married <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>o as both of you may receive me as a Brother. I am not able, fair Nymph, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the joy of this di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; nor do I think, that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe did know what language to u<U+017F>e, for the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her thanks; but taking him by the hand, and <U+017F>itting down by the Fountain <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he told him all the whole <U+017F>tory that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt <hi>Celion</hi> and her <U+017F>elfe, and after a million of thanks, <U+017F>he entreated him to go him<U+017F>elfe to <hi>Celion;</hi> for the tran<U+017F>port of this <U+017F>ad Shepheard was <U+017F>uch, that he would not return with any el<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hould go and <U+017F>eek him, becau<U+017F>e he would never believe this <U+017F>tory, if he heard it from any other. <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> who would by all means fini<U+017F>h the good work he had begun, re<U+017F>olved to go the next morning with <hi>Diamis, Celion</hi>'s Brother, promi<U+017F>ing not to return, untill he had found him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Being thus gone, and taken the fir<U+017F>t way their feet light upon, they wandred up and down in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Celion;</hi> and long had they looked in vain, if he him<U+017F>elfe, tran<U+017F>ported with fury, had not returned into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> with a de<U+017F>igne to kill <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> and with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>word, reach the heart of <hi>Belinde,</hi> not being able to live, and let another enjoy her. In this rage he <U+017F>et forward; and becau<U+017F>e he fed upon nothing but roots and herbs which he found in the high way, he was grown <U+017F>o weak, that he could hardly walk; and had not his rage <U+017F>upported him, he would have fallen down: needs therefore mu<U+017F>t he re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe very oft, e<U+017F>pecially in the heat of the day. Being thus weak and weary, he <U+017F>at down under <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hady Trees, clo<U+017F>e by a fountain; and after he had a while re<U+017F>ented his affliction, he fell a<U+017F>leep. Fortune, that was now weary with afflicting him had a minde, it <U+017F>eemes, to make him compleatly happy, and directed <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> and <hi>Diamis</hi> ju<U+017F>t to the <U+017F>ame place, and by chance <hi>Diamis</hi> walked fir<U+017F>t. As <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw his Brother he knew him, and looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, told <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> who being much rejoyced at it, would needs go and embrace him but <hi>Diamis</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer him, <U+017F>aying, I be<U+017F>eech you, <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> do not acquaint my Brother too <U+017F>uddenly with this newes, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e his death by exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive joy; therefore I conceive it better, to let me acquaint him with it by little and little: and becau<U+017F>e perhaps he will not believe me, you may come after, and confirm him in what I <U+017F>aid. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<U+017F>tes</hi> thinking this advice to be good, he went behinde <U+017F>ome Trees, where he could not be <U+017F>een, and <hi>Diamis</hi> went forward It may be <U+017F>aid, he was in<U+017F>pired with <U+017F>ome good <U+017F>pirit; for had <hi>Celion</hi> <U+017F>een <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> fir<U+017F>t, perhaps his de<U+017F>perate rage might have proved fatall to him. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Diamis</hi> came up, his Brother waked, and began to fall into his accu<U+017F>tomed complaints; and, after he had <U+017F>aluted him, he <U+017F>aid thus: I thank the gods, Brother, that I have <U+017F>o happily found you, to deliver a me<U+017F><U+017F>age which <hi>Belinde</hi> hath <U+017F>ent unto you.
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently) What! can <U+017F>he have any memory of me, now <U+017F>he is in the armes of <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes? Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diamis,</hi> has none of <hi>Belinde</hi> in his armes; and I hope, if you have any re<U+017F>olution, never <U+017F>hall. Do you doubt, Brother, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celion,</hi> that my re<U+017F>olution will fail me upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion?

No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diamis,</hi> I do <U+017F>wear by the great <hi>Theatates, He<U+017F>ius,</hi> and <hi>Thamaris,</hi> and by all that is <U+017F>acred unto us, that I tell you truth, and that ere long you <U+017F>hall hear it from <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes</hi> him<U+017F>elfe. Then <hi>Celion</hi> lifting up his hands and eyes unto heaven, Oh gods, <U+017F>aid he, unto what happy end have you re<U+017F>erved me? Then his Brother, to interrupt him, <U+017F>aid thus: Never talk any more, Brother, of mi<U+017F>ery and death, but of joy and contentment; and above all, prepare your <U+017F>elfe to thank <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> for the favour he hath done you, for I <U+017F>ee him coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. At this word, <hi>Celion</hi> ro<U+017F>e up, and <U+017F>eeing him neer, he ran to embrace him, with as much good will, as a little before he intended ill: But, when he heard the truth of the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, he fell upon his knees before <hi>Erga<U+017F>tes,</hi> and would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his feet.

When? <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea.</hi> Do you remember Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida,</hi> when you commanded me to make no more account of <hi>Polemas?</hi> Oh, very well remembred to no purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea;</hi> But did you never love <hi>Celadon?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I doe not love <hi>Celadon</hi> any otherwi<U+017F>e than as a Brother; and in that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid true; for <U+017F>ince the Shepheard and <U+017F>he had the la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to change her love into friend<U+017F>hip. Well <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph, let's leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e both of him and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for we have had too much of it. But what an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, will you return to <hi>Lindamor?</hi> Nothing, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but <U+017F>ilence. Mu<U+017F>t hee then whom he <U+017F>ent hither, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, return without any an<U+017F>wer? Let him take his own cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea.</hi> As for me, I am fully re<U+017F>olved, that neither for his <U+017F>ake, nor any others, will I make my<U+017F>elf mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Is it not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary then <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> that <hi>Flurial</hi> comeback? No, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he. <hi>Leonide</hi> then told her that there was a young man who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Silvia,</hi> and that <U+017F>hee thought it was from <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would deliver his Me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto none but <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> her<U+017F>elf. Then tell him where <U+017F>he is, <U+017F>aid the Nymph; we need but draw the Curtains of <hi>Celadons</hi> Bed; for I doe a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe he will bee glad to hear what <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath writ, <U+017F>ince I beleeve you have already acquainted him with their love. 'Tis very true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide</hi> but <hi>Silvia</hi> is of <U+017F>uch a haughty <U+017F>pirit, that I am confident <U+017F>he will be much offended, if this Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peake unto her before <hi>Celadon.</hi> Let it <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e her, <U+017F>aid

               <p>AFter <hi>Ligdamon</hi> had taken his leave of you, he departed with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed to him<U+017F>elfe, to obtain that by this voyage, which his <U+017F>ervices could not do at home; hoping either <U+017F>o to <U+017F>ignalize his nameby his acts of valour, that he might become agreeable unto you; or el<U+017F>e in dying, to make you grieve for his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e. In this de<U+017F>igne, they came into the Army of <hi>Merovea,</hi> a Prince adorned with all Perfections requi<U+017F>ite in a Conquerour; and came <U+017F>o opportunely, as the Battle was to be fought the <U+017F>eventh day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <U+017F>o as all the young Cavalrie had no other cares, but to burni<U+017F>h up their Armes, and get their hor<U+017F>es in good order. But it is not of them I am to <U+017F>peak, therefore pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing all them over in <U+017F>ilence, only what relates unto <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> give me therefore leave to tell you, that the a<U+017F><U+017F>igned day of Battle being come, the two Armies drew out of their Camps, and in <U+017F>ight of each other ranked them<U+017F>elves into Battalia. Here a Squadron of Hor<U+017F>e, there a Battalion of Foot; here the Drums, there the Trumpets; on one <U+017F>ide the neighing of Hor<U+017F>es, on the other <U+017F>ide the voices of men, did make <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e, as if <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>llona</hi> had roared in the field, and di<U+017F>played her mo<U+017F>t horrid Banners. As for me, I never having been before in the like <U+017F>ervice, I was <U+017F>o dea<U+017F>ned with the noi<U+017F>e, and dazled with the <U+017F>hining of Armes, that the truth is, I knew not where I was; yet my re<U+017F>olution ever was, not to abandon my Ma<U+017F>ter, though nothing was to be <U+017F>een but Engines of Death. But, all this was nothing, compared to that horrible confu<U+017F>ion, when all the<U+017F>e Squadrons met, and when the word of Combat was given.</p>
               <p>The Cavalrie and Infantry: Men, Armes, Hor<U+017F>es, and Engines, made a mo<U+017F>t affrighting thunder. After we had received <U+017F>everall clouds of Arrowes, I cannot tell you, how I came to be with my Ma<U+017F>ter in the mid<U+017F>t of his enemies, where I did nothing but admire the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of his <U+017F>word. I <U+017F>wear, fair Nymph, one wonder makes me forget another, <U+017F>o many did <hi>Ligdamon</hi> perform; and <U+017F>uch was his valour, that <hi>Merovea</hi> de<U+017F>ired to know his name, having ob<U+017F>erved him above all the re<U+017F>t of the Cavaliers. The fir<U+017F>t Squadron was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready victorious, and ours rallied to fall upon the <U+017F>econd, when the Enemy with his whole Body marched upon them, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, that <hi>Merovea</hi> could not relieve them in time. And certainly, if he had found a Captain le<U+017F><U+017F>e experienced than this, he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his de<U+017F>igne: But this great Souldier, imagining the de<U+017F>pair of his Adver<U+017F>ary, <U+017F>ent pre<U+017F>ently three fre<U+017F>h Squadrons, two, unto the two wings, and the third in the arrear of the

fir<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>o well, as they <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained a great part of the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hock; yet we, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, were much oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with numbers. At the <U+017F>ame time, both Bodies of Infantry being joyned, that of <hi>Merovea</hi> had the better; and look, how much we gained ground upon the Hor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o much the Infantry of the Enemy lo<U+017F>t. So it was, that upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fir<U+017F>t Charge, many of our men were troden down, be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e whom Arrowes had at the fir<U+017F>t un-Hor<U+017F>ed; among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Clidaman</hi> was one, his Hor<U+017F>e being killed under him with an Arrow. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who ever had an eye upon him, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, did ride up, and lay about him <U+017F>o couragiou<U+017F>ly, that he made a Wall of dead bodies about <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who, in the mean time, had lea<U+017F>ure to recover him<U+017F>elfe from under his Hor<U+017F>e, and who doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, without my Ma<U+017F>ters help and valour, had been tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to pieces; for <hi>Ligdamon</hi> lighted from his Hor<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>et <hi>Clidaman</hi> on the back of him, whil<U+017F>t he him<U+017F>elfe was <U+017F>o wounded and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with enemies, that he could not get upon that Hor<U+017F>e which I led. Now was our party forced to recoile, wanting the invincible Arme of my Ma<U+017F>ter; and we were in <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>perate condition, and we were amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many enemies, as there was no hopes of any life. However, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> would never render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe; and though he was wounded and weary, yet there was not an enemy, <U+017F>eeing what deadly blowes came from his Arme, that was <U+017F>o bold as to lay hold of him: At the la<U+017F>t, five or <U+017F>ix came galloping up with all their fury, and he having run his <U+017F>word into the fir<U+017F>t Hor<U+017F>e, it broke at the very bilt, and the hor<U+017F>e, being run through the heart, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: I ran to help him up, but halfe a <U+017F>core more that was fallen upon him, hindred me. Thus both of us halfe dead, were carried away; and the accident was the more dyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>terous, becau<U+017F>e almo<U+017F>t at the very <U+017F>ame time, our Party recovered what they had lo<U+017F>t, by the reliefe which <hi>Childerick</hi> brought from the Rear guard, and were Ma<U+017F>ters of the Field, burning all the enemies Hutts, mo<U+017F>t part of them being taken or killed. As for us, we were carried unto their principall City, called <hi>Rhotomages,</hi> where my Ma<U+017F>ter was no <U+017F>ooner arrived, but many came to vi<U+017F>it him; <U+017F>ome <U+017F>aid, they were his Co<U+017F>ens<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> others his friends, though he knew not one of them: For my part, I knew neither what to <U+017F>ay nor think of it, when I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o many <U+017F>trangers carra<U+017F><U+017F>ing, and making <U+017F>o very much of him: yet much more was our amazement, when a Lady, well attended, came to vi<U+017F>it him, <U+017F>aying, he was her Son, with <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations of affection, as he was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elfe; and much more, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, Oh <hi>Lydias</hi> my Child, how great are both my joyes and fears, at the <U+017F>ight of you in this place? Alas! how am I afraid to <U+017F>ee you in this cruell Town, <U+017F>ince your enemy <hi>Arontes,</hi> is dead of tho<U+017F>e wounds which you gave him, and <U+017F>ince you are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death by Ju<U+017F>tice? For my part, I know no other way but to ran<U+017F>ome you pre<U+017F>ently, and hide you, till you be able to get away. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was extreamly amazed at all this, and knew that he was taken for <U+017F>ome other; but he could not an<U+017F>wer her, becau<U+017F>e at the very <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant, he who took him, came into the Chamber, with two Officers of the Town, to take a li<U+017F>t of the names and qualities of the Pri<U+017F>oners; for many being taken they intended to exchange them. The poor Lady was much affrighted, thinking they came to <U+017F>eize upon him, and carry him to Pri<U+017F>on; and hearing them ask his name, <U+017F>he told them her <U+017F>elfe but my Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>aid, his name was <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> a <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian:</hi> She had an opinion, that he would di<U+017F><U+017F>emble his name; and to remove all <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, went pre<U+017F>ently to her hou<U+017F>e, with a re<U+017F>olution to ran<U+017F>ome him before he was known. The truth was my Ma<U+017F>ter did <U+017F>o re<U+017F>emble <hi>Lydias,</hi> that every one did take him for the <U+017F>ame. This <hi>Lydias</hi> was a young Gallant of that Country, and being in love with a great Beauty, had fought with <hi>Arontes,</hi> his Rivall, and killed him, yet had time enough to e<U+017F>cape the hands of Ju<U+017F>tice; but, after the death of <hi>Arontes,</hi> was <U+017F>o pro<U+017F>ecuted by his friends, that <hi>Lydias,</hi> though ab<U+017F>ent, was condemned to death. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was <U+017F>o wounded that he could not think of the<U+017F>e things. I fore<U+017F>eeing what danger might en<U+017F>ure, <U+017F>till pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Mother to ran<U+017F>ome him, which <U+017F>he did, yet not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, but the Enemies of <hi>Lydias</hi> were acquainted with it; <U+017F>o as the very <U+017F>ame day that this good Lady paid the ran<U+017F>ome, and carried him to her hou<U+017F>e, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Ju<U+017F>tice came and carried him to Pri<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ay what <hi>Ligdamon</hi> could. Thus being by every one taken for <hi>Lydias,</hi> he was in very great danger: but much more the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when he was examined upon <U+017F>uch interrogatories, of which he was <U+017F>o ignorant, that he knew not what to an<U+017F>wer. However, the Judges per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in their former judgment, and confirmed it, giving him no longer term than the healing of his wounds. The noi<U+017F>e was pre<U+017F>ently all about the Town, that <hi>Lydias</hi> was a Pri<U+017F>oner, and condemned to die, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Murderer, but as a Rebell, being taken in Armes for the <hi>Franks;</hi> and therefore, as the cu<U+017F>tome of that time and place was, for <U+017F>uch an offence, he was to be put into a Den
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53526:91"/>
of Lions; nothing el<U+017F>e was talked of through all the Town: At la<U+017F>t, it came to my ears; upon which I di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe, and with the help of that good Lady, who had paid his ran<U+017F>ome, I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> unto <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi> whom I acquainted with the accident at which they were much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, thinking it almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, two per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>emble <U+017F>o much as to finde no difference; but to prevent any danger, they pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>ent two Heraulds of Armes, to acquaint the enemy with their errour. But all this conduced to no purpo<U+017F>e, but confirmed them in their opinion, and rather ha<U+017F>ted the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Sentence than otherwi<U+017F>e. The wounds of <hi>Ligdamon</hi> were now healed, <U+017F>o as they pronounced the Sentence, That he <U+017F>hould die by Lions, which <U+017F>hould be his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners; yet, being of a noble Family, they would do him <U+017F>o much favour, as to let him wear his Sword and Dagger, as Armes belonging to a Cavalier; with which, if he had <U+017F>o much courage, he might defend him<U+017F>elfe, or at lea<U+017F>t, generou<U+017F>ly revenge his death. At that time they returned unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> that thus they alwaies puni<U+017F>hed their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were Traitors unto their Country. Thus <U+017F>ee poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> in mo<U+017F>t pittifull danger; yet, his Courage that never fainted, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in matters of Love, <U+017F>eeing there was no other remedy, re<U+017F>olved to defend him<U+017F>elfe as well as he could. <hi>Lydias</hi> being one of the be<U+017F>t Families of the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> almo<U+017F>t all the Citty a<U+017F><U+017F>embled to behold this Spectacle. When he was ready to be put into this clo<U+017F>e horrour, his only reque<U+017F>t was, that he might fight with the<U+017F>e Lions one after another. The people hearing this ju<U+017F>t demand, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it by their acclamations and clapping of hands, in <U+017F>pite of the pro<U+017F>ecutors. Now, <U+017F>ee <hi>Ligdamon</hi> alone in a great Court, and the Lions <U+017F>eeing their prey through <U+017F>ome Bars, did roar <U+017F>o horridly, as would have chilled the blood of any, but him; who taking notice which dore fir<U+017F>t opened, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, he <U+017F>aw a huge hungry Lion come out, who at the fir<U+017F>t, pawing with his foot upon the ground, and <U+017F>triking him<U+017F>elfe with his taile, he began to <U+017F>tretch forth his paw, and open his clawes, as if he would <U+017F>hew him what death he <U+017F>hould die. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> <U+017F>eeing no <U+017F>afety but in his own valour, a<U+017F>soon as ever he <U+017F>aw him begin to walk, he darted his Dagger <U+017F>o dexterou<U+017F>ly to the Lions brea<U+017F>t, as the point of it pierced his heart, and the bea<U+017F>t fell dead immediately. Great was the <U+017F>hout of the people! for every one ob<U+017F>erving his courageous behaviour, his valour and dexterity, they did wi<U+017F>h him well in their very hearts. But he, that knew the <U+017F>everity of the Judges would not be thus <U+017F>atisfied, he ran pre<U+017F>ently to take his Dagger again, which he had no <U+017F>ooner got into his hand, but another Lion, no le<U+017F><U+017F>e furious then the fir<U+017F>t, came running furiou<U+017F>ly upon him, <U+017F>o as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was like to be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, but he <U+017F>tepped a little a<U+017F>ide out of this raging Animal's full carrier, and cut him over the eyes; upon which, the furious bea<U+017F>t turned <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort upon him, that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> <U+017F>tepping back to fetch another blow, he fell; but <U+017F>o, that in falling, the Lion coming over him, he ran him into the belly, and <U+017F>o mortally, as he fell dead as <U+017F>oon as the fir<U+017F>t did. Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was thus fighting for his life, a Lady, one of the faire<U+017F>t of all the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> kneeled down before the Judges, be<U+017F>eeching them to <U+017F>tay Execution untill <U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken unto them; her name was <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> the very <U+017F>ame for whom <hi>Lydias</hi> had killed <hi>Arontes,</hi> and who, though much a<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet, <U+017F>pake thus unto the Judges: Sirs, Ingratitude is a <U+017F>in as great as Trea<U+017F>on, and I de<U+017F>erve a puni<U+017F>hment as great as his, did I not <U+017F>ave his life, as he formerly ventured his to <U+017F>ave my honour. Therefore I do pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf before you, and claim the Priviledge, which is, That any condemned Per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hall be delivered, if any Virgin do come and ask him for her Husband: A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I heard of your judgment, I came with as much ha<U+017F>te as I could, to demand him; and <U+017F>ince I am now come yet in the nick of time, I hope you will not deny me ju<U+017F>tice, and him to be my Husband. The people hearing this, <U+017F>houted for joy, and cryed, Favour, Favour; and though the enemies of <hi>Lydias</hi> did urge the contrary, yet it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Priviledge <U+017F>hould be ob<U+017F>erved: But alas! <hi>Ligdamon</hi> came out of one danger, to enter into another, and greater; for being brought before the Judges, they let him under<U+017F>tand the cu<U+017F>tom of the Country, which was <U+017F>uch, That any man who was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for any crime, <U+017F>hould be relea<U+017F>ed from execution of Ju<U+017F>tice, if any Virgin came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him for her husband: <U+017F>o as if he would marry <hi>Amerina,</hi> he <U+017F>hould be relea<U+017F>ed to live with her. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who did not know her was extreamly put to it for an an<U+017F>wer: Yet <U+017F>eeing no other remedy to avoid the danger wherein he was, he promi<U+017F>ed that he would, hoping that time would finde out <U+017F>ome expedient to get out of this Labyrinth. <hi>Amerina,</hi> who knew that <hi>Lydias</hi> alwaies loved her, was not a little amu<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o faint &amp; cold in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; yet thinking that the terror of the danger in which he was had made him <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he pittyed him the more, and carried him into the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Lydias</hi> Mother, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

this Marriage, knowing there was no other way to <U+017F>ave her Sons life, which cau<U+017F>ed her to pre<U+017F><U+017F>e on this Marriage as <U+017F>oon as it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, thinking that it would the more plea<U+017F>e her Sonne, whom <U+017F>he knew was in love with <hi>Amerina.</hi> But, ala<U+017F>s, all this was to ha<U+017F>ten his death. Oh my dear Ma<U+017F>ter, When I think upon thy la<U+017F>t words which you <U+017F>pake unto me, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but wonder, how it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould live. All things being ready for the Marriage, and the time of Ceremony being come, he took me a<U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>aid thus unto me; Oh <hi>Egides,</hi> my friend, Did<U+017F>t thou ever <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a peece of Fortune as this, that they would make me beleeve I am not my <U+017F>elf? Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto unto him, me-thinks your fortune is not bad; <hi>Amerina</hi> is fair and rich, every one <U+017F>ayes her Parents are of the be<U+017F>t Families in all the Country, What can you de<U+017F>ire more? Oh <hi>Egides,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, thou talke<U+017F>t merrily; but did<U+017F>t thou know the condition I am in, thou would<U+017F>t pitty me: I know thy fidelity, and therefore I tru<U+017F>t and conjure thee to carry this Letter unto the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> and tell her all thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een: And tell her further, that I did never love any but her, nor will I ever love any other: Upon the<U+017F>e words hee gave mee this Letter, which I have carefully kept ever <U+017F>ince that morning when he went unto the Temple, and when he called me, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me <U+017F>wear again, that I would the next day come in all ha<U+017F>te unto you; Then came a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to conduct him to the Nuptial Chariot, in which <hi>Amerina</hi> already was, with one of her Uncles, whom <U+017F>hee honoured as her Father. Shee fate in the middle betwixt <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and <hi>Cari<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>o was her Uncle called). Before the Chariot went all their own Family, and after it followed their Kindred, Friends, and Allies. In this Triumph went they unto the Temple, and when they came there, they were led up to the Altar of <hi>Hymen,</hi> upon which five Torches were lighted; on the right <U+017F>ide of <hi>Hymen</hi> was placed <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> on the left <U+017F>ide <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi> As for <hi>Hymen,</hi> he was crowned with Flowers and <U+017F>weet Marjerome, held in his right hand a Torch, and in his left, a Vail, of the <U+017F>ame colour of <hi>Amarine's.</hi> When they came fir<U+017F>t into the Temple, the Mother of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> and <hi>Amarine</hi> lighted their Torches. Then the chiefe <hi>Druide</hi> comming unto them, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed his <U+017F>peech unto my Ma<U+017F>ter, and asked him this que<U+017F>tion: <hi>Lydias,</hi> will you have <hi>Amarine</hi> to be the Mother of your Family? It was long before <hi>Ligdamon</hi> would <U+017F>peak; but at la<U+017F>t, he was forced to <U+017F>ay, Yes. Then the Druide turning towards her: And you <hi>Amarina,</hi> Will you have <hi>Lydias</hi> for the Father of your Family? And <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wering, Yes, he then taking their hands, and putting them together, he <U+017F>aid: And I, in the <U+017F>teed of the great gods, do give you one unto another; for ever after, eat your bread together. And then taking the Barley-cake, my Ma<U+017F>ter broke it, and, according to the cu<U+017F>tome, they did eat of it together. Now there re<U+017F>ted no more to be done to compleat the Ceremony, but to take the Wine and drink: Then he turned towards me, and <U+017F>aid: I do conjure you, Friend, as the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice you ever did me, to give me the Cup: Which I did, and alas, too <U+017F>oon. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he had it in his hand, he <U+017F>aid in a loud voice: O ye great gods, who know that I am not <hi>Lydias,</hi> do not revenge my death upon this fair Lady, who<U+017F>e errour, in taking me for <U+017F>ome other, more happy than my <U+017F>elfe, hath redeemed me from one kinde of death, to give me unto another: Upon this word, he drank up all that was in the Cup; which was contrary to the Cu<U+017F>tome, for the Husband <U+017F>hould have drunk one halfe, and the Wife the other: Upon which, <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid unto him: It <U+017F>eemes, <hi>Lydias,</hi> you have forgot the Cu<U+017F>tome, for you <U+017F>hould have left me a part. God forbid, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Amarina,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, for it is poy<U+017F>on, which I have cho<U+017F>en to fini<U+017F>h my life withall, rather then fail in my promi<U+017F>e to you, and in my affection which I owe unto the fair <hi>Silvia.</hi> Oh my god, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he is this po<U+017F><U+017F>ible? And then thinking that he was
<hi>Lydias,</hi> but that during his ab<U+017F>ence, he had changed his minde, and not de<U+017F>iring to live without him, <U+017F>he ran with the Cup in her hand to the Bottle, where the poy<U+017F>oned wine was, and before <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was aware, had drunk it off; for the Apothecary, whom <hi>Ligdamon</hi> had prepared had filled the Bottle full: Afterwards returning to him, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid; You cruell man, had rather have death then me, and I, rather then be without you. Oh <hi>Amerina,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I had offended, if I had been him you took me for: but, believe me, now I am upon my la<U+017F>t breath, I am not <hi>Lydias,</hi> but <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and time will di<U+017F>cover the error: However, I choo<U+017F>e death, rather then break my promi<U+017F>e made unto the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> unto whom I have con<U+017F>ecrated my life, <U+017F>ince I am not able to <U+017F>atisfy both. Then he continued: Oh faire<U+017F>t <hi>Silvia</hi> accept of this good will I now offer unto thee, and of all my actions, let this la<U+017F>t be be<U+017F>t received, <U+017F>ince it is imprinted with the noble character of Fidelity. The Poy<U+017F>on now began to work by degrees upon the <U+017F>pirits of the<U+017F>e two new-marryed per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>o as he could hardly breathe, when turning his head towards me, he <U+017F>aid, Go, go, my friend, go,

and do thy bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, relate what thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een, and that death is more welcome unto me than life, which would have <U+017F>tained that Fidelity, which I have vowed unto the fair <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via. Silvia</hi> was the la<U+017F>t word he ever <U+017F>pake, for as he uttered it, his Soul departed out of his Body into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where if ever any Lover was happy, it is he, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <U+017F>eeing you there with him. Is it then certainly true, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia)</hi> that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is dead? Alas! too true, an<U+017F>wered he. Oh ye gods! cryed out <hi>Silvia.</hi> All <U+017F>he was able to do, was, to lie down upon the bed, for her heart quite failed her; where after <U+017F>he had been awhile, <U+017F>he called for <hi>Leonida,</hi> to take <hi>Ligdamon's</hi> Letter, and to tell <hi>Egides,</hi> that <U+017F>he would have him <U+017F>erve her. Thus <hi>Egides</hi> with-drew, with eyes <U+017F>wimming in tears. Now did Love <U+017F>hew his power; for this Nymph, who never much loved <hi>Ligdamon</hi> alive, now <U+017F>he heard of his death, <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed as much griefe, as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any Lover. Upon this occa<U+017F>ion, <hi>Galathea</hi> talking unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, That hereafter <U+017F>he would think it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that a woman <U+017F>hould never in her life love any one; for, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this Nymph hath been too cruell unto all tho<U+017F>e that loved her, that <U+017F>ome have dyed for very griefe, others have been bani<U+017F>hed out of her <U+017F>ight by de<U+017F>pair; and this very man, whom <U+017F>he now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for, <U+017F>he did heretofore drive into <U+017F>uch extremity, that but for <hi>Leonida,</hi> he had then dyed al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o as I dur<U+017F>t have <U+017F>worn, Love would have <U+017F>ooner harboured in the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>nowie part of the <hi>Alps,</hi> than in her heart; and yet you may <U+017F>ee, unto what <U+017F>he is reduced now. Do not think this to be Love, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> but rather Pitty; for, <U+017F>he had been the harde<U+017F>t piece of Marble that ever was, had <U+017F>he not been extreamly perplexed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. For my part I think <hi>Ligdamon</hi> more happy, than if he were alive, <U+017F>ince he loved this Nymph <U+017F>o extreamly, and <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o hard hearted unto him: For what greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e can be, then to be at the end of mi<U+017F>ery, and to enter into felicity? How joyed would he be, to <U+017F>ee <hi>Silvia</hi> mourn for him, and <U+017F>et a value upon his affection? No, no, Madam, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is not to be mourned for <U+017F>o much, as <hi>Silvia;</hi> for you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, that all her minde and fancy will run upon <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the garb, the affection, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and briefly, every action of this Lover, will, in revenge of her cruelty, continually torment her minde, and will in revenge, be the Executioner of Love's ju<U+017F>tice. This di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e was <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o loud, and <U+017F>o neer <hi>Silvia,</hi> that <U+017F>he heard it all, and it did but increa<U+017F>e her griefe: <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he went out of this Chamber into her own, where <U+017F>he could no longer re<U+017F>train her tears: for, <U+017F>hutting the dore after her, and de<U+017F>iring <hi>Leonida</hi> to leave her, <U+017F>he threw her <U+017F>elfe upon the bed, where, with watry eyes, and folded armes, <U+017F>he called to minde all the former life of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> how great his love was, how patiently he endured all her rigour, with what di<U+017F>cretion he <U+017F>erved her, how con<U+017F>tant he was in his love, and in the end, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, all this is now enclo<U+017F>ed in a little piece of earth. Then calling to minde her own demeanor, her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, her farewells, her impatiencies, and a thou<U+017F>and more particulars, <U+017F>he was forced to <U+017F>ay, Oh fatall memory, let the a<U+017F>hes of my dear <hi>Ligdamon</hi> re<U+017F>t in peace; if thou do<U+017F>t torment me thus, I know he will not be contented with it. At la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>he had been a while mute; Well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it is re<U+017F>olved upon, be my life long or <U+017F>hort, as it <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e the Fates, I will never cea<U+017F>e loving my dear <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> nor forget his affection or vertues. <hi>Galathea</hi> in the mean while opened <hi>Ligdamon's</hi> Letter, which was in <hi>Leonida's</hi> hands, and found in it the<U+017F>e words.</p>

Why <U+017F>hould I fear, <U+017F>aid the Shepheard, <U+017F>ince it is I that am the offended party? Ah <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph, were all things equally ballanced, you would finde your offences committed much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then tho<U+017F>e you have received.

But I pray tell me, Shepheard, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, does not Ingratitude, of all crimes and offences that are accounted great, hold the fir<U+017F>t place? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it does, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard.

This for all; con<U+017F>idering what I am, and con<U+017F>idering what you are, I cannot conceive, how I have any waies offended again<U+017F>t Love, that he <U+017F>hould puni<U+017F>h me with <U+017F>o much rigour. <hi>Celadon</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>orry for beginning this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>ince it was already on foot, he re<U+017F>olved to clear him<U+017F>elfe, and therefore <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Madam, I know not how to give an an<U+017F>wer unto your <U+017F>peeches, but by blu<U+017F>hes; yet Love, which makes you <U+017F>peak, con<U+017F>traines me to an<U+017F>wer. That which you call ingratitude in me, I mu<U+017F>t call Duty; and if you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to ask me my rea<U+017F>on, I <U+017F>hall give it.

But let me tell you, that the Law of Nature is before all others, and that Law commands us, to <U+017F>eek and prefer our own good before anothers: And can you de<U+017F>ire a greater good than my affection? Whom have you in the Country like me, who can do as I can for you? The<U+017F>e are meer mockeries, <hi>Celadon,</hi> to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much upon the<U+017F>e follies of Fidelity and Con<U+017F>tancy; termes invented only by old women and ugly to keep <U+017F>uch within their Pales, as their faces has <U+017F>et at liberty.

Since you follow the Law which you <U+017F>peak of, I <U+017F>hall remain no longer in this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, then you <U+017F>tay in a place, where there is no Man, but my <U+017F>elfe.</p>

               <p>It hapned one day, being all four together, that they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the <hi>Grotto</hi> of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e the entrance <U+017F>eemed to be very fair, and made with much art, the Shepheard asked, what it was?

After <hi>Celadon</hi> had contemplated them in generall, he was <U+017F>o full of curio<U+017F>ity, as he de<U+017F>ired to know more of the particulars, and therefore to give an occa<U+017F>ion to the Nymph to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething more upon every part, he commended the Invention and Art of the worker. The<U+017F>e are the <U+017F>pirits of <hi>Mandrague,</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) who were left here, to te<U+017F>tifie, that Love does not pardon either old or young, fair or foul; and to relate unto tho<U+017F>e who come hither, the unfortunate Loves of <hi>Damon</hi> and <U+017F>he, and of the Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune.</hi> But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> is this the Fountain of Love's Verity?

But certain it is, that the Shepheard cannot be <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in beauty; look wel upon the delicate proportion and <U+017F>ymmetry of his face; his tall and proper <U+017F>tature; and <U+017F>ee how every part is painted in the height of perfection; although he <U+017F>toopes a little to reach the water, and with his right arme wa<U+017F>heth his left, yet for all that, you may ea<U+017F>ily perceive his perfect beauty. Then ca<U+017F>t your eye upon the other <U+017F>ide of the River, and there you may behold ugline<U+017F><U+017F>e in its height, as on this <U+017F>ide you did beauty: for there among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e dirty Ru<U+017F>hes, you may <U+017F>ee the Sorcerene <hi>Mandrague,</hi> looking upon the Shepheard as he is bathing him<U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he is dre<U+017F>t, as it were, in <U+017F>pite of tho<U+017F>e that look upon her: her rufled hair, her foul and naked arme, and her pittifull petticoat, tucked up higher then her ugly knee: I believe, and <U+017F>o would any that <U+017F>he was going to conjure. But <U+017F>ee here the <U+017F>trange effects of Beauty. This old Hag, with one hip in her grave, with her little, lean, wrinckled, and meager face, and hair as gray as old age could make it; <U+017F>he is not a<U+017F>hamed to fall in love with this young and lovely Lad: If there be any <U+017F>ympathy in Love, as they <U+017F>ay there is, I wonder where it could be betwixt <hi>Damon</hi> and her; look what an exta<U+017F>y <U+017F>he is in, how <U+017F>he lifts up her hoary head, and withered hands, and intending to <U+017F>mile makes a mi<U+017F>erable mouth: But be <U+017F>he as ugly as <U+017F>he is, <U+017F>he intends to love and court this Shepheard. Then lift up your eyes a little higher, and <U+017F>ee how <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> in that cloud, looking upon this new Lover do <U+017F>eem as if they laughed at it. Certainly this was <U+017F>ome wager, which that little god had laid with his Mother, that he could make this wither'd <U+017F>tump be<U+017F>tir her <U+017F>elfe in Love; or if it were not upon a wager, it was to <U+017F>hew by this old hag, that dry wood burnes better and <U+017F>ooner then green; or el<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>hew his power upon this aged Monument, he would try what heat was in his Torch, with which, it <U+017F>eemes, he can in<U+017F>pire new <U+017F>oules; and, in a word, make life revive, and come out of the grave.</p>

Ob<U+017F>erve how the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tars do <U+017F>eem as if they twinkled; there is <hi>Ur<U+017F>a major,</hi> which though it have <U+017F>even and twenty <U+017F>tars belonging to it, yet the judicious workman has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented clearly unto us but twelve; and of that twelve, but <U+017F>even that <U+017F>hine clear.

as they are more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e in height, <U+017F>o in clearne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Now let us con<U+017F>ider the Story of this Picture: Look upon <hi>Mandrague</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t of a Circle, with a wand in her right hand, and an old worm-eaten book in her left, with a candle of green wax, and a pair of rotten <U+017F>pectacles on her no<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemes to mutter her mouth awry, her browes like clouds, and every action <U+017F>eemes to groan out her affection: Ob<U+017F>erve how her feet, her arms, her left <U+017F>ide is naked, being on the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide with her heart: All tho<U+017F>e phanta<U+017F>mes which you <U+017F>ee about her, are Demons and Spirits, which <U+017F>he conjures up unto her by her charms, to know of them what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould do to make <hi>Damon</hi> love her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> They tell her of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto <hi>Fortune,</hi> and that there is no better way, then to tell him, that this Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e loves another and not him; and in order to that, it is requi<U+017F>ite, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently change the vertue that is in the Fountain of Loves verity. Before you go any further, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve the art of the Drawer; <U+017F>ee the effects of <hi>Mandrague's</hi> candle in the dark, how light it is on her left <U+017F>ide, and how dark it is on the other <U+017F>ide of her face, as if it were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent complexions. Then <U+017F>ee what a difference the <U+017F>hadow of this candle makes among<U+017F>t the Demons, <U+017F>ome in darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ome in light, as <U+017F>he does turn her <U+017F>elfe. Ob<U+017F>erve again the Painters art in drawing his di<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>omethings at hand, and <U+017F>ome afar off; <hi>Mandrague</hi> here is far off at the Fountain of Loves verity. But for your better under<U+017F>tanding, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to know, that a little before, there was a fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, the Daughter of a very cunning Magician, was <U+017F>ecretly de<U+017F>perately in love with a Shepheard. Whether it was, that the charmes of Magick had no influence upon the charmes of Love, or that he was <U+017F>o attentive upon his <U+017F>tudies, that he did not minde her; but <U+017F>o it was, that after a mo<U+017F>t extream affection, and di<U+017F>dain of the Shepheard, <U+017F>he took it <U+017F>o to heart, that <U+017F>he dyed, and all her Fathers skill could not help her: At which the Magician being extreamly <U+017F>orry when he under<U+017F>tood the occa<U+017F>ion, to eternize her memory, he changed her Tombe into a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; which he called the Verity of Love, becau<U+017F>e who<U+017F>oever looked in it, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and if <U+017F>he did love him, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her and him<U+017F>elfe together; and if <U+017F>he did not love any, then <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould appear alone. And this is the vertue that <hi>Mandrague</hi> would change, to the end, that when <hi>Damon</hi> came to look into the Fountain, he might finde that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e loved another, and <U+017F>o his affection unto her might die, and <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe might po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e it. See how <U+017F>he did inchant it, what Characters <U+017F>he makes about it, what Circles, what Triangles, and od Figures <U+017F>he u<U+017F>eth. Before <U+017F>he began to conjure, <U+017F>he called all her Divells about her, to her aide; yet Love being <U+017F>tronger then all they, they dur<U+017F>t not attempt any thing again<U+017F>t him, only coun<U+017F>elled her, to betray the<U+017F>e two faithfull Lovers, and to forbear that qualitie for a certain time. Now <U+017F>ince the vertue of this Fountain did <U+017F>u<U+017F>t come unto it by a Magician; <hi>Mandrague,</hi> who excelled all her Predece<U+017F>sors in that Science, might ea<U+017F>ily obtain that reque<U+017F>t. But let us pa<U+017F><U+017F>e to the next Picture.</p>

                  <head>The fift Picture.</head>
                  <p>THis Piece contains two actions: The fir<U+017F>t is <hi>Damon,</hi> when he came unto this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to be <U+017F>atisfied in tho<U+017F>e doubts into which an angry Dream had put him. The other, when being deceived by the art of <hi>Mandrague,</hi> and <U+017F>aw that the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune</hi> loved another, in de<U+017F>pair, he killed him<U+017F>elfe. Now let us <U+017F>ee how the<U+017F>e things are repre<U+017F>ented: See <hi>Damon</hi> there with his Faulchion, for he was in his hunting equipage; ob<U+017F>erve how his Dog followes him, look how that ob<U+017F>ervant Animal eye's his Ma<U+017F>ter; for whil<U+017F>t he looked in the Fountain, the Dog fixed his eye upon him, as if he were de<U+017F>irous to know what it was which <U+017F>o amazed him. <hi>Mandrague</hi> had in a dream let him <U+017F>ee <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radon,</hi> a young Shepheard, who taking one of <hi>Cupid's</hi> Arrowes, opened <hi>Fortune's</hi> brea<U+017F>t, and took away her heart. <hi>Damon,</hi> as all Lovers are, being in much doubt, as <U+017F>oon as ever he waked, got up, and went to the Fountain, to <U+017F>ee whether his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>till loved him. I be<U+017F>eech you ob<U+017F>erve very well his amazement, if you compare his face which is in all the other three Pictures, with this, you <U+017F>hall finde a <U+017F>trange alteration. Tho<U+017F>e two faces which you <U+017F>ee in the Fountain, is the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune's,</hi> and the other the Shepheard <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radon's,</hi> which the Witch cau<U+017F>ed to be repre<U+017F>ented rather then the other: and <U+017F>o <hi>Damon</hi> believed his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e loved <hi>Maradon,</hi> which beliefe made him re<U+017F>olve upon death. Do you <U+017F>ee how the water <U+017F>eemes to tremble, that is cau<U+017F>ed by poor <hi>Damon's</hi> tears, that had dropped into it. But let us pa<U+017F>s on to the <U+017F>econd Action: The dead man whom you <U+017F>ee lying upon the ground, is poor <hi>Damon,</hi> who being de<U+017F>perate, killed him<U+017F>elf with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53526:95"/>
his Falchion. His action is very naturally done, with one Arm engaged under his body, being <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with the <U+017F>uddenne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the fall, and having no <U+017F>trength to recover him<U+017F>elf; his head hanging over his right <U+017F>houlder, his eyes half <U+017F>hut, and half turned upwards; his mouth open, his teeth apparent, and <U+017F>o all <U+017F>ignes of a <U+017F>udden death: A man quite dead is not repre<U+017F>ented, but a man betwixt life and death, as if there were a medium. Look how the blood is running out of his wound; I do not think you ever <U+017F>aw any thing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repre<U+017F>ented. But let us <U+017F>ee what is in the other peece.</p>

                  <p>NOw be pleas'd to look upon the <U+017F>ixth and la<U+017F>t Peece; which containes four actions of the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune:</hi> The fir<U+017F>t is a Dream which <hi>Mandrague</hi> cau<U+017F>ed her to have; The other, how <U+017F>he went unto the Fountain to clear her doubts: The third, how <U+017F>he complains again<U+017F>t the Incon<U+017F>tancy of her Shepheard: And the la<U+017F>t is, how <U+017F>he dies, which is the conclu<U+017F>ion of this Tragedy. Let us look upon all the<U+017F>e particulars: Look upon the Ri<U+017F>ing of the Sun, ob<U+017F>erve how long the <U+017F>hadows are; how the sky is not <U+017F>o clear on the one <U+017F>ide; <U+017F>ee how clouds and mi<U+017F>ts are expelled; and how tho<U+017F>e little Birds do dre<U+017F><U+017F>e and prune them<U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t its approach. Pa<U+017F><U+017F>e your eye a little further, and <U+017F>ee the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune</hi> a<U+017F>leep in her bed and how the Sun <U+017F>hines through the window upon her naked brea<U+017F>t: Al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>leeve of her <U+017F>mock being loo<U+017F>e, the beauty of her Arm as high as the Elbow is to be <U+017F>een. See how the <hi>Daemons</hi> of <hi>Morpheus</hi> doe hover about her; all which are <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervants unto <hi>Mandrague,</hi> and in<U+017F>pire her with a minde to goe unto the Fountain of Loves verity; which accordingly <U+017F>hee did, having dreamed that her Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard was dead; and therefore <U+017F>hee came to the Fountaine of Loves verity, to know the truth: She had no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t her eye upon the water, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Damon;</hi> but, ala<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw by him the Shephearde<U+017F>s <hi>Melinde,</hi> a fair Shephearde<U+017F>s, and one who was never <U+017F>u<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to love <hi>Damon:</hi> yet, though hee neither did love her, <U+017F>hee was by this Sorcery to appear: See how <hi>Fortune</hi> bewails the accident in the very <U+017F>ame place, where <hi>Damon</hi> was almo<U+017F>t dead. Behold how <U+017F>adly <U+017F>he <U+017F>its again<U+017F>t yonder Rock; her arms cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed upon her brea<U+017F>t: It <U+017F>eems as if <U+017F>he <U+017F>ighed, and her heart panted, her eyes looking up to heaven, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge upon the Per<U+017F>idie which <U+017F>hee beleeves <hi>Damon</hi> to bee guilty of; and becau<U+017F>e her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was extream, <U+017F>he complained again<U+017F>t him in a very loud tone: And <hi>Damon,</hi> who you <U+017F>ee near her, though hee was at the la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>p, yet hearing the lamentation of his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F>s, and knowing her voice, did call unto her. She hearing a faint hollow voice, went towards him. Oh heavens! how the <U+017F>ight of him did amu<U+017F>e her? and forgetting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of her comming thither, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him in that condition, <U+017F>he asked who had u<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o: It is, <U+017F>aid hee unto her, the change of my fortune: It is your Incon<U+017F>tancy which hath deceived me with a <U+017F>hew of affection. To be brief, it is the happine<U+017F>s of <hi>Maradon,</hi> whom I <U+017F>aw in the Fountain next you; and doe you thinke it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould live and <U+017F>ee you love another? <hi>Fortune</hi> hearing this, Oh <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee, this Fountain is an errant Lyar; for it hath al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hewed me <hi>Belinde</hi> next you, whom I <U+017F>ee dying for the love of me. Thus the<U+017F>e two Lovers found out the fal<U+017F>ity of this Fountain, and being more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured than ever of each others affection, they dyed in each others Armes; <hi>Damon</hi> of his wound, and <hi>Fortune</hi> for griefe of his death. Behold there the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>itting again<U+017F>t a ma<U+017F><U+017F>ie Rock, and <hi>Damon</hi> leaning his head in her lap, taking his la<U+017F>t farewel, and bidding her, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu.

That old hagg which is next them, is <hi>Mandrague</hi> the Witch, who finding them both dead, cur<U+017F>ed her Art, hated all her <hi>Daemons,</hi> tore her hair, and extreamly grieved at the death of the<U+017F>e two faithful Lovers, and her own contentment. Look a little further off, and <U+017F>ee how <hi>Cupid</hi> weeps, his Bow and Arrows broken, his Torch extingui<U+017F>hed, and his eyes <U+017F>wimming in teares for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e two faithfull Lovers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celadon</hi> was all this while very attentive unto the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> and often blamed him<U+017F>elf for want of courage in not u<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ame remedy <hi>Damon</hi> did. And becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations made him very mute, <hi>Galathea</hi> taking <hi>Celadon</hi> by the hand, and going out of the Grotte, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him; What doe you think, <hi>Celadon,</hi> of the effects of Love? I doe think, <U+017F>aid he, that the effects of Love are <U+017F>implicity and folly: And it is a popular errour, wherewith every one is apt to cover their ignorance or excu<U+017F>e their faults, alwaies to attribute tho<U+017F>e effects unto <U+017F>ome Divinity, when they do not know

Then the <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia</hi> replyed unto him, <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I have <U+017F>een you in a place where all in it have thought you not <U+017F>o ignorant in matters of Love. Fair Nymph, an<U+017F>wered hee, in what place <U+017F>oever that was, there was much beauty in it, if you were there: but as too great a fire rather burns than warms, <U+017F>o your beauties are too high for our Ru<U+017F>tique hearts; for they do rather make us admire than love, and adore rather than <U+017F>erve. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es as this, all this faire company went homeward, where Dinner waited for them.</p>
                  <p>As <U+017F>oon as day did break, <hi>Leonida,</hi> according as it was re<U+017F>olved upon over night by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas,</hi> her companion, and <hi>Celadon;</hi> did come unto the Shepheards chamber, to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e him in tho<U+017F>e clothes which her Uncle had brought. But the little <hi>Merill,</hi> who by <hi>Galathea</hi>'s command did alwayes <U+017F>tay with <hi>Celadon,</hi> as well to be a <U+017F>pye over the actions of <hi>Leonida,</hi> as to wait upon the Shepheard, did a long while hinder their de<U+017F>ign. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e or other that was made in the Court, made <hi>Meril</hi> run out to <U+017F>ee what the matter was. Then <hi>Celadon</hi> did ri<U+017F>e immediatly, and the Nymph (<U+017F>ee what love will doe) did help to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e him for without her hee knew not how to put his clothes on hand<U+017F>omly. Pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Meril</hi> returnes, yet <hi>Celadon</hi> hearing him, went into a Wardrobe, and hee was no <U+017F>ooner entred but <hi>Meril</hi> asked where <hi>Celadon</hi> was? He is in the Wardrobe, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, and will come out pre<U+017F>ently, what would<U+017F>t thou have with him? I would tell him, <U+017F>ayd the boy, that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> is coming hither. <hi>Leonida</hi> was a little <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>he could not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h what <U+017F>he had begun; yet that <U+017F>he might goe and give <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>ome coun<U+017F>el <U+017F>he <U+017F>ayd unto <hi>Meril,</hi> Go little <hi>Meril,</hi> run and acquaint thy Lady, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed: The Boy ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could, and <hi>Celadon</hi> came out laughing at the news: Oh why do you laugh, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, her comming will hinder your going out? Come, come, <U+017F>aid hee, make ha<U+017F>te and dre<U+017F><U+017F>e me; for among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many Nymphs I <U+017F>hall the more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>teal away. But whil<U+017F>t they were very bu<U+017F>ie at their work, <hi>Galathea</hi> entred, and upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden, that <hi>Celadon</hi> could not get into the Clo<U+017F>et. You may well imagine how both <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> were <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this accident: Yet the crafty <hi>Leonida</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Galathea</hi> enter, <U+017F>he held <hi>Celadon,</hi> and would not let him hide him<U+017F>elf but turning towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming much troubled Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if you doe not u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome means that my Lady come not hither, we are all undone; for my part I am doing what I can to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e <hi>Celadon</hi> in a womans habit, but I am afraid I <U+017F>hall not have time enough.
<hi>Galathea,</hi> who knew not at the fir<U+017F>t what to think of this <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is,</hi> did much commend this witty invention of <hi>Leonida's,</hi> and when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>o well di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> Friend, but for you we had been all undone; for we could never have hidden <hi>Celadon</hi> among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many Nymphs as will come with <hi>Ama<U+017F>is;</hi> but now wee are well enough, and may <U+017F>afely <U+017F>hew him unto all your companions, who will take him for a woman. Thus <hi>Galathea,</hi> after it was agreed upon that <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay he was Co<U+017F>en unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and called <hi>Lucinde,</hi> went out to meet her Mother. I mu<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> after <U+017F>he was gone) I was never in my life <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed as at the<U+017F>e three accidents. Fir<U+017F>t, at the coming of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is.</hi> Secondly, at <hi>Galathea</hi>'s <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing us; and thirdly, at your <U+017F>udden invention. Shepheard, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> what I do, proceeds from my de<U+017F>ires to rid you out of your pain; and I would to the gods you knew my heart, then would you find what happine<U+017F><U+017F>e I wi<U+017F>h you. By way of gratitude for <U+017F>o great an obligation, <U+017F>aid the Shepheard, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but tender you my life, <U+017F>ince you have pre<U+017F>erved it. Thus they talked till <hi>Meril</hi> came into the Chamber, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Celadon</hi> almo<U+017F>t dre<U+017F>t, hee was ravi<U+017F>hed, and <U+017F>aid no live per<U+017F>on could know him; for hee that was continually with him, had he not <U+017F>een him dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, <U+017F>hould have been mi<U+017F>taken. Who told thee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that I was di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed? My Lady, <U+017F>aid he, and commanded me to <U+017F>ay your name was <hi>Lucinde,</hi> the Co<U+017F>en of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and to acquaint the <hi>Druide</hi> with it, who could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh when hee heard it, and promi<U+017F>ed to doe as my Lady commanded him. In the mean time, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was come out of her Coach, and met <hi>Galathea</hi> at the <U+017F>tairs foot, with <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Adamas.</hi> Daughter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, me-thinks you have been too long in <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and I am come to di<U+017F>order you a little. The good news I have received from <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
does <U+017F>o rejoyce mee, that I cannot contain my joyes alone, and therefore I am come to make you a participant with me, and would have you goe with me

unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where Bonefires <U+017F>hall be made through every <U+017F>treet. I doe much rejoice at your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> and wi<U+017F>h it may continue eternally: But truly, Madam, this place plea<U+017F>eth me <U+017F>o well, that I have no de<U+017F>iring Genius to leave it. No more you <U+017F>hall long, replyed <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> but becau<U+017F>e I will not goe thither untill night, let us walke together, and I will acquaint you with the news I have received. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> made a low reverence, and <U+017F>aid, Certainly, Madam, your news is very good, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>tirring <U+017F>o early to impart it unto your Daughter. I have received it (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee) two or three daies <U+017F>ince, but found that I could not enjoy the contentment of it alone, and truly the news de<U+017F>erves to be divulged. Thus they talked until they came into the Garden: when as they began to walk, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> took <hi>Galathea</hi> on one <U+017F>ide, and <hi>Adamas</hi> on the other, and then <U+017F>he proceeded thus.</p>

               <p>Con<U+017F>idering the <U+017F>trange variety of accidents which are cau<U+017F>ed by Love, me-thinkes it mu<U+017F>t needs be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that the Wheel of Love does turn about as fa<U+017F>t as the Wheel of Fortune, and that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion cau<U+017F>eth as many changes and alterations in humane affairs; as any thing el<U+017F>e. The examples of the<U+017F>e are <U+017F>o frequently before our eyes, that it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to in<U+017F>tance them: And yet when you have heard this which I intend to relate, you will confe<U+017F>s you never heard of any more remarkable. It is known unto you, how <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> by hazard and Lot became a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> and how <hi>Guyemant</hi> in bringing a Letter unto her from his Brother fell in love with her. And <U+017F>ince that, I believe you are not ignorant of their de<U+017F>ign in departing both together to goe unto <hi>Merovea:</hi> Nor how I <U+017F>ent a great number of the young Cavalrie under the conduct of <hi>Lindamor</hi> after them: But I beleeve, you do not know what they have done <U+017F>ince they went. And therefore I do at this time intend to make a relation of their voyage unto you, for it is worthy of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Clidaman</hi> came unto the Army, <hi>Guyemant</hi> who was known, brought him to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e the hands of <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi> under the notion of a young Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, de<U+017F>cended from a noble Family, who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>erve them. Hee was received with open Armes, e<U+017F>pecially coming at a time when the enemy did menace them with a Battle. But when <hi>Lindamor</hi> came, and it was known who <hi>Clidaman</hi> was, he was honoured and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; for he had already <U+017F>o <U+017F>ignalized him<U+017F>elf, that both friends and enemies did know and e<U+017F>teem him. Among<U+017F>t other Pri<U+017F>oners which he and <hi>Guyemant</hi> took (for they alwayes went out together in any enterpri<U+017F>e) there was one among<U+017F>t them that came out of <hi>Great Britane,</hi> <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, but <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad, that he moved <hi>Clidaman</hi> to pitty him. And becau<U+017F>e his impri<U+017F>onment made him <U+017F>eem extreamly <U+017F>ad, one day he <U+017F>ent for him; and after he had asked him <U+017F>everal que<U+017F>tions of his Being and Quality, he asked him the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, telling him that if it did proceed from his impri<U+017F>onment, hee ought like a man of courage to endure it, and thank the heavens that he fell into their hands, <U+017F>ince he was in a place where he had all civil treatment, and that his want of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeded onely from the command of <hi>Merovea,</hi> who had charged that no pri<U+017F>oners <U+017F>hould yet be ran<U+017F>omed, yet hee would doe his be<U+017F>t endeavour to procure him his liberty. The young man thanked him, but it was with a deep <U+017F>igh; which <hi>Clidaman</hi> more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at, did aske him the cau<U+017F>e. Unto which he an<U+017F>wered; Sir, this <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e which you <U+017F>ee in my face, and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ighs which <U+017F>o often <U+017F>teal from my brea<U+017F>t, doe not proceed from my impri<U+017F>onment which you <U+017F>peak of, but from another more <U+017F>trict than it; for my ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome will ere long di<U+017F>oblige me from this, but nothing le<U+017F><U+017F>e than death can bring me out of the other. I <U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o endure it with patience did I not fore<U+017F>ee my own death, and the ruin of the per<U+017F>on who keeps me <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e in pri<U+017F>on. <hi>Clidaman</hi> did by his <U+017F>peech ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was Love which troubled him, and by him<U+017F>elfe con<U+017F>idering the pain of his pri<U+017F>oner, his pitty moved him to promi<U+017F>e him that he would procure his liberty as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, knowing by experience what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and perplexities of mind u<U+017F>eth to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them that are deeply in love. Sir, <U+017F>aid hee unto him, <U+017F>ince you know the power of Love, and that your noble Country makes mee beleeve, that what knowledge <U+017F>oever you have of mee, you will not alter your good will unto mee; therefore upon a promi<U+017F>e not to di<U+017F>cover mee, I will tell you a thing which will make you wonder.

but Love, that is able to metamorphi<U+017F>e women into men, hath made me a<U+017F><U+017F>ume this dre<U+017F><U+017F>e; for I am not a man, but a woman, one that is de<U+017F>cended from as good a Family as any is in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and my name is <hi>Melandre,</hi> who, conducted by <U+017F>trange fortune, is fallen into your hands. There was a man who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Lydias,</hi> that fled out of his own Country, and came to <hi>London,</hi> having killed a man in Duell, and, to avoid the rigour of the Law, was forced to for<U+017F>ake his Country. Being in <hi>London,</hi> as it is the cu<U+017F>tom of our Nation, he found <U+017F>o much civility and courte<U+017F>y, that there was not a hou<U+017F>e of any noble note, where he was not familiar; and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, he was as free to my Fathers hou<U+017F>e, as he could be unto his own. Now becau<U+017F>e he intended to <U+017F>tay there, untill he could <U+017F>afely return into his own Country, he intended (the better to conform him<U+017F>elfe unto the Briti<U+017F>h humour, where every one has a particular Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e) to <U+017F>eem as if he were in Love: And in this re<U+017F>olution, (I cannot tell whether good or bad) he fixed his eyes upon me; and either out of affection or convenience, he began to profe<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe my <U+017F>ervant. I will not tire you with a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, tho<U+017F>e court<U+017F>hips, and tho<U+017F>e oathes; that he u<U+017F>ed unto me: But <U+017F>o it was, that after a long addre<U+017F><U+017F>e of court<U+017F>hip, (for he <U+017F>tayed there two years) his hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s, his courte<U+017F>y, his di<U+017F>cretion, and his valour, had <U+017F>uch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon me, that I did love him without any di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation. I <U+017F>hould blu<U+017F>h to confe<U+017F>s thus much, did I not think you a per<U+017F>on that hath tryed the force of Love; or to tell you, that the beginning of my love was the end of my tranquillity. Things being thus, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the <hi>Franks,</hi> after they had gotten the better in <U+017F>o many Battles again<U+017F>t the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours, again<U+017F>t the <hi>Goths,</hi> and again<U+017F>t the <hi>Gaules,</hi> they turned their Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> and brought them unto <U+017F>uch termes, as they were foroed to <U+017F>end unto <hi>London,</hi> their antient Allie, to demand aid, who, according to the Alliance made between them, did grant them aid, by the con<U+017F>ent of the King and States. This newes was pre<U+017F>ently divulged throughout all the Realm, and we, who were in the chiefe City, fir<U+017F>t heard of it. <hi>Lydias</hi> began to think upon his return the very fir<U+017F>t houre, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elfe, that his Countrymen, being in need of <U+017F>uch as he, would ea<U+017F>ily ab<U+017F>olve him from the death of <hi>Arontes:</hi> Yet, becau<U+017F>e he ever promi<U+017F>ed me, that if he went, he would carry me with him, he concealed his de<U+017F>igne from me, either as intending to deceive me, or el<U+017F>e fearing I <U+017F>hould hinder his departure. Yet, as there can be no fire <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely covered, but there will be <U+017F>ome <U+017F>moak; <U+017F>o he could not <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely hide his hot de<U+017F>ire of departure, but I heard of it. A<U+017F>soon as I came to the knowledge of it, the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw him, I took him a<U+017F>ide: Well <hi>Lydias,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, are you then re<U+017F>olved I <U+017F>hall not know your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of leaving me? Do you think my affection <U+017F>o feeble, that it is not able to follow the wor<U+017F>t of your fortune? If your affairs do urge you to return into your Country, why <U+017F>hould you not let me go with you? Ask my Fathers con<U+017F>ent unto our Marriage, I am confident he will be glad of our alliance; for I know he loves you. But, <hi>Lydias,</hi> do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much, as to leave me here de<U+017F>olate behinde you; for if you do, the gods will puni<U+017F>h you. Unto all this, he faintly an<U+017F>wered, That he had no thought of returning, but that he valued his pre<U+017F>ence with me above all affairs, and that I did him wrong to doubt of it; but his actions <U+017F>hould force me to confe<U+017F>s it. Yet, for all the<U+017F>e fair words, this perjur'd man went away within two or three daies after, with the fir<U+017F>t Forces that went out of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and took his time <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>tly, that he came to the Sea-<U+017F>ide ju<U+017F>t as they were Embarquing them<U+017F>elves, and <U+017F>o he Embarqued with them. We were pre<U+017F>ently adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ed of his departure; yet, I was <U+017F>o per<U+017F>waded that he loved me, as I was the la<U+017F>t that did believe it, <U+017F>o as he was gone eight daies before I could ever believe, that a man <U+017F>o well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cended as he was, could be <U+017F>uch a deluder and ungratefull man: but at la<U+017F>t, many daies being pa<U+017F>t, and I never <U+017F>eeing nor hearing of him, I began to think my <U+017F>elfe deceived, and that he was really gone. You may well imagine I was much troubled at it, when falling <U+017F>ick upon it, I was in <U+017F>uch a condition, as the Phy<U+017F>icians not knowing my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, gave me over for dead: But Love having a minde to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elfe a better Doctor than <hi>Ae<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> did cure me by a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange Antidote; and <U+017F>ee how contrary his effects are unto our re<U+017F>olutions. When I knew of the flight of <hi>Lydias,</hi> for <U+017F>o it may be called, I found my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o offended, that after a thou<U+017F>and invocations of the gods, as witne<U+017F>ses of his perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I <U+017F>wore, that I would never love him, as often as he <U+017F>wore that he would love me; <U+017F>o as it may be <U+017F>aid, both of us were perjured; for when my hatred was in the height of fury, a Ship coming in from <hi>Calice,</hi> to bring newes of the Armies happy landing, I heard, that <hi>Lydias</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over, with intention, to fight under the Banners of the Britti<U+017F>h Forces; but as <U+017F>oon as the Governour of that place, who was a Cozen unto <hi>Arontes,</hi> was adverti<U+017F>ed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53526:97"/>
of it, he did impri<U+017F>on him, as being already a per<U+017F>on condemned, and that he was quite undone; for the Governour had very great credit among<U+017F>t the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians.</hi> That indeed there was a way to <U+017F>ave him, but it was <U+017F>o difficult, that none dur<U+017F>t attempt it; and it was this: As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lydias</hi> was <U+017F>eized upon, he asked the Governour the rea<U+017F>on, why a Cavalier of <U+017F>o great a reputation as he was, would not rather revenge his quarrells by the way of Arms, rather then by the way of Ju<U+017F>tice? For, it is not the cu<U+017F>tome of the <hi>Gaules</hi> to have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e unto Ju<U+017F>tice, but unto Combat, in points of honour; and <U+017F>uch as do not <U+017F>o, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted cowards and di<U+017F>honourable. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> for <U+017F>o was the Governours name, did an<U+017F>wer him, that were he not already condemned by Ju<U+017F>tice, he would try it with him by Arms; but it being a di<U+017F>honour to him, to fight with a man that was dead in the Law, if he had any friend that would undertake the Quarell for him, he would fight with him upon this <U+017F>core, that if he were overcome, he would <U+017F>et him at liberty; and if not, then Ju<U+017F>tice <U+017F>hould have its cour<U+017F>e: And that his kindred or friends might have the more time to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, he would keep him a month in his power; if none came to pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves in that time, then he <U+017F>hould be delivered up to be puni<U+017F>hed according to his merits. And that no advantage might be on either <U+017F>ide, the Combat <U+017F>hould be with Sword and Dagger in their <U+017F>hirts. Now <hi>Lypandas,</hi> being reputed one of the valiante<U+017F>t men of all <hi>Neu<U+017F>tria,</hi> there was none <U+017F>o <U+017F>tout as to undertake this Combat: al<U+017F>o the friends of <hi>Lydias</hi> not being adverti<U+017F>ed of it, they could not do him this good office. Oh Sir, what <U+017F>trange apprehen<U+017F>ions had I, when I heard this newes? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I was never in all my life <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed in my thoughts, no, not when this perfidious man left me. But though I knew, waves do beat in vain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t a <U+017F>turdy Rock, yet, I mu<U+017F>t pay the tribute due unto Love, and arme my <U+017F>elfe in this quarrell, though it did co<U+017F>t me both honour and life: And after I had long, but in vain, lamented the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of the unfaithfull <hi>Lydias;</hi> at la<U+017F>t, I mu<U+017F>t think upon his pre<U+017F>ervation And in order to that, being tran<U+017F>ported with this new Fury, or rather, this old Love newly revived, I re<U+017F>olved to go unto <hi>Calice,</hi> and advi<U+017F>e with the kindred and friends of <hi>Lydias</hi> about it. Then taking order, as <U+017F>ecretly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, for my voyage, one night I <U+017F>tole away in this habit you now <U+017F>ee me have; but <U+017F>o bad was my luck, that I tarried above a formight for a <U+017F>hip The heavens know what became of Parents when they heard of my departure, for I never heard of them <U+017F>ince: great is my fear, that my Father's old age will never brook this cro<U+017F><U+017F>e; for he loved me as tenderly as him<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>o as I have <U+017F>ince wondred a hundred times, I <U+017F>hould ever undertake this voyage: but, the truth is, it was Love, not me, that was the cau<U+017F>e. But to return to our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, after I had waited above fifteen daies for a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, at the la<U+017F>t I met with a <U+017F>hip which went for <hi>Calice,</hi> when there was not above five or <U+017F>ix daies of <hi>Lydias</hi> his tearm to expire. I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea-<U+017F>ick, as I was forced to keep my bed two daies; <U+017F>o as there was but a very little time left, to con<U+017F>ult with the friends of <hi>Lydias,</hi> not knowing where to finde one of them, nor where they dwelt. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how this did trouble me, <U+017F>o as I thought my <U+017F>elfe rather come to <U+017F>ee him die, than any way to help him to live. Oh ye gods! how will ye di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of us? Tears did night and day flow from my eyes. At the la<U+017F>t, the very day before the expiration of the tearm, being re<U+017F>olved to die with <hi>Lydias,</hi> or before him, I re<U+017F>olved to enter into Combat with <hi>Lypandas.</hi> What a re<U+017F>olution, or rather de<U+017F>pair, was this? I had never handled a <U+017F>word in my life, nor did well know in which hand I <U+017F>hould hold the <U+017F>word, and in which the dagger; yet was I fully re<U+017F>olved to enter the Li<U+017F>ts again<U+017F>t a Cavalier, who<U+017F>e profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion was fighting, and had gotten the title of Brave and Stout: But all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations were nothing unto me, who was re<U+017F>olved to die before him, whom I loved above my life; and though I knew that I could not <U+017F>ave him, yet was it <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction to me, that I <U+017F>hould give <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timony of my affection. One thing did exceedingly trouble me, which I endeavoured to avoid, which was, that if I <U+017F>hould be known unto <hi>Lydias,</hi> this would hinder my de<U+017F>igne, for we were to fight without Armour; which to remedy, I writ a note unto <hi>Lypandas,</hi> by way of challenge, and de<U+017F>ired him, that <U+017F>ince we were both of us <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> it would be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome, if we u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch Armes as Cavaliers do, and not to fight naked like de<U+017F>perate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. To which he an<U+017F>wered, That in the morning he would be in the field, and that I <U+017F>hould come Armed, as he would; yet, it <U+017F>hould be in his choice which way they <U+017F>hould fight. The next morning I pre<U+017F>ented my <U+017F>elfe in the field, armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> but <U+017F>o loaded, that I could hardly <U+017F>tir; tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>tagger, did think it either fear of fighting, or weakne<U+017F>s, as indeed it was. Pre<U+017F>ently I <U+017F>aw <hi>Lypandas</hi> come prancing, as if he would kill me with his looks; but I was not a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, untill <hi>Lydias</hi> was brought upon a Scaffold, to <U+017F>ee the fight. I did <U+017F>o extreamly pitty him when I <U+017F>aw him in that condition, as I <U+017F>tood
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53526:98"/>
<U+017F>tock <U+017F>till a great while, and could not <U+017F>tir: At la<U+017F>t, the Judges carried me unto him, to know, whether he would accept of me for his Champion. He asked me who I was? Then counterfeiting my voice as well as I could, I <U+017F>aid unto him, Let it <U+017F>atisfie you, <hi>Lydias,</hi> that I am the onely One that will undertake this Combat for you. Since it is <U+017F>o, replyed he certainly you are a per<U+017F>on of great valour, and therefore I do accept of you. So when I was going away, he <U+017F>aid unto me, Cavalier, be confident, that your quarrel is mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t. Then I retired, with <U+017F>uch full re<U+017F>olution for death, that I <U+017F>tayed for nothing but the <U+017F>ound of the Trumpet, to <U+017F>ummon us unto the Combat. Upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ound, I <U+017F>et out but my Hor<U+017F>e did <U+017F>o jog me, that in lieu of carrying my Lance as I <U+017F>hould have done, I let it fall which way fortune would, and it fell <U+017F>o luckily upon my Hor<U+017F>es neck, that in lieu of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lypandas,</hi> it ran his Hor<U+017F>e into the body, who being wounded ran pre<U+017F>ently away in <U+017F>pite of his Ma<U+017F>ter and fell dead under him. <hi>Lypandas</hi> was <U+017F>o over-eager of doing bravely, that he mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed his blow. As for me, my Hor<U+017F>e ran even whither he plea<U+017F>ed; for I had enough to do in holding me by the Pommel, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould fall. And hearing <hi>Lypandas</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me turn again, and upbraiding me for killing his Hor<U+017F>e, I turned my hor<U+017F>e back, after I had got my <U+017F>word in my hand, as well as I could though with much ado: But my Hor<U+017F>e, a<U+017F>soon as he was turned having more courage then his Rider, began of him<U+017F>elfe to gallop, and ran furiou<U+017F>ly upon <hi>Lypandas;</hi> and he <U+017F>tepping a<U+017F>ide, ran his <U+017F>word into my Hor<U+017F>es body as he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, and pre<U+017F>ently I perceived him to <U+017F>hrink under me; and having lo<U+017F>t my <U+017F>tirrups, he fell under me, and <U+017F>o far off <hi>Lypandas,</hi> that I had time enough to get out of the Saddle, and recover my <U+017F>elfe from my Hor<U+017F>e: Then came <hi>Lypandas</hi> towards me, with his <U+017F>word up ready to <U+017F>trike at me: and I mu<U+017F>t tell you that had not Love born up my Armes better then my <U+017F>elfe did, he had di<U+017F>patched me; but <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly make his blow at my head, Nature had taught me to hold up my left arme, for otherwi<U+017F>e, I had never remembred my buckler that was upon it; but his blow upon it was with <U+017F>uch fury, as it <U+017F>truck it again<U+017F>t my face, and made my eyes to <U+017F>parkle. When he <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>tagger, he offered another blow more heavie then the fir<U+017F>t; but <U+017F>uch was my fortune, that holding up my <U+017F>word, his and mine cla<U+017F>hed together: and both of them broke. <hi>Lypandas</hi> <U+017F>eeing both of us upon the <U+017F>ame advantages, did <U+017F>ay unto me, The<U+017F>e Armes are equally favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto us, I will try whether others will do the like, and therefore let us ca<U+017F>t off our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Armour, and fight in our <U+017F>hirts, for I will have the Combat <U+017F>o decided. Cavalier, <U+017F>aid I unto him, by what is pa<U+017F>t, you may <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elfe in the wrong; our quarrell is not mortall, therefore relea<U+017F>e <hi>Lydias,</hi> and let the Combat alone. No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lypandas</hi> in a rage, both <hi>Lydias</hi> and you <U+017F>hall die. Then I will try, <U+017F>aid I, whether I can retort that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon your own head. Then getting as far off <hi>Lydias</hi> as I could, for fear of being known, I put off my Armour, with the help of tho<U+017F>e who brought us two other <U+017F>words and daggers. And when my doublet was off, I took a <U+017F>word and a dagger, and went into the middle of the Li<U+017F>ts: I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that I had much ado to hide my brea<U+017F>ts; for my <U+017F>hirt, do what I could, did not <U+017F>o hide them, but the fulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my Papps were palpable to be <U+017F>een; but that was the farthe<U+017F>t off every ones imagination and as for <hi>Lydias,</hi> he could not know me; for being in mans habit, and the weight of my Armour having put me in o a very high colour, I was much altered. At la<U+017F>t <hi>Lypandas</hi> and I were within ten or twelve paces one of another. Now did I look for nothing but death, being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, he would run me through at the very fir<U+017F>t pu<U+017F>h: But the fortune of <hi>Lydias</hi> was <U+017F>o good, for it was his life I only feared, that this high-minded <hi>Lypandas</hi> running extream violently at me, he chanced to <U+017F>tumble, and his head fell at my feet, and at this fall he received two wounds, with his own weapons; the one with his dagger, that ran him through his right arme, and the other with his <U+017F>word, which cut him ju<U+017F>t over the eyes. As for me, I was <U+017F>o frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this fall, that I thought my <U+017F>elfe dead and him too; and therefore <U+017F>tepping back two or three paces, without doing him any hurt, I thought to vanqui<U+017F>h him more by my courte<U+017F>ie then valour, and <U+017F>aid unto him: Ri<U+017F>e <hi>Lypandas.</hi> I will not hurt you when you are down. He being much <U+017F>tunnyed with his fall at fir<U+017F>t, did afterwards ri<U+017F>e, thinking to run upon me with all the <U+017F>trength he had: but one of his wounds had blinded him, and the other took away the u<U+017F>e of his arme, <U+017F>o as he could neither <U+017F>ee nor hold his <U+017F>word: Which I perceiving, I took courage, and lifting up my <U+017F>word I ran unto him, <U+017F>aying: Yield thy <U+017F>elfe, <hi>Lypandas</hi> or el<U+017F>e thou dye<U+017F>t. Why <U+017F>hould I yield my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid he, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Combat were not <U+017F>o; let it <U+017F>uffice, I <U+017F>et <hi>Lydias</hi> at liberty. Then the Judges comming in, and <hi>Lypandas</hi> having ratified his promi<U+017F>e, they led me out of the Li<U+017F>ts in triumph: But fearing le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>ome wrong in a place, where <hi>Lypandas</hi> had all
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53526:98"/>
the power, after I had put my Armour on again, I went to <hi>Lydias,</hi> with my Helmet pulled down, and <U+017F>aid unto him: <hi>Lydias,</hi> render thanks unto the gods for my Victory; and if you de<U+017F>ire to have any di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with me, I will go unto the Town of <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I will <U+017F>tay for you fifteen daies, for after that terme, I mu<U+017F>t go about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which will carry me far from hence. You may enquire for the <U+017F>orrowfull <hi>Chavelier,</hi> for under that name and notion I pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lydias,</hi> <U+017F>hall I not now know unto whom I am <U+017F>o much obliged? No, <U+017F>aid I unto him, it will not be good neither for you nor me: And <U+017F>o I left him. Then providing my <U+017F>elfe another Hor<U+017F>e, I came to <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I <U+017F>tayed. As <U+017F>oon as I was gone, this fal<U+017F>e <hi>Lypandas</hi> did impri<U+017F>on <hi>Lydias</hi> more clo<U+017F>e than before; and when he was charged with his promi<U+017F>e unto me, he did evade it, by <U+017F>aying, That it is true, he promi<U+017F>ed me liberty, but he did not tel me when: and therefore it <U+017F>hould not be this twenty years, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e upon a condition, that I <U+017F>hould become a Pri<U+017F>oner in his room, and <U+017F>o pay the ran<U+017F>ome of his liberty with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my own. <hi>Lydias</hi> told him, that this was the height; both of ingratitude and perfidie. This did <U+017F>o offend him, that he <U+017F>wore, unle<U+017F>s I came within fifteen daies, and put my <U+017F>elfe into his hands, he would transfer him over into the hands of Ju<U+017F>tice. And when <hi>Lydias</hi> in<U+017F>tanced his perjury to him. I have long <U+017F>ince, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>worn unto the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trian</hi> Lords, to maintain Ju<U+017F>tice, and I am more obliged to keep my fir<U+017F>t oth, than my <U+017F>econd. The fir<U+017F>t day pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, &amp; I did not think much; but when I heard no newes of <hi>Lydias,</hi> I <U+017F>ent a man to enquire of him: by him I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood what <hi>Lypandas</hi> had done and the term he had <U+017F>et: And though I did fore<U+017F>ee his cruelties, yet I re<U+017F>olved to get <hi>Lydias</hi> out of his hands, nothing being <U+017F>o dear unto me, as his pre<U+017F>ervation; and by fortune, the very <U+017F>ame day you took me Pri<U+017F>oner, I was going unto him; and all the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e you <U+017F>ee in me, and tho<U+017F>e deep <U+017F>ighes you have ob<U+017F>erved to e<U+017F>cape from me, did proceed, not from your impri<U+017F>onment, (for that is <U+017F>weet unto me, compared with my expectations of the other) but they proceed from my fears, that this unworthy <hi>Lypandas</hi> will put <hi>Lydias</hi> into the hands of his enemies, who gape for his life; for of tho<U+017F>e fifteen daies that were prefixed, ten of them are already pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o as I am out of all hopes to do this good office for my poor <hi>Lydias.</hi> Upon the<U+017F>e words, her tears hindred her tongue, and <U+017F>he was forced to be <U+017F>ilent, with <U+017F>o many apparent <U+017F>ignes of <U+017F>orrow, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> was moved unto compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and to comfort her, <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous <hi>Melandre,</hi> do not let your <U+017F>pirit droop for this, but rou<U+017F>e up the genero<U+017F>ity of your <U+017F>oul: The gods, who have pre<U+017F>erved you in greater dangers, will not let you <U+017F>ink under le<U+017F><U+017F>e. You may a<U+017F>sure your <U+017F>elfe, that I will u<U+017F>e my utmo<U+017F>t power to give you your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired contentment. But <U+017F>ince I am under a Prince whom I would not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your liberty from him, and will promi<U+017F>e you, to <U+017F>olicite him with all my power. So upon the<U+017F>e fair promi<U+017F>es, he went immediately to <hi>Childerick,</hi> and be<U+017F>eeched him, he would be plea<U+017F>ed to favour him <U+017F>o far, as to mediate unto the King his Father, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of this young Pri<U+017F>oner. The young Prince, who loved my Son, and knew that his Father would be glad to oblige <hi>Clidaman,</hi> went pre<U+017F>ently to <hi>Merovea,</hi> who granted his Sons reque<U+017F>t. Then, becau<U+017F>e the time was <U+017F>hort, he went immediately unto <hi>Melandre,</hi> and having drawn her a<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>aid thus unto her. Sorrowfull <hi>Cavalier,</hi> I hope now you will change that Epithite, <U+017F>ince better fortune begins to <U+017F>hine upon you: The heavens begin now to <U+017F>mile upon you; and in te<U+017F>timony of what I <U+017F>ay, know, that now you are at liberty, and may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of your <U+017F>elfe as you plea<U+017F>e; the Prince of the <hi>Franks</hi> hath given me the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of you, and the duty of a Cavalier obliges me, not only to give you your liberty, but to offer you all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I am able. <hi>Melandre</hi> hearing this unhop't for language, did leap up for joy, and ca<U+017F>ting her <U+017F>elfe at his feet, did ki<U+017F><U+017F>e them by way of gratitude: and when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that <U+017F>he was to pay no ran<U+017F>ome, which <U+017F>he could never have paid in the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of that fifteen daies: Noble Cavalier, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you do make it appear, that you do know what it is to Love, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o pittifull unto <U+017F>uch as are po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with it: I pray the heavens to make you as happy, as you are courteous and worthy of all good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Needs would <U+017F>he have gone away that very night, but <hi>Clidaman</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her, becau<U+017F>e it was dark; yet the next morning, as <U+017F>oon as day did appear, away <U+017F>he went, and never <U+017F>tayed, untill <U+017F>he came at <hi>Calice,</hi> where, by good fortune, <U+017F>he arrived the very day before the expiration of the time. She had made her comming known unto <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandas</hi> that very night, had <U+017F>he not been jealous of his perfidie, whom <U+017F>he was to deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed untill the morning, to the end, there might be more witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of the wrong he <U+017F>hould do her, in failing of his promi<U+017F>e. The day being come, and pa<U+017F>t noon, when all the principall men of the Town, to honour the Governour, came unto his hou<U+017F>e,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53526:99"/>
in comes the <U+017F>orrowfull Cavalier, and pre<U+017F>ents him<U+017F>elfe unto him: At the fir<U+017F>t, he was not known, for none had ever <U+017F>een him but in the Combat, where fear had altered his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and now every one drew neer to hear what he would <U+017F>ay. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, I come here to <U+017F>ummon you, to be as good as your promi<U+017F>e, from the friends and kindred of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias;</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e they tell you by mee, that they will publi<U+017F>h you unto the world, for a fal<U+017F>e and perfidious promi<U+017F>e-breaker. Stranger, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lypandas,</hi> go and tell them, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> is yet better then he <U+017F>hall be within the<U+017F>e few daies; for before this day be don, I will transfer him over unto <U+017F>uch hands, as will revenge my quarrell. As for my promi<U+017F>e, I think my <U+017F>elfe to be ab<U+017F>olved from it, by putting him into the hands of Ju<U+017F>tice. As for any new conditions I do in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon my fir<U+017F>t, which is, that he with whom I fought, do put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe into my hands, to the end, I may have my will of him, and relea<U+017F>e <hi>Lydias.</hi> What will you doe with him, <U+017F>aid he, when you have him? When I once have him, an<U+017F>wered he, and when I am to render you an account of my actions, then you <U+017F>hall know. Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ad Cavalier, <U+017F>end for <hi>Lydias,</hi> and him whom you de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>hall put him<U+017F>elfe into your hands. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who did extreamly de<U+017F>ire to be revenged upon his enemy, <U+017F>ent for <hi>Lydias: Lydias,</hi> who knew this to bee the la<U+017F>t day for his terme, did thinke this <U+017F>ending for, had been to transferre him over into the hands of the Law: But though hee did fore<U+017F>ee a certaine death, yet hee did rather de<U+017F>ire it, than to <U+017F>ee him who had fought in his cau<U+017F>e, in any danger. When hee came before <hi>Lypandas,</hi> he <U+017F>aid thus unto him; <hi>Lydias,</hi> this is the la<U+017F>t day that is prefixed you to bring your Champion into my hands: The young Cavalier is come hither to that end, which if he do then you are at liberty. <hi>Melander</hi> all this while did <U+017F>o turn her face from <hi>Lydias,</hi> that he could not know her and <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid thus; Yes <hi>Lypandas</hi> I have promi<U+017F>ed, and I will perform: I would you would be as punctual in all your promi<U+017F>es: But 'tis no matter, I am he whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire, and who values not any cruelty or rigour you can u<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t me, <U+017F>o my friend here may be out of his pain. Then every one fixed their eyes upon her, and remembring the actions <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed when <U+017F>he fought, they knew her to be the <U+017F>ame. Her beauty her youth, and her affection moved every heart unto pitty, but <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who being extreamly incen<U+017F>ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t her commanded her pre<U+017F>ently to pri<U+017F>on, and to let <hi>Lydias</hi> go. <hi>Lydias</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf <U+017F>o infinitely obliged, would not <U+017F>uffer it, but <hi>Melander</hi> came to him, and <U+017F>aid in his ear, Go <hi>Lydias;</hi> as for me, I know how to get out ea<U+017F>ily when I will; Go and <U+017F>erve <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea,</hi> and particularly <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who is the procurer of your liberty; and tell him you came from me. 'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould goe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lydias,</hi> before I know who you are. I am the <U+017F>orrowfull Cavalier, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee, and that's enough, and you need know no more.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lydias</hi> went with an intention to <U+017F>erve the King of the <hi>Frankes,</hi> <U+017F>ince hee who twice <U+017F>aved his life would have it <U+017F>o: But in the mean time <hi>Lypandas</hi> did expre<U+017F>ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that <hi>Melander</hi> <U+017F>hould be well guarded, and <U+017F>hackles put upon her hands and feet, not caring if <U+017F>hee had dyed with the mi<U+017F>ery. Judge in what a <U+017F>ad condition this young woman was; her victuals were bad, her lodging mi<U+017F>erable, and all accomdations want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So as if her affection had not been <U+017F>ome comfort unto her, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>hee <U+017F>hould have lived <U+017F>o long in that mi<U+017F>ery. In the mean time it was divulged throughout all <hi>Neu<U+017F>tria,</hi> that <hi>Lydias</hi> by the procurement of a friend was relea<U+017F>ed from his impri<U+017F>onment at <hi>Callice,</hi> and was gone to <U+017F>erve the King <hi>Merovea,</hi> and thereupon was declared a Traitor of his Country. Yet he failed not to go unto <hi>Merovea's</hi> Camp, where he found out which was <hi>Clidamans</hi> Tent. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Guyemant</hi> <U+017F>aw him, they ran to him, and embraced him with abundance of love and courte<U+017F>ie, at which hee was extreamly a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed; for they took him for <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who a little before was lo<U+017F>t in the battle which they had with the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> and was <U+017F>o extreamly like him, that any one would have taken the one for the other. At the la<U+017F>t, being known to be <hi>Lydias, Melanders</hi> friend, he was recommended unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> before whom <hi>Lydias</hi> related the whole <U+017F>tory of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment, and the courte<U+017F>ie which he had received from an unknown Cavalier: Al<U+017F>o how he came by this unknown Cavaliers command to <U+017F>erve him, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Clidaman.</hi> After the King had received him, and given him thanks for his good wil unto him; <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> <U+017F>poke to him, and <U+017F>aid, Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Lydias,</hi> you <U+017F>hould not know him that has fought for you and is now in pri<U+017F>on to relea<U+017F>e you? No certainly, <U+017F>aid hee, I doe not know him. This is the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t thing I ever heard of, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> did you never <U+017F>ee any that did re<U+017F>emble him? Not that I remember, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lydias,</hi> and wondered. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> I <U+017F>hall relate unto the King a <U+017F>tory, the mo<U+017F>t worthy of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that Love ever cau<U+017F>ed:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53526:99"/>
Then he related how <hi>Lydias</hi> went into <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> the courte<U+017F>ies he received there, the affection of <hi>Melandre</hi> to him the promi<U+017F>es hee made to carry her into <hi>Neu<U+017F>tria</hi> with him when he went away, his flight, and his impri<U+017F>onment at <hi>Callais.</hi> Poor <hi>Lydias</hi> was <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to hear <U+017F>o many particulars of his life, that he knew not what to thinke: But when <hi>Clidaman</hi> related <hi>Melandres</hi> re<U+017F>olution to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume mans habit, and to <U+017F>ight a Duel with <hi>Lypandas,</hi> and all that I have formerly related, every one was ravi<U+017F>hed. Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid <hi>Lydias,</hi> is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o blind? What <U+017F>hould I doe to an<U+017F>wer this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? You can doe no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> than give that life to her which <U+017F>hee has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd. That is little, an<U+017F>wer'd he, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e accompanyed with affection. Whil<U+017F>t they were thus in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, every hearer concluded, this noble act of this Womans, de<U+017F>erved, that this great Army <U+017F>hould goe and a<U+017F><U+017F>ault <hi>Callais</hi> for her <U+017F>ake. I prote<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merovea</hi> our Army cannot be better employed than in the re<U+017F>cue of <U+017F>o virtuous a Lady. Night being come, <hi>Lydias</hi> told <hi>Clidaman,</hi> that whil<U+017F>t he was at <hi>Callais</hi> a pri<U+017F>oner, he di<U+017F>covered a weak place in the Walls of the Town, where had he but a few men, he could infallibly enter. This being reported unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> it was approved of. So <hi>Lydias</hi> had given him five hundred Archers, and three hundred Men at Armes for the execution of this enterpri<U+017F>e. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion (for I will not relate all particulars) <hi>Callais</hi> was taken, <hi>Lypandas</hi> impri<U+017F>oned, and <hi>Melandre</hi> relea<U+017F>ed out of her captivity. But, I know not how it came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, nor why, yet as <U+017F>oon as all was quiet, after the Town was taken, <hi>Lydias</hi> and <hi>Melandre</hi> went away, and it was never <U+017F>ince known what became of them. In the mean time, poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath been mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erably tormented for <hi>Lydias;</hi> for, being taken pri<U+017F>oner by the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> he was mi<U+017F>taken for <hi>Lydias,</hi> and condemned to death. <hi>Clidaman</hi> procured <hi>Merovea</hi> to <U+017F>end two Heralds at Armes, purpo<U+017F>ely to let them know that they were mi<U+017F>taken, but they would not beleeve it. Thus was <hi>Ligdamon</hi> put into a den of Lyons, where they <U+017F>ay hee did things beyond Man: but doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he had dyed among<U+017F>t them, had not a fair Lady demanded him for her Husband, which cu<U+017F>tome did at that time <U+017F>ave him, but hee dyed pre<U+017F>ently after; for hee loving <hi>Silvia,</hi> would not marry that Lady, but cho<U+017F>e death rather than her for, ju<U+017F>t upon the very Marriage, he poy<U+017F>oned him<U+017F>elfe; and <U+017F>hee al<U+017F>o, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> to be <hi>Lydias,</hi> did poy<U+017F>on her <U+017F>elfe in the <U+017F>ame Cup. Thus poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> dyed, <U+017F>o lamented by every one, that his very enemies did pitty him: But Love had a mo<U+017F>t notable way of Revenge upon <hi>Lypandas;</hi> for when hee knew <hi>Melandre</hi> to be a woman, and remembring her virtue, beauty, and affection, hee fell <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately in love with her, that the poorman had no other con<U+017F>olation but to talk of her. My Sonne <U+017F>ent me word, that he endeavoured to get his relea<U+017F>e and hoped to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Thus <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> how they live in the plenitude of Honour, and none in all the Army more e<U+017F>teemed than they. I pray heavens to continue their good fortune, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas:</hi> And whil<U+017F>t they were thus talking they <U+017F>aw <hi>Leonida, Lucinde,</hi> and the little <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> coming towards them; I <U+017F>ay <hi>Lucinde,</hi> for <U+017F>o it was agreed <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hould be called. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who knew her not asked who <U+017F>he was?

She <U+017F>eems, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> as good as fair. I doe beleeve, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> that her di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition would be very plea<U+017F>ing unto you, and if you think good <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall goe with us unto <hi>Marcelles.</hi> By this time <hi>Leonida</hi> was come <U+017F>o near that <hi>Lycinde</hi> bowed her <U+017F>elf, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with <U+017F>o good a grace, as any one living would have taken her for a woman: <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did her the honour to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her, and <U+017F>aid that any who had a relation to <hi>Adamas</hi> were as dear unto her as her own children. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> began to <U+017F>peak le<U+017F>t if the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Lucinde</hi> <U+017F>hould have an<U+017F>wered, her voice might betray her; but hee needed not to feare that; for <U+017F>hee knew <U+017F>o well how to feigne her voice, as it did rather help to deceive them. However at this time <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered <hi>Adamas</hi> to an<U+017F>wer, and after a low reverence <U+017F>hee went among<U+017F>t the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nymphs, watching her opportunity how to <U+017F>teal away. At the la<U+017F>t, Dinner time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hand, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> went into the hou<U+017F>e, where finding meat upon the Table, every one dined with a merry heart, except the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> who did mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ent the death of her dear <hi>Ligdamon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Dinner was done, <U+017F>ome of the Nymphs had a minde to play; others to view the hou<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ome to walk in the Gardens, and others to fit and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in the Chamber of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>is: Leonida</hi> <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he would make her <U+017F>elf ready for her going with <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> went out of the Chamber, and pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Lucinde</hi> followed; and then <U+017F>eeming as if they would walk, they went out of the Ca<U+017F>tle, having mo<U+017F>t of the Shepheards clothes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53526:100"/>
their Petticoats, and when they were got into the thick of the Wood, the Shepheard undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, and putting on his own cloathes, he thanked the Nymph for her good a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, offering her in exchange, his life &amp; all that did depend upon it. Then the Nymph with a deep <U+017F>igh <U+017F>aid unto him, Well, <hi>Celadon,</hi> have I not performed my promi<U+017F>e? I pray remember yours al<U+017F>o. I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>ayd <hi>Celadon,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t unworthy man that lives, if I did not perform all my promi<U+017F>es unto you. Then, <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, remember what you <U+017F>wore unto me; for I am re<U+017F>olved to put you to the Te<U+017F>t this very hour: Fair Nymph, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me as far as I am able, as freely as you can of your <U+017F>elf; for I am fully re<U+017F>olved upon obedience. Have you not made a promi<U+017F>e unto me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Nymph, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>earch into all your life pa<U+017F>t, and if I found any thing which you could doe for me, you would doe it? And he an<U+017F>wering that it was true, then <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I have done as you did bid me, and though they <U+017F>ay Love be blind yet I have <U+017F>o much light left in me, as to know that you ought to continue that love which you have <U+017F>o often promi<U+017F>ed unto your <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> for di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ts of love will not allow any one to be perjured or unfaithfull, and therefore ye ought not to fail in your duty, though they have treated you ill. The faults of others can never excu<U+017F>e or wa<U+017F>h away our own. Love therefore the fair and happy <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> with as much <U+017F>incerity of affection as ever you did: <U+017F>erve her, adore her, and more if it bee po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; for Love requires extreames in his <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But yet, I know, that the good offices which I have done you, does de<U+017F>erve <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And becau<U+017F>e Love can never be payd but with Love, you are obliged to pay mee in the <U+017F>ame coyn, if no impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities doe intervene. But <U+017F>ince one heart is not capable of any more but one love, let me be paid with what it can: And <U+017F>ince you cannot love me as your Mi<U+017F>tris, I would have you love me as your Si<U+017F>ter; and ever hereafter to love mee, cheeri<U+017F>h me, and treat me in that manner. <hi>Celadons</hi> contentment cannot be expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, after hee heard this language; for he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed it was infinitely his own de<U+017F>ire: And therefore, after he had given the Nymph a Million of thanks for her affection, hee vowed to receive her as his Si<U+017F>ter, and under that notion to doe what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hee commanded him. And <U+017F>o they parted extreamly well contented and <U+017F>atisfied one with another. <hi>Leonida</hi> returned to the Ca<U+017F>tle, &amp; the Shepheard to his voyage, <U+017F>hunning all <U+017F>uch Plains where he thought he might meet with any Shepheards of his acquaintance. And leaving Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> on the left hand, he went unto a little ri<U+017F>ing ground, from whence he could view mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e places where hee was accu<U+017F>tomed to feed his Flock, where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was wont to come unto him, and where they u<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>hade them<U+017F>elves from the <U+017F>corching Sunne in the heat of the day. Briefly, this Pro<U+017F>pect pre<U+017F>ented to his eye, all tho<U+017F>e contentments which hee had been <U+017F>o long deprived of: And in contemplation of them hee <U+017F>ate down under a <U+017F>hady tree, and <U+017F>ighed out the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es.</p>

                  <hi>Celadon</hi> having no mind to be <U+017F>een by any that could know him, when hee <U+017F>pied this Shepheard a good di<U+017F>tance off, he concealed him<U+017F>elf behinde a thick bu<U+017F>h, and when hee was pa<U+017F>t, he followed him at an un<U+017F>een di<U+017F>tance, untill he <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>it down, and then hee crept <U+017F>o neare that hee could heare all his <U+017F>ad complaints. The humour of this unknowne Shepheard <U+017F>ympathizing with his own, it <U+017F>welled him with a curio<U+017F>ity to know <U+017F>omthing from him both concerning his own Mi<U+017F>tris, and his al<U+017F>o. Therefore going to him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <U+017F>peak thus, Sad Shepheard, I doe wi<U+017F>h thee joy with all my heart, <U+017F>ince I can doe no more, I hope thou wilt take my wi<U+017F>h in good part; and in requital of my love, I pray thee tell me whether thou doe<U+017F>t know <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Phillis,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and if thou do<U+017F>t, then tell me all thou knowe<U+017F>t of them. Kinde Shepheard, an<U+017F>wered hee, thy civil language obliges me to pray, that thou may<U+017F>t never have any <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>orrows as I have: And I will freely tell thee all I doe know concerning tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons you mention, although my own grief forbids me to meddle in any other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e but my own. It is about a month or <U+017F>ix weeks, <U+017F>ince I came into this Country of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> not as many doe, to try what the Fountain of Loves verity will <U+017F>hew me; for I am but too certain of my <U+017F>ad fate; but by the commandment of the gods, who from the fertile banks of the famous <hi>Siene,</hi> <U+017F>ent mee hither with a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that I <U+017F>hould here finde a remedy again<U+017F>t my mi<U+017F>eries: And ever <U+017F>ince I came, I have taken up my lodging in <U+017F>uch Villages as <U+017F>eemed mo<U+017F>t agreeable to my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humour, with a re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>tay as long as the heavens <U+017F>hall permit me. This de<U+017F>ign hath moved me to enquire of all the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es of the<U+017F>e parts: I am able to <U+017F>atisfie you in any thing you de<U+017F>ire to know of them. All I de<U+017F>ire to know, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> is to be <U+017F>atisfied how they doe. All of them, <U+017F>aid he, are well; but they are all troubled very much at one act of blind and fickle Fortune; and that is, at the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of one <hi>Celadon</hi> (a Shepheard altogether unknown to me) who was the Brother of <hi>Lycidas:</hi> This lo<U+017F>t Shepheard was <U+017F>o loved and e<U+017F>teemed of every one, that he is generally lamented by all, e<U+017F>pecially by tho<U+017F>e three per<U+017F>ons whom you named unto me. It was conceived that this Shepheard was a devoted <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and it was the enmity of their Parents which hindered them from Marriage. How is it reported, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> this Shepheard was lo<U+017F>t? It is variou<U+017F>ly reported, an<U+017F>wered he; Some <U+017F>peake as opinion leads them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to circum<U+017F>tances and appearance; and <U+017F>ome, as others doe report: So as it is divers wayes related. As for me, I came hither into the<U+017F>e quarters the very <U+017F>ame day he was lo<U+017F>t; and I doe remember that every one was <U+017F>o affrighted at the accident, as none knew how to make a perfect relation of it. In conclu<U+017F>ion (and that is the be<U+017F>t received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis, A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> them<U+017F>elves doe <U+017F>ay it) that this Shepheard <U+017F>lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping clo<U+017F>e by the River <U+017F>ide, he fel in, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> al<U+017F>o, but her clothes did <U+017F>ave her. <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> imagining that they had prudently invented this report, to take away occa<U+017F>ion of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill upon the accident, he was very glad; for his feares alwayes were, that reports would reflect much upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>'s honour, and therefore hee asked him further; But what doe they think, <U+017F>aid he, is become of this Shepheard? That hee is dead (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>ad Shepheard) And I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> takes it <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly, that though <U+017F>hee puts the be<U+017F>t face of it <U+017F>he can, yet every one <U+017F>aies, it is almo<U+017F>t incredible, that <U+017F>hee <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much changed; however, for ought I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o fair that (except <hi>Diana</hi> hinders her) I never <U+017F>aw any fairer, except my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Cleon,</hi> and indeed they three may well be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Every one, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> will <U+017F>peake well of his own Mi<U+017F>tris; and Love has a quality, not onely to blind, but to change the eyes of Lovers; <U+017F>o as there was never any Lover that thought his Mi<U+017F>tris ugly. This, an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard, were <U+017F>omething, if I were in love with <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> or <hi>Diana;</hi> but <U+017F>ince I am ever incapable of that, I may be a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53526:101"/>
competent judge: And you who <U+017F>eem to doubt of this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es beauty, you mu<U+017F>t needs be either a <U+017F>tranger, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome ill-willer. I am neither of tho<U+017F>e two, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but truly I am the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erably afflicted Shepheard that is in the whole world. I <U+017F>hall never grant that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you except me: For if your mi<U+017F>ery proceed from any thing el<U+017F>e but Love, the pain cannot be <U+017F>o great as mine, <U+017F>ince the heart is the mo<U+017F>t ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part we have, and is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any <U+017F>orrows: And though your mi<U+017F>ery doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from love, yet it mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ubmit unto mine; for of all the mi<U+017F>eries in love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair is the mo<U+017F>t intolerable; di<U+017F>dain, anger, hatred, jealou<U+017F>ie, ab<U+017F>ence, or any thing is <U+017F>hort of death; for this pale Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e with her fatall hand, does cut away both hope and life; <U+017F>o as I the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable among<U+017F>t all men living, doe complain of a mi<U+017F>ery without any remedy or hope. <hi>Celadon</hi> an<U+017F>wered with a deep <U+017F>igh, Oh Shepheard, how much doe you erre in your opinion? I doe confe<U+017F>s that the greate<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>eries are tho<U+017F>e which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Love, of which I have had a full experience: But I cannot by any means allow that tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries which are without hope are the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ad; nor indeed doe they de<U+017F>erve to bee re<U+017F>ented; for it is a meer act of folly to weep for a thing which cannot bee help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And Love, an<U+017F>wered hee, what is that but a meer folly? I will not enter upon that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> before we have done with the other; for that alone will take up much time. But I pray tell me, Doe you lament this death out of love, or not? Certainly out of love, an<U+017F>wered he. If it be out of love, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> then I have heard <hi>Silvander,</hi> and all our learned Shepheards <U+017F>ay, that Love is nothing but a de<U+017F>ire to enjoy that beauty which you find in the per<U+017F>on loved. 'Tis very true, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger: Then, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> Will any rea<U+017F>onable man de<U+017F>ire a thing which cannot bee had? No certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis.</hi> Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> the death of <hi>Cleon</hi> ought to be the cure of all your grief; for <U+017F>ince you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ire never ought to be where there is no hope of obtaining; and that Love is nothing el<U+017F>e but a de<U+017F>ire; Death, which puts you out of all hopes to enjoy, ought by con<U+017F>equence to put you out of all de<U+017F>ire; and de<U+017F>ire being dead, all Love <U+017F>hould die with it. The <U+017F>ad Shepheard an<U+017F>wered, that what<U+017F>oever he <U+017F>aid, he was <U+017F>ure that his mi<U+017F>ery was mo<U+017F>t extream; and becau<U+017F>e he would not revive the memory of his dead <hi>Cleon,</hi> hee would not argue the matter any longer, onely thus farre hee <U+017F>aid, Shepheard, that which comes under <U+017F>ence is more certain than that which is onely in opinion: And therefore all tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons which he alleged could not convince him of that which he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of: So recommending him unto the tuition of <hi>Pan, Celadon</hi> and he parted: And Solitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable to a Lovers thoughts, <hi>Celadon</hi> went on through the Woods untill hee came to the Bridge of <hi>Boutre<U+017F><U+017F>e:</hi> and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over the River there, he was in doubt which way to wend; but this was his full re<U+017F>olution, to obey <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who had forbidden him to <U+017F>ee her, untill <U+017F>he did command him. At la<U+017F>t, being come near <hi>Bonleiu,</hi> the habitation of the cha<U+017F>t Ve<U+017F>tals, hee was a<U+017F>hamed that he had <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>hly approached that place; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intending to goe farther off, hee went into a Wood, <U+017F>o thick and boggy, that hee had much adoe to get out again. This forced him to draw nearer the River; for the thinne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was le<U+017F><U+017F>e trouble<U+017F>ome to him than the thick mud: So walking along, untill hee was weary, hee looked for a convenient place to re<U+017F>t upon, intending to keep <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e untill night that none <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him: At the la<U+017F>t, hee ca<U+017F>t his eye upon a little Cave, who<U+017F>e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on one <U+017F>ide towards the River the water had wa<U+017F>hed; and the other <U+017F>ide was <U+017F>o co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Trees and Bu<U+017F>hes, as tho<U+017F>e in the way could not <U+017F>ee it; nor had he him<U+017F>elfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of it, had hee not gone along the River <U+017F>ide. The place did <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>e him, that he re<U+017F>olved to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the re<U+017F>t of the day in it, and not to come out of this <hi>Grotto</hi> untill night: And therefore hee beganne to trim it up as well as he could, removing the Rubbi<U+017F>h which the River had brought into it. The place was nothing el<U+017F>e but a Rock, which the water beating upon, had by degrees worn away, and made a Cave, and that in <U+017F>uch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rooms, as if it were done on purpo<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>tooping a little, hee entred into a room like a Bed-chamber: the place was about <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even paces in length, and as much broad: It was about the height of a man, though in <U+017F>ome places, the points of the Rock were trouble<U+017F>ome, which the Shepheard did by degrees break off with a Flint: Hec contrived him<U+017F>elf a place like a bed, which he covered with Mo<U+017F><U+017F>e; and having fitted all things in this manner, he laid his coat, and <U+017F>uch things as troubled him, upon his bed, and then looking upon the ground, he found a Letter, which he knew to be from the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> which hee did let fall. Hee rouzed up him<U+017F>elfe, as out of a deep <U+017F>leep, and came into the entrance of the Cave, where looking upon the dear paper which he held in his hands, after a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred zealous and amorous ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, hee <U+017F>aid; Oh thou mo<U+017F>t deare paper, heretofore my great

joy, and now the occa<U+017F>ion of my mo<U+017F>t bitter <U+017F>orrowes: Upon this, opening it, the fir<U+017F>t thing that pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elfe to his eye, was <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> Character joyned with his: This did <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>hly revive the memory of his former happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as now he was reduced almo<U+017F>t unto tearms of de<U+017F>pair. Oh ye Characters, (<U+017F>aid he) too true te<U+017F>timonies of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, why are you not <U+017F>eparated from mine, to wait upon the will of my fair Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s? Time was, when you might have done me good <U+017F>ervice; but now, that <U+017F>uch fatall dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters have <U+017F>eparated us, why are you here?

               <p>The<U+017F>e few words of <hi>A<U+017F>trea's,</hi> cau<U+017F>ed abundance of mi<U+017F>ery unto <hi>Celadon;</hi> for after he had many times read them over, they did make his wounds to bleed afre<U+017F>h; for, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected into his memory one after one, all the favours that ever this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did him, which moved him unto <U+017F>o much regreet, as had not night approached, he had not <U+017F>uffered his eyes to cea<U+017F>e from crying, or his tongue from complaining, again<U+017F>t what his heart <U+017F>uffered; but darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e cau<U+017F>ed him to enter into his Cave, and being very weary with walking and grieving, he fell a<U+017F>leep. Two daies were pa<U+017F>t, before this <U+017F>ad Shepheard ever thought of eating; for he was <U+017F>o taken up with <U+017F>ad thoughts, and his mind was <U+017F>o full of melancholly, as he never thought upon any meat, but was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tempered with tears, that his eyes <U+017F>eemed two Fountains: and had he not feared offending the gods, in cau<U+017F>ing his own death, and wore, in thereby lo<U+017F>ing the Idea of his fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he had ended the cour<U+017F>e of his life; but <U+017F>eeing he was con<U+017F>trained unto it, he did vi<U+017F>it that bag of victualls which <hi>Leonida</hi> had furni<U+017F>hed him withall, which provi<U+017F>ion la<U+017F>ted him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies; for he did eat as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he could: At la<U+017F>t, he was con<U+017F>trained to have recour<U+017F>e unto roots and fallads. All the day long, if he <U+017F>aw none neer his <U+017F>olitary habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would walk upon the gravelly <U+017F>hore, and often engraved the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>orrowes upon the bark of Trees; <U+017F>ometimes he would engrave <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> Characters and his own; then upon a <U+017F>udden would he deface them, <U+017F>aying, Thou art deceived, <hi>Celadon,</hi> this is not a time for Characters: for thou art <U+017F>till con<U+017F>tant, and, to thy grief all things el<U+017F>e are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Let all tho<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies of pa<U+017F>t happine<U+017F>s alone; and if thou wilt needs be writing in Characters, engrave with them thy tears, thy <U+017F>orrowes and thy death, as mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable unto thy condition. When night came, then his <U+017F>ad thoughts came fre<U+017F>her into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for darkne<U+017F>s being more <U+017F>it for it, his imagination was the <U+017F>tronger; nor did he ever retire, unle<U+017F>s it was night and if the Moon <U+017F>hined, he would walk all night long, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>inde him<U+017F>elfe a<U+017F>leep under a tree in the morning. Thus this <U+017F>ad Shepheard, leading this di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate life, he was grown <U+017F>o pale and lean, that he was not knowable; and <U+017F>ometimes when he went unto a Fountain to drink, he would wonder to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elfe in the water; his hair was grown all into di<U+017F>order, his eyes <U+017F>hrunk, his no<U+017F>e <U+017F>harp and long, <U+017F>o as it was a wonder he <U+017F>hould live. Oh! had <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>een him in this <U+017F>ad condition, what abundance of content would it have been unto her, to <U+017F>ee by undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that <U+017F>he was perfectly loved by the mo<U+017F>t faithfull and compleat Shepheard of all <hi>Lignon.</hi>

               <p>The Moon had been twice at the full, <U+017F>ince <hi>Celadon</hi> e<U+017F>caped out of <hi>Galathea's</hi> hands; and <U+017F>till, in obedience to the commands of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he dur<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elfe unto her, but <U+017F>enlked him<U+017F>elfe in his <hi>Grotto:</hi> And though three months were compleatly pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet, the re<U+017F>entments of it were <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h in the <U+017F>oul of his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all her prudent circum<U+017F>pection was not able to conceal it, from <U+017F>uch as had any ob<U+017F>ervance over her.

no objects, but <U+017F>uch as were <U+017F>ad; which to avoid, <U+017F>he kept her <U+017F>elfe mo<U+017F>t commonly in her Cabin: But, her greate<U+017F>t affliction was, <U+017F>he was deprived of that con<U+017F>olation, which is found, even in the greate<U+017F>t misfortunes; I mean, <U+017F>he could not lay the fault upon any but her <U+017F>elf, nor could <U+017F>he find out any excu<U+017F>e to turn it another way: And certainly, it had bin ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her to have lived under <U+017F>uch a load of griefs, if the <U+017F>ociety of <hi>Diana</hi> &amp; <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> had not helped her to bear the burthen; for the pre<U+017F>ence of reall friends, is doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e one of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>overaigne remedies that griefe can receive; and the<U+017F>e two reall friends not being ignorant of it, they had <U+017F>o great a care of her, that one or both of them were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with her; they would pull her out of her Chamber by force, and carry her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mo<U+017F>t unfrequented places, for unto others they would not, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould meet with <U+017F>ome accidents, which might bring <hi>Celadon</hi> afre<U+017F>h into her memory; <U+017F>o as the<U+017F>e kinde Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es did <U+017F>weeten many an houre, and <U+017F>tole many a bitter minute from <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>

                  <hi>Silvander</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, under pretence of a faigned addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <hi>Diana,</hi> did fall <U+017F>o extreamly in reall love with her, as he hath been an excellent example unto all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and, at his own expences taught them this Doctrine, that Love will not be jea<U+017F>ted withall. He findes now <U+017F>o many compul<U+017F>ive cau<U+017F>es of love in that Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires he <U+017F>hould be acquainted with her <U+017F>o long, and love her no <U+017F>ooner: And though this task of court<U+017F>hip which he had undertaken, was the Origen of his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; yet, he made no complaint, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> without any offence, allowed him liberty to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <U+017F>uch was the violence of his love, that if it had not been allowed <U+017F>ome vent, it would have broke him, and he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have lived without it. When he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted with him<U+017F>elfe, he plainly <U+017F>aw, that he had made a di<U+017F>advantageous change, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he remembered how happy he was, an ab<U+017F>olute Ma<U+017F>ter of him<U+017F>elfe; oft did he mu<U+017F>ter up all his arguments drawn from rea<U+017F>on, to rid him<U+017F>elfe from this new <U+017F>ervitude; and when he found that rea<U+017F>on was too weak to do it, he would arme him<U+017F>elfe with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent re<U+017F>olutions again<U+017F>t it. But alas! look how oft he tryed all the<U+017F>e waies <U+017F>o oft did he <U+017F>ee, that it is in vain for any man to <U+017F>trive agan<U+017F>t the ordinances of heaven; and that who<U+017F>o is wi<U+017F>e, will rather comply and <U+017F>ubmit his will thereunto. And therefore every morning and night, when civility denyed him <hi>Diana's</hi> company, he u<U+017F>ed to retire him<U+017F>elfe from all manner of company, as well, becau<U+017F>e all the world without her was irk<U+017F>ome unto him, as to con<U+017F>ult more freely with him<U+017F>elfe, and to con<U+017F>ider, which way he had be<U+017F>t take, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his de<U+017F>ires: And though he <U+017F>aw many impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities in the pur<U+017F>uit of his affection yet, for all that, he could fix upon no re<U+017F>olutions, which concluded not in advantage of his love: If at any time he <U+017F>tarted a de<U+017F>igne to make a retreat, Oh, how <U+017F>uddenly would his heart give a check unto him<U+017F>elfe? If he determined to pur<U+017F>ue, Oh, what difficulties, what rubs, and how many Martyrdoms did he fore<U+017F>ee? What <U+017F>hall we do, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (would he <U+017F>ay to him<U+017F>elfe) <U+017F>ince both pur<U+017F>uit and retreat are equally impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible? Then would he <U+017F>ay in an<U+017F>wer to him<U+017F>elfe: Thy be<U+017F>t way is to do, as the heavens they would have thee. Can it be imagined, that the heavens would ever have made her <U+017F>o admirably fair, but only, that all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>hould love her? And <U+017F>ince in going both forward and backward, thou finde<U+017F>t equall impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility, chu<U+017F>e that cour<U+017F>e which is mo<U+017F>t agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of heaven and to thy <U+017F>elfe. She is made <U+017F>o fair, purpo<U+017F>ely to be loved and adored; and for my part, I will far <U+017F>ooner quit my life, then her <U+017F>ervice. What then needs any further con<U+017F>ultation, <U+017F>ince the will of heaven and my own, do <U+017F>o well agree upon it?</p>
               <p>As he was in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him<U+017F>elfe, he chanced to be neer the plea<U+017F>ant River of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> oppo<U+017F>ite to a Rock, which re<U+017F>ounded an Eccho, that di<U+017F>tinctly an<U+017F>wered to the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllable of every <U+017F>entence: And therefore, after much turbulency of <U+017F>pirit, he rou<U+017F>ed up him<U+017F>elfe, as if awakned out of a dream, and <U+017F>aid, Why <U+017F>hould I thus turmoile my <U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>o many ravelled contrarieties? The <hi>Eccho</hi> which inhabits in this place, will tell me what it hath heard from the mouth of my faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; and therefore it is the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle which I can con<U+017F>ult withall.

For my part, I conceive it <U+017F>o di<U+017F>cordant to rea<U+017F>on, that I cannot imagine how it <U+017F>hould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander,</hi> in obedience to her commands, <U+017F>hewing a Path-way which was a nearer cut thorough a great Meadow, began thus to reply; The que<U+017F>tion, Great Nymph, is of no <U+017F>uch great difficulty to be under<U+017F>tood, if it be but taken as it ought; for it is mo<U+017F>t certain that the eyes are the doores by which Love fir<U+017F>t enters into our <U+017F>oules. If any doe fall in love upon report of beauty and perfection of ab<U+017F>ent parties, that is either a love not la<U+017F>ting: nor violent, being rather a <U+017F>haddow than any real love; or el<U+017F>e the <U+017F>oul which received it, had <U+017F>ome grand defect in it <U+017F>elf; for reports having commonly as many fal<U+017F>ehoods as truths, that judgement which builds upon any <U+017F>uch uncertain foundation, cannot bee found, nor proceed from a well-tempered <U+017F>oul; but as that which produceth a thing, is not the <U+017F>ame which gives it nutriment, and makes it grow up to perfection, <U+017F>o it may be rightly <U+017F>aid of Love. Our Ewes bring forth their Lambs, who at fir<U+017F>t doe <U+017F>eek a little nutriment from their Milk, yet it is not that Milk which brings them up unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it is a more <U+017F>olid nutriment which they receive from the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e which they feed upon: So likewi<U+017F>e the eyes may conceive and produce a green infant-affection, but there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>omething more <U+017F>olid and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial to make it grow unto perfection, and that mu<U+017F>t be by a knowledge of the virtues, beauties, merits, and a reciprocal affection of the party loved. Now this knowledge does take its originall indeed from the eyes, but it mu<U+017F>t bee the <U+017F>oul which mu<U+017F>t afterwards bring it to the re<U+017F>t of judgement, and by the te<U+017F>timonies both of eyes and eares, and all other con<U+017F>iderations, concoct a verity, and <U+017F>o ground upon it. If this verity bee to our advantage, then it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in us <U+017F>uch thoughts, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e cannot be equalled by another kinde of contentment than the effects of the <U+017F>ame thoughts. If it be onely advantageous to the party loved, then doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it doth augment our affection, but yet with violence and inquietude: and therefore no que<U+017F>tion but ab<U+017F>ence doth augment love, <U+017F>o it bee not <U+017F>o long as that the very image of the party loved be quite effaced; Whether it be that an ab<U+017F>ent Lover never repre<U+017F>ents unto his fancy but onely the perfections of the per<U+017F>on loved; or whether it bee, that the under<U+017F>tanding being already wounded will not fancy any thing but what plea<U+017F>eth it; or whether it be that the very thought of <U+017F>uch things does adde much unto the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the party loved: Yet this is infallibly true, that he does not truly love, who<U+017F>e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection does not augment in ab<U+017F>ence from the per<U+017F>on loved. For my part (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)</hi> My judgement is much different from yours, and I have ever been of opinion, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence is the greate<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t dangerous enemy which Love hath. Pre<U+017F>ence, replied the Shepheard, is without compari<U+017F>on much more, as wee may <U+017F>ee by dayly experience; for you <U+017F>hall find a hundred loves that change in pre<U+017F>ence, for one in ab<U+017F>ence; and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate, that pre<U+017F>ence is more enemy unto love, con<U+017F>ider, that if one ab<U+017F>ent cea<U+017F>e loving, its ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> without any violence of <U+017F>trugling, and the change is onely becau<U+017F>e the memory is by degrees <U+017F>mothered with oblivion, as a fire is with its own a<U+017F>hes; but when love breaks off in pre<U+017F>ence, it is never without a noi<U+017F>e and extream violence, and (which is a <U+017F>trange argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And that proceeds from this rea<U+017F>on; A lover is alwaies either loved or hated, or held in a degre of indifferency; if he be loved, as abundance is apt to glut, <U+017F>o love being loaden in pre<U+017F>ence with too many favours, grows weary: If hee be hated, then hee meets with <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations of that hate every minute, as at length he is forced to ea<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf If hee be in a degree of indifferency, and finds his love <U+017F>till <U+017F>lighted, he will at length, if he be a man of any courage, make a retreate, and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the continuall affronts which are put upon him; whereas in ab<U+017F>ence, all favours received cannot by their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance glut, <U+017F>ince they do rather <U+017F>et an edge upon de<U+017F>ire: And the knowledge of hatred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into our <U+017F>ouls onely by the ear, the blow <U+017F>marts not <U+017F>o much as that which is received by <U+017F>ight: and likewi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>dain and <U+017F>light, bee much more tolerable in ab<U+017F>ence than in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence; doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e therefore ab<U+017F>ence is much more fit to pre<U+017F>erve affection than pre<U+017F>ence is. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) that there happens many accidents in pre<U+017F>ence which de<U+017F>troyes love, that ab<U+017F>ence is exempted from. But for all that, you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53526:104"/>
me, but that I mu<U+017F>t needs think the <U+017F>ight of the party loved, does augment love much more, than by not <U+017F>eeing her; for carre<U+017F><U+017F>es and favours are the food of love; and tho<U+017F>e which are conferred in pre<U+017F>ence, are far greater, and more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly obliging, than any others. I thought, Madam (an<U+017F>wered the Shepheard) that I had already <U+017F>ufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered your demand; but <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure to de<U+017F>ire more clear rea<U+017F>ons, I <U+017F>hall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give them. It hath already been <U+017F>aid, that Love doth fir<U+017F>t begin at the eyes, but it is not the eyes that doth nouri<U+017F>h it: Beauty and goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e without any more, give it a growth in us, when they are once known: Now the knowledge of this Beauty indeed comes fir<U+017F>t by the eyes; but when that knowledge is once in our <U+017F>ouls, wee may love after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without the help of eyes, which you will ea<U+017F>ily grant if ever you were in love: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider, and tell mee, would you lo<U+017F>e your love if you lo<U+017F>t your eyes? No, certainly, and therefore you mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, it is not your eyes which does pre<U+017F>erve your love. As for the knowledge of goodne<U+017F>s it is produced either by actions, or by words, both which doe <U+017F>tand in need of pre<U+017F>ence, to be fir<U+017F>t known, but afterwards not at all; for that knowledge is afterwards pre<U+017F>erved in the <U+017F>ecret Cabinet of the memory, whereupon a <U+017F>oul does after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <U+017F>ufficiently feed. Then I beleeve you know, Madam, that the more knowledge one hath of the party loved, the more doth love encrea<U+017F>e; but then, it is apparent, that the turbulent motion of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, doe infinitely hinder the clearne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the under<U+017F>tanding; and as the plummets of a Clock, the one cannot a<U+017F>cend unle<U+017F><U+017F>e the other doe de<U+017F>cend, <U+017F>o when the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es are up, the under<U+017F>tanding part mu<U+017F>t needs bee down and <U+017F>o the contrary, when the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es are ab<U+017F>ent, the Intellectuals are be<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ent, and does work more perfectly than they would if they were di<U+017F>turbed by any objects of the eye, which is able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el<U+017F>e but look, and de<U+017F>ire, and <U+017F>igh. If you would think <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon any matter, has not wi<U+017F>e Nature taught you to put your hand upon your eyes to the end that the <U+017F>ight <U+017F>hould not divert the under<U+017F>tanding another way? And therefore hence you mu<U+017F>t needs conclude with me in my argument, and confe<U+017F>s, that Love dige<U+017F>ts it <U+017F>elf better in ab<U+017F>ence than in pre<U+017F>ence. But if it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that all Lovers <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire the <U+017F>ight of them they love? It proceeds from ignorance, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander:</hi> He cannot attribute unto him<U+017F>elfe the name of a Lover, who thinkes his love <U+017F>o great that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible it <U+017F>hould augment: If any be of that opinion, he will never <U+017F>eeke after any means to increa<U+017F>e it, nor bee in any que<U+017F>t of further knowledge, but re<U+017F>ts him<U+017F>elfe contented with as much onely as his eye can afford him, without any deeper contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, O great Nymph, what a va<U+017F>t difference there is betwixt a love that is nouri<U+017F>hed by the eyes, and a love that is nouri<U+017F>hed by the under<U+017F>tanding? As much doubtle<U+017F>s as the <U+017F>oul is <U+017F>uperiour to the body, <U+017F>o much is the under<U+017F>tanding to be preferred before the eyes. And ab<U+017F>ence in <U+017F>uch is <U+017F>o far from dimini<U+017F>hing love, that it augments and begets fre<U+017F>h and violent de<U+017F>ires to augment it; and contemplation of a Beauty does imprint it deeper into the fancy than any eye can. If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> I wonder you doe not ab<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elfe from <hi>Diana,</hi> to the end you may the more love her. I told you before (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> that I ought to doe <U+017F>o, but that I have not yet obtained <U+017F>o much ma<U+017F>tery over my <U+017F>elf; for, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> we are all but men, I mean all imperfect; and the imperfections of humanity are not upon a <U+017F>udden removed: We are all <U+017F>en<U+017F>itively inclined, and love to <U+017F>ee, ta<U+017F>t, <U+017F>mell, and touch, and mu<U+017F>t needs hanker after the<U+017F>e corporal <U+017F>en<U+017F>es. This is the point unto which I have not yet arrived, and unto which I ought.

               <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued longer, if they had not by chance heard <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>ing neare the field of <hi>Mercury:</hi> Shee was <U+017F>itting with another Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e under a <U+017F>hady tree, looking upon their Flocks as they were feeding untill the heat of the day was over. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Silvander</hi> heard her tone hee turned his head that way and knowing them, hee turned his head again <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, that <hi>Leonida</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile.

I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> that I believe without <hi>Phillis,</hi> I had not fallen in love; but I mu<U+017F>t tell you withall, that <U+017F>he is the cau<U+017F>e that I have lo<U+017F>t my liberty, and am le<U+017F><U+017F>e my own than hers whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore: And I mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o tell you, that liberty is of <U+017F>o high a price, that I am not <U+017F>o much obliged to her for making me more accompli<U+017F>hed, as I am di<U+017F>obliged to her for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my dear and de<U+017F>irable freedom. But, added the Nymph, by her means you may perhaps obtain the affection of her whom you adore and love. And a well born <U+017F>oul, as yours is, will <U+017F>et <U+017F>uch a value upon that, be it at any rate what<U+017F>oever, as he cannot complain again<U+017F>t her who is the cau<U+017F>e of it; A well born and generous <U+017F>oul, replyed he, will not upon any termes thank her who is the cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>ervitude; for <U+017F>ervitude, be it in what degree it will, is <U+017F>till <U+017F>ervitude. At the fir<U+017F>t when <hi>Lycidas</hi> heard <hi>Phillis</hi> named, he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till with much attention, but after he had heard all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and replyes of <hi>Silvander,</hi> he did beleeve that he really loved her; and not being able to hide his Jealou<U+017F>ie as he de<U+017F>ired, he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay unto him, I be<U+017F>eech you, Shepheard, tell mee, Doe you indeed love this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o much as you <U+017F>eem to doe? <hi>Silvander,</hi> who never thinking of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> had talked thus unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> and knowing that this que<U+017F>tion did proceed from Jealou<U+017F>ie, hee had a minde to keep him <U+017F>till in his doubt, and therefore would not either deny, or confe<U+017F><U+017F>e what he asked, but onely <U+017F>aid thus unto him; I be<U+017F>eech you, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> tell mee what you doe think?

Since my di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> doe blind your judgement, I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, what is your de<U+017F>ire?

Though you do imploy all your Art and Armes again<U+017F>t me, yet, I hope in the end the victory will be mine. <hi>Phillis</hi> knew well enough, that this <U+017F>hepheards <U+017F>peeches had relation only unto the wager that was between them, who <U+017F>hould love <hi>Diana</hi> be<U+017F>t, and therfore received his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, in that <U+017F>ence they ought to be under<U+017F>tood. But <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who thought that this wager was only an invention betwixt them, to umbrage their affection, he took it in another <U+017F>ence. Which <U+017F>he plainly perceiving, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eyes alwaies upon him, and to undeceive him in his opinion, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi> in this manner: Shepheard, Shepheard, there is no <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of u<U+017F>ing all my power to vanqui<U+017F>h you, in the wager that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and therefore I dare a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much confidence as to tell you, that I <U+017F>hall get the victory. <hi>Silvander</hi> knew what <hi>Phillis</hi> de<U+017F>igned, and therefore, by way of contradiction, an<U+017F>wered her: None can be ignorant of your power and <hi>Silvander,</hi> the lea<U+017F>t of any Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard about <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I cannot tell (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and blu<U+017F>hed at his words) what your de<U+017F>igne is in <U+017F>peaking thus, but I am <U+017F>ure, our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>hall be acquainted with the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>sembling expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which, <U+017F>ince the wager is to be determined very <U+017F>hortly, I am very confident will co<U+017F>t you very deer, and then you will feel the <U+017F>mart of over late repentance. Do not think, Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, that I <U+017F>hall ever repeat of any expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of my affection to you, but on the contrary, I ought rather to be <U+017F>orry, that I have been <U+017F>o long without any declaration of it, and ought not to fear the menaces wherewith you threaten me. <hi>Phillis</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> al<U+017F>o, that he mocked her; but that was no <U+017F>atisfaction to the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition which the<U+017F>e words did kindle in the minde of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who perceiving how <hi>Phillis</hi> was netled at them, was the more fortified in his opinion.

If that be his aime, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> his be<U+017F>t way would be, to be plain, and <U+017F>peak unto you, as if you were <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elfe, and not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble <U+017F>o unto you. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that's all one, my aime is to let her under<U+017F>tand the qualitie of my affection. And then he prepared him<U+017F>elfe to proceed. I conjure you <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> by her, whom of all the world you love mo<U+017F>t, to let me be quiet, and content your <U+017F>elfe, that I do know more of your affection, then you can expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e conjurations, <U+017F>aid he, are too powerfull to be contradicted, and the declaration which you have made too advantageous, not to content me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure, I am <U+017F>ilent. You do oblige me by it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> for I cannot endure your language; it is more fit you went and helped <hi>Diana,</hi> whom I left in her Cabin, much troubled about her beloved Lamb <hi>Floretta,</hi> which is dead, or neer it.

Nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if that be all, I do command you; and will undertake the charge of your flock. Then <hi>Silvander,</hi> as if he dur<U+017F>t not di<U+017F>obey what <U+017F>he commanded, went unto the place where <hi>Diana</hi> was, leaving <hi>Phillis</hi> very glad of his departure, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> the mo<U+017F>t jealous Shepheard in all the Country: For, though <hi>Silvander's</hi> language did much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e, yet, the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures which he ob<U+017F>erved in <hi>Phillis,</hi> were much more <U+017F>tinging; and her conjuring him by the per<U+017F>on whom he mo<U+017F>t loved, was mo<U+017F>t of all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive to him: But her taking the charge of his flock upon her, this action pierced him to the very heart and yet the poor Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did all this, only becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

When <U+017F>he was out of all hopes, and perhaps accu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome of her neighbours of Witchcraft, for looking upon it with <U+017F>ome malevolent eye; <hi>Silvander</hi> came in, and after a <U+017F>alute asked her, what <U+017F>he did upon the ground? You may <U+017F>ee without asking me, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he if you do but look in what a condition my dear <hi>Floretta</hi> is in. The Shepheard kneeled down, looked <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon it, and <U+017F>topped its no<U+017F>e with one of his fingers, to hinder it from breathing: But a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as it was let alone, after a little faint <U+017F>neez, it began to turn round about untill it fell. <hi>Silvander</hi> having di<U+017F>covered its di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, looked very jocundly upon <hi>Diana:</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not your <U+017F>elfe, fair Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid he unto her, your beloved <hi>Floretta</hi> will recover again; it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is not cau<U+017F>ed by any Witchcraft, but rather by the heat of the Sun, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended the brain, hath cau<U+017F>ed this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which is called the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> a convul<U+017F>ion of the nerves, which have their <U+017F>cource from the brain, and cau<U+017F>eth them to go round.

But <hi>Silvander</hi> taking it by the neck, did put it into a room by it <U+017F>elfe, and wi<U+017F>hed <hi>Diana</hi> not to let it come out all that day, by rea<U+017F>on of the Sun's heat. <hi>Diana</hi> not contenting her <U+017F>elfe with the cure of her beloved <U+017F>heep, and with the knowledge of the herb, would yet by any means know the name of it.

When I <U+017F>ee them ill, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, not only unto my own, but unto any's el<U+017F>e, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I can. I would you were as willing to do <U+017F>o, replyed he, as I <U+017F>ee you are the contrary.

Upon this, <U+017F>he went to the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> full of joy for the cure of her <U+017F>heep; and by the way <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood, that <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> were with tho<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, unto whom <U+017F>he went: Pre<U+017F>ently after, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards her; for <hi>Paris</hi> hearing of <hi>Diana's</hi> griefe, de<U+017F>ired all the company to go unto her, and try if they could give any good advice for the cure of her <U+017F>heep: But when they <U+017F>aw her comming afar off, they <U+017F>tayed, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>heep to be either cured or dead; and as chance was, it was ju<U+017F>t in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> where foure waies met: And becau<U+017F>e the ba<U+017F>is on which the <U+017F>tatue of <hi>Mercury</hi> did <U+017F>tand, was rai<U+017F>ed above the levell three <U+017F>teps, they <U+017F>at round about it, and <U+017F>ome looking one way, <U+017F>ome another, <hi>Leonida</hi> e<U+017F>pied two Shepheards and a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, coming, as it were from mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> who <U+017F>eemed to be at <U+017F>ome odds; for the actions of their hands, armes, and all parts, did <U+017F>hew them to be in <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate di<U+017F>pute, e<U+017F>pecially the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who thru<U+017F>t from her <U+017F>ometimes the one, and <U+017F>ometimes the other, and would not hear them: <U+017F>ometimes they <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till and held her, as if they were de<U+017F>irous to make her the judge of their controver<U+017F>y; but <U+017F>he <U+017F>till <U+017F>truck away their hands on both <U+017F>ides, and then ran away from them, untill they overtook her again.

Town next adjoyning unto mount <hi>Verdun:</hi> They are not originally of that place, but <U+017F>trangers, whom the fortune of their Parents con<U+017F>trained to come and dwell in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. If you de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee a young <U+017F>pringing beauty, give great hopes of rare perfection, look but that Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the face; and if you could by any means invite them to relate the difference that is betwixt them, I am confident it would prove an excellent diver<U+017F>ion: for they are both in love with that Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he will not entertain either: It was once my chance to hear <U+017F>ome of their di<U+017F>putes from their own mouths, and in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was worthy of notice. The Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e is called <hi>Celida,</hi> he that is the taller on the right hand, is called <hi>Thamires,</hi> and the other <hi>Calidon. Lycidas</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid this, but the <U+017F>trangers were <U+017F>o neer them, that every one perceived the reports of <hi>Lycidas</hi> concerning <hi>Celida</hi> to be mo<U+017F>t true; for the lu<U+017F>tre of her beauty was <U+017F>o admirable, as it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all eyes upon her; and though there might be found <U+017F>ome nice defect in her beauty, yet any one might judge that time would bring it unto exact perfection. Whil<U+017F>t every one was in a cen<U+017F>orious contemplation of her, <hi>Leonida,</hi> prompted by the report of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> was very de<U+017F>irous to know their difference; therefore <U+017F>he advanced towards them, and after a civill <U+017F>alute, invited them in the name of all the company, to <U+017F>it down and re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves upon the <U+017F>tairs where they did <U+017F>it. <hi>Celidea,</hi> who was full of civility, and knew what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence was due unto the Nymph, and al<U+017F>o very glad to avoid the importunities of the two Shepheards, <U+017F>he did mo<U+017F>t willingly accept of <hi>Leonida's</hi> offer: And when all were taking their places, <hi>Diana</hi> came unto them, and after all civill <U+017F>alutations, <U+017F>he <U+017F>at down among<U+017F>t the good company. <hi>Lycidas</hi> not being able to endure, that <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>it next <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> he <U+017F>tole out of the company before any took notice of him, and went to entertain his own <U+017F>ad thoughts in the thick of the wood. Then <hi>Leonida,</hi> having cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Celidea</hi> to <U+017F>it next her on one hand, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> on the other, <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>at next the <U+017F>tranger, and <hi>Paris</hi> next her. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> had taken her place next the <U+017F>ad <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Silvander</hi> was with <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon;</hi> and though they did not <U+017F>it about the <U+017F>tatue, yet their backs were towards the fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and could not <U+017F>ee them.
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did <U+017F>it a little turning from them yet <U+017F>o, as by a little turning their bodies, they could both <U+017F>ee and <U+017F>peak unto them. Being thus ranged, <hi>Leonida</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Celidea's</hi> mode<U+017F>ty would not permit her to <U+017F>peak, and intending to in<U+017F>pire her with more confidence, <U+017F>he thus broke <U+017F>ilence Although, fair <hi>Celidea,</hi> you were unknown unto us by <U+017F>ight; yet the fame of your beauty hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all our ears, which <U+017F>wells us all with extream curio<U+017F>ity, to know both you and your fortune. <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath partly acquainted us with the difference that is betwixt you and the<U+017F>e two courteous Shepheards; but <U+017F>ince there goes various reports of it, we <U+017F>hould be extreamly glad to hear the truth from your own mouth.

Although the relation and remembrance of things pa<U+017F>t, be nothing plea<U+017F>ing unto me; Yet, great Nymph, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but de<U+017F>ire, that you might entertain the time with <U+017F>ome other, and <U+017F>ome better di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

To return your own arguments upon your <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires,</hi> it is I that ought to <U+017F>peak, being the mo<U+017F>t injured; I, that have rea<U+017F>on to complain again<U+017F>t <hi>Celidea,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did once love me, and now does not; and again<U+017F>t <hi>Calidon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he is the mo<U+017F>t obliged unto me, and yet the mo<U+017F>t ungratefull.

               <p>Now becau<U+017F>e I did fore<U+017F>ee, that this Beauty would be the object of many eyes, and that my heart would not burn alone, I re<U+017F>olved to be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elfe into her minde: And con<U+017F>idering, that her age was not yet capable of any <U+017F>olid affection, I cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with childi<U+017F>h toyes, and <U+017F>ometimes talked of Love, of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, of De<U+017F>ire, and of Flame; not that I thought her able to re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>uch things yet, but my end was, only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tome her to tho<U+017F>e phra<U+017F>es, which commonly does more offend the ears of <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, then the effects them<U+017F>elves do. I continued this life above a year, during which time, I would <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>teal a ki<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ometimes put my hand into her bo<U+017F>ome, and indeed, great Nymph, <U+017F>o tampered with her, that I did extreamly win upon her affection; for, when <U+017F>he came to be eleven years of age, <U+017F>he loved me, as <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>aid, as well as <U+017F>he did her Father; and her affection growing every day, <U+017F>he vowed unto me, that <U+017F>he loved me much above the degree of either Father or Brother: And when <U+017F>he accompli<U+017F>hed the age of twelve, <U+017F>he loved me above all the world. And indeed, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o void of all malice, and <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>y to be wrought upon at that age, as I could have engaged her unto any thing, if I had not de<U+017F>igned to marry her when <U+017F>he was a little older: But that con<U+017F>ideration, together with the reall affection I did bear unto her, did re<U+017F>train me from all manner of evill thoughts. But, becau<U+017F>e her <U+017F>implicity made me fear, le<U+017F>t any other <U+017F>hould deceive her, <U+017F>ince many began already to court her, I was continually laying before her that high e<U+017F>teem which every one did <U+017F>et upon con<U+017F>tancy and fidelity; how contemptible tho<U+017F>e were, that loved many; how almo<U+017F>t all Shepheards are unfaithfull and deceivers, and there was no credit to be given to their words; nay, that it was a grand fault in any young woman to hear them. But one day, when <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me, That if this be a fault, then <U+017F>he ought not to <U+017F>uffer me to <U+017F>peak as I did; I perceived, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>till in her innocent Infancy, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did not know my aim; and therefore I read her a loving Lecture upon Love and Amitie, telling her, that we came purpo<U+017F>ely into the world to love; that without this vertue, there was no delight in life; that it was Love which made all bitter <U+017F>weet, and paines ea<U+017F>ie; that who<U+017F>oever was without that quality, were extreamly mi<U+017F>erable, becau<U+017F>e none could ever love them; that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw before her eyes the example of her Father and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; her Mother did Love her Father, and her Aunt her Uncle; but <U+017F>uch as love above one, are <U+017F>corned by every one. But I be<U+017F>eech you, replyed <U+017F>he, are <U+017F>hepheards al<U+017F>o obliged to love but one? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e they are, an<U+017F>wered I: And do you not <U+017F>ee, that I do love only you? But I be<U+017F>eech you, tell me, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, did you never love any one before I was born? and if I <U+017F>hould die, would you not love <U+017F>ome other? I could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at this down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right demand, and in an<U+017F>wer to it: Know, my Faire<U+017F>t, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) that I did never love any till you did come into the world; and if you <U+017F>hould die before me, my love would die with you, and never live again for any other. And if you <U+017F>hould die before me <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, mu<U+017F>t I of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity do the like? If I mu<U+017F>t, pray Father teach me how I mu<U+017F>t bury my Love in your Coffin. Daughter, <U+017F>aid I unto her, and <U+017F>miled, you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till let your love of me live in your memory, as I <U+017F>hould of you, if you did die before me. But how, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>hould I love one that is dead? When you did at any time ki<U+017F><U+017F>e me, and put your hand into my brea<U+017F>t, if I did ask you, why you did <U+017F>o you alwaies an<U+017F>wered, that it was, becau<U+017F>e you loved me: And when you are dead, mu<U+017F>t I do the <U+017F>ame? Fair Daughter, (<U+017F>aid I unto her, taking her in my armes, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her) <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es never u<U+017F>e to hang upon the necks of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards whom they love, nor u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch carra<U+017F><U+017F>es as te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their loves unto them: It is enough for them to <U+017F>uffer, and not act <U+017F>uch things. I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, replied <U+017F>he, is <U+017F>uffering ones <U+017F>elfe to be ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed in this manner, a te<U+017F>timony of love? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it is, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) and therefore they ought
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53526:107"/>
not to <U+017F>uffer any <U+017F>o to do, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>uch as they do love. And how do <U+017F>hepheards expre<U+017F><U+017F>e their loves, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me? As I do, an<U+017F>wered I, when I ki<U+017F><U+017F>e you, and take delight in playing with you. It <U+017F>eemes, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that when one would ki<U+017F><U+017F>e me, and play in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with me, I may by that know he loves me.</p>
               <p>I do relate the <U+017F>implicities of this young Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, Madam, that you may the better know, of what nature that affection was which <U+017F>he bore unto me, and with what indulgent care I brought her up, more like a Father then a Lover; you may hereby conceive, how much beholding <U+017F>he ought to be unto me, for not loving her after a vicious manner, nor working upon the <U+017F>implicity of her age and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; for you may perceive by her Que<U+017F>tions and An<U+017F>wers, that her minde might have been tempered into what Mould <U+017F>oever I would. Perhaps you will wonder, that I, who was of more <U+017F>olid years, could take any delight in the conver<U+017F>ation of one who was <U+017F>o very young; but if you will plea<U+017F>e to con<U+017F>ider, that Love is alwaies a childe, and takes mo<U+017F>t delight in youth, you will not think it <U+017F>trange, that <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t love with a mo<U+017F>t pure and <U+017F>incere affection, an innocent and harmle<U+017F>s beauty <U+017F>hould be mo<U+017F>t agreeable unto mee. And the very truth is, it was not I that was the author of this affection to her, but it was heaven that forced mee to love her whether I would or no. For I did often ab<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf from her, and oppo<U+017F>ed all manner of arguments that rea<U+017F>on could <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t it, but that did rather augment than dimini<U+017F>h my affection, which in the end grew to a mo<U+017F>t extreame height. About this time <hi>Calidon</hi> returned out of the <hi>Boyen</hi> Province, and was <U+017F>ome eighteen years of age, or thereabouts. He was taller than u<U+017F>ually that age allows any; hand<U+017F>omly proportioned; his complexion, for a brown, extreamly fair; his mind, his garb, and his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, was higher than perhaps his quality required, but yet not at all proud nor vain-glorious. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that when I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>o much improved, I loved him better than I did before: For before, I did love him onely in con<U+017F>ideration of Con<U+017F>anguinity, and upon the recommendation of my Uncle; but when I found him to be <U+017F>o amiable, <U+017F>o extreamly well accompli<U+017F>hed, and every way <U+017F>o well improved, that I having neither Wife nor Child, or then intending to marry, re<U+017F>olved to make him my Heir, after my death, unto all my e<U+017F>tate, which perhaps was not very incon<U+017F>iderable. And to oblige him unto a reciprocal good will unto me, I declared as much unto all my Kindred and Neighbours. Now becau<U+017F>e I did fore<U+017F>ee that dwelling in my hou<U+017F>e, it was almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but he <U+017F>hould fall in love with the fair <hi>Celidea,</hi> I gave him a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trict charge to look upon her onely with the eyes of a Brother, and not of a Lover: He prote<U+017F>ted with a thou<U+017F>and a<U+017F><U+017F>everati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oaths, that he would obey me in this, and all things el<U+017F>e, and would not doe any thing in the world that <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me: Yet before the Moon had run a full cour<U+017F>e, he was charmed with <hi>Celidea;</hi> and not daring to declare it unto her or me, or any el<U+017F>e, after he had langui<U+017F>hed a while, hee was forced to keep his bed; his eyes <U+017F>hrunk into his head, his complexion grown yellow, and grown <U+017F>o lean and altered, as he was not knowable. I brought the mo<U+017F>t knowing and experienced Phy<U+017F>icians in all the Country unto him: If Fame cryed up any man, I <U+017F>pared neither co<U+017F>t nor pains till I got him. I cau<U+017F>ed Sacrifices to be offered upon every Altar of the Country to appea<U+017F>e <hi>Tautates, He<U+017F>us, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> if <hi>Calidon</hi> by chance had offended them. I <U+017F>ent to enquire of every Oracle and Augurer: I <U+017F>ent for all the <hi>Bardi</hi> to come and pray with him: I <U+017F>ent al<U+017F>o for the be<U+017F>t Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians, to try if Mu<U+017F>ick would allay the Melancholly which oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed his <U+017F>oul. To bee <U+017F>hort, there was not one <U+017F>age <hi>Sarronide</hi> which at my reque<U+017F>t did not come to vi<U+017F>it him, and give him wi<U+017F>e precepts again<U+017F>t grief and <U+017F>orrow. But all the<U+017F>e had no operation; nor could all the teares which I <U+017F>hed by his beds <U+017F>ide, get him to tell me the cau<U+017F>e of his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Thus langui<U+017F>hing in this manner, and no remedies could doe any good upon him, there was an old Phy<U+017F>ician, a friend of mine, who hearing of my <U+017F>orrows for <hi>Calidon,</hi> came unto me, to comfort me in my affliction; and after as good and wi<U+017F>e advice as any humane Prudence could give, hee bade me re<U+017F>ign <hi>Calidon</hi> and my own will into the hands of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> and to believe, that if I did it unfeignedly, I <U+017F>hould receive more comfort than I could from all men living. When he was ready to goe away, he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee <hi>Calidon:</hi> We went both into his chamber, he fell into talk with him, and con<U+017F>idered him very <U+017F>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly he felt his pul<U+017F>e, ob<U+017F>erved his actions and ge<U+017F>tures; turned him every way to finde out his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: And after hee had been two hours with him; Young man, <U+017F>aid hee unto him, chear up, and bee a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that you <U+017F>hall not dye of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; I have found out the cau<U+017F>e, and I have known many <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>ame, but never knew one dye of it. Then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Chamber, he took me a<U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>aid thus unto me; The age I have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53526:108"/>
unto, is great, and though I have not employed all my time very well, yet not all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably: I have <U+017F>tudyed the art of Phy<U+017F>ick very long, and have attained unto no meane reputation; I have been employed by many of the be<U+017F>t quality among<U+017F>t the <hi>Boyens,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guanonans,</hi> and the <hi>Allobrogians:</hi> Long experience have I had in my Art, which makes me <U+017F>peak with more a<U+017F><U+017F>urance than any that is younger than my <U+017F>elf can. Let me tell you, that <hi>Calidons</hi> di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeds not from the body but the mind; and if his body be <U+017F>ick, it is becau<U+017F>e of the near union it hath to his <U+017F>ick mind, which makes it re<U+017F>ent the pain as if it were its own, as we <U+017F>ee one friend <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the pain of another. And though the<U+017F>e kinde of maladies be very painfull, yet are they not <U+017F>o dangerous as tho<U+017F>e of the body; for the mind is not <U+017F>ubject to corruption, or di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of parts, but onely to change its quality. I tell you this, that you may not de<U+017F>pair of the young mans cure, who<U+017F>e Malady, I think I have very rightly di<U+017F>covered; And by all <U+017F>ymptomes, I finde that he is extreame pa<U+017F><U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in Love, and is either <U+017F>leighted, or el<U+017F>e dares not declare it. As <U+017F>oon as ever the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ician <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, I pre<U+017F>ently apprehended, that certainly it was with the fair <hi>Celidea;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e of my forbidding him, hee dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>peak of it. When the Phy<U+017F>ician perceived me <U+017F>ad, in lieu of rejoycing at the matter, hee asked mee the rea<U+017F>on, to whom I an<U+017F>wered, that I was more in fear of him than ever, becau<U+017F>e his malady was without the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of my cure, and he might love one I had no power over, or el<U+017F>e a <U+017F>tranger, or perhaps <U+017F>ome enemy, and therefore I <U+017F>aw no rea<U+017F>on to rejoice. There is a remedy, <U+017F>aid he, again<U+017F>t any thing but death, and therefore never fear but I <U+017F>hall keep <hi>Calidon</hi> alive; and if you will plea<U+017F>e to give me leave to be with him a few dayes, I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover well enough whether he be in love with any that has any dependance upon you, or with a <U+017F>tranger. You cannot hope, <U+017F>aid I unto him, ever to get it from his own mouth. No, no, <U+017F>aid he, that's not the way; but fear not, I <U+017F>hall bring it about: Matters of Love be they never <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, may ea<U+017F>ily be di<U+017F>covered, if prudent artifice be u<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>But, great Nymph, I <U+017F>hould be extreamly tedious if I <U+017F>hould relate every trivial pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age, therefore for brevities <U+017F>ake, I <U+017F>hall onely tell you, that this Phy<U+017F>ician was for <U+017F>even or eight daies never from <hi>Calidons</hi> bed <U+017F>ide. In the mean time, he advi<U+017F>ed me to get all the young Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es in the neighbourhood to come and <U+017F>ee him, under pretence of <U+017F>orrow for his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e. As for the Phy<U+017F>ician, hee was alwaies holding him by the arme, and felt his Pul<U+017F>e, to know when any cau<U+017F>ed an extraordinary motion in him. So it was, that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> at that time was gone a journey with <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and <U+017F>tayed away five or <U+017F>ix daies, and therefore <U+017F>he was almo<U+017F>t the la<U+017F>t of all the vi<U+017F>itants, though the neare<U+017F>t neighbour: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived it <U+017F>o, that all my friends and neighbours <U+017F>ent both their Si<U+017F>ters and Daughters to my hou<U+017F>e; &amp; when we were almo<U+017F>t out of all hope to di<U+017F>cover what I de<U+017F>ired to know this way, one came to tell us, that <hi>Celidea</hi> was at the door. As fortune was, the Phy<U+017F>ician held him by the arm at that time; and his pul<U+017F>e did beat a <U+017F>lower pace than it had done all the day; but as <U+017F>oon as ever he heard <hi>Celidea</hi> named, it began to beat as if he were in a mo<U+017F>t high Feaver. The Phy<U+017F>ician finding this, did look him in the face, and <U+017F>aw his eyes more quick and lively than ordinary; his complexion came into his cheeks, and he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o great an alteration every way, as hee would hardly <U+017F>tay till <hi>Celidea</hi> entred for better a<U+017F><U+017F>urance; but when <U+017F>he entred, his pul<U+017F>e then did keep a mad mans time, and all parts were different from their ordinary temper. Therefore drawing me a<U+017F>ide, <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, It is not <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> which enters into the Chamber, but it is <hi>Calidons</hi> Wife, if you would have him live. Oh heavens! how tho<U+017F>e words pierced me to the heart? They <U+017F>truck me dumb, I was not able to <U+017F>peak one word. Afterwards, when I had a little recollected my <U+017F>elf; I asked him, whether con<U+017F>idering the condition he was in, it were fit to marry him? No, <U+017F>aid he, it will be enough if you can procure the Shephearde<U+017F>s to give him <U+017F>ome knowledge of her affection; and in the mean time you may talk with <hi>Clcontine,</hi> who being wi<U+017F>e, will not bee again<U+017F>t a match <U+017F>o advantageous.</p>
               <p>The Phy<U+017F>ician went away, and left me in a wor<U+017F>e condition than his patient. Oh what <U+017F>trange contrarieties were in my <U+017F>oul? One <U+017F>ide bade mee yeeld <hi>Celidea</hi> unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> for friend<U+017F>hip <U+017F>ake; Love, on the other <U+017F>ide forbade the banes. But, <U+017F>aid Friend<U+017F>hip unto me, <hi>Calidon</hi> will dy if you doe deny her; and there is no Phy<U+017F>ician but this, can cure him: And Love an<U+017F>wered, how can<U+017F>t thou live thy <U+017F>elf, if thou doe<U+017F>t not enjoy her? Can<U+017F>t thou not <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount a vain pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion (<U+017F>aid Friend<U+017F>hip) and be ruled by the Laws of Rea<U+017F>on?

               <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations had <U+017F>uch a prevalency with me, as I did once re<U+017F>olve to part with <hi>Celidea,</hi> and re<U+017F>ign her unto <hi>Calidon.</hi> But, O Madam, what extream difficulties did I finde in the execution of it? Fir<U+017F>t, to the end this young Shepheard might recover his health, I begun with him, and acquainting him with my knowledge of his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hewed him my extream de<U+017F>ire of his cure: At the fir<U+017F>t, he denyed it unto me, but at la<U+017F>t hee did confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it with watry eyes, and asked me forgivene<U+017F><U+017F>e, with <U+017F>o many apparent <U+017F>ignes of <U+017F>orrow, that <U+017F>eeing his errour was by a mo<U+017F>t compul<U+017F>ive power of Love, I could not chu<U+017F>e but take his fault upon my <U+017F>elfe. But the grand difficulty was to <U+017F>peake unto <hi>Celidea</hi> for <U+017F>hee was <U+017F>o farre from loving him, that <U+017F>hee did down right hate him. And certainly this hatred proceeded from an Antipathy in Nature, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>haddow of any cau<U+017F>e for it; and the Shepheard had <U+017F>o many excellent good qualities, that in all rea<U+017F>on they <U+017F>hould rather have gotten love than hatred: And yet <U+017F>hee would alwaies <U+017F>ay unto me, that <hi>Calidon</hi> of all men <U+017F>hee knew, <U+017F>hould be the la<U+017F>t man <U+017F>he would love. But being re<U+017F>olved to make this overture, <U+017F>o contrary both unto her will and my own, I was at an extream puzzle where, and how to begin. At la<U+017F>t, I thought it be<U+017F>t to break the Ice by degrees for to bid her downright to love <hi>Calidon,</hi> was not the way, both in re<U+017F>pect of her affection to me, and di<U+017F>affection to him. I went therefore to work by degrees, and now <U+017F>he was not to be treated as a child: I hinted unto her my extreame <U+017F>orrows for the Shepheard; how dear his life was unto me, and how I <U+017F>hould never enjoy any delights if I lo<U+017F>t him; That Phy<U+017F>icians and all knowing per<U+017F>ons told me his malady proceeded from nothing el<U+017F>e but <U+017F>orrow; and not knowing what was the cau<U+017F>e, I could not chu<U+017F>e but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire all them that loved mee, to <U+017F>tudy how to make him merry, or at lea<U+017F>t to finde out the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e: And that <U+017F>he being one whom I loved and honoured mo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hee was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged more than any to endeavour the cure of this Shepheard for my <U+017F>ake: Therefore I conjured her by our friend<U+017F>hip, to <U+017F>ee him as often as <U+017F>he could, and to carra<U+017F><U+017F>e and cheer him up, to keep him from that melancholly which would kill him. She who did really love me, did promi<U+017F>e to doe it <U+017F>o oft as <U+017F>he conveniently could: And indeed did <U+017F>o, which on the one <U+017F>ide did content me, and on the other did <U+017F>o grieve me, as I did thinke I <U+017F>hould not live. I had a conceit that her familiarity with him would in time engage her to liking of him, which afterwards might the more ea<U+017F>ily make her bee per<U+017F>waded unto love: Shee having no other de<U+017F>ign, did onely as <U+017F>hee promi<U+017F>ed, but did not change her minde. However this wrought good effects upon <hi>Calidon,</hi> who receiving <U+017F>o many favourable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>its, and being <U+017F>o kindly carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed above his expectation, did in a <U+017F>hort time begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: And though he was not pre<U+017F>ently cured, yet there was apparent <U+017F>ignes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now becau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hee was weary of this life, and becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>aw my de<U+017F>ign did not take according to my thoughts, I intended to oblige her another way. I addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> acquainted her with my affection unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> with my intention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him my Heir; I repre<U+017F>ented unto her the quality of this young Shepheard, his virtues, and to be brief, with the love he had unto <hi>Caledon,</hi> and u<U+017F>ed all manner of arguments that might advance the match. Judge great Nymph, if I went not very farre, and whether he be not much obliged unto me. <hi>Cleontine</hi> thinking the Match to be advantageous, did thank me for my good will unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> then gave me her word that <U+017F>he would u<U+017F>e all her endeavours in favour of <hi>Calidon;</hi> but that the young Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e had a Mother who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her exceedingly well, and <U+017F>hee could not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her without her con<U+017F>ent: But <U+017F>he would motion it unto her and in the mean time prepare <hi>Celidea</hi> as wel as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could. Thus, Madam, you <U+017F>ee how mi<U+017F>erable my fortune was: I invented all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ways to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my <U+017F>elfe of the onely good that could render my life plea<U+017F>ing unto me; and I did fore<U+017F>ee, that though I did bring it pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet I <U+017F>hould reap no contentment by it. Had I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for <hi>Calidon</hi> that which I did endeavour, what could I ever have hoped for in my

This being my condition, which I knew not whether to tearm a death or a life one day after I had received <hi>Cleontine's</hi> an<U+017F>wer, I went unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> with whom I was not <U+017F>o familiar as formerly: My dear and faire<U+017F>t Daughter, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) <hi>Cleontine</hi> has acquainted me with her intention, and I conceive, that you ought to approve of it. Then fearing <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ask me what it was, I <U+017F>eemed to have earne<U+017F>t and <U+017F>uddain bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to do, and went away, leaving her in a great doubt what it was: But I went away with a <U+017F>ad heart; for, <U+017F>trive what I could again<U+017F>t my own will, I could not blot her out of my <U+017F>oul; and as often as I fancyed <hi>Celidea</hi> in the armes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I had not re<U+017F>olution enough to endure the very thought of it. Imagine in what condition I <U+017F>hould have been, if the Marriage had taken effect, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I did mo<U+017F>t vigorou<U+017F>ly endeavour for <hi>Calidon's</hi> fake?</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cleontine,</hi> thinking my propo<U+017F>ition advantageous for <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>he took her a<U+017F>ide, and broke the matter unto her: Then, before <U+017F>he asked her opinion of it, <U+017F>he told her what was he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>; and the more to induce her, told her, how much <U+017F>he was obliged unto me, for motioning it unto her. That Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, can be<U+017F>t tell you, how <U+017F>he <U+017F>tarted at the motion, e<U+017F>pecially when <U+017F>he heard that it came from me: but <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he had much ado to conceal her anger in <hi>Cleontin's</hi> pre<U+017F>ence; yet, giving her a very mode<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer, though it were very far from her thoughts, <U+017F>he referred her <U+017F>elfe unto her judgment, and the plea<U+017F>ure of her Mother, unto whom <U+017F>he was never di<U+017F>obedient. In conclu<U+017F>ion, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to marry a Grave rather then <hi>Calidon,</hi> <U+017F>he came unto me. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever I <U+017F>aw her, I perceived that <U+017F>omething did trouble her, for her eyes trembled in her head; her eye-lids frowning and her colour higher than ordinary. But I could not imagine that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be offended again<U+017F>t me, nor believe, that <hi>Cleontine</hi> had told her the motion came from me. As fortune was I was under a great Elme alone, which <U+017F>tood by it <U+017F>elfe almo<U+017F>t in the mid<U+017F>t of Mount <hi>Verdun's</hi> plain, neer the high way. As <U+017F>oon as ever I <U+017F>aw her I did ri<U+017F>e up, and holding her hand as I was went, I was amazed to <U+017F>ee her pul back her arme, and look upon me with an angry eye: <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how dare you take her hand, whom you have given to another? Was it not enough, and too much, that you have abu<U+017F>ed me as long as ever the innocence of my age could endure it? Do you think your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle, and me <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, that now, being pa<U+017F>t a child, I cannot <U+017F>ee your cunning perfidie? When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>tand amazed, and did not an<U+017F>wer: Nay, nay, <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never think to deceive me any more by your words, nor a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of amity; I am now grown more crafty, and I wi<U+017F>h to god I had alwaies been <U+017F>o then I <U+017F>hould not have now <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on to complain of you.

Away ungrateful and cruell man! What did you ever finde in me, that <U+017F>hould give you any occa<U+017F>ion to u<U+017F>e me thus? Was there ever any old enmity between our Parents that you would revenge upon me? Did I ever attempt again<U+017F>t your life? Have I ever <U+017F>poken again<U+017F>t you or any of your friends? Did I ever fail in my word or friend<U+017F>hip? Have you ever found any fault in me, that did invite you to ca<U+017F>t me off? Or, do you now think me not wi<U+017F>e, or rich, or fair enough, for you? If it be to revenge the fault of a Father upon a Daughter, me-thinks it, <U+017F>hould be an act unworthy of <hi>Thamires?</hi> If I did ever attempt again<U+017F>t your life, why did you not take mine away at a blow, but put me into the power of an enemy, with whom I <U+017F>hould live a dyinglife every minute? If I be not fair enough, nor <U+017F>o vertuous as to plea<U+017F>e you, good <hi>Thamires,</hi> go and <U+017F>eek out a better. But alas, why mu<U+017F>t I as a pennance for a fault in nature, be put into the hands of him, whom nature it <U+017F>elfe makes me abhor? For gods <U+017F>ake leave me in the <U+017F>ame liberty you found me, when by your craft you began to deceive me, and content your <U+017F>elfe with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>orrowes I <U+017F>hall have all my life, for not knowing your de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>ooner.

Ah! mo<U+017F>t unnaturall Shepheard, you are mute, and cannot <U+017F>peak a word; Is it for the <U+017F>ham: for the wrong you have done me? or, have you any new piece of <U+017F>ubtlety again<U+017F>t <U+017F>illy <hi>Celidea?</hi> Go, go, perfidious and di<U+017F>loyall <hi>Thamires.</hi> This act hath put me out of opinion, that ever you loved me.

In offering to give me unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> you have for ever deprived your <U+017F>elfe of the true<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection that ever was; and never hope it will revive, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e an univer<U+017F>all conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <U+017F>hould <U+017F>et the whole world a fire, and <U+017F>o kindle this love in me again. Away, away, there is not a man upon the face of the whole earth, but Mon<U+017F>ters, and Tigers, that would devour me. Upon this, taking from her neck a platted Chain which I gave her, as <U+017F>he gave it into my hand, <U+017F>he broke it in pieces: Thus, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is our love to one another for ever broken, and never to piece again. She had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>poken the<U+017F>e words, but <U+017F>he ran away with a piece of the chain in her hand, and left the other in mine, who was in <U+017F>uch an exta<U+017F>y, that I was not able to <U+017F>peak one word by way of excu<U+017F>e, nor follow her one <U+017F>tep I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, that the<U+017F>e words did <U+017F>ting me to the very heart; and when I did <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider what good rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he had to <U+017F>peak them, I could not lay the blame upon her, but wholly upon my <U+017F>elfe: However, I kept my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>till con<U+017F>tant to my re<U+017F>olution, of endeavouring the contentment of <hi>Calidon.</hi> He, knowing that I had <U+017F>poken of it unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and hearing the report of their Marriage publickly divulged, he did not much wonder, that his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>ee him; but when <hi>Cleontine</hi> came to vi<U+017F>it him, conceiving it but fit for her <U+017F>o to do, <U+017F>ince their Marriage was <U+017F>o much <U+017F>poken of; <U+017F>o as in a few nights he recovered his former health, and got out of his bed, and a little after out of his Chamber. In the mean time, <hi>Celidea</hi> was much perplexed and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other hopes, but in the tender affection of her Mother, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw I had gained <hi>Cleontine,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her, <U+017F>he fell down upon her knees, and would not ri<U+017F>e, untill <U+017F>he had obtained a promi<U+017F>e, never to marry her again<U+017F>t her will. <hi>Celidea</hi> was <U+017F>o exceedingly contented with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, as <U+017F>hcould not re<U+017F>t, untill <U+017F>he had adverti<U+017F>ed us of it, thinkinking her de<U+017F>ires not compleatly <U+017F>atisfied till then. It is very hard to <U+017F>ay, great Nymph, whether I was more <U+017F>orry, or more plea<U+017F>ed; for on the one <U+017F>ide, I feared <hi>Calidon's</hi> relaps; and on the other, I was glad that none <U+017F>hould enjoy <hi>Celidea.</hi> But when I <U+017F>aw <hi>Calidon,</hi> though <U+017F>omething <U+017F>ad, yet in health, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I was extreamly plea<U+017F>ed at <hi>Celidea's</hi> repul<U+017F>ing him, and did in my heart commend her prudence and re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; for I had a conceit, that all <U+017F>he did was only to re<U+017F>erve her <U+017F>elfe for me, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her anger again<U+017F>t me was <U+017F>o high, as utterly to extirpate the affection which <U+017F>he bore unto me; <U+017F>o as recollecting my <U+017F>elfe, I did confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the injury which I had done her, was not with a de<U+017F>igne to extingui<U+017F>h my love unto her, (for I never had any <U+017F>uch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor could ever hope to be <U+017F>o much Ma<U+017F>ter of my <U+017F>elfe) but only had a minde to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it unto <hi>Calidon's</hi> health. So then mu<U+017F>t the act which I would have done be phra<U+017F>ed: for my aim was only at the <U+017F>aving of his life, and not at the <U+017F>atisfaction of his plea<U+017F>ures. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations being often in my minde, Love began to be more violent in me then ever; and ea<U+017F>ily it might, for having re<U+017F>igned this fair one unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> only to <U+017F>ave his life, and <U+017F>eeing that he lived <U+017F>till, though <U+017F>he was not his <U+017F>elf, I conceived, that my quitting her having wrought its intended effect, I might very ju<U+017F>tly fall on upon my own <U+017F>core as I fell off for <hi>Calidon's.</hi> Upon this account, I went to the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hewed her the rea<U+017F>on why I dealt <U+017F>o with her, and why I did now dedicate my <U+017F>elfe wholly to her <U+017F>ervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeching and conjuring her, to pardon and forget the fault, if <U+017F>he thought it to be one. To be briefe, I u<U+017F>ed the be<U+017F>t arguments and eloquence I could devi<U+017F>e, to advance my cau<U+017F>e; but I found her to be <U+017F>o exceedingly altered, that all my arguments, excu<U+017F>es, and rea<U+017F>ons, could not move her more then they could a Rock, nor obtain the lea<U+017F>t glance of a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble look upon me As fortune was whil<U+017F>t I was <U+017F>peaking to her, <hi>Calidon</hi> comes in, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde me a very good <U+017F>econd, he advanced towards us, to <U+017F>peak to her for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe; but when he heard my words, never man was more amazed: he dur<U+017F>t not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me with breach of faith and abu<U+017F>ing him; but <U+017F>tepping back three or foure paces, with folded armes: Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid he, is there any loyalty in any man living? Is it he that brought me up, lie whom I call Father, and he, who hitherto hath done me all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent offices<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> is it he, I <U+017F>ay, that puts a dagger into my heart, and <U+017F>ends me to my grave? Unto which I returned a faint an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>hewed him the rea<U+017F>ons why I quitted <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and why I did again apply my <U+017F>elfe to her. But Love did <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>port him into <U+017F>uch violent raptures, that there could be no bitter invective, wherewith he did not a<U+017F>per<U+017F>e me. But the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did laugh at us both: Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never <U+017F>trive for <hi>Celidea,</hi> for neither of you have the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hare in her: Not you, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and turned to <hi>Celidon)</hi> for I never did love you: Nor you, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and turned to me) becau<U+017F>e you are extreamly unworthy of that love, which once I did bear unto you. Then <U+017F>he left both in a confu<U+017F>ed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53526:110"/>
amazement: We al<U+017F>o parted. And ever <U+017F>ince, that <U+017F>hepheard hath continued with one of his Kin<U+017F>men, and never came at his own Cabin. Three Moones have changed <U+017F>ince this <U+017F>eparation, and do both he and I what we could, we could not obtain one good word from her; but, the more violent we are in our loves, the more violent <U+017F>he is in her hatred. In the mean time, <U+017F>uch is my extream affection to her, that it will not admit of the lea<U+017F>t diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but does <U+017F>till more and more encrea<U+017F>e: <U+017F>o as did <U+017F>he but know it, I do believe, that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did love me before, out of an opinion I loved her, <U+017F>he would love me much more now, becau<U+017F>e I do love her now much more than I did then, and more than any man living can.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Thamires</hi> ended his relation; and after a while of <U+017F>ilence, he began again. Now, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, as chance was, we met this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e love continues in us and di<U+017F>dain in her, we both of us <U+017F>hewed her the be<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>ons we had, to convince her, that <U+017F>he ought to love one of us. I pleaded, that it was I upon whom her election ought to be.: <hi>Calidon,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, whom I have <U+017F>o much obliged by many good offices, he very opinioatively maintaines, that it belongs to him. Now knowing that your wi<U+017F>dome can much better under<U+017F>tand rea<U+017F>on, then I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I would with all my heart, to put an end to our long di<U+017F><U+017F>entions, (for we are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy grown the common talk of our Town) that you, great Nymph, would be plea<U+017F>ed to hear our rea<U+017F>ons and arguments from our own mouths, and ordain what you <U+017F>hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be ju<U+017F>t, for I <U+017F>hall mo<U+017F>t freely <U+017F>ubmit my <U+017F>elfe unto your judgment: It would be a work well worthy of your <U+017F>elfe, it would be acceptable to the gods, and would infinitely oblige us all unto you. <hi>Leonida</hi> thanked him for the pains he had taken, in the relation of of the matter; and did a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that if he, and all tho<U+017F>e who had any intere<U+017F>t in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, did think her able to be the Judge, <U+017F>he would mo<U+017F>t willingly arbitrate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the be<U+017F>t of her judgment, upon condition they would all promi<U+017F>e to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve it otherwi<U+017F>e, all their labour would be but lo<U+017F>t. <hi>Thamires</hi> kneeled down upon his knees, and <U+017F>aid: Oh, great Nymph, I do refer my life, my death, and the contentments of them, unto your wi<U+017F>e judgment; if I do di<U+017F>obey your doom, let our Druides excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate me from ever a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting them at their holy <U+017F>acrifices, and forbid me for ever coming into the <U+017F>acred groves, or our cele<U+017F>tiall woods. For my part; <U+017F>aid <hi>Calidon,</hi> if I do not the <U+017F>ame, may the Mi<U+017F>leto of the ninth year be never whol<U+017F>ome unto me, let the great <hi>Tautates</hi> animate all his furies again<U+017F>t me, and never let me be at re<U+017F>t, if I do not <U+017F>ubmit unto your judgment as proceeding from the great god. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Celidea</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aid unto her. Are not you plea<U+017F>ed, fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, to be rid of all the importunities which you receive from the<U+017F>e two Shepheards, and refer your <U+017F>elfe unto the judgment of this great Nymph? I am mo<U+017F>t willing to be rid of them an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; but I am afraid to fall into a greater mi<U+017F>ery: And certainly, I <U+017F>hould refer the hazard of this judgment unto any, if the gods had not advi<U+017F>ed me the la<U+017F>t night in a dream, to take another cour<U+017F>e: For, pre<U+017F>ently after midnight, me-thought I <U+017F>aw my Father, who hath been long dead, open my brea<U+017F>t, take out my heart, and ca<U+017F>t it as a <U+017F>tone in a <U+017F>ling over the River <hi>Lignon;</hi> then <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words unto me: Go, my child, unto the other <U+017F>ide of the fatall River <hi>Lignon,</hi> there thou <U+017F>halt finde that heart which <U+017F>o much torments thee, or el<U+017F>e a full <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and re<U+017F>t, untill thou come<U+017F>t unto me. Upon this, I awaked and therefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over the River, to <U+017F>ee if I can finde that tranquillity which is promi<U+017F>ed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. However, Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Leonida)</hi> you may be certain, that I <U+017F>hall never di<U+017F>obey any command which you <U+017F>hall impo<U+017F>e upon me, <U+017F>ince I do believe that the gods will <U+017F>peak by your mouth. Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e you all three, to give as ju<U+017F>t a Judgment, as I my <U+017F>elfe would receive upon the like occa<U+017F>ion: And that I may not erre in my judgment, <hi>Paris</hi> and the<U+017F>e fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es and <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>hall help me with their advice, before I pronounce the Sentence.

Let this great Nymph be moved with my arguments; let her, whom thou ha<U+017F>t given me, and who was al<U+017F>o given me by him that had the greate<U+017F>t intere<U+017F>t in her, be pre<U+017F>erved and kept for me, both again<U+017F>t her own <U+017F>corn, and again<U+017F>t the violencies of him that would ravi<U+017F>h her from me. Were it not in hopes of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from this divinity whom I invoke, I dur<U+017F>t not, great Nymph, open my mouth again<U+017F>t a per<U+017F>on, whom of all men in the world I am mo<U+017F>t obliged unto: For I mu<U+017F>t needs ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Thamires,</hi> by his <U+017F>weet indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency towards me, has more obliged me, than my Father, who gave me life; the one gave me only a being, but the other a well-being. <hi>Thamires</hi> has been troubled with all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations of my child-hood, and hath brought me up even from my Cradle; he hath <U+017F>pared no paines nor co<U+017F>t in my education, nor care nor prudence in cau<U+017F>ing me to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed; <U+017F>o as the Appellation of Father is in all rea<U+017F>on his due, and I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge my <U+017F>elfe his Child, having received from him all tho<U+017F>e indulgencies, which tho<U+017F>e names require. And in confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing all the<U+017F>e obligations, how can I open my mouth again<U+017F>t him, without incurring the ugly brand of ingratitude? If this di<U+017F>pute did depend only upon my <U+017F>elfe, I had rather be in my grave <U+017F>leeping with my fathers, and wi<U+017F>h that my Cradle had been my Coffin, rather then oppo<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires</hi> in any thing: <hi>Thamires,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, who hath made me what I am: <hi>Thamires,</hi> unto whom I owe all I have: <hi>Thamires,</hi> in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice, when I have <U+017F>pent all my life, yet halfe my obligations are not cancelled. But alas, it is all long of him<U+017F>elfe; it is Love which commanded me; he him<U+017F>elfe al<U+017F>o commanded me. Let <hi>Thamires</hi> tell me, whether it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that a heart which Love hath touched to the quick, can di<U+017F>obey him in any thing? If he have found this to be true by experience, then I do conjure him by the god of Love, who hath <U+017F>uch power over his <U+017F>oule, to pardon that fault which I have been forced to commit again<U+017F>t him; and that he give me leave to maintain, that all rea<U+017F>on ordaines <hi>Celidea</hi> to love me, and that there is none but my <U+017F>elfe that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto her. For to begin with the fir<U+017F>t point, what can <hi>Calidea</hi> an<U+017F>wer if I call her before the Throne of Love, and if in the pre<U+017F>ence of this equitable company, I do complain again<U+017F>t her in this manner? This is the fair one, Oh great god of Love, which pre<U+017F>ents her <U+017F>elf before thee<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> This is <U+017F>he whom thou ha<U+017F>t commanded me to love and <U+017F>erve, upon hopes of <U+017F>uch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as thou u<U+017F>e<U+017F>t to give unto tho<U+017F>e that follow thee. If from the fir<U+017F>t minute of my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, unto this in<U+017F>tant, I did ever contrary thy will, if I have notalwaies continued in a full re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>pend my whole life in thy obedience; Then, Oh Love, who looke<U+017F>t into all hearts, and <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t all my de<U+017F>ignes, let me be puni<U+017F>hed as a perjured villain, and let all the thunderbolts of the great <hi>Tharamis</hi> fall upon me, as a perfidious per<U+017F>on. But if truth and my words agree, and if never any loved like me, why do<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>uffer her to deceive my hopes? why does <U+017F>he not make good thy promi<U+017F>es? and why wilt thou let her laugh at all tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries, which thou ha<U+017F>t made me to endure for her? A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever I <U+017F>aw her, I loved her, and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever I loved her, I did dedicate my <U+017F>elfe and <U+017F>oul to adore her. But perhaps this affection is unknown unto her, or I have only acquainted the <U+017F>olitary Woods and Rocks with it. No, no, Oh Love, <U+017F>he hath heard my complaints, <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>een my tears, <U+017F>he knowes of my affection, <U+017F>omthing from my own mouth, more from <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Cleontina,</hi> and other of my friends; but mo<U+017F>t of all from the effects of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Has <U+017F>he not <U+017F>een me in the bed of death for her? has <U+017F>he not held me by the hand, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me from my grave, <U+017F>aying unto me, Live, live. <hi>Calidon,</hi> thy preten<U+017F>ions are not hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e? And <U+017F>ince I had <U+017F>uffered the very pangs of death, why did <U+017F>he call me from that re<U+017F>t, which my grave would have given me? If it was to make me die again without pitty, it was extream cruelty? Mu<U+017F>t I be puni<U+017F>hed with a <U+017F>econd death, for obeying and adoring her? But perhaps <U+017F>he will <U+017F>ay, that I ought to mea<U+017F>ure her by my own Ell, and con<U+017F>ider, that as I have not power to quit her and love another; <U+017F>o <U+017F>he being engaged another way, <U+017F>he cannot di<U+017F>engage her <U+017F>elfe to love me. Oh Love, the<U+017F>e are only words, bare excu<U+017F>es Let her <U+017F>hew the contract of this engagement, and if thou do<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ently adjudge it to be fal<U+017F>e,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53526:111"/>
then let me be condemned. She never loved any, but the <U+017F>hepheard <hi>Thamires,</hi> as <U+017F>he hath told me; but I dare <U+017F>ay farther, and maintain, that <U+017F>he never loved this <hi>Thamires.</hi> Did <U+017F>he love him? Alas, when? Even when <U+017F>he was not able to love, when her hands and mind were wholly taken up with childi<U+017F>h Gew-gawes; when her de<U+017F>ires could not reach any higher then to be a little Fine, or to make a Baby, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>e it, and talk to it. Was <U+017F>he not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant what Love was? or if <U+017F>he did at that age love <hi>Thamires,</hi> or thought it to be love; mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>he needs love him <U+017F>till? Alas, alas, <U+017F>uch young green affections as that is like our clothes, to be ca<U+017F>t off when we will. Oh! pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant god of Love, how ignorant was <U+017F>he, or rather, how did <U+017F>he de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e all thy <U+017F>tatutes and ordinances? Is it not by thy Lawes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a mo<U+017F>t capitall crime, to think, that ones Love <U+017F>hall ever end? What then <U+017F>hall we think of this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who could not <U+017F>o much as think, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was uncapable of de<U+017F>ire, but who is really retreated from that love, which <U+017F>he bare unto him, as <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe told <hi>Thamires?</hi> Can it be<U+017F>aid, Oh great deity, that <U+017F>he was ever one of thy <U+017F>ubjects? Wilt thou acknowledge her, or let her enjoy tho<U+017F>e priviledges which <U+017F>he pretends unto, or <U+017F>uffer her to oppo<U+017F>e me? But if it be <U+017F>o, that thy <U+017F>uper-abundant goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, which tran<U+017F>cends the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of all other deities, will allow her to enjoy the benefit of true Lovers, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he flies unto thee for <U+017F>anctuary, and may plead, that loving <hi>Thamires</hi> will not love me, no, nor <U+017F>o much as look upon me, how can <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer this, that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he would not love <hi>Thamires</hi> any longer? With what excu<U+017F>e can <U+017F>he palliate her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? And why do<U+017F>t thou not puni<U+017F>h this high di<U+017F>obedience? If thou do<U+017F>t not, then <U+017F>he is the only one, that de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing, is not puni<U+017F>hed; and I the only one, who adoring thee, does not finde the reward of thy accu<U+017F>tomed goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                           <p>I do believe, Oh great Nymph, that <hi>Celidea</hi> being thus accu<U+017F>ed before the Throne of this great deity, <U+017F>he can hardly an<U+017F>wer, nor avoid being condemned, to give me <U+017F>atisfaction for all the paines I have taken, and to render love for love, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Thamires</hi> cannot oppo<U+017F>e me with any particular intere<U+017F>t: For what intere<U+017F>t can he claim in that, which he hath freely given me? He hath e<U+017F>tated the whole title upon me, and is <U+017F>o far debarred from any right, that he ought in rea<U+017F>on rather to defend and maintain my title, again<U+017F>t all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <U+017F>ince it was from him I derived my title. But perhaps he will <U+017F>ay, that it was his meer free and voluntary act, without any con<U+017F>ideration, but his own love to me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not obliged unto any warrantie. But why, <hi>Thamires,</hi> do you call that a meer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act, which you have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed before your Judge, that you were obliged unto it by your promi<U+017F>es, unto my dying Father, unto whom you were much obliged for <U+017F>everall benevolences? Do you call that a meer free act of your will, which you were con<U+017F>trained unto to be quit of <U+017F>o many obligations? Do you think you do oblige your Creditors, by paying your due debts? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, great Nymph, that <hi>Thamires</hi> hath paid both principall and intere<U+017F>t, which renders him not to be ungratefull; but I do ab<U+017F>olutely deny, that there was nothing in this act which did oblige his will. But admit it <U+017F>o, that it was an act of his own meer free will, and that he did it of him<U+017F>elfe; did not the effect of this will aime at his own peculiar <U+017F>atisfaction? If he do but con<U+017F>ider the debt due unto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my Father, and his aime of obliging me by this act, of giving <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me, he will finde, that it was not an act of pure and meer free will, but a way to <U+017F>atisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, by paying that debt which was due to my Father, and a way to purcha<U+017F>e my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations unto him<U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>o as what he hath done is but a loan, which I mu<U+017F>t perpetually pay intere<U+017F>t for, and which he may claim as an obligation upon me to pay: If I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ail in paying my acknowledgments, he might ju<U+017F>tly call me ingrate; but he cannot <U+017F>ay that he gave me <hi>Celidea</hi> freely, <U+017F>ince in con<U+017F>ideration of him<U+017F>elfe, and by the rules of human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he was obliged unto it, and hath <U+017F>o debarred him<U+017F>elfe, as he is obliged to maintain my claim unto her, again<U+017F>t any that <U+017F>hall hinder me from enjoying her. The god of Love be my witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, Father, (for <U+017F>o I will call you as long as I live unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you forbid me) the great god of Love be my witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>ay, whether it grieves me not to the very foul, I <U+017F>hould oppo<U+017F>e you in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. You your <U+017F>elfe doe know, in what a <U+017F>ad condition you have <U+017F>een me: You know, how Love had almo<U+017F>t brought me to my grave, and you mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that it was the power of Love which compelled me to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you; <U+017F>uch was the force upon me, that I had no free will unto it at all but was forced by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ive nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity unto it: Nothing el<U+017F>e under the Sun could have made me contradict your commands; if there be let the gods puni<U+017F>h me as the mo<U+017F>t ungratefull per<U+017F>on that ever breathed. But Father, <U+017F>ince there was an unre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table force upon me, I be<U+017F>eech you pardon my weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and do not you your <U+017F>elfe help me to complain again<U+017F>t you; for, were not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53526:111"/>
you the cau<U+017F>e of all this? For <U+017F>ince it was wholly in your di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e, why did you bring me from among<U+017F>t the <hi>Boyens</hi> before you had married <hi>Celidea?</hi> Could you think, that being your Kin<U+017F>man, I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ympathize with you, and <U+017F>o be in danger to love her as well as you? But perhaps you will <U+017F>ay, that you thought your command upon me not to love her, was enough to keep me within the bounds of my duty, and make me look upon her onely as my Si<U+017F>ter. But, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires,</hi> I doe wonder you <U+017F>hould not remember the follies of youth; and that it is the nature not onely of all tho<U+017F>e of that age, but generally of all men what<U+017F>oever, to think things that are mo<U+017F>t forbidden to be mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>weet: I admire you <U+017F>hould forbid me loving her before ever I <U+017F>aw her, as if you had a minde to make me love her by the ear, before <U+017F>he was <U+017F>een by the eye. What was this, but to awaken my de<U+017F>ires, and to kindle a fire; like a Flint which is <U+017F>trucken, which before was cold, and had no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heate in it.</p>
                           <p>But perhaps again you will <U+017F>ay, that you did allow me to love her in the degree of a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter, and <U+017F>o limit my de<U+017F>ires as I <U+017F>hould neither offend you nor my <U+017F>elfe; you in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>training me too much, and me in not confining me too narrowly, but allowing me to keep within your pre<U+017F>cribed limits.</p>
                           <p>But, O great Nymph, con<U+017F>ider, I be<U+017F>eech you, what kind of command this was: <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> <U+017F>hewes me a beauty of an infinite lu<U+017F>tre, allows me conver<U+017F>e with her; commands me to love her, but will not have my love <U+017F>tir one foot beyond his limit, nor love her above the quality of a Brother. Oh heavens! what did he think I was made of? Can Love that thinkes the whole univer<U+017F>e too narrow a compa<U+017F><U+017F>e to be confined unto, and who di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth of all our wills according to his plea<U+017F>ure be hemmed up in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trait limits as hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribes? Will Love be ruled and governed by the will of any but him<U+017F>elfe? But what in the name of Heaven does <hi>Thamires</hi> thinke of me? Does hee conceive that I have more power than either Men or Gods, or the whole World hath? It had been but ju<U+017F>t to have mea<U+017F>ured me by him<U+017F>elf; and if he could have tamed his own affections and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, then might he have had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to impo<U+017F>e the like task upon me: But that hee who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his own <U+017F>trength, and of Loves power, for him, I <U+017F>ay to command a thing which he him<U+017F>elfe could not ob<U+017F>erve, who<U+017F>e age and experience had great advantage over my green years, this was too much, too unrea<U+017F>onable. Perhaps again he wil complain, that I have not payd him <U+017F>uch re<U+017F>pect as is due unto a Father, &amp; that his great indulgency towards me might very well oblige me unto much more than all this. Ala<U+017F>s, ala<U+017F>s, does he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider, that what I did was done by compul<U+017F>ion; and that I had rather dye than fail in any point of duty to him? The torments I did endure, when I was in the very Arms of death, is a <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timony of all this. The grave Phy<U+017F>ician found it by my Pul<U+017F>e, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my complexion: Let him con<U+017F>ider, that <U+017F>uch was my re<U+017F>pect of him, that I cho<U+017F>e death rather than I would di<U+017F>cover the cau<U+017F>e of my Malady. If he will blame any, he mu<U+017F>t blame Nature, for not giving me power to command my Interior motions, as well as my Tongue and exterior actions and parts: Ala<U+017F>s, I would never have received life from him but on condition that <hi>Celidea</hi> might be mine: I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that never man was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto another than I am to him; I know that never Kin<U+017F>man received more indulgent kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e from another Kin<U+017F>man; nor ever any Child greater te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of affection from a Father than I did from <hi>Thamires</hi> when he re<U+017F>igned <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me: But now at this time, <U+017F>ince he offers to ravi<U+017F>h her from me, May I not rightly <U+017F>ay, that never man received greater injury from another? never Co<U+017F>en more unkindne<U+017F>s from a Co<U+017F>en, nor child more tyrannique treatment from a Father, than <hi>Calidon</hi> from <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?</hi> So as now all my former obligations to him, are cancelled and changed into <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injuries: For, <hi>Thamires,</hi> though it is true, you had a care of mee in my very cradle, though you have brought me up with all indulgent care; though you have declared mee your Heir, yet for all the<U+017F>e, if you doe deprive mee of that thing which farre above all the world is mo<U+017F>t dear unto me, and which you your <U+017F>elf did give me, doe you not give me a death much wor<U+017F>e than that which you pre<U+017F>erved me from? And if I doe not enjoy that which you would ravi<U+017F>h from me; your e<U+017F>tate, your education, nay, my life it <U+017F>elf is of no value unto me. Con<U+017F>ider, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires,</hi> that to take back a gift by force, doth more offend him that did receive it, than if being asked it had been denied him; and therefore, wonder not if I <U+017F>ay that this act hath cancelled all my obligations unto you. Which to prevent, I be<U+017F>eech you joyn with me, and own what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto <hi>Celidea</hi> on your behalf; How is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, my fair Daughter (would I have you <U+017F>ay unto her) that <hi>Calidons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affection <U+017F>hould find no acceptance from you? Will all my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of him reach no farther than your eares, and have no effectual influence upon
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53526:112"/>
your <U+017F>oul? Have you not often promi<U+017F>ed that I <U+017F>hould have the ab<U+017F>olute di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of you? If it be <U+017F>o, why doe you not make good your promi<U+017F>e? Did I ever propo<U+017F>e any unto you who was not worthy to be loved? Is he whom I doe now motion unto you <U+017F>uch a one, or unknown to you, or without kindred or friends? I beleeve there is not a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in all the Country, that would not thinke his amity to be advantageous unto her. The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cleontine</hi> thinks it <U+017F>o, and <U+017F>o does your Mother, though out of an over-fond tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he will not command you any thing again<U+017F>t your mind: But perhaps you <U+017F>ay, that, <hi>Thamires,</hi> it is you only whom I love, and cannot love any other; unto you have I wholly given my <U+017F>elf; you have the ab<U+017F>olute power over me, and may do any thing with me but giving me unto another. The heavens doe know, my fair Daughter, how plea<U+017F>ing this declaration of yours is unto me, and that there is nothing under heaven can be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto me: But if you doe indeed love me, you will endeavour to pre<U+017F>erve my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and love me under the name of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who is my very <U+017F>elf, and of my very blood. As for his <U+017F>oul, he loves you as I doe, <U+017F>o as there is a <U+017F>ympathy betwixt us: And <U+017F>ince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t friends, all things are in common, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ince I love him, I have nothing he hath not a <U+017F>hare in as well as my <U+017F>elf: So as if I have any <U+017F>hare in your affection, as you <U+017F>ay I have, he mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary con<U+017F>equence be a participant with me. Doe not complain again<U+017F>t me for this, and <U+017F>ay, that I break faith with you, and change you for another; for I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved never to love any but you; you, you onely were the beginning, and <U+017F>hall bee the end of my affection. But <U+017F>ince De<U+017F>tiny forbids me to enjoy you, and con<U+017F>trains mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath you unto another, both by the Laws of Duty and Nature, I <U+017F>hall think it, faire Daughter, an infinite contentment to <U+017F>ee you his whom I have made choice of, whom I have brought up, whom I love, and whom I have cho<U+017F>en, not onely for my Heir, but al<U+017F>o for my Companion in all the e<U+017F>tate which the Heavens and Fortune hath, or for the future <U+017F>hall give me. You are obliged unto this by our Friend<U+017F>hip, as well as I am by my duty. Love therefore my <hi>Calidon,</hi> if ever you loved me, and make it thereby appear, that you are but a Lover, and Religious towards the Gods, who certainly would never have given me liberty to part with you again<U+017F>t my will, had they not <U+017F>o decreed it in their infallible De<U+017F>tinies.</p>
                           <p>Great, and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, this is the language which <hi>Thamires</hi> doth, or ought to u<U+017F>e, of which I am onely the in<U+017F>trument; And which, as I conceive, is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o worthy of him<U+017F>elf, as I hope he will not di<U+017F>own it. And therefore, after I have vowed by the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> that <hi>Calidon</hi> doth infinitely love <hi>Celidea,</hi> and that there never was a more faithfull Lover than he, I will u<U+017F>e no other arguments or rea<U+017F>ons but his own, and <U+017F>o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring my life, my death, my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, my mi<U+017F>ery, and my All unto your wi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cretion I pray unto the Gods to endue you with all Wi<U+017F>dom and Ju<U+017F>tice.</p>

they will make me love by force, and compel me to love and hate according to their wills.</p>
                           <p>I have heard our great and wi<U+017F>e <hi>Druids</hi> <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom we <U+017F>ee erected upon our Altars, with a Club in his hand, and a Lyons skin upon his <U+017F>houlders, was in his time a great <hi>Hero,</hi> who by his <U+017F>trength and valour quelled Mon<U+017F>ters, and was a great Patron of Truth.

To him therefore do I addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ubdue the<U+017F>e mon<U+017F>trous <U+017F>pirits, and to furni<U+017F>h me with <U+017F>o much elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and audacity as may make my rea<U+017F>ons apparent unto my Judges. I be<U+017F>eech thee therefore, by thy valour, O great <hi>Hercules,</hi> and by the fair <hi>Galathea</hi> our Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee to deliver me from the<U+017F>e mon<U+017F>trous Lovers, and <U+017F>o to cleare my rea<U+017F>ons unto this Nymph, that <U+017F>he may give a ju<U+017F>t judgement, and keep me from loving both <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And to begin, what do<U+017F>t thou mean, <hi>Calidon,</hi> by calling me before the God of Love, whom thou do<U+017F>t make both thy Judge and thy God? Do<U+017F>t thou think, that he hath any power over us, who are a<U+017F>hamed that his Name <U+017F>hould be in our mouths, though it do reach our ears? A Maid, <hi>Calidon,</hi> who ever <U+017F>corned to have any thing to do with this Love, is now <U+017F>ummoned to appear before his Throne to receive her doom: And can<U+017F>t thou expect I will make any other an<U+017F>wer, but that let this God of Love doom what he will I will not obey him? But I prethee tell me, when I have ob<U+017F>erved his <U+017F>tatutes, and am con<U+017F>trained to live according to his will, what recompence may I expect from him? onely this, to be called the mo<U+017F>t amorous Maid in all the Country. A very brave and honourable title indeed for a maid of any quality, and one that de<U+017F>ires to live without a blemi<U+017F>h upon her honour. Therefore, Oh Shepheard, never <U+017F>ummon mee before his Tribunal who<U+017F>e Power and Juri<U+017F>diction I will not acknowledge, and unto whom I doe declare my <U+017F>elf to bee an enemy.</p>
                           <p>If you will have me give an an<U+017F>wer, let us both appeal unto Virtue and Rea<U+017F>on, and certainly wee need not goe any farther than this great Nymph, who is plea<U+017F>ed to take <U+017F>o much pains to hear our differences. Before her I <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer unto any thing you have or can object; which as I conceive may be reduced unto three heads: Fir<U+017F>t, that I ought to love you, becau<U+017F>e you love me, and becau<U+017F>e I knew it: Secondly, becau<U+017F>e the favours which you received from me in your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and which, as you <U+017F>ay, cau<U+017F>ed your cure, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me: And la<U+017F>tly, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires</hi> hath given me unto you.</p>
                           <p>But, Madam, that I may give full an<U+017F>wers unto all the<U+017F>e objections, I be<U+017F>eech you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to an<U+017F>wer unto my que<U+017F>tions, that you may come to the knowledge of the Truth out of his own mouth. I ask you, <hi>Calidon,</hi> what allurement did I u<U+017F>e, to make you in love, the fir<U+017F>t time you begun to love me? When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent, and gave no an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf unto the Nymph; Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I be<U+017F>eech you command him to an<U+017F>wer me: And <hi>Leonida</hi> appointing him <U+017F>o to doe; You ask me a que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>aid he, which you your <U+017F>elf can be<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve; but <U+017F>ince you will needs have it from my mouth, I will tell you; It was the favour which I received from you, in being plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>hew your <U+017F>elf unto me at the Sacrifice which was celebrated at the <U+017F>ixth of the month. Was I the onely woman that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted at the Sacrifice (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celidea)</hi> and were you the only Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the Town that was there? No, an<U+017F>wered hee, for almo<U+017F>t all the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es and Shepheards of the Town were there al<U+017F>o. What one act was it, I be<U+017F>eech you, replyed <U+017F>he, that did attract your affection? In this, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t acknowledge that my love was the decree of heaven; You did no <U+017F>ooner turn your eyes towards me, but as <U+017F>oon as ever I <U+017F>aw you, I loved you, as if I were forced unto it by <U+017F>ome interior power, which it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. But perhaps (<U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e) when I knew you did love me, did I u<U+017F>e any art to cheri<U+017F>h it, or augment it by any fre<U+017F>h favours? No, <U+017F>aid he, my affection did beginne without you, continue without you, and augment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, I mean without your contributing any thing unto it but by being your <U+017F>elf. But on the contrary, the fir<U+017F>t time you knew it (for though I did not di<U+017F>cover it by my words, yet I knew you did perceive it) Oh what har<U+017F>h treatment did I receive from you? And what extreame di<U+017F>like have you <U+017F>ince <U+017F>hewed? So as if I be as you <U+017F>ay, a Mon<U+017F>ter of Love, I am <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e it is a thing mo<U+017F>t mon<U+017F>trous that a Lover <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o long pre<U+017F>erve his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maugre <U+017F>o many rigorous affronts and cau<U+017F>es of hatred; for I may <U+017F>afely <U+017F>ay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of your actions towards me de<U+017F>erves no other name but of Rigour and Hatred: So

as it is apparent when you came to vi<U+017F>it me in my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, your de<U+017F>ign was to <U+017F>ave my life, onely that afterwards you might murder me more cruelly. Then <hi>Celidea</hi> replyed thus; You <U+017F>ee, great and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, by <hi>Calidons</hi> own mouth, that if hee did love me, it was without any contributing to it by me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e by being my <U+017F>elf; and again<U+017F>t that, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can I invent? What would he an<U+017F>wer if I <U+017F>hould ask him the<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions before the Throne of Rea<U+017F>on and your <U+017F>elf: Since Shepheard I never did con<U+017F>ent unto any of your addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, why would you have me participate in your own troubles, <U+017F>hame, and errours? Is it not enough that I have all this while endured your importunities without revenge? You doe love me you <U+017F>ay, and becau<U+017F>e you love me, I mu<U+017F>t love you again: But pray hear what Rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>aith; You have loved <hi>Celidea,</hi> and in loving her, you have offended her, and what other recompence can you expect from her but hatred? The truth is, Shepheard, that being unwilling to be revenged of you, as in rea<U+017F>on I might, I contented my <U+017F>elf with hating you in my very <U+017F>oul, and for <hi>Thamires</hi> his <U+017F>ake I pardoned the re<U+017F>t. If you doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that I doe know of your love by your teares, and by your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e: Ala<U+017F><U+017F>e, this does not oblige mee one jot the more to love you, but rather to hate you more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.</p>
                           <p>Tell me, <hi>Calidon,</hi> <U+017F>ince <hi>Thamires</hi> hath taken <U+017F>o much care to bring you up in literature, and travails, in what part of the world have you <U+017F>een it decent for a young maid as I am, to love, or <U+017F>uffer her <U+017F>elf to be loved? If it bee not the cu<U+017F>tome in any place of the world, but where Vice is held for Virtue, doe you not infinitely offend in tempting mee to that which is contrary to my duty? You love me, you <U+017F>ay, becau<U+017F>e you cannot chu<U+017F>e but doe <U+017F>o. Good friend, how am I obliged unto you, for doing that, which you cannot chu<U+017F>e but do? You do excu<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe to <hi>Thamires,</hi> for loving me again<U+017F>t his will, by <U+017F>aying, that you are not to blame, becau<U+017F>e you are forced unto it. Can you think your <U+017F>elf exempt from blame, in <U+017F>inning by compul<U+017F>ion? and do you think your <U+017F>elfe worthy of recompence, for being forced unto a thing, who<U+017F>e contrary de<U+017F>erves a recompence? Either confe<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe culpable towards <hi>Thamires,</hi> or el<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>e <U+017F>eeking a recompence for your forced <U+017F>ervice, But if you do love me again<U+017F>t my will, am I to be puni<U+017F>hed for it? Did I ever entreat you to it? did I ever give you any occa<U+017F>ion? You <U+017F>ay, No. Will your love be any contentment or advantage unto me? Shall I become more fair, more vertuous, or ever the better by it? Oh heavens! <hi>Calidon,</hi> where are your wits? Are you mad, to ask a recompence, where a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment is de<U+017F>erved?

I believe you will <U+017F>ay, that I <U+017F>hould not have flattered you in your errour, nor kept you alive when you were <U+017F>ick by giving you good language. But, <hi>Calidon,</hi> have I not good cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, you are an ungratefull man and does not acknowledge the good office I did you, in mi<U+017F>con<U+017F>truing of it, and taking it in another <U+017F>en<U+017F>e then you ought. Did a guilty per<U+017F>on ever finde or think his Judge too milde or <U+017F>weet? or, did any offendor ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that in lieu of puni<U+017F>hment, he received favour and courte<U+017F>y? Becau<U+017F>e I wi<U+017F>hed not your death, am I blamable for <U+017F>aving your life? You accu<U+017F>e me for having pitty upon you, and <U+017F>hewing favour in<U+017F>tead of revenge, and would have me puni<U+017F>hed for it. Judge, Madam, how his under<U+017F>tanding is out of the way, and how he takes rea<U+017F>on the wrong way. But Shepheard, neither blame me, nor commend me for my act, <U+017F>ince according to your own argument, it was an act forced upon me, which ought neither to be recompen<U+017F>ed nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed. It was my affection to <hi>Thamires,</hi> who conjured me unto it by all the obliging arguments he could devi<U+017F>e, which induced me unto it. I <U+017F>ee, <hi>Calidon,</hi> that you do <U+017F>mile, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, it was my affection unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> which moved me to treat you in that manner, becau<U+017F>e you conceive, that <U+017F>he who a little before did declare her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>uch an enemy to Love, cannot now well <U+017F>ay, that Love had <U+017F>uch an influence upon her <U+017F>oul. But Shepheard, you are much mi<U+017F>taken, if you think, that in being an enemy unto Love, I am <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o unto Amity and friend<U+017F>hip, or void of that vertue, which makes us think of things as they ought to be. I have heard <U+017F>ay, great Nymph, that one may love two manner of wayes; the one according to rea<U+017F>on; the other, according to de<U+017F>ire. That which hath rea<U+017F>on for its rule, is called vertuous and hone<U+017F>t Amity; and that which <U+017F>uffers it <U+017F>elfe to be tran<U+017F>ported with de<U+017F>ire, Love. With the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e we do love our Parents, our Kindred, our Friends, our Country, and both in generall and particular, all tho<U+017F>e in whom any vertue <U+017F>hines. As for the other, tho<U+017F>e that are infected with it, are tran<U+017F>ported and di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, as with a frenzy Feavour, and do commit <U+017F>o many gro<U+017F><U+017F>e faults, that the name of it is as infamous among<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons of honour, as the other is good and laudable.</p>

I <U+017F>hall without a blu<U+017F>h then confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I did love <hi>Thamires,</hi> but withall I mu<U+017F>t tell you, it was for his vertue. If <hi>Calidon</hi> do ask me, how I can di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h and di<U+017F>cern between the<U+017F>e two kinds of affection, <U+017F>ince the one does commonly appear in the habit of the other? I <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer him, that the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cleontine</hi> teaching me how to behave my <U+017F>elfe in the world, did give me the difference: Daughter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, my age hath furni<U+017F>hed me with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in many things, and hath taught me, that things are the mo<U+017F>t certainly known by their effects; and the better to di<U+017F>cern after what manner we are loved, con<U+017F>ider the actions of tho<U+017F>e that love us; if you finde them to be irregular, and contrary to rea<U+017F>on, vertue, or duty, flie them as di<U+017F>honourable; if on the contrary you finde them to be moderate, and not ramping beyond the limits of hone<U+017F>ty or duty, then cheri<U+017F>h them, and e<U+017F>teem them as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. This <U+017F>apient le<U+017F><U+017F>on, Shepheard, teacheth me to cheri<U+017F>h the affection of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and to flie yours: For what effect does the love of <hi>Calidon</hi> produce? Violencies, raptures, tran<U+017F>ports, and de<U+017F>pairs, were never the effects of vertue. If the love of <hi>Thamires</hi> be con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we <U+017F>hall finde it to be all vertue: When did he begin to love me? At a time, when there was no likelyhood any vice could invite him to it. How has he continued this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? So, as neither duty nor hone<U+017F>ty could take the lea<U+017F>t exception again<U+017F>t it. But why did he give over? For the rea<U+017F>ons which he him<U+017F>elfe hath given. Whether rea<U+017F>on do not appear in all this, I refer my <U+017F>elfe, Madam, unto your judgment. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations moved me to entertain the affection of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and reject the love of <hi>Calidon.</hi> And this Amity, and nothing el<U+017F>e, did enforce me to vi<U+017F>it this Shepheard when he was <U+017F>ick; to give him <U+017F>uch good words as might recover him; and all this, as well to <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Thamires,</hi> as out of a naturall compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which all ought to have one unto another. If I did fail in my love to <hi>Thamires, Calidon,</hi> for your <U+017F>atisfaction, I will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it and repent, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tation, to love <hi>Thamires</hi> no more, nor fall into the like fault. But I cannot believe, that therefore I am obliged to love you; for if I <U+017F>hould, it would be to correct one errour by committing another, which is wor<U+017F>e. Perhaps you will alledge again<U+017F>t my defence, that having given the whole di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of my <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> and he transferring me into your hands, I cannot contradict his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>all of me. This is an excellent conclu<U+017F>ion indeed: I chu<U+017F>e you for my husband pre<U+017F>ently after you may give me unto another; this is very fine Logick. You mu<U+017F>t know, <hi>Calidon,</hi> that the rea<U+017F>on why I gave <hi>Thamires</hi> all the power of my <U+017F>elfe, was, becau<U+017F>e I did love him, and he loved me; and therefore if he have any power over me, he mu<U+017F>t love, that is the implicite condition of his power; but if he do not, then, the cau<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>ing, the effect mu<U+017F>t needs cea<U+017F>e: and therefore if he do not love me, he hath no power over me. But haply you will reply, that he <U+017F>wears he does continue loving me <U+017F>till, and that it is rea<U+017F>on, not want of affection, which made him transfer me over unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I mu<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer both him and you, Shepheard, that I do not believe him; and yet, if rea<U+017F>on can <U+017F>o well per<U+017F>wade with his affection, why <U+017F>hould not rea<U+017F>on have as much power over my affection? Is there any rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould love him, whom nature and rea<U+017F>on both forbids me to love?

Does he yet hope for any love from her, whom he hath mo<U+017F>t ungratefully wronged? Whan colour, and upon what ground can he de<U+017F>ire me to love him?

Madam, had been <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on at that time; but now, <U+017F>ince he has left loving me, and would force me to love another and not him<U+017F>elf, why does he urge unto me the time pa<U+017F>t, which is not, nor ever will return? The memory of that time is an argument to hate him the more, <U+017F>ince I do finde him at this pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o unworthy. I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I did love him; but, when he re<U+017F>igned me unto another, he did demon<U+017F>tratively <U+017F>hew, that he neither did nor does love me: And therefore let him not think it <U+017F>trange that <U+017F>ince my affection did proceed from his mine <U+017F>hould cea<U+017F>e as well as his; for his was the cau<U+017F>e, and mine the effect, and the cau<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>ing, the effect mu<U+017F>t follow. Why did he cut up a Tree, from which he expected fruit? He hath done me more wrong then I him, <U+017F>ince he was the fir<U+017F>t offendor, and yet I am <U+017F>atisfied, I complain not, I can quit him with a very good will, and cannot wi<U+017F>h he <U+017F>hould court me again, becau<U+017F>e it is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to obtain me. What is it he would now have? Does he not know, that as long as our love was mutuall, I was his, and he was mine, and then by the Lawes of Amity he might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me as his own? If he have given me unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> how can he pretend me to be his? If he have any thing to require from me, he mu<U+017F>t addre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to him unto whom he hath given me; if he can have his con<U+017F>ent, I will afterwards con<U+017F>ider what I have to do; if he cannot, why does he complain of me? or ask me, for what he has given away? He hath <U+017F>acrificed me, as he <U+017F>aith, to <hi>Calidon's</hi> health, manife<U+017F>ting thereby, that <hi>Calidon</hi> was dearer unto him, than I was, and in very good time: But can he not be contented, that his <U+017F>acrifice is accepted, and that his deer <hi>Calidon</hi> is recovered from death? Would he <U+017F>o <U+017F>acrilegiou<U+017F>ly recall, what he has dedicated unto the gods? Remove, <hi>Thamires,</hi> all <U+017F>uch thoughts out of your <U+017F>oul, le<U+017F>t the gods do puni<U+017F>h you for it; and do not hope, that <U+017F>ince I have been offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gods for the health of <hi>Calidon,</hi> I will ever <U+017F>toop <U+017F>o low as men again. The truth is, <U+017F>ince I have been <U+017F>o ill treated by the man whom I mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teemed, it would be extream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in me, to put my <U+017F>elfe into his hands again, who knew not how to make any better u<U+017F>e of me Perhaps <hi>Thamires</hi> would have me again, that he might <U+017F>om other time <U+017F>ave the life of <U+017F>ome friend or kin<U+017F>man; or el<U+017F>e courts me now, to keep me again<U+017F>t <hi>Calidon</hi> fall <U+017F>ick again: But be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that my own life is much deerer unto me, then his life is unto whom you have given me; and therefore I have all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to look unto my <U+017F>elfe before any other. If I did be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>ome tears at thy departure <hi>Thamires,</hi> I will laugh at your return. Oh, how liberall you are, to give away that which is anothers? But, Oh you hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, how ju<U+017F>t you are, <U+017F>ince when you <U+017F>aw me offended by the<U+017F>e two Shepheards, and knowing my innocency, you would vouch<U+017F>afe to take me into your protection, and have revenged my quarrell, even by my enemies them<U+017F>elves. What di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure does this perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous man receive, even from him unto whom he hath given me? And what torments does this importunate per<U+017F>ecutor of my re<U+017F>t receive, even from him, who gave him all the right he has to pretend unto me? What le<U+017F><U+017F>e can be expected upon them, than divine vengeance? And I make no que<U+017F>tion, Madam, but you will ratifie the doom of heaven, and give <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on my <U+017F>ide.</p>

                           <p>I Perceive, great Nymph, it happens to me, as unto him that made a <U+017F>word for one, who thru<U+017F>t it into his heart; for I, that educated this Shepheard and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e with as much indulgent care as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; I that taught them to <U+017F>peak, and how to live in the world; yet the<U+017F>e two do wound me to the very heart and <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>o as I have no hopes left, but in your favourable judgment. It <U+017F>eemes, they make me the very Butt of their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and would have me bear all their own faults; but, though the<U+017F>e a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ions do deeply wound me, yet, I had rather be the offended, then the offending party: And truly, I am naturally <U+017F>uch a deadly hater of ingratitude, which is the bane of all humane <U+017F>ociety, that I had rather receive the blow from the hand of another, then give it.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps by acknowledging the faults which you both have committed, you will be a<U+017F>hamed, and repent of the wrongs you have done me, in requitall of all my indulgency towards you: And then, all your gilded language which you have employed to my ruine, will be a <U+017F>hame unto your <U+017F>elves, <U+017F>ince I do <U+017F>till love you both, and <U+017F>ince my affection is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53526:114"/>
yet much above all the injuries you have done me. Now, my children, I doe pardon you, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by the follies of your youth; but then, I do expect you <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F><U+017F>e your faults, and acknowledge my favours, and that you doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e a le<U+017F><U+017F>e affection than mine, could never pardon <U+017F>uch ingratitude. I perceive, Madam, that I doe <U+017F>peake unto deafe ears, and <U+017F>pend my advice upon <U+017F>tones which hear me not. I have hither to applied the mo<U+017F>t milde medicines, to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e would cure them, but <U+017F>ince Lenitives will not doe, Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ives mu<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>ince they continue <U+017F>till ob<U+017F>tinate, I mu<U+017F>t pur<U+017F>ue them with Fire and Sword.</p>
                           <p>The<U+017F>e are the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Calidon</hi> hath alleadged: You have given <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me, and you are obliged unto it by the confidence which my Father did put in you, by the affection which you profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto me, and by your hopes of obliging me. And you have offended me much more in offering to take her from me after the gift of her; than if you had at the fir<U+017F>t denyed her unto me: This, great Nymph, is all he hath <U+017F>aid with <U+017F>uch a huge flouri<U+017F>h of words, both again<U+017F>t mee, again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe, and again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on.</p>
                           <p>Ungratefull Shepheard, wilt thou thus trample upon my goodne<U+017F>s and indulging over thee? You <U+017F>ay that I did give <hi>Celidea</hi> unto you; and why I be<U+017F>eech you, did I give her? was it was becau<U+017F>e I was weary of her, or onely to plea<U+017F>e you? No, no, <U+017F>ay you, it was only to <U+017F>ave my life. Well then, you mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you owe your life unto me; and are you not extreamly ungratefull in offering to take his life away that pre<U+017F>erved yours? If I did give her unto you onely to <U+017F>ave your life, what wrong is it to aske her againe, now your life is <U+017F>aved, and you well? But haply you will <U+017F>ay, that though you are recovered, yet it was onely in hopes that <hi>Celidea</hi> <U+017F>hould remaine with you; what though you have recovered your health, <U+017F>ince now you are not in any danger? Courte<U+017F>ie and di<U+017F>cretion teacheth us, that when in ca<U+017F>es of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity wee make u<U+017F>e of any thing which is our friends, we <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>tore it with the intere<U+017F>t of thanks. It <U+017F>eems you are very farre from <U+017F>o much courte<U+017F>ie and di<U+017F>cretion, <U+017F>ince when I gave you <U+017F>ome hopes of <hi>Celideas</hi> favour, and gave you thereby your life, now you are recovered you would take her and them for your own, and endeavour by glo<U+017F>ing language to cover your ingratitude. But, Madam, perhaps he wil <U+017F>ay, that if I do take her from him, he <U+017F>hall fall into the <U+017F>ame danger he was before: No, great Nymph, you <U+017F>ee by experience that now he is a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> will never be his, he onely grows a little more melancholly; but his life is not at all in danger, and therefore to <U+017F>ave his life being the rea<U+017F>on of my act, and not the <U+017F>atisfying of his plea<U+017F>ure; <U+017F>ince his life is <U+017F>aved, I may without offence take her back unto my <U+017F>elf. But admit his life were at the <U+017F>take, would not my life be the <U+017F>ame? For <U+017F>hould I bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this fair one, death would be more certain unto me than life. Judge, Madam, I be<U+017F>eech you, whether I ought not to have a greater care of my <U+017F>elf than him. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I ought to yeeld <hi>Celidea</hi> unto him, to <U+017F>ave his life becau<U+017F>e his Father loved mee, and recommended him unto me, why does he not as well conceive him<U+017F>elf obliged to yeeld her unto me, <U+017F>ince my life is as well concerned, and that upon the very <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>ideration of amity which his Father profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto me; Is it not his duty to have as great a care of my life as I had of his? He knows, ungrateful man that he is, I cannot live if I be denyed her, and is he not extreamly ungratefull if he doe deny her unto me? Is hee not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the title of Son unto him that hath <U+017F>o much loved him? Can he think, that becau<U+017F>e I loved him, therefore I am obliged to part from the thing which is mo<U+017F>t of all the world dear unto me? Is he not unworthy the name of Kin<U+017F>man, <U+017F>ince he does not value my life? Nay, may I not di<U+017F>own him for a Friend, <U+017F>ince he will not doe the <U+017F>ame offices for mee in my nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, which I did for him? Nay more; May I not account him the mo<U+017F>t cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my I have, <U+017F>ince he pur<U+017F>ues me again<U+017F>t all rea<U+017F>on, with <U+017F>uch violent arguments to my very death? The very thought of Ingratitude from <U+017F>uch as we have obliged, is <U+017F>o extreamly odious unto all, as I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly give punctual an<U+017F>wers unto every particular in<U+017F>tance of this Shepheard, who hath <U+017F>o extreamly offended me. Give me leave, I be<U+017F>eech you, Madam, to pre<U+017F>ent this offer unto him in a few words; As he ows his life unto mee for yeelding <hi>Celidea</hi> unto him, I will relea<U+017F>e him of that obligation, <U+017F>o he will yeeld her again unto me. And to make it appear that he is out of all danger, he cannot deny but that it is above a month <U+017F>ince <hi>Celidea</hi> refu<U+017F>ed him: She told him that <U+017F>he would never love him; <U+017F>he let him know that her Mother promi<U+017F>ed not to marry her again<U+017F>t her con<U+017F>ent, and at the <U+017F>ame time told him, that heaven and earth <U+017F>hould meet before <U+017F>he would contract any affection with him; yet for all this, ye <U+017F>ee he lives, and <U+017F>trives to take away the life of him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53526:115"/>
that did pre<U+017F>erve him. Since he is mo<U+017F>t certainly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that <hi>Celidea</hi> will never be his, is he not the mo<U+017F>t ungratefull per<U+017F>on in the world, in offering to hinder mee from obtaining her? There is not any hopes for him, and hee would al<U+017F>o ruin all mine. Should he de<U+017F>ire that another <U+017F>hould enjoy this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e before me, the whole world would never know the like Ingratitude. I gave him that which was mine, and hee will not let me have that which is not his: I <U+017F>aved his life by depriving my <U+017F>elf of that which was mo<U+017F>t deare unto me, and he will refu<U+017F>e that unto me which never was his. But, great Nymph, all the<U+017F>e hot di<U+017F>putes 'twixt him and me, are me-thinks, to no purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince his misfortune, and my too much affection unto him, hath taken from us both, that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which we are di<U+017F>puting about. What right can you have unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he does not love you? You will <U+017F>ay no other, but from your affection to her, and from my gift. But, Shepheard, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can you have from your affection, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he di<U+017F>dains and refu<U+017F>eth you? And what can you pretend unto by my gift, <U+017F>ince I gave you no more than what I had my <U+017F>elf to give? Now all the right that I had, depended upon her own will, and if this will be contrary unto mine, what power or right had I in it? Therefore, Shepheard, you can have none, nor make the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>haddow of pretence unto any. Now, I be<U+017F>eech you, let us <U+017F>ee what right I my <U+017F>elf can pretend unto. Oh heavens, how great would it be if there was no <hi>Calidon</hi> in being? An affection begun in the Cradle, <U+017F>o long carefully continued; a court<U+017F>hip <U+017F>o full of pure intentions; an affection <U+017F>o violent, and <U+017F>o long in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of favours; all the<U+017F>e would make my cau<U+017F>e very <U+017F>trong, if <hi>Calidon</hi> were not in the world, or had no eyes, or el<U+017F>e if he could have guided them according to rea<U+017F>on.</p>
                           <p>I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, fair <hi>Celidea</hi> (and <U+017F>o I do with teares in my eyes, and <U+017F>orrow in my heart) that you have more rea<U+017F>on to complain of me than all your words and mine can expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. I acknowledge, that never did any affection receive a greater affront than yours hath by my imprudency; yet who <U+017F>hould endure, nay overcome great difficulties, but tho<U+017F>e who have <U+017F>trength and courage? 'Tis true, I have extreamly wronged you, but may not you make this an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew how highly you can love, by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by and pardoning <U+017F>uch an offence? What te<U+017F>timonies of your love have you heretofore promi<U+017F>ed me? What is it which you have not <U+017F>aid you would <U+017F>urmount for my <U+017F>ake? I do now <U+017F>ummon you unto your promi<U+017F>es, and put you to the Te<U+017F>t; And what greater te<U+017F>timony can you give, then by this occa<U+017F>ion which I now offer unto you? When I did oblige you by my <U+017F>ervices, by my affection, and by all manner of ob<U+017F>equious ob<U+017F>ervancie, you did continue your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto me: But this is no te<U+017F>timony of affection, it is rather an acknowledgement of a debt: It had been a right te<U+017F>timony of your affection, if you had continued when I did hate you. Fortune would have this occa<U+017F>ion to pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf, though I am extreamly <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it, to put you to the tryal of your affection; and as a <U+017F>ummons to keep your word: I hope you are not like unto tho<U+017F>e, who vaunt that they doe not fear dangers, yet at the very fir<U+017F>t encounter of an enemy, will <U+017F>ubmit without re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. But you objected again<U+017F>t me, How can you hope, <hi>Thamires,</hi> to gather any fruits from love, <U+017F>ince you have cut up the Tree? Oh fair <hi>Celidea</hi> let me tell you, I had rather cut away my life than that deare Tree of Love: Nay, though I <U+017F>hould offer it, yet it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to do it. But admit that I had imprudently cut it up, you know that the Mirtle is the Tree of Love, and why would you have it to be the Cypre<U+017F>s? The Mirtle is of a nature, that the more it is cut, the more branches it puts forth. Oh that I could <U+017F>ee this effect in your <U+017F>oul, that I might beleeve there is growing in you this Tree of Love, and not a Tree of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>But admit my fault, in guilting you, to bee <U+017F>o great as you make it, mu<U+017F>t my fault make you to commit the like? If you think <U+017F>o, then you mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that you catch at bad examples, and not at good ones, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I doe leave you, <U+017F>o you leave me, and when I doe return unto you, you doe return unto me al<U+017F>o: Otherwi<U+017F>e, you are more moved with an offence than with a full <U+017F>atisfaction for it; and evil hath a greater predominancie in you than good: But this is unworthy of <hi>Celideas</hi> <U+017F>oul, which promi<U+017F>eth all goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                           <p>But you <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>ince I have given you unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> if I would have any thing of you, I mu<U+017F>t ask him. This would puzzle mee to an<U+017F>wer, if I had not heard you <U+017F>ay, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to give you unto him. Now the matter is brought to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as you mu<U+017F>t be either his or mine: If you will not be mine, becau<U+017F>e I have imprudently given you away, then <hi>Celidea</hi> you mu<U+017F>t be <hi>Calidons.</hi> Con<U+017F>ider whether this change be plea<U+017F>ing unto you: If on the contrary, you will not be <hi>Calidons,</hi> then you cannot deny but you mu<U+017F>t be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53526:115"/>
mine, <U+017F>ince having been mine before, and my gift taking no effect, all right in the world is, that the thing given <U+017F>hould revert unto the fir<U+017F>t po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or: And you ought not to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me for offering you as a Sacrifice for <hi>Calidons</hi> recovery, becau<U+017F>e Sacrifices which are offered unto the gods, are alwaies of the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t precious things we have. Nor doe not think that by continuing to love you afterwards, I doe commit any <U+017F>acrilege, nor doe prophane any <U+017F>acred or holy thing, <U+017F>ince we doe all love the gods them<U+017F>elves: The greate<U+017F>t command which they doe impo<U+017F>e upon us mortals, is to Love them. But for Gods <U+017F>ake doe not <U+017F>ay that I ask you onely to <U+017F>acrifice you again for the recovery of <U+017F>ome other: For my de<U+017F>ire is onely to have you again for my own <U+017F>ake. I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my fault, and will not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon any other argument or rea<U+017F>on, but my extream affection; and will not argue with her any where but before the Throne of Love. I doe here pro<U+017F>trate my <U+017F>elf upon my knees, and vow by all eternity, never to ri<U+017F>e as long as I live, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I be ingratiated into <hi>Celideas</hi> favour again.</p>

                           <p>THree things doe pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves unto us, upon the difference betwixt <hi>Celidea, Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> and <hi>Calidon:</hi> The fir<U+017F>t, Love: The <U+017F>econd, Duty: The third, an Offence. In the fir<U+017F>t, we ob<U+017F>erve, three great Affections; in the <U+017F>econd, three great Obligations; in the third, three great Injuries. <hi>Celidea</hi> hath loved <hi>Thamires</hi> from her Cradle, <hi>Thamires</hi> hath loved <hi>Celidea,</hi> though he be elder; and <hi>Calidon</hi> hath loved her from the fir<U+017F>t time hee ever <U+017F>aw her. <hi>Celidea</hi> hath been much obliged unto the virtuous affection of <hi>Thamires; Thamires</hi> much obliged unto the memory of <hi>Calidons</hi> Father; and <hi>Calidon</hi> much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the Indulgency of <hi>Thamires.</hi> Again, <hi>Celidea</hi> hath been extreamly offended with <hi>Thamires,</hi> for giving her unto <hi>Calidon; Calidon</hi> no le<U+017F><U+017F>e offended with <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea: Thamires</hi> offended with <hi>Calidon</hi> for refu<U+017F>ing to doe the <U+017F>ame courte<U+017F>ie he received; And <hi>Celidea</hi> offended with <hi>Calidon</hi> for offering to con<U+017F>train her will, and making her to lo<U+017F>e him whom <U+017F>he did love. All the<U+017F>e things being long debated, and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we conceive, that as tho<U+017F>e things which Nature produceth, are alwaies more perfect then tho<U+017F>e that are produced by Art, <U+017F>o the Love that comes by a natural inclination, is greater, and more e<U+017F>timable than tho<U+017F>e affections that doe proceed from de<U+017F>ignes or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Furthermore, tho<U+017F>e obligations which we receive in our own per<U+017F>ons, being greater than tho<U+017F>e in the behalf of another; <U+017F>o it is certain, that a benefit obligeth more than a memory. An offence which hath any tincture of ingratitude, it is much more hainous than a bare offence without it, and de<U+017F>erves a greater puni<U+017F>hment. Now, we do find that the Love of <hi>Thamires</hi> does proceed from a natural inclination; for commonly <U+017F>uch loves are reciprocal, and <U+017F>o he loving <hi>Celidea,</hi> he was loved again: But <U+017F>o is not the love of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>terile affection produceth nothing but hatred and <U+017F>corn. Moreover, the good offices which <hi>Calidon</hi> hath received from <hi>Thamires,</hi> doe render him more obliged, than <hi>Thamires</hi> can be upon the <U+017F>core of an Uncle. Again, <hi>Calidons</hi> offence again<U+017F>t <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> having a <U+017F>tain of Ingratitude upon it, is much greater than the offence of <hi>Thamires</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Calidon,</hi> <U+017F>ince <hi>Thamires</hi> may almo<U+017F>t cover it with the name of Revenge or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ti<U+017F>ment. Therefore, in the fir<U+017F>t place, we doe ordain that the love of <hi>Calidon</hi> do <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the love of <hi>Thamires:</hi> That the obligation of <hi>Thamires</hi> be e<U+017F>teemed le<U+017F><U+017F>e than the obligation of <hi>Calidon;</hi> And the offence of <hi>Calidon</hi> greater than the offence of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires.</hi> And as for that which concerns <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea,</hi> we do declare, that <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> obligation unto <hi>Thamires</hi> is above the offence of <hi>Thamires,</hi> in re<U+017F>pect of his pure and innocent love; and in re<U+017F>pect of his carefull and indulgent education of her, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>hee would be ingrateful if <U+017F>he did not think her <U+017F>elf much obliged: 'Tis true, his offence is not <U+017F>mall, when in di<U+017F>advantage of his affection, he would needs <U+017F>atisfie the obligations
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53526:116"/>
which he thought he owed unto <hi>Calidon.</hi> And yet in con<U+017F>ideration there is no offence but may be pardoned by a per<U+017F>on that truly loves, we doe ordain, with the advice of all tho<U+017F>e who have heard the difference, That the Love of <hi>Celidea</hi> <U+017F>hall <U+017F>urmount the offence which <U+017F>hee hath received from <hi>Thamires;</hi> And that the Love which <hi>Thamires</hi> for the future <U+017F>hall bear unto her, <U+017F>hall <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>e that affection which hitherto he hath born unto her; for <U+017F>uch is our Judgement.</p>

               <p>This was <hi>Leonida</hi>'s Sentence, which hath <U+017F>ince been ob<U+017F>erved by all three; though the poor <hi>Calidon</hi> received it with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t, that but for the extream di<U+017F>dain of <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> he <U+017F>hould hardly have <U+017F>upported it. But his malady at this time proved to be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, when from a more <U+017F>ound judgement he con<U+017F>idered how much he was obliged unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> and how great his folly was, in thinking to make <hi>Celidea</hi> love him by force. But at the fir<U+017F>t, the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations had not <U+017F>o much power upon him, as to cut off all his hopes at one blow: which the Nymph wi<U+017F>ely fore<U+017F>eeing, and to avoyd the complaints and teares of this Shepheard, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he had pronounced the la<U+017F>t word of her Sentence, <U+017F>he did ri<U+017F>e up, being partly invited unto it by the night which came on apace, and <U+017F>he had no more day left than to carry her unto her Uncles hou<U+017F>e. Therefore, after <U+017F>hee had <U+017F>aluted all the fair Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>he and <hi>Paris</hi> entreated <hi>Silvander</hi> to conduct them through the Wood of <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e their way, it being very late, and too trouble<U+017F>om for the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es to accompany her.</p>
               <p>Thus they parted; and pre<U+017F>ently after, the Nymph and <hi>Paris</hi> di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Silvander,</hi> and came unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> as he was ready to goe unto his <U+017F>upper. <hi>Silvander</hi> as he returned, left <hi>Bonleiu</hi> on his left hand, a Temple where many Ve<U+017F>tals, and cha<U+017F>t Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Druids</hi> doe inhabit, under the charge of the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante,</hi> and hee went through a Wood <U+017F>o thick, that though the Moon was up and <U+017F>hined, yet hee could not hit his way. And indeed his own wandring thoughts as well as the darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Wood, did put him be<U+017F>ides his aym: For hee was <U+017F>o wholly taken up with <hi>Diana,</hi> that he minded nothing el<U+017F>e; And walking on, he came at la<U+017F>t upon an open place, where hee <U+017F>aw the Moon, <U+017F>he was a little pa<U+017F>t her Full, and <U+017F>hined very clearly. The Shepheard fell down upon his knees, to adore her; and becau<U+017F>e of the conformity in Names between <hi>Diana</hi> and her, he loved that Starre above all the re<U+017F>t in the Cope of Heaven. Having thus adored her, and <hi>Diana</hi> in her, hee <U+017F>tood up, and fixing his eyes upon her, he uttered the<U+017F>e Lines.</p>

He had not gone above fifteen or twenty paces, but in the mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>cure part of the wood, he found him<U+017F>elfe clo<U+017F>e by two men, whom he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly know, as well by rea<U+017F>on of the darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as becau<U+017F>e their backs were towards him; yet he knew by their habits, that one of them was a Druide, and the other a Shepheard.</p>
               <p>They were <U+017F>et under a Tree, which <U+017F>pread its leaves over a chry<U+017F>tall fountain, who<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ing murmur invited them to <U+017F>pend part of the night in that place. When <hi>Silvander</hi> was mo<U+017F>tde<U+017F>irous to know them, he heard one an<U+017F>wer the other, thus: But, Father, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>trange, and I cannot <U+017F>ufficiently admire it, that you <U+017F>hould by your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e intimate as much, as if it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that there are many other beauties more perfect, then the beauty of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; which truly I cannot believe, without an unpardonable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: For certainly, every one does think his own the faire<U+017F>t; and to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he is not, is a crime, both again<U+017F>t his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and again<U+017F>t Love. Then he heard the Druide an<U+017F>wer in this manner: My Son, there is no doubt of what I <U+017F>ay, nor any fear of offending her Beauty, or Love; and I am confident, that I <U+017F>hall in a few words make you under<U+017F>tand it: You know, that all beauty proceeds from that <U+017F>overaign goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e which we call God, it is a Ray of him<U+017F>elfe, and tran<U+017F>cends all his other creatures; and as the Sun, which we <U+017F>ee, does enlighten the Aire, the Water, and the Earth, with the <U+017F>ame beams; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the eternall Sun, does enlighten the angelick Under<U+017F>tanding, the rationall Soul, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But, as the cleerne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Sun appears more bright in the Air than in the Water, and in the Water then in the earth: <U+017F>o the illumination of God appears with greater lu<U+017F>tre in the Angelick Under<U+017F>tanding, then in the Rationall Soul; and in the Rationall Soul, more then in the Matter. Into the fir<U+017F>t, he hath infu<U+017F>ed Ideas; into the <U+017F>econd, Rea<U+017F>on; and into the la<U+017F>t, Formes. The Druide would have gone on, had not the <U+017F>hepheard interrupted him in this manner: Your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, Father, is a little too high, and you do not con<U+017F>ider the capacity of him unto whom you <U+017F>peak; my wit is too dull to <U+017F>oar <U+017F>o high: But if you will plea<U+017F>e to make me under<U+017F>tand, what the Angelicall Under<U+017F>tanding is, what the Rationall Soul is, and what the Matter is, of which you <U+017F>peak, perhaps I <U+017F>hall under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>omething more. My Son, <U+017F>aid the Druide, Angelicall Under<U+017F>tanding is that pure Intellect, by which they <U+017F>ee that Soveraign Beauty, and are adorned with all kinde of Ideas. The Rationall Soul is that, by which men are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from bea<U+017F>ts; it is it by which we come to the knowledge of things which is called Rationall. The Matter, is that which falls under the Sen<U+017F>es, which is imbelli<U+017F>hed with divers forms that are given unto them, and by which you may judge, whether <U+017F>he whom you love, has in perfection the two la<U+017F>t beauties, which we tearm Corporeall and Rationall, and which we may without any offence <U+017F>ay, that there is in others greater beauties then in hers; which you will under<U+017F>tand by a compari<U+017F>on of Bottles, full of water; for, as the greater do hold more then the little ones, and yet the little ones are as full as the greater: <U+017F>o it may be <U+017F>aid of all things capable of beauty; for there are <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, which by their perfection of Nature, can receive much more beauty then others, which yet cannot be termed imperfect, becau<U+017F>e they have as much perfection as they can receive. And under this notion comes the beauty of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, whom you may <U+017F>ay is perfect, and yet without offence confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he hath le<U+017F><U+017F>e beauty then the<U+017F>e pure Intellectualls which I <U+017F>peak of. If you be not too much tran<U+017F>ported with young and imprudent affections, and <U+017F>et too great a price upon the beauty of her face, you will <U+017F>et your whole affection upon the beauty of her minde, in which you will finde <U+017F>omething <U+017F>o la<U+017F>ting fair, as will give you as much delight and <U+017F>atisfaction, as the beauty of a face gives you <U+017F>orrow, and perhaps de<U+017F>pair. I have heard much di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this <U+017F>ubject, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Shepheard, but it <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed me, that I did not remember it. But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that one of you Druides endeavoured to prove, that the minde, the eye, and the ear,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53526:117"/>
have only their parts in Love: For, <U+017F>aid he, Love is only a de<U+017F>ire of Beauty; and there being three <U+017F>orts of Beauties, that of the fight, of which the eye is the only judge; that of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of which the ear is only capable; and that of rea<U+017F>on, which the minde can only di<U+017F>cern, it mu<U+017F>t follow, that the eyes, the ears, and the minde, have only their <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If any other Sen<U+017F>es do intrude, they re<U+017F>emble tho<U+017F>e impudent gue<U+017F>ts, that come unto Marriages before they be invited. Oh Son, <U+017F>aid the Druide, this is a Doctrine which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is under<U+017F>tood by many, but certainly followed by very few; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <U+017F>o many vexations and misfortunes do fall out among<U+017F>t Lovers. For Love, which mo<U+017F>t certainly is the greate<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t holy of all the gods, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o many waies offended by <U+017F>uch as call them<U+017F>elves his Votaries, either in contemning his ordinances, or prophaning his purity, does very often cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e them, to the end they may know their faults. For, my Son, what are jealou<U+017F>ies, di<U+017F>dains, <U+017F>landers, quarrells, infidelities, and all breaches of amity, but puni<U+017F>hments of that great god? Did our de<U+017F>ires <U+017F>tretch no further then di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, no further then the <U+017F>ight, nor no further then the ear, why <U+017F>hould we ever be jealous? why di<U+017F>dainfull? why angry? why enemies? why treacherous? and briefly, why <U+017F>hould not all love, and be loved, <U+017F>ince, then, the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of another would not one jot le<U+017F><U+017F>en our happine<U+017F><U+017F>e? Then <hi>Silvander</hi> heard the Shepheard interrupt the Druide with a deep <U+017F>igh, in this manner: Alas, Father, how true is your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto all Lovers, but my <U+017F>elfe? for my love is full of purity and cha<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ires, as it cannot offend the mo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure Ve<U+017F>tall. Let the god of Love be the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere of all the gods, yet I am <U+017F>ure, he can finde no fault with my affection; and yet for all this, never was Lover <U+017F>o rigorou<U+017F>ly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I am. Son, <U+017F>aid the Druide, many things do produce different effects, according to the <U+017F>ubjects they meet withall. A Line which is <U+017F>treight, is not made only to draw another <U+017F>traight Line by, but often to know what is not <U+017F>traight. Tho<U+017F>e dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent, though in others they are called puni<U+017F>hments, yet in you, they may be termed te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and proofs of your love and vertue, which will at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>o turn to your advantage, as you may with rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>ay, that you had never been happy, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you had been mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And in the interim be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e will repent of her fault, and the wrong <U+017F>he does you. After this, becau<U+017F>e it was very late, he ro<U+017F>e up, with intention to go away, and took the <U+017F>hepheard by the hand, who as he followed an<U+017F>wered thus.</p>
               <p>I be<U+017F>eech you, Father, and conjure you, by your love unto me, not to <U+017F>ay my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e is in any fault, much le<U+017F><U+017F>e that <U+017F>he does me wrong; for <U+017F>he having power to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me as much as my <U+017F>elfe, you will offend the mo<U+017F>t perfect piece that ever nature produced, and will more di<U+017F>oblige me by <U+017F>uch language, then your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance can plea<U+017F>e me. <hi>Silvander</hi> hearkened very attentively unto their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and though he did very preci<U+017F>ely ob<U+017F>erve all their actions, yet <U+017F>uch was the ob<U+017F>curity of the place, that he could not know them: and though he thought he knew the Druide, yet, <U+017F>eeing only his back, he was not certain. As for the <U+017F>hepheard, he was altogether unknown unto him, <U+017F>o as he did not remember he ever heard his voice before. This incertainty therfore cau<U+017F>ed him to follow them, hoping for a better di<U+017F>covery by the Moon, when they were out of the woods; but keeping at a good di<U+017F>tance, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een by them, he lo<U+017F>t them among<U+017F>t the Trees, and never <U+017F>ince could tell what became of them, which being very <U+017F>orry for, he left not his que<U+017F>t of them untill mo<U+017F>t of the night was <U+017F>pent; but wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e at the la<U+017F>t made him look for a place to re<U+017F>t in not knowing how to hit the way unto his Town. When <hi>Silvander</hi> was a<U+017F>leep, he waked not untill the Sun was very high. The Shepheard that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed with the Druide in the night, was as early as <hi>Aurora;</hi> and the place of his dwelling being very neer, as he was taking his u<U+017F>uall morning-walk, he e<U+017F>pied <hi>Silvander</hi> a<U+017F>leep: He having not been above a month in the Country, and having no acquaintance with any Shepheard, he was very de<U+017F>irous to know who <hi>Silvander</hi> was, and therefore went very <U+017F>oftly to him. He no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et his eye upon <hi>Silvander's</hi> face, but he knew him to be his mo<U+017F>t intimate friend; the remembrance of their former acquaintance, and of the plea<U+017F>ing life they had lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, cau<U+017F>ed his eyes to flow in tears: Then retiring back a few paces, and hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe behinde a great Tree, le<U+017F>t if <hi>Silvander</hi> waked, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pie him, he looked upon him very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, and in a low voice uttered the<U+017F>e words: Oh, my dear friend, and mo<U+017F>t faithfull companion, <hi>Silvander,</hi> how glad, and how <U+017F>ad both, doth this meeting with thee make me? Our friend<U+017F>hip, that now <U+017F>ees thee <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad, will not let me rejoyce at the <U+017F>ight of thee; and yet the <U+017F>ight of thee brings into my memory that happy life I lived, ever <U+017F>ince I was fir<U+017F>t acquainted with thee, untill that fatall <U+017F>entence which my Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced again<U+017F>t me; a <U+017F>entence which I cannot remember, but with a <U+017F>ad heart I mu<U+017F>t needs

call for death to relieve me, finding experimentally the Proverb to be mo<U+017F>t true, That none are <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable, as tho<U+017F>e that have been happy, and now are not. Who is able without a flood of tears to think upon my pa<U+017F>t felicity, and to <U+017F>ee my pre<U+017F>ent mi<U+017F>ery? Upon this, he was <U+017F>ilent; and going further back, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>tir a little, and looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words: Oh faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, how cruelly do you treat this poor Shepheard? The <U+017F>tranger knew he was a<U+017F>leep; but not knowing who was the Shepheard that he <U+017F>poke of, he went neerer him; and when he looked him in the face, he found it all tears, which found a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through his eye lids, though they were clo<U+017F>e. Then did he conclude, that it was him<U+017F>elfe he <U+017F>poke of, which he thought to be very <U+017F>trange, when he remembered, that his humour was wont to be extreamly aver<U+017F>e unto Love, in<U+017F>omuch as he was commonly called, The Shepheard without affection: But con<U+017F>idering what power Beauty hath, he believed that now he was no more exempted from the wounds of Love, than other <U+017F>hepheards of his age; and he was the more confirmed in this opinion, when he remembered, that <U+017F>ome had told him of the wager that was between him and <hi>Phillis.</hi> This con<U+017F>ideration made him look upon him and <U+017F>ay: Ah <hi>Silvander!</hi> I <U+017F>ee thou art now far unfit to give any coun<U+017F>el unto others, and for ought I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>tand<U+017F>t in need of coun<U+017F>el thy <U+017F>elfe My friend<U+017F>hip cannot chu<U+017F>e but pray, that Love would be more pitifull unto him, then it hath been unto me, and make him more fortunate then I have been. Then going gently away, he went unto the place where he lodged; and he was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et upon his bed-<U+017F>ide, but thinking upon his encounter, <hi>Silvander's</hi> affection unto him came into his minde, what great familiarity had been between them, and what fortune it was <U+017F>hould bring him into this place. It is, <U+017F>aid he, to give a beginning unto a better life, and to put an end unto my torments. Alas that cannot be, for nothing can make me le<U+017F><U+017F>e mi<U+017F>erable then I am, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it be death. Perhaps the heavens, fore<U+017F>eeing the end of my daies, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Silvander,</hi> my be<U+017F>t friend, unto me, to bid me my la<U+017F>t Adien, in the name of him<U+017F>elf and all the re<U+017F>t of my friends. This con<U+017F>ideration took up his thoughts a good while, and at la<U+017F>t made him re<U+017F>olve upon a thing which never came into his minde before, which was, to write unto his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; for her <U+017F>evere bani<U+017F>hment of him had <U+017F>o damped his <U+017F>pirit, that he dur<U+017F>t not a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e: But now verily believing, that his cour<U+017F>e of life was neer an end, he conceived him<U+017F>elfe obliged to take his leave of her in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort or other, before he went out of the world. Then he took pen and inke, and writ a Letter, and after he had folded it up, he <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cribed it, <hi>Unto the faire<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t loved Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the whole Univer<U+017F>e.</hi> Then he went unto the place where he left <hi>Silvander,</hi> and going gently to him, after he had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Letter two or three times, he put it into his hand: Oh happy Paper (<U+017F>aid he) if thy good Fate do bring thee into the hands of her, upon whom all my contentment depends, touch her to the heart; and if thou can<U+017F>t not move her to any pitty, yet force her to believe, that though <U+017F>he be changed from me, yet my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <U+017F>hall ever be the <U+017F>ame to her. And thou <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, putting the Letter into his hand) if love will yet give thee leave to look upon the beauty of her, unto whom this Letter is directed, give it unto her: Good <U+017F>hepheard, I be<U+017F>eech thee do this good office for thy friend, as the la<U+017F>t that he can hope to receive from thee or any el<U+017F>e Then this <U+017F>hepheard went away with folded armes, and dejected eyes, untill he came to his lodging. Pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>Silvander</hi> awaked; and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw the Sun of a great height, he looked about which way he <U+017F>hould take homeward; and rubbing his eyes after his <U+017F>leep, he made u<U+017F>e of that hand in which the Letter was; he wondred extreamly when he <U+017F>aw it, but much more, when he read unto whom it was directed. Do I <U+017F>leep, (<U+017F>aid he) or do I wake? Is it a dream, or is this a Letter which I <U+017F>ee? Then looking well upon it: No, no, <U+017F>aid he, I do not <U+017F>leep, but I have a Letter in my hand, which is directed unto the Faire<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t loved <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the whole Univer<U+017F>e. But, if I be not a<U+017F>leep, why am I ignorant who gave it unto me? Had I it before I fell a<U+017F>leep? No, no, I had it not. It mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be, that <U+017F>ome did put it into my hand when I was a<U+017F>leep: This may very well be, for there is not one of all the gods that has not loved the beauties of the earth; the god of Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, who wounds others, has not been exempted; <U+017F>o as it <U+017F>eemes, they think our <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es more fair then their godde<U+017F><U+017F>es.

Upon the<U+017F>e words, they both embraced and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with abundance of zealous affection; which <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>eeing, he wi<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elfe <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> a hundred times, that he might have received the like favours. After this, they <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves down again, and falling unto their work again, he thought that he heard them name him; and therefore, that he might hear the better, he crept neerer unto them, and <U+017F>aw, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e was making a bracelet of her hair. When he was beginning to be jealous, le<U+017F>t any but him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould wear it, he heard <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>ay: <hi>Silvander</hi> would be very jealous, if he <U+017F>aw his enemy in greater favour than him<U+017F>elfe. I do believe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> that <U+017F>he did ask it of me with that de<U+017F>igne. I do think <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> but you do wrong the <U+017F>hepheard in it, if you do favour the one more than the other; you are not as good as your word, becau<U+017F>e you have promi<U+017F>ed the contrary. The advantage which I <U+017F>eem to confer upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> nor the wager it <U+017F>elfe, is not of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; be<U+017F>ides, the <U+017F>hepheard did never reque<U+017F>t me for it, as <U+017F>he did. But I do be<U+017F>eech you, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>hewing him<U+017F>elfe unawares) if he do reque<U+017F>t one, I hope you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed

to be<U+017F>tow it. The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es hearing him <U+017F>peak, were much amazed; and their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was <U+017F>o great, as they were a long time before they <U+017F>pake one word, only gazed upon one another, fearing he had heard the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e they had a little before he came.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> began to <U+017F>peak, and told him thus: Fie, <hi>Silvander,</hi> I wonder your di<U+017F>cretion <U+017F>hould be no more, then to harken unto the <U+017F>ecrets of others. Do you <U+017F>o little re<U+017F>pect your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to <U+017F>teal a hearing, when <U+017F>he would not have any hear but me? I do not know what <U+017F>ecrets you mean (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander)</hi> but I am <U+017F>ure, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>ity which invited me hither, was, only to hear my own <U+017F>ecrets from the mouth of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; it is from her that I mu<U+017F>t be informed and I am very <U+017F>orry I came no <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <U+017F>ince all that I heard informes me no further, then concerning a Bracelet, which, with much inju<U+017F>tice, is intended for <hi>Phillis.</hi> You need not be <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>hepheard, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> for comming no <U+017F>ooner, <U+017F>ince if you had, your crime, in offering thus to <U+017F>teal the <U+017F>ecrets of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, had been no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then his, that <U+017F>tole fire from heaven; and in rea<U+017F>on, you could not expect a more milde cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement.</p>
               <p>Oh! an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> it is not any fear of puni<U+017F>hment which can give a <U+017F>top unto my ju<U+017F>t curio<U+017F>ity; for I do <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teem the means of rendring her proofes of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as all manner of puni<U+017F>hments are <U+017F>weet unto me, upon that account. Good <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> unto him) how can you think to give her any te<U+017F>timonies of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction this way? I will tell you, fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)</hi> <U+017F>hould I not render her a mo<U+017F>t infallible te<U+017F>timony, if knowing what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ecret, I <U+017F>hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it? For we now live in an age, when every one does not only tell all they know, but all that they do imagine. In <U+017F>o doing, <U+017F>hepheard, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> you do make your di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion appear. But more affection, <U+017F>aid he. As for di<U+017F>cretion, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I will allow it; but as for affection, I will refer my <U+017F>elfe unto her, to whom it is addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. I will make an<U+017F>wer for her, <U+017F>aid he. Would you have <hi>Silvander,</hi> who heretofore was a declared enemy to Love, yet now mu<U+017F>t love and adore; would you, I <U+017F>ay, have him make his love known? But how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, fair Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Diana)</hi> that you would not an<U+017F>wer unto what I <U+017F>ay, but <U+017F>eemes, as if my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you?

               <p>Ah <hi>Silvander,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> let us talk no more of any favours and <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>ince the terme of three Months pre<U+017F>cribed for your faigned affection, is almo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>t; it would be too great a trouble to you, to con<U+017F>train your naturall inclination any longer.</p>

The<U+017F>e words did touch <hi>Silvander's</hi> heart <U+017F>o to the quick, <U+017F>ince he perceived by them, that he had gained a <U+017F>mall influence upon her good-will, as he was not able to hide his <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entments of them; but his countenance did plainly di<U+017F>cover them by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging colour: Which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> perceiving: How now, <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, what! does your heart fail you? It were <U+017F>trange, replyed he, if <U+017F>uch cruell language from my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>hould not extreamly trouble me; yet, do not think my heart <U+017F>hall ever fail me, though <U+017F>he and the heavens have the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ure of all my hopes and life. Is not this, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> rather ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e in you, then courage? and are you not too pre<U+017F>umptuous, in denying <U+017F>uch powers? No, replied the <U+017F>hepheard, it is a mo<U+017F>t true, reall, perfect, and mo<U+017F>t faithfull love which makes me <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o. By the<U+017F>e and the like expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <hi>Diana</hi> perceived, that <hi>Silvander</hi> did really love her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> he did fore<U+017F>ee abundance of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and very <U+017F>mall hopes unto him<U+017F>elfe. And <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did conceive, that Love had laid a foundation of an exqui<U+017F>ite and la<U+017F>ting affection. And though they all three had different thoughts, yet were they all true, as afterwards you <U+017F>hall perceive. But <hi>Silvander</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the <U+017F>ubject of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Diana:</hi> I hope, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, that this Bracelet of your fair hair, which you have made for <hi>Phillis,</hi> is only to be rid of her importunities; and if it be <U+017F>o, you are obliged to favour <hi>Silvander</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:53526:119"/>
as much as her; and le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould be taxed with partiality, you ought to treat us both with equall favour, though the affection which you have cau<U+017F>ed in my <U+017F>oul, cannot be equall'd by any other. And why not, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> taking the part of <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>ince both sour affections do proceed from the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e; one grain of corn produceth <U+017F>everall ears: Allthough the cau<U+017F>e of our affections be the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> yet the effects may be different. But experience <U+017F>hewes the contrary, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for the affection of <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obtained that favour, which is denyed yours. This is not: or want of any love, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard, but for want of good fortune: yet, <U+017F>ince the dropping of water upon the harde<U+017F>t Marble, will, in continuance of time, pierce it; why may not I as well hope, that my Love and fervency of prayers long continued, may as well work upon the marble heart of this fair one? Then, after he had looked upon her, or rather adored her a long while, be fell down upon his knees: If Love, my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid he unto her have any influence upon beauty, and if prayers cau<U+017F>ed thunderbolts to fall out of the band of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> how is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the extream affection of <hi>Silvander,</hi> and his mo<U+017F>t zealous <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications cannot obtain as much favour, as the <U+017F>hallow affection and trouble<U+017F>ome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obtained from you? If it cannot, I may with as much rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>ay, that the way to obtain love is not to love; and the way to overcome an obdurate heart, is not, by prayers and earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>upplications; but only by di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and vexing importunities.</p>

And when he was in the mid<U+017F>t of his <U+017F>weet imaginations, it <U+017F>eemes, Love had a minde to compleat his joyes, in making the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> to enter: For he, who<U+017F>e happine<U+017F><U+017F>e is unknown to any but him<U+017F>elfe, cannot be <U+017F>aid to be compleatly happy; but the more it is known, the more happy he is, and much the more, when this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e does not come by Fortune, but by Merit. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aw her, he ran unto her, and in a mo<U+017F>t jocund manner, <U+017F>hewed her the arme, on which he had already put his mo<U+017F>t beloved Bracelet, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it often before her eyes, <U+017F>aying: Here, <hi>Phillis,</hi> here is the earne<U+017F>t of my en<U+017F>uing Victory. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had been <U+017F>eeking <hi>Lycidas,</hi> with a de<U+017F>ire to convince him of his jealou<U+017F>ie, and could not finde him, was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad and <U+017F>o weary, as <U+017F>he needed not to counterfeit any anger, nor change any countenance to te<U+017F>tifie her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure and <U+017F>orrowes, which this favour might have cau<U+017F>ed in her. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvander</hi> was very trouble<U+017F>ome unto her, not only in this Act, but in being the bellowes, which did blow up the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him in as <U+017F>harp a manner as <U+017F>he could: This earne<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hepheard, which you <U+017F>hew me, is rather an argument of your little merit, then of any en<U+017F>uing victory; for <U+017F>o it is u<U+017F>uall to do, only to make all even. What do you mean by that, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard?

So till we are arrived at the end of our terme, <hi>Diana</hi> does wi<U+017F>ely ballance that <U+017F>ide which is the leighter, by her favours; but afterwards, <U+017F>he will give her judgment without any regard unto the weight of my affection, or the levity of your little love: And then, God knowes on whom the victory you <U+017F>peak of will fall. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> <U+017F>miled, and an<U+017F>wered: It is rather the cu<U+017F>tome of mi<U+017F>erable people to be envious, and le<U+017F><U+017F>en the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of others, which they infinitely e<U+017F>teem by their language.</p>

                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> without any further reply, left him, and went unto the two <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and was extreamly offended at them: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> laid the fault upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and

You thought hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>Phillis</hi> loved you, and indeed I know none, but have in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort been deceived by her di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations. Love, who knowes all the interiour faculties of the <U+017F>oul, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ing to undeceive you, hath cau<U+017F>ed you to favour me with this Bracelet of your hair, not onely as a mark of my affection, but al<U+017F>o to di<U+017F>cover the hollow affection of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder by her jealou<U+017F>ie: For as it is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that two contraries <U+017F>hould be at the <U+017F>ame time in one place; <U+017F>o much more, that love and jealou<U+017F>ie <U+017F>hould be at the <U+017F>ame time in one and the <U+017F>ame heart. <hi>Silvander's</hi> aim was, only to torment <hi>Phillis</hi> the more; for knowing how jealous <hi>Lycidas</hi> was, he doubted not but to trouble her, by propo<U+017F>ing, that Love and Jealou<U+017F>y are incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent: And <U+017F>he being touched to the quick could not chu<U+017F>e but an<U+017F>wer him thus: Pray, Shepheard, what rea<U+017F>ons and arguments have you to maintain <U+017F>o bad an opinion? Such, <U+017F>aid he, as will make you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe of the <U+017F>ame; at the lea<U+017F>t, if you know what the rea<U+017F>on is. Love is nothing but a de<U+017F>ire and every de<U+017F>ire is hot: Jealou<U+017F>ie is nothing but a fear, and all fear is as cold as ice; and how can you imagine <U+017F>uch a cold Child <U+017F>hould be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of <U+017F>uch a hot Parent? We <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that flint, which is cold, will <U+017F>end <U+017F>orth <U+017F>parks that are hot. Mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander;</hi> but fire never produceth cold. Yet by your favour, replied <hi>Phillis</hi> a<U+017F>hes, that are cold, do proceed from fire. Yes, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard but when the a<U+017F>hes are cold, the fire is not in them. <hi>Phillis</hi> was almo<U+017F>t non-plu<U+017F>t at this reply; and much more, when <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>poke. So likewi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, when cold jealou<U+017F>ie begins, Love, that is hot ends. Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> my enemy may well get the victory, if he have <U+017F>o good a Second as your <U+017F>elfe. Then turning her <U+017F>elfe towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> And you, fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he I may ju<U+017F>tly think you a very ill friend, if <U+017F>eeing me a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted by two, you will not take my part. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> an<U+017F>wered very <U+017F>adly: I do hold it for a thing <U+017F>o certainly true, that jealou<U+017F>y may proceed from love, as not to bring it into any doubt. I will not di<U+017F>pute it, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be forced to confe<U+017F>s, that I my <U+017F>elfe did not love, becau<U+017F>e I was jealous as I do <U+017F>ee you are forced to confe<U+017F>s, that being jealous of <hi>Diana,</hi> you do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> her; or at the lea<U+017F>t, being in doubt whether jealou<U+017F>ie may proceed from love, you are not well a<U+017F>sured whether you love her or no. I do ki<U+017F>s the hand of this fair and ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, without re<U+017F>pect of per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>peaks with <U+017F>o much truth in my advantage. If you be obliged unto me, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> then <U+017F>urely you do think, that I did <U+017F>peak partially in your favour; for none are beholding unto him that <U+017F>peaks truth, more then to him that payes a debt ju<U+017F>tly due. Mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> if it be taken in the rigour of ju<U+017F>tice but we do live in an age, wherein <U+017F>o few do follow vertue <U+017F>imply and cleerly, as we may think our <U+017F>elves obliged unto tho<U+017F>e, that will but acknowledge any benefit, although they are obliged unto it. But what can you argue again<U+017F>t that experience which we daily finde, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto him? For I know a <U+017F>hepheard, who after he had loved long, and fell into extream jealou<U+017F>ie: yet afterwards recovering out of it, did continue his affection long after: Can you <U+017F>ay, that this was a fire extingui<U+017F>hed, which produced the<U+017F>e a<U+017F>hes? It is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander)</hi> but one that is well may fall <U+017F>ick, and after that <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, grow well again; nor, that a fire may be put out, and afterwards kindled again. Affection that was long hot, may be put out by cold jealou<U+017F>ie, and that jealou<U+017F>ie being gone, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as hot as ever it was before: But it cannot be, that health and <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, hot fire and cold a<U+017F>hes, love and jealou<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>hould be in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject at the <U+017F>ame time. And for a full clearing of this truth, let us ob<U+017F>erve the effects of love and jealou<U+017F>ie, and by them judge, whether the cau<U+017F>es from whence they proceed, have any conformity together. The effects of Love is an extream de<U+017F>ire in our <U+017F>oules, to <U+017F>ee the per<U+017F>on loved, to <U+017F>erve her, and to plea<U+017F>e her, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we can. The effects of jealou<U+017F>ie, is a fear to meet her whom we love, a carele<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s to plea<U+017F>e her, and a di<U+017F>daining to <U+017F>erve her: And who can think <U+017F>uch contrary effects can proceed from one and the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e? If we do, we mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that nature will de<U+017F>troy her <U+017F>elfe, if <U+017F>he will have contraries to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t together. <hi>Phillis</hi> would gladly have an<U+017F>wered, but <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o non-plu<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>he knew not where to begin; at which <hi>Diana</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, e<U+017F>pecially when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas.</hi> And to add more matter for her perplexities, <U+017F>he did purpo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>peak in this manner: Jealou<U+017F>ie is a <U+017F>igne of love, as old ruines are <U+017F>ignes of ancient buildings, which are the greater, the more magnificent the Edifice was: And therefore, a great jealou<U+017F>ie cannot proceed from a little love. But, as we cannot give the name of buildings unto the<U+017F>e ruines,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53526:120"/>
<U+017F>o jealou<U+017F>y cannot be called love. And if I may judge by my own humour, if I did love, I <U+017F>hould not have power to be jealous. And what would you be, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if he whom you <U+017F>hould love, <U+017F>hould love another? His enemy, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> I would <U+017F>ay, hate him: And though I do fore<U+017F>ee that <U+017F>uch an accident would di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, yet, it would be more, for being deceived <U+017F>o long, then for being <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon forgotten. But, if that <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>hould be jealous of you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what then would you do? I would u<U+017F>e him <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he <U+017F>hould never love me again. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire he <U+017F>hould love you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what way would you take? The way of a Precipice, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana;</hi> for I <U+017F>hould then think my <U+017F>elfe worthy to end mi<U+017F>erably, if I <U+017F>hould love one, whom I knew did not love me. Oh! <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> how freely you <U+017F>peak? Nay, <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> how pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately you di<U+017F>pute? If you have need of a remedy again<U+017F>t this malady, either take that which I would give you, or arme your <U+017F>elfe with patience to endure any di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure that can befall you, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, the number of them will not be a few.</p>
               <p>Thus the<U+017F>e fair and di<U+017F>creet Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed with <hi>Silvander,</hi> And becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi> thought that if it continued any longer, it might breed <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>te, <U+017F>he had a mind to interrupt them; therefore <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up, and <U+017F>eemed very de<U+017F>irous to walk, <U+017F>o as taking <hi>Diana</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Phillis</hi> by the other, <U+017F>he motioned to walk, <U+017F>aying, they had been <U+017F>itting too long. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> as he was officious in waiting about his Mi<U+017F>tris he <U+017F>cattered the Letter which was put into his hand in the Night time: and <hi>Phillis</hi> having <U+017F>till her eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, It <U+017F>ell no <U+017F>ooner upon the ground, but <U+017F>he took it up, hee not perceiving her; and carrying it unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> would needs read it before <U+017F>he would re<U+017F>tore it to him again. But as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he and the <U+017F>ad Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e did ca<U+017F>t their eyes upon it, they conceived it to be the hand of <hi>Celadon.</hi> This apprehen<U+017F>ion did touch <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>o to the heart, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Diana</hi> with <hi>Silvander,</hi> and taking <hi>Phillis</hi> a<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>it down upon the ground. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing her countenance much changed asked her how <U+017F>he did, and what was the cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddain alteration? Oh my good Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what a <U+017F>trange trembling hath <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed me? and what a perplexity hath the <U+017F>ight of this Letter put me into?

Perhaps it is one of his Letters which Love will re<U+017F>tore unto you by the hand of <hi>Silvander,</hi> as being mo<U+017F>t due unto you. Ala<U+017F><U+017F>e, my dear Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> me-thought I <U+017F>aw him this very la<U+017F>t night <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad, and <U+017F>o pale, that I <U+017F>tarted, and <U+017F>o awaked out of my <U+017F>ad Dream: She would have gone on, when <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> came unto them, very <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee her face <U+017F>o much and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would by all meanes hide this <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e from that Shepheard, did make a <U+017F>ign unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> Shepheard, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hath a very great de<U+017F>ire to impart her minde freely unto <hi>Diana,</hi> if you were not pre<U+017F>ent. Oh my enemy, an<U+017F>wered he, our hatred is not <U+017F>o great as to make me uncivil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> I know it is not fit that Shepheards <U+017F>hould heare all the <U+017F>ecrets of Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es, and therefore I will retire into the next Grove, and wait there untill you call me. And <U+017F>o making an humble reverence unto <hi>Diana,</hi> he went into the Wood. And not to bee idle, he took his knife, and began to cut Letters upon the barks of trees. In the mean time, <hi>Diana</hi> under<U+017F>tood from <hi>Phillis,</hi> how the <U+017F>ight of a Letter, which fell from <hi>Silvander,</hi> and <U+017F>eemed to be the hand of <hi>Celadon,</hi> had troubled <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> Then <U+017F>hewing it unto her, and <U+017F>he looking upon it a long time very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly; It would be very welcome news which <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> hath brought, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> if it was <hi>Celadon</hi> that writ this Letter; for mo<U+017F>t certainly it is very newly written, it is <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h, as if it were written this very hour; <U+017F>o as if this be <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladons</hi> hand, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he is not dead: But let us <U+017F>ee what is within, perhaps we <U+017F>hall learn more in it.

               <p>Ah my dear Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> It is <hi>Celadon</hi> who writ tho<U+017F>e words: I know it by his <U+017F>tyle and manner of writing; but perhaps it is long <U+017F>ince it was written.

Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> unto the <U+017F>ad Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you can but hold your countenance, that he may not <U+017F>ee the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, I am confident we <U+017F>hal learn all from him.

Better Fate then you could expect, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; for I am not only come my <U+017F>elfe unto you, but I have left behinde me two of your greate<U+017F>t enemies. Since it is <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered he, I do much more fear your blowes. My blowes, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, do not offend; or if they do, it is only <U+017F>uch as would have them do <U+017F>o. It is very true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> they do indeed offend none, but tho<U+017F>e as would have them do <U+017F>o: but yet that's the rea<U+017F>on, why there are <U+017F>o many wounded; for all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ee you, do de<U+017F>ire to receive your wounds. The blowes which are de<U+017F>irable, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> need not be feared. Your wounds, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> are de<U+017F>ired, but not de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and are terrible, but not terrifying. When I did <U+017F>ay, that I feared them, it was rather to <U+017F>hew what I ought to do, then what I did.

But to leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, pray tell me, <U+017F>hepheard, from whom this Letter is, and to whom it is directed? <hi>Silvander</hi> not knowing how he lo<U+017F>t it, returned this an<U+017F>wer: My heart, and your eyes, if they did but look in a gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, would an<U+017F>wer for me, that it is directed unto you, as, Unto the mo<U+017F>t fair, and

But, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> unto him, and then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with <hi>Phillis</hi> came to them) if this Letter came from you, why did you not write it? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, I found a better Secretary than my <U+017F>elfe; and I mu<U+017F>t needs ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that there is <U+017F>omething <U+017F>upernaturall in it, <U+017F>ince I found my own conceptions in it, without writing them; and <U+017F>ince you have it, and I never gave it unto you: But, my good Angell, who was my Scribe, <U+017F>eeing I was too <U+017F>low in pre<U+017F>enting it unto you, did <U+017F>teal it from me, though I did <U+017F>tay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an opportunity of privacy to pre<U+017F>ent it. And why <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana?</hi> Do you think I will receive any Letters in private, which I would refu<U+017F>e in publick? My intention of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> was in con<U+017F>ideration of my <U+017F>elfe, and not of you, becau<U+017F>e I had rather receive a denyall from you without a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, then before the face of my enemy: But I <U+017F>ee, that he who a<U+017F><U+017F>umed the boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e to write of me, has found out a way to let you <U+017F>ee it. I <U+017F>hall receive your excu<U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> upon condition, you will tell me, who was your Secretary. This la<U+017F>t night, (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) after a long medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and entertainment of my own thoughts, I chanced to fall a<U+017F>leep in a wood not far di<U+017F>tant hence; and in the morning when I awaked, I found this Letter in my hand: At the fir<U+017F>t, I was much amazed at it; but after I had read it, I conceived, that <U+017F>ome good Angell which loved me, and had read the <U+017F>ame thoughts in my imagination, did write them in this paper for me, to pre<U+017F>ent them unto you. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had wit at will, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Diana</hi> mute, did ask him, if he knew the way unto the wood. No, <U+017F>aid he, if there be none but you that would go unto it: but, if it be the plea<U+017F>ure of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I will wait upon her unto it; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe, that the Trees which heard me almo<U+017F>t all the night, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which I had with my <U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t them. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> being very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee the place, did make a <U+017F>igne with her eye unto <hi>Diana,</hi> that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take him at his word; who thereupon asking, whether they had time enough to go and return, and being an<U+017F>wered, Yes, <U+017F>he intreated him, to conduct them all thither. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who was full of civility, and who de<U+017F>ired nothing more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, then to do any <U+017F>ervice unto his fair <hi>Diana,</hi> did freely con<U+017F>ent to <U+017F>hew them the way. So <hi>Diana</hi> turning towards the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, purpo<U+017F>ely to umbrage <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> de<U+017F>igne, did very particularly intreat them, they would be plea<U+017F>ed to go along with her, and they <U+017F>hould command her as much another time. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was very glad, that <hi>Silvander</hi> took <hi>Diana</hi> to be the Author of this de<U+017F>igne, did an<U+017F>wer, That <U+017F>he would mo<U+017F>t willingly follow her, whither<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to go. So committing the charge of their flocks unto one of their neighbours, who came accidentally, <hi>Silvander</hi> took the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t way to the wood, and conducted them thither.</p>
               <p>Where the way was narrow and bad, <hi>Silvander</hi> alwaies went before; but a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they came into the Meadow, which is often watered by the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> he waited upon his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and led her by the arme. She, who had <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did accept of her <U+017F>hepheards <U+017F>ervice with a very good will, le<U+017F>t the length of the way <U+017F>hould weary her; and giving him her left arme: You, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I make u<U+017F>e of you in this voyage as my Servant; and of you, <hi>Phillis</hi> for my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Phillis</hi> de<U+017F>iring to make <hi>Silvander</hi> talk, that the company might be the le<U+017F><U+017F>e weary, and who would not have a word, <U+017F>o much to her advantage pronounced by <hi>Diana,</hi> to pa<U+017F>s unob<U+017F>erved, <U+017F>he addre<U+017F>sed her <U+017F>elfe unto the <U+017F>hepheard, and asked him, what he thought of this favour? That it is greater, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> then we de<U+017F>erve. But, replyed <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> how do you take the difference that <U+017F>he puts betwixt us? As a faithfull Servant ought to take what is plea<U+017F>ing unto his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander.</hi> But you, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F>s, who are <U+017F>o great a <U+017F>tickler again<U+017F>t jealou<U+017F>ie, have not you <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parks of it your <U+017F>elfe, in <U+017F>eeing the great favour which your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e hath conferred upon me?

This, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is a <U+017F>econd my<U+017F>tery of that god which I will explain unto you. <hi>Diana</hi> has no defects neither in beauty nor merit, but <U+017F>he is all perfection; the defect is only in your <U+017F>elfe, that you do not love enough, and that your love does not equall tho<U+017F>e admirable excellencies which you <U+017F>ee in her: But, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould love her in that height, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he does not love you, according to the Oracle of which I <U+017F>poke. <hi>Venus</hi> <U+017F>eeing her Son <U+017F>o little, did ask the gods, what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould do to make him grow: To which que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>he received this an<U+017F>wer, That <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould get him a Brother, and then he would grow to full proportion; but as long as he was alone, he would never grow. Do you not <U+017F>ee, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that this an<U+017F>wer was given again<U+017F>t you, and in favour of me? For, if your love be little, and a dwarfe, the rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e it hath not a Brother. If mine, on the contrary, do excell the highe<U+017F>t, it is, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> my mo<U+017F>t fair <hi>Diana,</hi> hath given it one, whom he loves, whom he honours: nay, whom he adores. And do you think, <hi>Silvander,</hi> replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> that <U+017F>he does love you better then <U+017F>he does love me? It can be no more doubted, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard, then truth it <U+017F>elfe The gods do never lie, Oracles are the interpreters of their will. How dare you tax an Oracle with any untruth? No, no, <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>ince I do love this fair <hi>Diana</hi> better then you do, mo<U+017F>t certainly <U+017F>he does love me better then <U+017F>he doth you; otherwi<U+017F>e, the gods would be impo<U+017F>tors, and not gods. Many have been deceived, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding of Oracles. 'Tis true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> but when that is, the contrary event doth pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>cover it and <U+017F>o they remain not long undeceived: But, the Oracle of which I <U+017F>peak, is an<U+017F>wered by <U+017F>uch conformable effects, both in you and me, that it would be impiety to doubt it; <U+017F>ince, do what you can, you cannot make your love <U+017F>o great as mine: And to confirm it the more, is it not a common received opinion, that who<U+017F>oever will be loved, mu<U+017F>t love? Why, <U+017F>hepheard, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted him) do you think by loving much, to make your <U+017F>elfe much loved? If you would give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this my<U+017F>tery unto you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> perhaps you would be as ready to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, as you have been to interrupt me; but this is all I will <U+017F>ay, if the way to get love be to love, then there is no doubt, but that <hi>Diana,</hi> who con<U+017F>traines me to love her with <U+017F>uch ardency
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53526:122"/>
of affection, doth love me extreamly. <hi>Phlllis</hi> was dumb at this, not knowing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer the <U+017F>hepheard, who indeed defended his cau<U+017F>e but too well. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> whi<U+017F>pered <hi>Diana</hi> in her ear: Never credit me again, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a whi<U+017F>per) if this <U+017F>hepheards jea<U+017F>t do not turn to earne<U+017F>t, and if he do not, like children, who play <U+017F>o long with their finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the candle, that at la<U+017F>t they burn them<U+017F>elves. <hi>Diana</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>uch a thing might perhaps be, if I were as capable of burning, as he is of being burned; but, <U+017F>ince he him<U+017F>elfe is only in the fault, let him only bear the puni<U+017F>hment: as for me, I do not intend to participate with him. This talk had continued longer, if <hi>Phillis</hi> had not interpo<U+017F>ed, and chid them for taking <hi>Silvander's</hi> part. We did not take his part, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana;</hi> but we may well <U+017F>ay, that you are too weak to argue with him, for his knowledge is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove yours. But I would gladly know, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> how he can conceive, that what you <U+017F>aid unto him at the beginning, was more advantageous to him than to me; for, I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it to be a greater honour unto me, <U+017F>ince you did thereby cho<U+017F>e me to be your Companion. She did confer that honour indeed upon you, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard, but her affection upon me. No, no, replyed the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, under the name of Companion is both affection and honour comprehended, for they do almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignifie the <U+017F>ame thing. You may as well a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> that affection and flattery are the <U+017F>ame, and not contrary. If that per<U+017F>on whom you love be<U+017F>t <U+017F>hould tell you, that your perfections do tran<U+017F>cend any godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, would you not <U+017F>ay, this is gro<U+017F><U+017F>e flattery? And why, poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thing that you are, do you not think the <U+017F>ame of <hi>Diana,</hi> when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ayes, that you are her Companion? For, as you your <U+017F>elfe expound it, that Companion <U+017F>ignifies, one like her <U+017F>elfe; and her perfections are <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendently above all other women, as there cannot be a greater difference between men and gods, then betwixt you and her. Poor blinded <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee, that this <U+017F>weet word which is <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing to you, is only pure flattery, which my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e is plea<U+017F>ed to put upon you, to acknowledge in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort that <U+017F>hallow affection which you bear unto her? For, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he cannot love you, <U+017F>he will give you <U+017F>atisfaction in this coyne. In taking you for a Companion, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewes flattery, and flattery <U+017F>hewes <U+017F>mall affection: On the contrary, in taking me for her Servant, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewes the good will <U+017F>he bears unto me, <U+017F>ince I am capable of that favour, if any mortall man be. Oh impudence! (cryed out <hi>Phillis).</hi> Oh love! an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander.</hi> Why, replyed the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, do you think your <U+017F>elfe worthy to <U+017F>erve her, who<U+017F>e merits are above all mortalls? The greate<U+017F>t gods, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, are <U+017F>erved by men, and are plea<U+017F>ed with their <U+017F>ervice and duty: Then why, if I be a man, as I hope you do not que<U+017F>tion, will you not permit me to <U+017F>erve and adore my godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe requires this holy duty from me? <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>tanding mute, and con<U+017F>idering well of <hi>Silvander's</hi> rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>he knew not how to an<U+017F>wer one word, but did really think, that <hi>Diana</hi> did confer a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> then upon her; and therefore addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>peech unto her: Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, upon con<U+017F>ideration of my enemies rea<U+017F>on, I finde, that he is in the right, and that you have conferred more favour upon him than me: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you <U+017F>hould do it intentionally? If you did, I <U+017F>hall have a ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion of complaint, and take it ill, he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much advanced above his merit. I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> coldly, that opinion hath a greater power of you then truth, and you are guided only by it: Within this quarter of an houre, you were boa<U+017F>ting of the favour which I did you, in preferring you before <hi>Silvander:</hi> And now, this opinion being changed, you complain of the contrary, <U+017F>o as I am afraid, that your affection al<U+017F>o is nothing but opinion. No que<U+017F>tion of it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> for every word <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>poken is an argument of it. Is it any argument of Love, <hi>Phillis,</hi> to finde fault with the actions of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? If they be to my di<U+017F>advantage, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, would you have me to think well of them? It were but your duty to conform your <U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>trive to get more love then you have, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander.</hi> Would you have <hi>Diana</hi> conform her <U+017F>elfe unto your will, or ought you to conform your <U+017F>elfe unto hers? I wi<U+017F>h to the gods, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I had as much advantage over her, as it <U+017F>eemes <U+017F>he hath given you over me. If it were <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> pray tell me, which of you two <U+017F>hould be the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e and which the Servant? Truly, <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I do not think you ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>cratch in Love's War. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who <U+017F>ilently heard their difference, was at la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>ay thus unto <hi>Diana:</hi> I think, wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that this <U+017F>hepheard will take away from <hi>Phillis</hi> the u<U+017F>e of her tongue.

               <p>I Shall never think any thing <U+017F>trange, generous Shepheard, when I remember <hi>Hylas,</hi> and con<U+017F>ider, that mo<U+017F>t things do con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t only in Opinion. For nothing is <U+017F>o directly contrary unto each other, as vertue and vice; and this man, taking the one for the other, doth <U+017F>hew us, that it is meerly opinion which puts the price upon all things: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s he is the mo<U+017F>t uncon<U+017F>tant piece that ever thought him<U+017F>elf in Love; and he will go about to prove by arguments and rea<U+017F>ons, that it is a vertue to change, or love many at once; and that this is no incon<U+017F>tancy. Al<U+017F>o, it is que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s, that he <U+017F>peaks as he thinks, and his arguments and rea<U+017F>ons are the i<U+017F><U+017F>ues of his heart. I remember that when he came from <hi>Camargue</hi> unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> he got into the Temple among<U+017F>t the women, at the grand Fea<U+017F>t; and if <hi>Palinice</hi> had not <U+017F>hewed much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon him (for <U+017F>o is the name of this my Companion) certainly he had payed very dear for his curio<U+017F>ity: but <U+017F>he finding, that his fault proceeded from folly, and not malice, di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him with a vail, and got him out of the Temple, then carryed him to his lodging, which was in a demi-I<U+017F>le, betwixt the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> and the <hi>Arar.</hi> This courte<U+017F>y was enough to oblige <hi>Hylas,</hi> unto a gratefull vi<U+017F>it of <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice:</hi> and her mode<U+017F>ty was <U+017F>uch, as would have given a check unto any but <hi>Hylas,</hi> from moving any matters of Love unto her: Yet, before the third vi<U+017F>it was paid, he acquainted her with his minde, and was as familiar, as if he had been brought up with her from his cradle. You have, fair one, (<U+017F>aid he unto her at the very fir<U+017F>t acco<U+017F>t) pre<U+017F>erved my life, and good rea<U+017F>on it <U+017F>hould be imployed in your <U+017F>ervice; and I will do it, though only out of gratitude: And not to detract from your fir<U+017F>t favour which you have done me, I be<U+017F>eech you accept this offer of my <U+017F>ervice, and believe, that there is no per<U+017F>on upon earth that can love you better then I, nor who<U+017F>e heart is <U+017F>well'd with more affection. My Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who was unaccu<U+017F>tomed to any <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, did, at the fir<U+017F>t, an<U+017F>wer him very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but <U+017F>eeing he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>he grew angry, and would not <U+017F>uffer him to u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: At the la<U+017F>t, when by his continuall vi<U+017F>its <U+017F>he found his humour, <U+017F>he did nothing but laugh at him, which did not offend him at all; for he had this good quality, that as he was free with every one, <U+017F>o he allowed every one to be free with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his Love did <U+017F>o increa<U+017F>e, that my companion did grow weary of him; not but that <hi>Hylas</hi> is certainly a man of much merit, and is owner of many qualities which de<U+017F>erve Love; but <U+017F>he being a Widow, and not intending to marry, this court<U+017F>hip could not but be very di<U+017F>advantageous to her.

Looking upon her therefore very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, he began by degrees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Cercenea</hi> was <U+017F>he whom he <U+017F>aw in the Temple, and remembring how excellently <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ing, and all that Love could make him apprehend at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, he quite forgot his promi<U+017F>e unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> and thought only how to <U+017F>peak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe. Thus you may <U+017F>ee how dangerous a thing it is, to imploy a Second in <U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e. He acco<U+017F>ted her, afterwards <U+017F>aluted her: And <U+017F>he, out of <U+017F>weet civility, returned him a <U+017F>alute again. Then both being in the Temple, and every one going to their devotion, he <U+017F>aid thus unto her: I <U+017F>ee, fair <hi>Cercenea,</hi> that the <U+017F>ight of you is fatall unto me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither to be an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant unto your <U+017F>acrifices, I am become a <U+017F>acrifice my <U+017F>elfe. She, who knew not the man, or ever heard of him, did look him in the face; and then, after a little con<U+017F>ideration, <U+017F>he concluded him to be a <U+017F>tranger, both by his language and habit; becau<U+017F>e, though they were made according to the garb of our Town, yet he did wear them in that manner, as was plain he was a <U+017F>tranger: For <U+017F>trangers, though they do di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves in our fa<U+017F>hion; yet, they have <U+017F>ome trick or other in their Air, by which one may <U+017F>ee, they are not of the <U+017F>ame Country. And I do believe, that this difference is le<U+017F><U+017F>e found among<U+017F>t the <hi>Franks,</hi> then any other Nation. Now <hi>Circenea</hi> not knowing <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>he thought, that he had taken her for <U+017F>ome other; and therefore, after <U+017F>he had looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <U+017F>he turned <U+017F>leightly another way, and gave him no an<U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas</hi> not <U+017F>atisfied with this, he pulled her by the Gown, and <U+017F>aid: What, fair one, no an<U+017F>wer to a civill que<U+017F>tion? I thought, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you had not <U+017F>poken unto me, or that you had addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed your <U+017F>peech unto <U+017F>ome other; for I do not know what you mean, by your fatall <U+017F>ight and your <U+017F>acrifice.

I do not remember any <U+017F>uch thing, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercenea,</hi> or that I ever <U+017F>aw you.

I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you are a <U+017F>tranger, and doe not know me; and I do believe, that my affection is very indifferent unto you. Upon this, <U+017F>he turned away, and one of her Companions comming accidentally into the Temple, <U+017F>he gave her place unto her, as if out of courte<U+017F>y, and got as neer her Mother as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could; and all the while that the <U+017F>acrifice la<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>he would not come neer him. But <hi>Hylas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke the Ice, he would go through, and was not a man that would <U+017F>it down in the mid way.</p>
               <p>He found a way, by the means of <hi>Palinice,</hi> to come into <hi>Cercenea's</hi> Chamber, and in conclu<U+017F>ion, grew very familiar, making <hi>Clorian</hi> believe all this while that it was for his <U+017F>ake he frequented her company <U+017F>o much. But <U+017F>uch was the humour of <hi>Hylas,</hi> as he did not think it enough to deceive his friend, and to love both <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but, one night as we were walking together, he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe as fair unto me as unto them, and that before he knew my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas,</hi> who as I told you before, was hearkning, he could not chu<U+017F>e, though it was contrary to his de<U+017F>igne, but <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>ay: Why, fair <hi>Florice,</hi> do you think it

What then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> can it be? An humour of changing, <U+017F>aid <hi>Florice,</hi> and a certain levity of minde, that will not let you continue foure and twenty houres in one opinion. Oh! <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you are a partie, and therefore your judgment may be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.

               <p>All this while, <hi>Paris</hi> had addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> whom after he had <U+017F>aluted; This, <U+017F>aid he, is a more happy encounter, than I could ever have hoped for, <U+017F>ince I did the lea<U+017F>t expect you here.

The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who had no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to hate <hi>Silvander,</hi> took notice of it, and <U+017F>o did <hi>Laonice,</hi> though the <U+017F>hepheard did di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it as well as he could; and they had known it better, if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had not parted them; for, de<U+017F>iring mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately to fini<U+017F>h their journey, <U+017F>he broke company: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <hi>Paris</hi> had taken <hi>Diana</hi> by the arme, <hi>Silvander</hi> went towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing him comming: It <U+017F>eemes (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) that we are too too many, and that, though we were ab<U+017F>ent, they could entertain them<U+017F>elves.

But my de<U+017F>ire is, to have a relation of that from your own mouth, which you hindred <hi>Florice</hi> from imparting to us. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this reque<U+017F>t, and being much offended with the extremity of the Suns heat, did <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he would be a very willing Auditor, <U+017F>o they could finde out an umbrage from the Sun's heat; for <U+017F>he believed, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> would be very plea<U+017F>ant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who longed to go about their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, did think as much, and therefore in compliance unto <hi>Diana's</hi> will, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>he would make one. So, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> it <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tick upon me; and I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe to be very bad company, if I were not very willing to give you <U+017F>atisfaction, and my <U+017F>elfe al<U+017F>o, for I do believe, there is as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thinking upon old and pa<U+017F>t Loves, as if they were pre<U+017F>ent; for the delights of Love are commonly more in the imagination, then in the thing it <U+017F>elfe; and in relation of things pa<U+017F>t the <U+017F>oul doth ca<U+017F>t her eye upon tho<U+017F>e images which remain in the fancy, and looks upon them as if they were pre<U+017F>ent. And therefore let us look out for a convenient <U+017F>hade, from the rayes of the Sun. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> to finde a more convenient place in all the Wood, then by this little brook which you <U+017F>ee; for the coolne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <U+017F>hade, and murmure of the water, is very inviting; be<U+017F>ides, it is nothing out of our way. All the company concur with him; and when they came unto it, every one began to wa<U+017F>h their hands, and <U+017F>it round the Fountain of it, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Silvander,</hi> who got into a great Cherry Tree, which made part of the <U+017F>hade unto the Fountain, and brought <U+017F>ome of the be<U+017F>t Cherries unto <hi>Diana,</hi> who gave <U+017F>ome to <hi>Paris</hi> and the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and picking out <U+017F>ome of the be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he gave them unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aying; Here <hi>Silvander,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs give you <U+017F>ome, who gave them unto me. I would to god (<U+017F>aid he, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand that gave them) you would receive all I give you with as good a will as this. Then taking his place as neer her as he could, <hi>Hylas,</hi> when they had eaten all their Cherries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of</hi> Parthenopea, Florice, <hi>and</hi> Dorinde.</head>
               <p>I Have often laughed in my thoughts, at all tho<U+017F>e who condemn incon<U+017F>tancy, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ed enemies again<U+017F>t it, con<U+017F>idering, that they them<U+017F>elves are not able to be as they <U+017F>ay, nor more con<U+017F>tant, then tho<U+017F>e, whom they brand with that vice; for, when they do fall in love do they not fall in love with Beauty, or <U+017F>omething they think that is plea<U+017F>ing unto them? Now when this Beauty doth fade, as time doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e will make all Beauty do, are not they incon<U+017F>tant, in <U+017F>till loving tho<U+017F>e faces that are now grown ugly, and retain nothing of what they were, but only the very name of a face? If to love that, which is contrary unto that which was loved, be incon<U+017F>tancy; and if ugline<U+017F><U+017F>e be contrary unto beauty: then he that did love a fair face, and continues loving it when it is ugly, mu<U+017F>t be concluded incon<U+017F>tant. This con<U+017F>ideration makes me think, that the way to avoid incon<U+017F>tancy, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to love beauty, and when it fades, farewell love; finde <U+017F>ome other that is fair, and <U+017F>till love beauty, and not its contrary, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you be uncon<U+017F>tant to your fir<U+017F>t love. I know full well, that this is point blank again<U+017F>t the opinion of the vulgar: But, by way of an<U+017F>wer, let me tell you, that the Heard of people, the vulgar, is but a heard of rude and ignorant bea<U+017F>ts and in this, they give a true te<U+017F>timony of it.</p>
               <p>Do not think it <U+017F>trange, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, nor you generous <hi>Paris,</hi> if in relating the <U+017F>tory of my life you hear of many <U+017F>uch changes: For, I am <U+017F>o carefull not to decline from this con<U+017F>tancy, that I had rather quit all tho<U+017F>e whom hitherto I have loved, then recede from it. You have formerly been acquainted with the cau<U+017F>e, why I came out of <hi>Camargues,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:53526:127"/>
how I came unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> why I loved <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea.</hi> And when I interrupted <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> <U+017F>he would have told you, how <U+017F>he began to captivate me; but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he forgot <U+017F>ome things which are requi<U+017F>ite you <U+017F>hould know, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak out that, which <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtlely conceal, and then relate the <U+017F>tory of my life, if we have time enough.</p>
               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know, then, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Clorian</hi> was very ill advi<U+017F>ed, in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to be his <U+017F>poke<U+017F>-man unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> in <U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e as that, it is dangerous to make choice of a friend, that is better accompli<U+017F>hed then him<U+017F>elfe; a hundred to one, but in lieu of Friend, he becomes a Lover; and he that <U+017F>ent him, not loved; for, if his Mi<U+017F>tris have any wit, <U+017F>he will chu<U+017F>e the better. The truth is, when I went with <hi>Palinice</hi> unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Clorian,</hi> my intention was to <U+017F>erve him as a friend, and to u<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, which might conduce unto his contentment; but, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>aw this Beauty, I remembered, that I my <U+017F>elfe was in love with her, ever <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw her that night in the Temple; <U+017F>o as now the <U+017F>tate of the que<U+017F>tion was whether I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tifle Friend<U+017F>hip, or <U+017F>tifle Love; and after a long debate with my <U+017F>elfe unto which I <U+017F>hould yield, I concluded, that the la<U+017F>t commer mu<U+017F>t give place unto the fir<U+017F>t. Love told me, that it had taken po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of my <U+017F>oul almo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I was born, and that my affection unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> was before my love of <hi>Palinice,</hi> which was the cau<U+017F>e of my friend<U+017F>hip with <hi>Clorian;</hi> and therefore my friend<U+017F>hip coming after my love, it is inju<U+017F>tice if I let it keep <U+017F>till in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion. No <U+017F>urely, thought I, we <U+017F>ee the Lawes allow primogeniture in Children, and Nature it <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>eemes to approve of it. This was the rea<U+017F>on why I applyed my <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> as <hi>Florice</hi> hath told you. And I be<U+017F>eech you judge, whether I am obliged to endeavour the contentment of another, before my own. Why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he upbraid me with the name of Traitor to my friend? For, if of two evills, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er be alwaies to be cho<U+017F>en; if killing ones <U+017F>elfe be the wor<U+017F>t of murders, who, that is in his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, will <U+017F>ay, but I had better betray friend<U+017F>hip then love, and have a greater regard unto the pre<U+017F>ervation of my own life and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the life and contentment of <hi>Clorian? Clorian</hi> loved me, and I loved <hi>Cercenea; Clorian</hi> de<U+017F>ired me to <U+017F>peak for him, and my affection bad me <U+017F>peak for my <U+017F>elfe: If I did not <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Clorian,</hi> I offended again<U+017F>t my friend<U+017F>hip to him; if I did not <U+017F>atisfie my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I offended again<U+017F>t <hi>Cercenea</hi> and <hi>Hylas.</hi> I do love <hi>Clorian,</hi> and I do love <hi>Hylas</hi> al<U+017F>o. Put <U+017F>elfe and another in the <U+017F>cales, and <U+017F>elfe, I dare <U+017F>ay will out-weigh: So I and <hi>Clorian.</hi> The gods did favour my de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>o as <hi>Cercenea,</hi> after <U+017F>ome court<U+017F>hip, did love me may be, as well as I loved her, and when you know what a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of it <U+017F>he did give me, I believe you will <U+017F>ay as much as I. But becau<U+017F>e there was <U+017F>ome unto whom <U+017F>he owed duty, and particularly her Mother, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired me to let her faign as if <U+017F>he loved <hi>Clorian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e there was already <U+017F>ome probability of a Marriage betwixt them, being both of one Town, and one quality. Moreover, <hi>Clorian</hi> being very rich, her Mother would doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e like well of the Match; whereas if my love unto her had been di<U+017F>covered, being a <U+017F>tranger, and perhaps had a wife in <U+017F>ome other place, <U+017F>he would have di<U+017F>allowed of it, and perhaps charged her daughter not to <U+017F>ee me.</p>
               <p>I was very glad of the motion, becau<U+017F>e I knew not with what language I could put <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> off any longer, having worn out all my excu<U+017F>es, till they were thread-ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>o much with <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and yet doing nothing for him, began to be in <U+017F>ome doubt of me. Then I acquainted <hi>Cercenea</hi> with all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt <hi>Clorian</hi> and me, and how he had employed me to <U+017F>peak unto her. But, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. I told her by way of mocking him, le<U+017F>t if I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>et forth unto her his affection as it was, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any <U+017F>parks of love unto him; but, I did it <U+017F>o dexterou<U+017F>ly, that <hi>Cercenea</hi> had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minde to make u<U+017F>e of him as a cloak for her love of me, with le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition and told me. That her Mother had often propo<U+017F>ed him unto her for a Husband, and that <U+017F>he knew he had <U+017F>ome good will unto her. Then I went unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> unto whom I faigned a long Prologue, as an introduction of what I intended to <U+017F>ay; I related unto him the <U+017F>peeches, an<U+017F>wers, and replyes, that I made in his behalfe, and did a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that I had made a way for his affection to finde a welcome. Oh! what thanks did he give me, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es to <U+017F>erve me upon the like occa<U+017F>ion: for which I thanked him, but did not de<U+017F>ire to be in his hands as he was in mine. At the la<U+017F>t, he took heart, and according to my advice, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>peak of it unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but, with more fear and heart-beating, then if he were to fight with the mo<U+017F>t valiant man alive: Yet, the courage which I had infu<U+017F>ed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that he <U+017F>hould be welcome to her, did make him <U+017F>urmount tho<U+017F>e fears which had <U+017F>olong <U+017F>ilenc'd him; and finding an opportunity, he acquainted her with his intentions in the be<U+017F>t language he could invent, the effect of which was, that he bore unto
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53526:128"/>
her <U+017F>o much humble re<U+017F>pect, as, without me, he never had dur<U+017F>t to declare his affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; that it was all purity and vertuous de<U+017F>ires. Truly (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) you have a very good friend of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you may well think him <U+017F>o, and by all meanes pre<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch a Jewell; for he hath done nothing above a month, but continually talk in commendation of you: Al<U+017F>o, you may under<U+017F>tand from him, that I am not <U+017F>o obdurate as you imagine, but does think my <U+017F>elfe obliged to entertain a man of your merit, when you come with hone<U+017F>t and pure de<U+017F>ignes of Marriage, as your friend tells me you do; and therefore I am contented to live with you, according to the purity of <U+017F>uch affection; but I <U+017F>hall be very glad to have <hi>Hylas</hi> a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of all that pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth betwixt us, that he may arbitrate all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt us. I mu<U+017F>t be briefe, my fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e an age would not <U+017F>erve, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the accidents that befell me. But be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that ever <U+017F>ince this day, <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> was <U+017F>o far ingaged, that he could not retreat; and becau<U+017F>e their Parents began to take notice of it, I did acquaint her Mother, that <hi>Clorian</hi> did intend to marry her Daughter, and that, becau<U+017F>e I thought it an advantageous Match unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> I had contributed all my endeavours to bring it about; but, <U+017F>ince I had not yet <U+017F>poken of it unto his Father and Mother, I de<U+017F>ired, that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e might be kept <U+017F>ecret. <hi>Cercenea's</hi> Mother knowing <hi>Clorian</hi> to be rich and well born did heartily thank me for my endeavours, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire, that if <hi>Clorian</hi> had any <U+017F>uch minde, he would <U+017F>peak unto her, and <U+017F>he would keep it as <U+017F>ecret as he plea<U+017F>ed; but <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, to have that <U+017F>atisfaction from him<U+017F>elfe. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her, he <U+017F>hould; and accordingly, within a few daies after, we went unto her again, and <hi>Clorian</hi> told her more then I had done. Thus all things went very well; for my part, I was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Mother, more welcome to <hi>Clorian,</hi> but mo<U+017F>t of all to <hi>Cercenea.</hi> You <U+017F>ee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a pa<U+017F><U+017F>e I was brought: to <U+017F>eem as if I did not love this fair one, I was forced to quit my place unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> and to <U+017F>peak for him. When there was any company, I <U+017F>tood before them, that <hi>Clorian</hi> might un<U+017F>een ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand; but, it vexed me to the <U+017F>oul, when he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her mouth, as often he did in my pre<U+017F>ence: And though it did di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me very much, and <hi>Cercenea</hi> more, yet we did con<U+017F>train our <U+017F>elves, that <U+017F>he and I might have <U+017F>ome opportunities <U+017F>ometimes of privacy: For the Mother, believing me to be a mediator only for <hi>Clorian</hi> did give me all the liberty I could de<U+017F>ire. Nay more, I brought her Letters from <hi>Clorian,</hi> and oftentimes did an<U+017F>wer them my <U+017F>elfe, for <U+017F>he did only write them, and god knowes, not without much laughter and jearing of him.</p>
               <p>Thus did I live, the mo<U+017F>t contented man alive, till Fortune upon a <U+017F>udden turn'd the wheel and yet it went not <U+017F>o neer my heart, as it would anothers, becau<U+017F>e I had <U+017F>o good a receipt again<U+017F>t all <U+017F>uch maladies. The <hi>Facchanalian</hi> Fea<U+017F>ts being at hand to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Clorian</hi> and I re<U+017F>olved to maintain a Tournement. <hi>Clorian</hi> took for his device a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Circe</hi> (with <hi>Circenea's</hi> face) among<U+017F>t the Companions of <hi>Uly<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> with this Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>To her had fewer Charmes.</hi> But I not daring to declare my <U+017F>elfe as he did, I did a little di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her name, and painted a <hi>Syren,</hi> and <hi>Uly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> tyed to the Ma<U+017F>t of his Ship, with this Motto, <hi>What B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As chance was, there was a young Beauty in <hi>Lyons,</hi> who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> a neer neighbour unto my lodging, with whom, how ever it came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, I had no great familiarity; for it was not my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to have any fair neighbours, and not to vi<U+017F>it them. When I was in the Li<U+017F>ts, tho<U+017F>e that were curious, began to interpret our devices; as for that of <hi>Clorian,</hi> every one could ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tand it, <hi>Circenca's</hi> face, and the clinch of her name, did <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>cover it: But, as for mine, none could give it a meaning. At the la<U+017F>t an old Knight that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold, among<U+017F>t the Ladies where <hi>Cercenea</hi> was, and <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and who<U+017F>e age excu<U+017F>ed him from being in Armes, he <U+017F>aid, that it was ea<U+017F>ie to di<U+017F>cover his meaning; and then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Parthenopea:</hi> It is for you, fair One, <U+017F>aid he, that he enters into the Li<U+017F>ts. At this, <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>h'd and thinking her <U+017F>elfe wrongfully accu<U+017F>ed, did an<U+017F>wer: If it be for me, he is very <U+017F>ecret in his matters, for he never <U+017F>poke to me. Take heed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cercenea,</hi> who thought her <U+017F>elfe concerned) that you do not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, and carry it more clo<U+017F>e then he doth. It is an ea<U+017F>y matter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to carry that <U+017F>ecret which I do not know. If you plea<U+017F>e to know the rea<U+017F>on of my opinion (<U+017F>aid the old Knight) I <U+017F>hall tell you, and I am confident your judgments will agree with mine. I <U+017F>hall be very glad, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to under<U+017F>tand this <U+017F>ecret from you. You <U+017F>ee then (replyed the old Knight) that he bears a <hi>Syren</hi> upon his Shield, with this Motto, <hi>What Bonds would be <U+017F>ufficient?</hi> he could not more plainly name you, then by the painting of a <hi>Syren;</hi> for the Ancients <U+017F>ay, that the <hi>Syrens</hi> were three Daughters of <hi>Achiloes,</hi> by the Nymph <hi>Calliope;</hi> and were called <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi>

                  <hi>Leuco<U+017F>ia,</hi> and <hi>Parthenopea;</hi> and your name being <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> he could not more clearly expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his meaning then by a <hi>Syren,</hi> and <hi>Uly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> tyed to the Ma<U+017F>t of a Ship, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that nothing can hinder him from being yours, if by your favours you will be his. Then all the company cryed out; Oh <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> how clo<U+017F>ely have you kept it? But you had now better to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e then deny it. For my part, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it is all one whether it be <U+017F>o or no, for it concernes me but a little. I hope then <U+017F>aid <hi>Circenea,</hi> you will not be angry if we call him your Knight. I do not care <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but have a care you do not call him wrong. The report went pre<U+017F>ently among<U+017F>t the Ladies that I was the <hi>Syren's</hi> Knight, and <hi>Clorian Cyrenea's.</hi> For my part, I knew nothing of it, but took notice, that as I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed under the Scaffold, <hi>Cercenea</hi> cryed out unto me, Adieu the Knight of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> but I knew not what <U+017F>he meant.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, the Tourney being ended, every one retired; and <hi>Clorian</hi> and I thinking we had behaved our <U+017F>elves very well, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as we had put off our Armes, we went unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but <U+017F>he being infinitely incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me, did not look upon me with her u<U+017F>uall <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but when I <U+017F>poke to her, <U+017F>he would give no reply, but, Let me alone, Knight of the <hi>Syren,</hi> and in a <U+017F>corning manner, turned away from me. I was <U+017F>o innocent in what <U+017F>he accu<U+017F>ed me of, that I knew not what to think, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e that I had ill acquitted my <U+017F>elfe in this Tournement, which I undertook to maintain: But not conceiving, that I had done any wor<U+017F>e then my Companion; and <U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he cheri<U+017F>hed him, I could not imagine what to think.</p>
               <p>That night I retired, un<U+017F>atisfied; for I could not obtain <U+017F>o much favour, as to <U+017F>peak with her in private, but went away much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at my fortune. But the next morning, a chance happened, which <U+017F>poiled all my affairs. Being that morning in the Temple, I <U+017F>aw there <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> with one of her Aunts; and <U+017F>eating my <U+017F>elfe by chance by her, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <U+017F>he did not look upon me with the eye of an enemy: She was fair, and con<U+017F>equently one of tho<U+017F>e, who by the Lawes of Con<U+017F>tancy, I was obliged to love; and therefore I got a little neerer unto her, and watching for an opportunity of <U+017F>peaking unto her, <U+017F>he leaned towards me, and <U+017F>aid How Sir, do you like the Tournement? It is my part, <U+017F>aid I, to ask you that que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>ince it is the office of <U+017F>uch Beauties as your <U+017F>elfe to judge. I do not ask you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how you did behave your <U+017F>elfe, for every one can witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, none could do better; but I would gladly know, whether you be not weary after all the pains you took? Since, fair one, <U+017F>aid I, you have given <U+017F>uch an advantageous judgment for me, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I <U+017F>hould be weary. We were in a place where long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was not hand<U+017F>ome, and therefore <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me only with a <U+017F>mile, and turned the other way When prayers and devotions were done, <U+017F>he went out of the Temple; and I conceiving my <U+017F>elfe obliged by her language to wait upon her to her lodging, which was neer, I took her by the hand, and by the way I under<U+017F>tood how it was the opinion of every one, that I maintained the Tournement as her Knight. I being glad to umbrage my affection unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and moreover taken with the favours of <hi>Parthenopea</hi> I an<U+017F>wered her, that it was true and that not daring to declare it by my words, I made choice of that way. After much di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and when we were come unto her lodging <U+017F>he took off her Scarfe, and laid it upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; afterwards her Mask, and <U+017F>tanding to the fire, <U+017F>he talked unto me and I perceived, that what I had done, was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>till renewed the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: And the more I <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>ervice plea<U+017F>ed, the more fell I in love with her. In conclu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before I parted, I took her Scarfe which lay upon the Table, and though <U+017F>he made a little re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, yet I put it about my neck, and told her, That <U+017F>ince I undertook a Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement for her, without any mark of my affection, it was rea<U+017F>onable I <U+017F>hould have that, as a te<U+017F>timony of my being hers; her re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance was not great, and therefore I carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and wore it about my neck all the re<U+017F>t of the day. However, becau<U+017F>e I would not lo<U+017F>e <hi>Cercenea,</hi> I would not go into any place where <U+017F>he was in probability of <U+017F>eeing me: But he whom I doubted the lea<U+017F>t, which was <hi>Clorian,</hi> told her, not intending any hurt unto me, that I was the mo<U+017F>t contented man in the world, with the favours of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and thereupon told her of the Scarfe. Oh how this went to her very heart, for <U+017F>he did really love me, and yet <U+017F>he made no <U+017F>hew of any di<U+017F>content. But the next morning when I went unto her, and <hi>Clorian</hi> not there: Oh Knight of the <hi>Syren,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what have you done with your fine Scarfe? I mu<U+017F>t tell you that I did love <hi>Cercenea</hi> much better then I did <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenopea,</hi> and would not lo<U+017F>e her upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall an occa<U+017F>ion; and therefore I <U+017F>wore a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and oaths that when I undertook the Tournement, I had not the lea<U+017F>t thought of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenopea;</hi> but upon the word of <hi>Syren</hi> only, which had a re<U+017F>emblance unto <hi>Cercenea.</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:53526:129"/>
But, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, why did you not tell me of it? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered I, I thought the thing <U+017F>o plain, that you would know it this way. And what do you (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) concerning this Scarfe? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid I unto her, that I took it from <hi>Parthenopea</hi> ye<U+017F>terday, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my affection unto you under that vail. <hi>Cercenea</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent a while, and then began thus: Well <hi>Hylas,</hi> I wil believe all you tell me provided you will give me <U+017F>atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in one thing. It <U+017F>hall be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible (<U+017F>aid I) if I do not. Give me the Scarfe, replyed <U+017F>he, which you took from <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and in exchange, I <U+017F>hall give you another which is better. I was very loath to do it, and would gladly have come off with an excu<U+017F>e, but it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had it, <U+017F>he put it upon her arme, and gave me another, which indeed was much better; and the <U+017F>ame day, knowing that I was not in my lodging, <U+017F>he went with <U+017F>ome of her friends (under colour of walking) unto my lodging, and <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>ee if I was not within: A <U+017F>ervant of mine, whom <U+017F>he knew, came to her, and told her, that I was not in my lodging. This good company and my <U+017F>elfe (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) were de<U+017F>irous of his company to walk with us: But prethee do me the favour to go and tell <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> that we <U+017F>tay here for her to that end; and in reward of thy <U+017F>ervice, take this Scarfe, and wear it all this day for my <U+017F>ake. Then <U+017F>he put about his neck that Scarf which I had from <hi>Parthenopea.</hi> This varlet thought him<U+017F>elfe mighty brave, and much honoured in this favour, and gave her mo<U+017F>t humble thanks; and to <U+017F>hew his ready obedience, ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could to deliver his me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing her Scarfe about the fellowes neck, <U+017F>he had an opinion, that I cau<U+017F>ed him to wear it in <U+017F>corn of her, and hearing his err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd, did know very well, that it came from <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and that I had given it unto her; which did <U+017F>o extreamly offend her, that I could never <U+017F>ince renew with her, and much le<U+017F><U+017F>e with <hi>Cerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> who ab<U+017F>olutely declined me, although <U+017F>he plainly <U+017F>aw, that I did love her better then I did <hi>Parthenopea.</hi> But practi<U+017F>ing this Maxime, that one mu<U+017F>t hate them whom they have offended, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he knowing her trea<U+017F>on to be great, <U+017F>he would never con<U+017F>ide in me again. I was con<U+017F>trained to return unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> but <U+017F>tayed not long; for it being then the <U+017F>pring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the year, the<U+017F>e Ladies would many in a company, enjoy the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the aire, and go into the Country in a Barge, up the calm and <U+017F>mooth River of <hi>Arar,</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing away the time, one while in mu<U+017F>ick of In<U+017F>truments, another while in that of Voices and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times landing, would dance upon the dazie Meadowes. As ill luck was, I had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among<U+017F>t all this good company, but only <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea;</hi> however, I thru<U+017F>t in among<U+017F>t them, and undertook to entertain them all: I <U+017F>aw they all whi<U+017F>pered, and asked who I was and <hi>Palinice</hi> had a great deal of trouble in telling my name unto all that asked her: But pre<U+017F>ently after, I was as well known as any in the company, for, holding di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e with the fir<U+017F>t that did offer any, they found my humour <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing, that all of them de<U+017F>ired my friend<U+017F>hip. As long as the Barge went upward, although the River ran <U+017F>o <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as one could not tell which way it ran; yet, <U+017F>ometimes it would make <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tream, as they could u<U+017F>e none but In<U+017F>truments: but when it went downward, the waves made only a little da<U+017F>hing again<U+017F>t the Barge, and then tho<U+017F>e who had good Voices, did <U+017F>ing what came into their fancies. Among<U+017F>t this a<U+017F><U+017F>embly of Beauties, there was many Knights, and children of Druides, to keep them company, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the evening with more delight. This was the fir<U+017F>t time I ever <U+017F>aw <hi>Theombres:</hi> This man had almo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Autumne of his age, in <U+017F>uch a good opinion of him<U+017F>elfe, as he thought all Ladies like to die for the love of him: For my part, I never could ob<U+017F>erve any taking quality in him; yet certainly, he had <U+017F>ome features, which was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto <U+017F>ome: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Florice</hi> was one, who might come into the catalogue of tho<U+017F>e who are called Fair: Indeed <U+017F>he was fair, all her features plea<U+017F>ing, but above all her eyes were <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet and alluring as I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I never <U+017F>aw <U+017F>uch; her <U+017F>tature was tall, and her minde <U+017F>o maje<U+017F>tick, as one might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>he was above vulgar extraction; and indeed <U+017F>he was of that Family, who vaunts to be de<U+017F>cended from the great <hi>Ariovi<U+017F>tes.</hi> And though this fair Lady was <U+017F>uch, as there was not one in all the Country, but did, and ought, to yield unto her, both in merit and beauty: Yet, <hi>Theombres</hi> was more in her affection, then any in the Town. And becau<U+017F>e it was long <U+017F>ince this Love began, and hung in a kinde of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing continuance, <hi>Theombres</hi> thought it be<U+017F>t to awake it, by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parks of jealou<U+017F>ie; and therefore <U+017F>eemed as if he were in love with a young Beauty, called <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome beauty, but yet yielded in all unto <hi>Florice:</hi>
Now <hi>Dorinde</hi> being gone out of the Town unto one of her Uncles, <hi>Theombres,</hi> to continue his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, did alwaies, when he <U+017F>ung, take <hi>Dorinde</hi> for the <U+017F>ubject, and, as I remember, one Ver<U+017F>e of

I perceived it well enough, but <U+017F>till waited, till her words gave me an occa<U+017F>ion to let her know, that I loved her. My rea<U+017F>on, why I treated her at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance of re<U+017F>pect, was, the grandure and <U+017F>tate that <U+017F>he kept, which in truth was <U+017F>uch, that of all I ever loved before, I never <U+017F>tood in <U+017F>uch reverentiall fear, as of her. It hapned as I hoped for after <U+017F>he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many of the flowers which I gathered, <U+017F>he told me, I had taken too much paines, and that I would think her to be uncivill, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered me to continue. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered, That I thought every one obliged to do her all <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o excellently well defended her friend in her ab<U+017F>ence. Do you mean <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me? The very <U+017F>ame <U+017F>aid I, in who<U+017F>e per<U+017F>on you have obliged all others. Truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the vanity of <hi>Theombres;</hi> for you <U+017F>ee what he is, and yet he thinks, we are all ready to die for the love of him. Then certainly, <U+017F>aid I, Ladies mu<U+017F>t needs be either very loving, or of very little judgment; for I think him to be rather a remedy again<U+017F>t Love, then of any capacity to cau<U+017F>e it. I am clearly of your opinion, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; for, if I had an inclination to love, this man of all men living <U+017F>hould be the la<U+017F>t I would chu<U+017F>e. If you <U+017F>hould love him, <U+017F>aid I, it would be a grand offence again<U+017F>t the gods, who having adorned you with <U+017F>o much beauty, you would that way profane it. I cannot tell (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what beauty there is in me: but I am mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure, that I could never love him. Cannot you tell what beauty there is in you, <U+017F>aid I? then you cannot tell what all the world doth <U+017F>ee; but, perhaps it is only your mode<U+017F>ty, which makes you <U+017F>eem ignorant of it. No, no, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I do really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is nothing in my face which can merit that name you give it: But, be it what it will, pray let's talk no more of it, for more would be out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting. I <U+017F>hall obey you, <U+017F>aid I unto her, but it <U+017F>hall be with this prote<U+017F>tation then, that I will never <U+017F>peak again what I think, and what you have forbidden to be in my mouth, <U+017F>hall as long as I live re<U+017F>t in my heart. We had di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed longer, had not the company
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53526:130"/>
called us away, for they were already gone into the Barge. Then <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any an<U+017F>wer, and putting her flowers in a corner of her Gown, I took her hand, and conducted her to her company, where not daring to revive the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which we left, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be too bold (for <U+017F>o much forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e in the fir<U+017F>t declaration of Love, is a <U+017F>igne of but little affection) I contented my <U+017F>elfe at this time with what I had already <U+017F>aid. At la<U+017F>t, the generall genius of the company was all for <U+017F>inging, and when it came to my turn, I <U+017F>ung the<U+017F>e en<U+017F>uing Ver<U+017F>es, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Florice,</hi> that all which I had <U+017F>aid, was true.</p>

               <p>Thus, fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> was a good foundation laid; for, <U+017F>ince the very fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to make a retreat; yet it angred me, that I <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> as well becau<U+017F>e I was obliged unto her, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was really a woman of much merit. Moreover, the love of <hi>Cercenea</hi> much grieved me; for this young Beauty being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <U+017F>he <U+017F>leighted all the rea<U+017F>ons I could bring in to convince her. However, though <U+017F>he did not love me, yet it vext her to <U+017F>ee, that <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>hould have a more ab<U+017F>olute power over me, then ever <U+017F>he could have, thinking this to be an argument, of her being inferiour in beauty: And this was the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he did me all the ill offices <U+017F>he could both to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linice</hi> and <hi>Florice.</hi> But <U+017F>o it hapned, that her malice did me no harm, but did more for me, then all my <U+017F>ervices perhaps of a long time could have done; for <hi>Florice</hi> pre<U+017F>ently found, that <hi>Cercenea,</hi> did <U+017F>peak it out of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate partiality, and therefore <U+017F>he gave no credit unto her: And on the contrary, con<U+017F>idering and ob<U+017F>erving my actions more neerly, <U+017F>he began to finde them agreeable, and by little and little to plea<U+017F>e her; <U+017F>o as Love, like a <U+017F>lie and <U+017F>ubtle <U+017F>pie, did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elfe into her <U+017F>oul. However, I being very de<U+017F>irous to keep my <U+017F>elfe in <hi>Palinice's</hi> favour, I was a little vexed.</p>
               <p>But learn this from me, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, and turned towards that Shepheard) that there is none whom women e<U+017F>teem more, then tho<U+017F>e who are in love with them. Nor none whom they more de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> then tho<U+017F>e that leave them, and love another. But upon this con<U+017F>ideration, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I endeavoured to keep fair with all, if it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but all in vain; for <hi>Florice</hi> was too full of vanitie, and had too over good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53526:130"/>
of her own merits, to entertain a heart in which any other had a <U+017F>hare. And this proud <U+017F>oul re<U+017F>olving to be <U+017F>ole Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e and to love none but me, <U+017F>he did one day do me <U+017F>o much favour, as to a<U+017F><U+017F>urence of her love. But, <U+017F>aid I unto her, what <U+017F>hall we do with <hi>Theombres,</hi> (thinking to upbraid her with him)? She pre<U+017F>ently an<U+017F>wered me in my own element. Let us give him unto <hi>Palinice.</hi> I under<U+017F>tood her meaning well enough and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I <U+017F>wore unto her never to love any but <hi>Florice</hi> and that if <U+017F>he would bani<U+017F>h <hi>Theom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> out of her <U+017F>ight, I would promi<U+017F>e her, never to look upon <hi>Palinice</hi> again. Nor becau<U+017F>e you de<U+017F>ire it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he but becau<U+017F>e he does extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, I will <U+017F>wear and prote<U+017F>t unto you, that I will never love him, and that if it were hand<U+017F>ome, I would bani<U+017F>h him out of my <U+017F>ight; for when you con<U+017F>ider that action well, you will finde it to be a greater wound unto me, then it can be <U+017F>atisfaction unto you. Since this time, <U+017F>he gave her <U+017F>elfe wholly unto me, and I, contrary to my own nature, did give my <U+017F>elfe wholly unto her, and declined all others. From morning untill night I never <U+017F>tirred out of her lodging: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he went; and if any came upon vi<U+017F>its, they mu<U+017F>t be per<U+017F>ons of great eminency, if they did interrupt our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. At every word, I was in her mouth, and <U+017F>he in mine, and we could not <U+017F>peak, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e the one called the other as a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Judge yet, whether <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea</hi> had not enough to talk off. This was the rea<U+017F>on, why all the Town made it their common talk; and reports alwaies encrea<U+017F>ing by going, they went <U+017F>o much in di<U+017F>advantage of <hi>Florices</hi> honour, that at la<U+017F>t they came to her ears, by a friend who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her. She repented her <U+017F>elfe of the imprudent carriage of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, though too late: She acquainted me and told me, that we mu<U+017F>t be more circum<U+017F>pect in our expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of good will; and the better to hide it for the future <U+017F>he willed me not to come unto her, but at night, and <U+017F>o give a <U+017F>top unto reports if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. To give her <U+017F>atisfaction, I refrained comming for a while; but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was as much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my company, as I of hers, it was re<U+017F>olved betwixt us, to finde out <U+017F>ome way or other, to avoid the cen<U+017F>ure of the world, and yet be together. After con<U+017F>ideration <U+017F>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed me to <U+017F>eem as if I loved <U+017F>ome, who u<U+017F>ed to be familiarly with her, and under that <U+017F>haddow, I might come unto her: And upon <U+017F>erious thoughts, none deemed more fit for this purpo<U+017F>e then <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as well, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was her co<U+017F>en, and frequently familiar, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was fair, though not very <U+017F>ubtle: And though <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>o fair as <hi>Florice,</hi> nor <U+017F>o rich, nor <U+017F>o well de<U+017F>cended; yet, <U+017F>he did excell the mo<U+017F>t, both in beauty and merit. The day that I declared my <U+017F>elfe <hi>Dorinde's</hi> <U+017F>ervant, was that, upon which the people ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Fea<U+017F>t, in memory of the re<U+017F>tauration and building of their Town by <hi>Nero,</hi> after that mo<U+017F>t terrible fire, which in one night con<U+017F>umed it to the ground. At this time of publick joy, every one did <U+017F>trive to appear as fine as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they could, as well to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>acrifices offered unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Re<U+017F>taurator, and to the Titular gods, as to be <U+017F>een in the Theaters and publick Shewes. <hi>Dorinde,</hi> de<U+017F>irous to be <U+017F>een and ob<U+017F>erved, did <U+017F>et out her beauty with all the illu<U+017F>trations that Art could devi<U+017F>e. Before the day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I did <U+017F>o acco<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde</hi> with my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of that affection I had unto her, that <U+017F>he did believe them. At that time and day, I became acquainted with a young Cavalier called <hi>Periander,</hi> a man indeed full of civility, di<U+017F>cretion, and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e: This man <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>equious to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and finding my humour agreeable unto his own, re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make me his friend: And I, on the other <U+017F>ide, being de<U+017F>irous of acquaintance in that place, where I intended to <U+017F>tay, <U+017F>ince Love did <U+017F>o oblige me to it; I thought him to be a man of merit, and therefore was glad to have him my friend. This encounter of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip, which proceeded from one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ympatheticall cau<U+017F>e, was <U+017F>ooner contracted betwixt him and me, then betwixt me and <hi>Dorinde,</hi> although <hi>Florice,</hi> the better to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e her own love, did contribute all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could unto it: But poor <hi>Florice</hi> did not fore<U+017F>ee, how <U+017F>he was <U+017F>harpning a <U+017F>word which gave her a deep wound <U+017F>he did not know, how it was alwaies my humour, never to <U+017F>ee any Beauty, but I mu<U+017F>t needs love her a little; <U+017F>o as ere I was aware, I was in Love with <hi>Dorinde</hi> as well as with <hi>Florice:</hi> yet, I did love <hi>Florice</hi> better, <U+017F>he being more fair, and of a higher rank. Two months were <U+017F>pent in this manner, and the friend<U+017F>hip betwixt <hi>Periander</hi> and me grew to that height, that we were commonly called the two Friends; and becau<U+017F>e we both de<U+017F>ired a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, we took reciprocall oathes, of a mo<U+017F>t faithfull and perfect friend<U+017F>hip, calling the gods to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e to the oath which we had taken, and to be puni<U+017F>hers of him, who <U+017F>hould violate the Lawes of friend<U+017F>hip. After this prote<U+017F>tation, nothing was in the <U+017F>oul of one, but it was di<U+017F>covered unto the other. It hapned one morning (for commonly we lay both together) after much di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon the Beauties of the Town, he asked me, whether
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53526:131"/>
there was any of them which I loved: And an<U+017F>wering him; Yes: He told me, that before he would ask me who my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e was, he would tell me who was his I de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>aid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to be the fir<U+017F>t in that freedome, becau<U+017F>e you were the fir<U+017F>t that asked the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion. Then I related unto him all the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es which I had made unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>ince the la<U+017F>t two months, but would not by any means mention <hi>Florice,</hi> as well, becau<U+017F>e I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her more and de<U+017F>ired that that Love <U+017F>hould be kept <U+017F>ecret, as becau<U+017F>e I knew that one of his con<U+017F>ens did court her in Marriage. As <U+017F>oon as I had named <hi>Dorinde:</hi> How, (<U+017F>aid he) do you love <hi>Dorinde? Dorinde,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Arcingentorix.</hi> The very <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aid I; and I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that I have courted her above this <U+017F>ix months. Oh heavens! cried he, how cruelly doth love treat me? And after he had pau<U+017F>ed a while; I do <U+017F>wear, <U+017F>aid he, and prote<U+017F>t, that it is <U+017F>he whom I have long loved. Could a greater misfortune befall me! I had rather die then retreat, and if I continue, I <U+017F>hall offend again<U+017F>t the Lawes of Amitie. I was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to hear him <U+017F>ay thus; for, though I loved him, yet it went again<U+017F>t my heart to leave <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto whom Love had kindled new de<U+017F>ires in me: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after I had held my eyes up to heaven, as one that was much troubled, I <U+017F>aid thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Brother, <U+017F>ince our Loves did begin in us before our Friend<U+017F>hip, it argues a <U+017F>ympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in our humours, which forceth us to love the <U+017F>ame; but however, let the Lawes of Friend<U+017F>hip be inviolable; <U+017F>ince we have thus far agreed, let our prudence endeavour to continue <U+017F>o for the future; and in order to that, let us <U+017F>ee whom this Lady mo<U+017F>t affects: To think that our friend<U+017F>hip <U+017F>hould make us quit her the one unto the other, this would be rather tyranny then friend<U+017F>hip; and to think, that we can continue Rivalls and Friends, is Folly. What then <U+017F>hould we do? Let us refer all to Rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>ee which of us <U+017F>he loves mo<U+017F>t. Tell me, I do conjure you by the Oath which we have taken, whether it be true, that <U+017F>he doth love you, and what te<U+017F>timonies of it <U+017F>he hath given you? I do <U+017F>wear, Brother, (an<U+017F>wered he) that I will not tell you a lie, either in this, or any thing you <U+017F>hall ask, I will fir<U+017F>t die a hundred deaths. Know then, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould give you any a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that <U+017F>he loves me, <U+017F>ince her di<U+017F>cretion and mode<U+017F>ty keeps all clo<U+017F>e in her own <U+017F>oul: Then (<U+017F>aid I unto him) <U+017F>ince we are both in one condition, let us <U+017F>wear by our friend<U+017F>hip one unto another, and call all the divinities to puni<U+017F>h mo<U+017F>t rigorou<U+017F>ly the perjured, that he who can obtain mo<U+017F>t affection from her and give a te<U+017F>timony of it unto the other, he <U+017F>hall only enjoy her: By this means we <U+017F>hall not offend again<U+017F>t the Lawes of Friend<U+017F>hip it being mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>onable, that he whom <U+017F>he loves mo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould enjoy her, and the other quit her. I conceive your Propo<U+017F>ition to be very ju<U+017F>t, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Periander)</hi> and I <U+017F>wear by all the gods not to <U+017F>werve from it.</p>
               <p>I be<U+017F>eech you, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> con<U+017F>ider the Natures of mo<U+017F>t men. Before <hi>Periander</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his affection unto me I did love <hi>Dorinde;</hi> but much le<U+017F><U+017F>e then <U+017F>ince: And as a fire is augmented by the agitation of the winde; <U+017F>o my affection was much more violent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppo<U+017F>ed by the affection of <hi>Periander.</hi> This was the rea<U+017F>on, why I devoted my <U+017F>elfe unto her more then before. But having <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome daies in courting her without effect, and fearing that <hi>Periander</hi> being of that Town, and having many kindred of good rank, <U+017F>hould make a farther progre<U+017F><U+017F>e into her favour then my <U+017F>elfe. I re<U+017F>olved to u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ubtlety of the Fox, where the <U+017F>trength of a Lion would not prevail: I had recour<U+017F>e then unto Policie, thinking that in Love, <U+017F>ubtleties were lawfull and ju<U+017F>t. I cau<U+017F>ed a little Mirror to be made, no bigger then the plain of my hand, but as rich as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly Art could make it, both in the curio<U+017F>ity of the Gold work, and in the Enamell, which added much to the value and beauty; afterwards I put my own Picture, which was drawn to the life, between the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and the table of Gold which held it; <U+017F>o as when the Mirror was opened, nothing could be <U+017F>een but the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e and work about it. Afterwards I went to an old woman, who got her living, by carrying Jewells and other pieces of curio<U+017F>ity, unto private hou<U+017F>es to <U+017F>ell; and told her, that I de<U+017F>ired to turn this Mirror into Money, and therefore <U+017F>he would do me a great plea<U+017F>ure, if <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ell it for me. She promi<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he would do her be<U+017F>t. But I told her, that I had pre<U+017F>ent u<U+017F>e of money, and would let it go at any rea<U+017F>onable rate. She an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that things done in ha<U+017F>te were never well done; but <U+017F>till <U+017F>he would do her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So <U+017F>he went away with my Mirror, yet, <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner gone out of my lodging, but I <U+017F>ent for her back, and told her, that my occa<U+017F>ions were <U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, as if <U+017F>he could but get halfe the worth, or le<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould let it go; but advi<U+017F>ed her, before <U+017F>he went any whither el<U+017F>e, to carry it into the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Arcingentorix:</hi> I know, <U+017F>aid I unto her that he hath a Daughter whom he loves very well, perhaps he will be glad of <U+017F>uch a pre<U+017F>ent for her. Indeed, an<U+017F>wered the woman, I did intend to offer it unto him before any other,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53526:131"/>
becau<U+017F>e it was long <U+017F>ince I was at that hou<U+017F>e Go then, <U+017F>aid I unto her, and before you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it any whither el<U+017F>e, let me know what the Father or the Daughter will give for it. I will not trouble you with all the goings and commings of this woman: but <U+017F>o it was, that my plot took effect, and <hi>Dorinde</hi> bought it, as well for its curio<U+017F>ity of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip, as for the cheapne<U+017F><U+017F>e; not giving the third part of the worth for it. Things being thus ordered about five or <U+017F>ix daies after, I <U+017F>aw it hanging by her <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>he making very much of it. Then I thought it requi<U+017F>ite to accompli<U+017F>h my plot as <U+017F>oon as I could; for it was to be feared, that becau<U+017F>e the gla<U+017F><U+017F>e was <U+017F>o extreamly thin and fragil, it might break, and then my picture would be <U+017F>een; to prevent which danger, I went unto <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and asked him, Whether he had any thing advanced him<U+017F>elfe into <hi>Dorinde's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? To which he very ingenuou<U+017F>ly an<U+017F>wered, That he was not one jot more in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than the fir<U+017F>t day he <U+017F>aw her, that he knew not whether he <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e her Nature, or his deficiency in Merit, or his hard Fortune; yet, all his contentment was, that he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he treated him as well as any other. No, no, Brother, <U+017F>aid I unto him, do not accu<U+017F>e your own Merits, not the Nature of <hi>Dorinde;</hi> for your Merits are much above your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; nor is <U+017F>he in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of Love's Darts; but that affection which po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth her, is the cau<U+017F>e of all this coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, both towards you and all others: And to <U+017F>hew you your errour, though I know it will vex you at the fir<U+017F>t, yet I will tell you the truth<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Believe it, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (<U+017F>aid I and embraced him) that I am in <U+017F>uch po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her, as <U+017F>he cannot <U+017F>ee but with my eyes. The truth is, I did never in all my life meet with <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet a Lover as <U+017F>he is; for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o afraid her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould be known, as <U+017F>he will not in publick <U+017F>o much as look upon me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e forced unto it by the Lawes of civility; but, when we are in private, if you did but <U+017F>ee how pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately <U+017F>he does carra<U+017F><U+017F>e me, you would admire the <U+017F>trange command <U+017F>he hath over her <U+017F>elfe, in not making demon<U+017F>trations of it any where el<U+017F>e. And to the end you <U+017F>hould not think this to be a forged tale, I will give you <U+017F>uch certain knowledge, as <U+017F>hall undoubtedly a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of all I <U+017F>ay. But, I do conjure you, by all the <U+017F>acred Lawes of Friend<U+017F>hip, (<U+017F>ince what I <U+017F>hall tell you, is only to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you) that you do never di<U+017F>cover me, for it will nothing at all profit you, but may ruine me in her opinion. Then vowing he would not, I continued; Did you never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Mirror (<U+017F>aid I unto him) which of late daies <U+017F>he hath worn by her <U+017F>ide? And he an<U+017F>wering, Yes. Then know (<U+017F>aid I unto him) <U+017F>he weares it for my <U+017F>ake, and the love of me. Now, to put you out of all doubt, the fir<U+017F>t time you <U+017F>ee her, take out the gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and then take out a little paper which is between the gla<U+017F><U+017F>e and it, and you <U+017F>hall finde my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. There is no que<U+017F>tion, but <U+017F>he will be very <U+017F>orry that you <U+017F>aw it; but however, my friend<U+017F>hip obligeth me to di<U+017F>cover this <U+017F>ecret unto you, rather then let you run on in your errour. <hi>Periander</hi> hearing this, <U+017F>tood as if immovable, and <U+017F>tared, as if he had <U+017F>een the face of <hi>Medu<U+017F>a:</hi> But after he had con<U+017F>idered upon what I <U+017F>aid, he concluded, that if it was <U+017F>o, then he would quit her unto me, and ab<U+017F>olutely fall off. And to know the truth, <U+017F>aid he, though I do not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect your words, yet, I would go out of her <U+017F>ervice, by letting her know the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not accu<U+017F>e me of levitie. So he went immediately unto her lodging, where he found <hi>Dorinde</hi> by her <U+017F>elf, who <U+017F>tayed at home to entertain two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which intended a vi<U+017F>it unto her. She, who did really love <hi>Periander</hi> better then all tho<U+017F>e that courted her, did yet make very little <U+017F>hew of it; and as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he went to meet him, according to her accu<U+017F>tomed <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and civility. But he, who came with a bad opinion of her, and conceiving all her kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es to be but di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, he began to look upon her and all her actions with di<U+017F>dain. Almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as he, the<U+017F>e expected Ladies came al<U+017F>o, but went pre<U+017F>ently away again. <hi>Periander</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but wonder at her freene<U+017F><U+017F>e to him and all others: But having no minde to carry any longer in a place, where he thought him <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o unworthily treated and betrayed, he would <U+017F>ee, whether all that was <U+017F>aid was true; and therefore took the Mirror in his hand, <U+017F>eeming as if he much admired it; and as he offered to take out the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, it broke, at which he <U+017F>tarted, as if it had been done by chance, and <U+017F>eeing the gla<U+017F><U+017F>e broken: Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, I beg your pardon, I am obliged to make amends, and put in another Gla<U+017F>s. She an<U+017F>wered him, that it was a <U+017F>mall matter, and not worth the pains; upon this word, <U+017F>he held out her hand to take it again; but he, thinking that <U+017F>he would not let him have it, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee the Picture in it, he was the more backward in re<U+017F>toring it: and in this di<U+017F>pute, he took out the Gla<U+017F>s, then the paper, and then he found what I had <U+017F>aid was true. Although he did believe me before, yet when he <U+017F>aw my Picture, he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that he could not <U+017F>peak of a long time; and the amazement of <hi>Dorinde</hi> was no le<U+017F>s. <hi>Periander,</hi> who <U+017F>tood
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53526:132"/>
mute, looking <U+017F>ometimes upon the Picture, and <U+017F>ometimes upon <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and con<U+017F>idering her amazement al<U+017F>o, had an opinion, that <U+017F>he only <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o, to be thought ignorant of it; therefore he was extreamly tran<U+017F>ported with anger: Let me tell you, <U+017F>aid he unto her, that both in well loving, in <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y, and in di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, you are the mo<U+017F>t admirable, that ever I knew. <hi>Periander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I do prote<U+017F>t by all that's <U+017F>acred, that I am ignorant of it. Take heed, <U+017F>aid he, how you invoke things that are <U+017F>acred; but, <U+017F>ince you are not the fir<U+017F>t who<U+017F>e humour hath deceived me, I will leave the place to another, that I may have <U+017F>o much contentment, as not to be the la<U+017F>t whom you will deceive. Upon this, he went away in an extream fury. <hi>Dorinde</hi> did all <U+017F>he could to undeceive him, but that did more augment his opinion of her di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation. Thus he left her, and to ob<U+017F>erve the Lawes of friend<U+017F>hip, he re<U+017F>olved upon Travell, not knowing any better way to overcome Love then ab<U+017F>ence, which yet would not do, as I <U+017F>hall tell you afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now look upon me as arrived at the port of my de<U+017F>igne, having the place free unto my <U+017F>elfe. But Oh! generous <hi>Paris,</hi> when I went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Oh how <U+017F>he was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at me? She had <U+017F>ent for her who <U+017F>old her the Mirror, and forced her to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e of whom <U+017F>he had it; and finding it to be my <U+017F>elfe, I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Perfidious Impo<U+017F>tor (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) why would you <U+017F>o mortally offend one, that never gave you any. occa<U+017F>ion for it? How dur<U+017F>t you, after <U+017F>o great an injury, be <U+017F>o impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to come in my <U+017F>ight? I had before han I prepared my <U+017F>elfe for a chiding, yet could not endure it without a blu<U+017F>h; but knowing, that the only way to <U+017F>top an impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of fury, was, to let her ju<U+017F>t anger cool a little, before I gave any an<U+017F>wer; therefore I <U+017F>tayed mute untill <U+017F>he had vented all <U+017F>he had to <U+017F>ay, and then I an<U+017F>wered her thus: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all your reproaches are ju<U+017F>t; but alas, I cannot complain again<U+017F>t you for it, only again<U+017F>t Love, who having inflamed my <U+017F>oul towards you, did freez yours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Had Love been ju<U+017F>t, it would in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort have cooled my too ardent affection, and then I <U+017F>hould not have been forced to offend you, and needed not have u<U+017F>ed any tricks, to drive away my Rivall from you. But alas I <U+017F>ee that I am a very Novi<U+017F>t in Love, <U+017F>ince I look for any rea<U+017F>on in any thing it doth. But for all that, fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you do me wrong in complaining again<U+017F>t my actions, <U+017F>ince being but effects of Love, yet you <U+017F>hould expect them to be <U+017F>quared according to any rules of Rea<U+017F>on. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I have <U+017F>inned again<U+017F>t the rules of Rea<U+017F>on, but not again<U+017F>t Love; and I be<U+017F>eech you take me not as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, but as amorous, and mo<U+017F>t extreamly wounded with the darts of Love.</p>
               <p>I expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the extremity of my affection with <U+017F>o much dejected humility, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate language, as it had a good melting influence upon her <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>o as within a few daies after, <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>mile upon me, and pardon my offence; and <U+017F>ee how an ill chance is <U+017F>ometimes profitable, for that which was the cau<U+017F>e of her anger, was it which augmented her good will unto me: and con<U+017F>idering the artifice which I had u<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he had an opinion that I did mo<U+017F>t certainly love her. And this con<U+017F>ideration cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Thcombres</hi> to mi<U+017F><U+017F>e his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; for <U+017F>he devoted her <U+017F>elfe wholly unto me, <U+017F>o as it may <U+017F>eem, that I did love her only to make her hate him: And yet for all this, I loved <hi>Florice</hi> much more then I did <hi>Dorinde:</hi> Truth is, that when <hi>Dorinde's</hi> favours did flow more then u<U+017F>uall upon me, I did begin to love her more; for nothing doth kindle affection and augment it <U+017F>o much, as favours.</p>
               <p>Living then thus ambodexterou<U+017F>ly with <hi>Florice</hi> and <hi>Dorinde, Florice</hi> began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of me, and the common brute of this affection was blown all over: Therefore one day <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke unto me as if <U+017F>he were quite altered; and I, who did really love her, did vow and <U+017F>wear, that all my court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> was but an effect of her own command to cover thereby my affection unto her: That if <U+017F>he would, I would never look upon <hi>Dorinde</hi> again, and told her, that if <U+017F>he would but look her <U+017F>elfe in a gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and look upon <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that <U+017F>ight would give her better a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my <U+017F>ervice and affection, then all my words could. To be brief, with good language I brought her into a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of me; yet I was forced to promi<U+017F>e, that I would give her all the Letters which <hi>Dorinde</hi> writ unto me. Take heed, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould promi<U+017F>e and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for that would for ever lo<U+017F>e me, if I come to know it. I will never fail in any thing I promi<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid I unto her) and much le<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <hi>Florice,</hi> then unto the gods. Thus were we upon better termes then ever. And becau<U+017F>e none was <U+017F>o dear unto me as <hi>Florice,</hi> yet had I a corner in my heart for <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and was much delighted in her company; <U+017F>he conferred many favours upon me, and I courted her <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e with <U+017F>everall Letters, that <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me in Letters again, which I pre<U+017F>ently carried unto <hi>Florice,</hi> who read them, and kept them carefully.</p>

               <p>See now, <U+017F>aid he, the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of the<U+017F>e Loves; the frequent conver<U+017F>ation which I had with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> began to encrea<U+017F>e my love unto her the more. And in as much as the conferring of one favour drawes on another, that is greater, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he did every day give me cleerer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of her love, which was a cau<U+017F>e, that our Letters began to alter <U+017F>tyle, and became more affectionate and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate then u<U+017F>uall. This was a rea<U+017F>on, why I gave them unto <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> but <U+017F>eldome, and then only tho<U+017F>e which had fewe<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of affection, and crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept the re<U+017F>t to my <U+017F>elfe.</p>
               <p>Thus I lived for a while in a <U+017F>ea of delights, being welcome unto both; but it was too high to hold, and this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e did not la<U+017F>t long: For it hapned one day, that as I pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <U+017F>ome things out of my pocket, in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Florice</hi> and other company, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied two or three little Letters, lapped up after the very <U+017F>ame manner as <hi>Dorinde's</hi> were, which I had given unto her: She began pre<U+017F>ently to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the truth, and many daies pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing, and I not giving them unto her, <U+017F>he concluded her <U+017F>elfe to be deluded, and re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>teal them from me; and becau<U+017F>e I took no notice, <U+017F>he ea<U+017F>ily got them out of my pocket, whil<U+017F>t I was talking unto others, who did what they could to abu<U+017F>e me, and give her a better opportunity to play the thief, thinking <U+017F>he did it only to make me <U+017F>eek them. She took them out <U+017F>o dexterou<U+017F>ly, that I perceived not; <U+017F>he went away immediately, and was no <U+017F>ooner come unto her lodging, but locking her <U+017F>elfe up in her clo<U+017F>et, <U+017F>he threw them all upon the Table, and found five; <U+017F>ome very fre<U+017F>hly written, and others of a longer date. The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he took, which was la<U+017F>t writ, contained the<U+017F>e words.</p>

Then both of them began to inveigh again<U+017F>t me with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible bitterne<U+017F><U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Dorinde</hi> who thought her <U+017F>elfe the mo<U+017F>t offended. <hi>Florice</hi> having revenged her <U+017F>elfe upon me according to her de<U+017F>ires, returned unto her lodging, fully re<U+017F>olved never to love me again, no, nor ever to <U+017F>ee me again if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible: But, when the heat of her anger was a little cooled, and when <U+017F>he began to recall into her memory the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Dorinde</hi> and <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>he remembered, that what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <U+017F>oever I had unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> yet I had never acquainted her with the affection I had unto <hi>Florice,</hi> nor of any favour I ever received from her; concluding from hence, that I loved her more then I did <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he began to repent of what <U+017F>he had don; for <U+017F>he did believe, that if I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>On the contrary, <hi>Dorinde</hi> ju<U+017F>tly incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me, and <U+017F>welling with anger, after a flood of tears, flowing upon her cheeks and brea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he went into her Clo<U+017F>et, and vented all the bitterne<U+017F><U+017F>e and animo<U+017F>ity that her <U+017F>orrowes could in<U+017F>pire into her tongue: And as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, ju<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he was wiping the tears from her eyes, I came to her hou<U+017F>e, and when <U+017F>he heard me walking, <U+017F>he ran and pulled to the dore, which <U+017F>he had left open when <hi>Florice</hi> went out, and which, her minde being upon other things, <U+017F>he had forgot to <U+017F>hut; yet, <U+017F>he could not do it <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, but I <U+017F>aw how red her eyes were with crying; and when I wondred, both at her tears, and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould deny me entrance, <U+017F>he opened her Clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>tanding in the dore: Perfidious Traitor (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and called me by my name) are you come with any de<U+017F>ignes of injury unto me?</p>
               <p>And becau<U+017F>e I an<U+017F>wered nothing, being <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed that I could not <U+017F>peak: Perhaps, ungratefull wretch, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you will deny your villany? Ah mo<U+017F>t wicked per<U+017F>on!

Oh! yar, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me did you not carry her the la<U+017F>t which I writ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o?

Then I named two, who had <U+017F>een her <U+017F>teal them, and told me of it; and therefore, when <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>ound her <U+017F>elfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed by her own invention, <U+017F>he acquainted you with all that could break off your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from me.

I pre<U+017F>ently ob<U+017F>erved this redintegration, and told <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, when <U+017F>he heard how <hi>Theombres</hi> was embarqued. <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>eeing I did not return unto her according to her expectance, did the more multiply her favours upon him, in<U+017F>omuch as many did di<U+017F>like her behaviour, and acquainted her Parents with it; for, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o free and open in the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of her favours, as in lieu of hiding them, as is u<U+017F>uall, <U+017F>he expo<U+017F>ed them to the view of every one, nay, <U+017F>tudied how to make them <U+017F>een, otherwi<U+017F>e I had not come to the knowledge of it for I never <U+017F>aw her but in publick, and when I was with her in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place, I <U+017F>hunned her. Now her Father, as I have told you, being adverti<U+017F>ed of this Love, did exceedingly reprehend her, and much more her Mother, who for honour and cha<U+017F>tity was an eminent example to all the Country. At the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> would have glo<U+017F><U+017F>ed the matter with an excu<U+017F>e; but afterwards, <U+017F>eeing excu<U+017F>es would not do it, <U+017F>he did confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, and <U+017F>aid, that it was true, <hi>Theombres</hi> did court her, and that <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but love him. But her Mother, who could not upon any termes approve of her behaviour, did tell her in a very angry manner, That <hi>Theombres</hi> did not give <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies of his love to her, as <U+017F>he of her love to him. To which <hi>Florice,</hi> in much di<U+017F>order an<U+017F>wered, That <hi>Theombres</hi> did court her in the way of honour; and <U+017F>ince his End was only at Marriage, <U+017F>he could do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then allow of him. If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid her Father, let him acquaint us with his intentions, otherwi<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hall think, you only invented this, thereby to excu<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe. She, who had a very reverentiall re<U+017F>pect and fear of her Father and Mother, and who be<U+017F>ides, had ever lived in great reputation, did think it expedient, that <hi>Theom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> <U+017F>hould make <U+017F>ome overtures of Marriage unto her Parents, yet not intending to go any further, then a meer motion; for <U+017F>he hoped, that it might be ea<U+017F>ily broken off: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke unto <hi>Theombres</hi> concerning it, who was joyed at it beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and not to lo<U+017F>e a minute of time, he entreated two of his Uncles to make the motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53526:134"/>
                  <hi>Florice's</hi> Father and Mother; which accordingly they did, with <U+017F>o many fair offers, as they were received as well as they could de<U+017F>ire; for he was very rich, and an advantageous Match unto <hi>Florice,</hi> which being known and con<U+017F>idered by her Parents, they would not prolong time, but did conclude the Marriage that <U+017F>ame day, and the more willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they believed it agreeable unto the liking of their Daughter. Thus is <hi>Florice's</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Theombres</hi> made up, all things agreed upon, Writings <U+017F>ealed, and nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but a Prie<U+017F>t to Marry them. But Oh! what a wonder was all this unto <hi>Florice,</hi> when <U+017F>he heard of it? Her Father thinking <U+017F>he would be very glad of it, would him<U+017F>elfe be the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of the newes: But, when he told her how all things went, though <U+017F>he would have faigned, yet <U+017F>he could not, but broke out into a deluge of tears, at which her Father was much amazed: How, Daughter, <U+017F>aid he unto her, this is very <U+017F>trange; does <hi>Florice</hi> cry at what <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe de<U+017F>ired? I told you, Father (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi> all in tears) that <hi>Theombres</hi> courted me in way of Marriage, but I never told you, that I did de<U+017F>ire it. Were not you the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid the Father, which moved <hi>Theombres</hi> to make the motion? It was upon your command, replied <U+017F>he, and not upon my own de<U+017F>ire; and I did believe, you would have given me <U+017F>ome time to con<U+017F>ider upon it. Come, come, (<U+017F>aid he in an angry manner) you knew well enough how <U+017F>uch bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es u<U+017F>e to be carried. Re<U+017F>olve with your <U+017F>elfe, that <U+017F>ince they have gone thus far, they <U+017F>hall go on. What! would you be further courted, and give all the world an occa<U+017F>ion to talk of you? Would you have further time, to make me more a<U+017F>hamed? No, no, <hi>Florice,</hi> content your <U+017F>elfe, I have blu<U+017F>h'd enough for you already, when your friends acquainted me with your behaviour, and I will prevent it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if I can. Upon this, he left her alone, and went to his Wife, who hearing what di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, came to her with all the <U+017F>harp language which <U+017F>he could invent, and for a conclu<U+017F>ion told her, that nothing but death could hinder that Marriage from taking effect, and therefore <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve upon it. Thus, poor <hi>Florice</hi> was in a wor<U+017F>e condition than ever; for, <U+017F>he had not only lo<U+017F>t me whom <U+017F>he loved, but was likely to be enjoyed by another, whom <U+017F>he loved not, but hated wor<U+017F>e then a death. Imagine in what a wilderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of thoughts <U+017F>he was and what various combats was in her <U+017F>oul: In conclu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved, that death <U+017F>hould be the remedy again<U+017F>t all her re<U+017F>tle<U+017F><U+017F>e afflictions; not that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much courage as to kill her <U+017F>elfe, (for the thought of <U+017F>uch a cruelty made her to tremble) but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought her life was not able to endure <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ad and tormenting mi<U+017F>eries. But <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>trange con<U+017F>equents of Love; <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>o much grieve for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of me, and at her being anothers whom <U+017F>he loved not, as to think, that I <U+017F>hould put a bad con<U+017F>truction upon that affection which <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto me: For, though <U+017F>he was angry at me, becau<U+017F>e of <hi>Dorinde;</hi> yet, <U+017F>he did love me, and excu<U+017F>ed me for loving her no more, accu<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe with the offence which <U+017F>he had committed again<U+017F>t me. Being thus perplexed, and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could not avoid her Marriage with <hi>Theombres,</hi> <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to give her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfaction at the lea<U+017F>t, as to let me know, that her minde was not changed, and that her affection <U+017F>hould for ever be the <U+017F>ame as I had found it: Her Letter was thus written.</p>

                        <hi>WHen you look upon this hand, perhaps you will remember, that you have <U+017F>een it heretofore, when you loved her that writ it, and that now <U+017F>o much offended you.

               <p>When this Letter was brought unto me, I was <U+017F>orry at tho<U+017F>e frequent reports of this Marriage; and though I was re<U+017F>olved to be wholly <hi>Dorinde's,</hi> yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but re<U+017F>ent the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Florice;</hi> for I e<U+017F>teemed her lo<U+017F>t, in the alliance of <hi>Theombres.</hi> And <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ubtlety of Love: He knew well enough, that to a<U+017F><U+017F>ault me openly was in vain, becau<U+017F>e I was <U+017F>till in mine anger, and therefore he would go another way with me. Fir<U+017F>t, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto me my hatred of <hi>Theombres,</hi> how unde<U+017F>erving he was of this advantage,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53526:134"/>
and how happy he would be in <hi>Florice.</hi> Then he repre<U+017F>ented unto me, the beauty and merits of <hi>Florice,</hi> what pitty it was that <U+017F>uch a man <U+017F>hould enjoy her; and brought into my memory all tho<U+017F>e favours which I had received from her: To be briefe, he did <U+017F>o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations in my <U+017F>oul, that ere I was aware, I was more in love with her, then with <hi>Dorinde;</hi> <U+017F>o as when her Letter came unto my hands, and con<U+017F>idering with a <U+017F>ound judgment, the beauty, the quality, and the merits of the Writer, I did acknowledge that I had done her wrong, in quitting her for another much inferiour; and repenting of it, I intended to return to her again. Truth is, when I con<U+017F>idered the remedy which <U+017F>he propounded, to break off her Marriage with <hi>Theombres,</hi> I knew not what to re<U+017F>olve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I hated that fatall Tie of Marriage more then I can expre<U+017F><U+017F>e; not with <hi>Florice</hi> in particular, but with any woman in generall; conceiving that there was no greater tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor <U+017F>lavery among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ons of men, then that of Marriage. Thus was I in a Labyrinth of ravelled re<U+017F>olutions; for on the one <U+017F>ide, <hi>Dorinde</hi> was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto me; on the other <U+017F>ide, I could not endure, that <hi>Theombres</hi> <U+017F>hould enjoy <hi>Florice,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially in the way of Marriage: But, after a long conte<U+017F>t with my <U+017F>elfe, I re<U+017F>olved to renew that love which was betwixt us, and to do all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could to prevent <hi>Theombres.</hi> And in order to this re<U+017F>olution, I <U+017F>eemed, as if I had not received the Letter which <U+017F>he had writ unto me, which I might ea<U+017F>ily do, becau<U+017F>e he who brought it, left it for me at my lodging, I not being then within: So taking pen, inke, and paper, I writ thus unto <hi>Florice.</hi>

When <U+017F>he received my Letter, <U+017F>he was extreamly joyed, to finde that I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, and was <U+017F>orry, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw I had not received hers, therefore <U+017F>he writ unto me again, to let me know, that <U+017F>he had adverti<U+017F>ed me of a cour<U+017F>e which I <U+017F>hould take, to free her from that mi<U+017F>ery which was prepared for her.

the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>eal, both <U+017F>he &amp; I having long <U+017F>ince each of us a Seal as like one another as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could be made. Shee took the Letter with a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>igh, and afterwards enquired, why I went away, and what urgent occa<U+017F>ion had con<U+017F>trained me to be gone <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon? He an<U+017F>wered her according to my in<U+017F>tructions, That he knew nothing; only, he never <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad in all his life as I was at my departure. Ah me! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he then, with a mo<U+017F>t profound <U+017F>igh) I am afraid he will return too late for my contentment. Then, to hide the tears which trickled from her eyes, <U+017F>he turned the other way.

                        <hi>Could I <U+017F>end you my life in this paper, as well as the truth of my intention, I <U+017F>hould not complain at heavens inju<U+017F>tice in de<U+017F>tinating me to fail, both in my love and in my duty. Tomorrow is the la<U+017F>t day of my life, if I may call that a death which takes away all my contentment. If</hi> Hylas <hi>do love me, mi<U+017F>erable as I am, and will accompany my <U+017F>orrowes with his, let him re<U+017F>ort to my grave.</hi>

               <p>Judge, whether this Letter did not touch me to the quick, <U+017F>ince I did really love her: but, <U+017F>eeing no remedy but to marry her, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, my affection was not of force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to bring my will unto it.</p>
               <p>The next morning <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>igne the Contract, and to agree unto all that her Father and Mother would have her; but, with <U+017F>uch incredible griefe and trembling, that her legs were not able to bear her, nor her hand to guide the pen, wherewith <U+017F>he <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed her name. Oh ye gods! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto one of her Companions what a mo<U+017F>t cruell Law is this, that ordaines the innocent to <U+017F>igne their own death? But when <U+017F>he went to the Temple, and through the <U+017F>treet where my lodging was lifting up her eyes to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto her <U+017F>elfe: Why, Oh happy lodgings, are not the gods as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto me as you? And, as fortune was, I being at the window, which I held halfe open, to <U+017F>ee her pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied me: But, Oh ye gods, how this vi<U+017F>ion went to her heart? <U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>woond, and lay in the armes of tho<U+017F>e that went with her: And le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould do the like, I was con<U+017F>trained to lie down upon my bed, and <U+017F>tirred not from it mo<U+017F>t part of that day At the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he was married with <U+017F>o many tears, as every one pittyed her. And becau<U+017F>e I feared, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he having <U+017F>een me, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould think; I did but only give out that I was gone away, I procured an intimate friend that <U+017F>ame night to let her under<U+017F>tand, that I was departed, only becau<U+017F>e I would not <U+017F>ee this unhappy Marriage, and that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, never to return again; but, <U+017F>ince my affection would not give me leave to be <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant, I was con<U+017F>trained to return, but arrived in the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate minute that could be; and that it was ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould live, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he gave me <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that her affection was not changed. She, as if <U+017F>he never heard him, took a Ring off from her finger, and put it into his hand: This Diamond, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that it hath le<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>tancy, then the affection which I promi<U+017F>ed unto him.</p>
               <p>Now hear, I be<U+017F>eech you, what hapned: That very <U+017F>ame night, and, I believe, about the very <U+017F>ame houre, when <hi>Theombres</hi> had her in his armes, I was in my bed, and held my hand upon my brea<U+017F>t, having the Ring upon my finger. I know not how, but it cut me, and made <U+017F>o deep a wound, that my <U+017F>hirt and <U+017F>heets were all bloody, and ever <U+017F>ince, hath left a mark upon my <U+017F>ide, neer my heart. Oh heavens! (cryed I out upon a <U+017F>uddain, thinking upon the wrong which I had done <hi>Florice,</hi> and <hi>Theombres</hi> had done me) how <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible am I of the offence and injury that is done unto my affection. Perhaps I have in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted too long upon the<U+017F>e particulars; but I be<U+017F>eech you excu<U+017F>e <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>ince he was never <U+017F>o touched to the heart by any other, except by you, my faire<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis.</hi> Or except any in this Company, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he. But, pray tell us how you left <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Unto which <hi>Hylas</hi> replyed thus: When I was in the depth of my perplexities (for indeed I did love <hi>Florice,</hi> as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was fair, as becau<U+017F>e I thought <hi>Dorinde</hi> loved another) the heavens helped me out with as good an occa<U+017F>ion as I could de<U+017F>ire. <hi>Periander,</hi> who, as I told you, was con<U+017F>trained to quit <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto me, and, not being able to <U+017F>ee me enjoy her, was gone out of the Town,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53526:135"/>
was at length forced to return, as not being able to endure <U+017F>o long out of her <U+017F>ight; and though he did fore<U+017F>ee, his <U+017F>orrowes would be greater in <U+017F>eeing, then in hearing, of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yet could he not chu<U+017F>e but return, thinking it would be <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>olation unto his wound, to <U+017F>ee the hand that gave it. And becau<U+017F>e he came at the fir<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ee me, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he came, I re<U+017F>olved to give, as they <U+017F>ay, two blowes with one <U+017F>tone, to rid my <U+017F>elfe of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> and to oblige <hi>Periander.</hi> Two or three daies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, and he never talked one word unto me concerning <hi>Dorinde;</hi> and one time, being <U+017F>eparated from the Company, I <U+017F>aid thus unto him: <hi>Periander,</hi> it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for my affection unto you, to <U+017F>uffer my <U+017F>elfe to be a cau<U+017F>e of that melancholly which I have ob<U+017F>erved in your face, any longer; I love you too well, than to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>uffer for my <U+017F>ake: You do not doubt of my affection unto <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> but you <U+017F>hall le<U+017F><U+017F>e doubt of the affection I have unto you; And to give you evident te<U+017F>timony that it is not a little, I relea<U+017F>e this <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto you, whom my good fortune took from you; and the affection I bear unto you, <U+017F>hall <U+017F>urmount the love I bear unto her: Receive her, therefore, <hi>Periander,</hi> from me, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that I <U+017F>hall le<U+017F><U+017F>e grieve to part with her, then to <U+017F>ee you thus <U+017F>ad for my <U+017F>ake, or be deprived of your pre<U+017F>ence. If ever any condemned per<U+017F>on was joyed when a Pardon came, <hi>Periander</hi> was as much, when he heard this; and yet his di<U+017F>cretion and affection unto me, made him at the fir<U+017F>t refu<U+017F>e it; but when he <U+017F>aw I per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in this minde, he received it with <U+017F>o many thanks, as I was con<U+017F>trained to tell him, that <U+017F>he was ju<U+017F>tly his due, knowing very well, that he did <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount me in love, as my good fortune and cunning <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ed his</p>
               <p>Then I retired by little and little from <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> on the contrary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. But, in the mean time, I attempted upon <hi>Florice,</hi> I found out the means to <U+017F>peak unto her, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her of my affection. To be briefe, I contrived it <U+017F>o, as there was never better corre<U+017F>pondency betwixt us; and that which mo<U+017F>t helped me, was, the hollow-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted affection which <U+017F>he bore unto <hi>Theombres:</hi> 'Tis true, <U+017F>he had alwaies <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and therefore after <U+017F>he thought that <U+017F>he had made me hers, <U+017F>he told me peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, that <U+017F>he would have me <U+017F>o clearly and openly break off with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never be in any doubt of it afterwards; otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould live in a continuall incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my affection, and that <U+017F>he had rather part fair with me, then live in <U+017F>uch continuall apprehen<U+017F>ions. I de<U+017F>ired, that my breach with <hi>Dorinde</hi> might be done by <U+017F>ome civill way, and lea<U+017F>t offen<U+017F>ive unto her. But <U+017F>he would needs have it done by <U+017F>ome rude and publick affront, and <U+017F>he would not be per<U+017F>waded otherwi<U+017F>e At the la<U+017F>t, I re<U+017F>olved upon it.</p>
               <p>Upon the <U+017F>ixt of <hi>July,</hi> all the Gallantry of the Town went with the Druides to gather the <U+017F>acred <hi>Mi<U+017F>letoe,</hi> in the Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>Erieu;</hi> and then <hi>Florice</hi> charged me to <U+017F>atisfie her reque<U+017F>t. All the Ladies were trimmed in their gaye<U+017F>t dre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and every one in the Athenian habit. The <U+017F>acrifice being ended, and publick rejoycings beginning, I took <hi>Periander</hi> apart, to the end he <U+017F>hould not be offended at what I did; I told him how I <U+017F>aw <hi>Dorinde</hi> had <U+017F>ome hopes yet in me, and therefore <U+017F>he did not receive his <U+017F>ervice; <U+017F>o well as <U+017F>he ought; but I would undeceive her, and da<U+017F>h all her hopes. Then <U+017F>eeing her with <hi>Florice,</hi> and in the mid<U+017F>t of the be<U+017F>t company, I went to her, and after <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>aid unto her <U+017F>o loud, as all about her might hear Now I <U+017F>ee <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that what is told me of you, is true. What's that, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, little expecting <U+017F>uch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer as I gave)? That you have (replyed I) the be<U+017F>t opinion of your <U+017F>elfe, of any per<U+017F>on in the world. Then <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>h'd, and asked me the rea<U+017F>on of my judgment. Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I, you mea<U+017F>uring others by your <U+017F>elfe; as you do love all you look upon, <U+017F>o you think every one is in love with you; and I know you are in that errour concerning me thinking that I am ready to die for the love of you: but, I would have you know, that your merits are too mean to make me <U+017F>uch a fool; if you think otherwi<U+017F>e, undeceive your <U+017F>elfe, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that <hi>Hylas</hi> is a<U+017F>hamed he ever loved you; or if he was <U+017F>uch a fool, that he is wi<U+017F>er now. Imagine, noble <hi>Paris,</hi> how blank <hi>Dorinde</hi> was: For my part, I would not exchange a <U+017F>yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable more with her, but went away, and left her mo<U+017F>t pittifully out of countenance. Ever <U+017F>ince, <hi>Florice</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied that is imaginable, and wholly devoted her <U+017F>elfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me And as <hi>Theombres</hi> <U+017F>tood for a Husband, <U+017F>o I enjoyed her as a Friend. But <hi>Dorinde,</hi> extreamly incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me, re<U+017F>olved to do me all the mi<U+017F>chiefe that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, and di<U+017F>covering the intimate familiarity betwixt <hi>Florice</hi> and me, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>igned to thwart it: And becau<U+017F>e I did not <U+017F>ee her, though I was <U+017F>orry for it, for I did love her, though le<U+017F><U+017F>ethen I did <hi>Florice,</hi> <U+017F>he thought <hi>Periander</hi> would be a fit in<U+017F>trument to work her ends by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>hew him more countenance then accu<U+017F>tomed, and, by degrees, <U+017F>eemed to love him better; at which <hi>Periander</hi> was <U+017F>o joyed, that he almo<U+017F>t never <U+017F>tirred from her:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53526:136"/>
Having lived a while thus with him, <U+017F>he acquainted him with the deceit I had u<U+017F>ed, in putting my Picture in the Mirror, and that he <U+017F>hould not doubt it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for the woman who brought it to <U+017F>ell. To be brief, <U+017F>he told him <U+017F>o much in my di<U+017F>advantage, as <U+017F>he cooled his affection unto me; and all this out of a de<U+017F>igne, to get by his means, <U+017F>ome of <hi>Florice's</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from me; &amp; therfore continuing her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: He is (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) wholly devoted unto <hi>Florice,</hi> but it is only, untill <U+017F>ome other pa<U+017F><U+017F>e before his eyes; for he is the verye<U+017F>t knave, and arrante<U+017F>t weathercock that ever was. But (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, and held his hand in hers) will you do me one very great plea<U+017F>ure? And he an<U+017F>wering, that he would do any thing to <U+017F>erve her. She made him <U+017F>wear, he would be as good as his word. Then went <U+017F>he on: You know, that <hi>Florice</hi> and I are friends and allies, I cannot believe that <U+017F>he does love him: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you tel me all you know. Undeceive your <U+017F>elf in that, <U+017F>aid he unto her, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>he does love him, and there is hardly a day, but he hath a Letter from her. Oh my god, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, can you not help me to the <U+017F>ight of one of her Letters? Very ea<U+017F>ily, an<U+017F>wered he, for he is very carele<U+017F><U+017F>e of them. In this, <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>aid right; for the truth is, I know not what I did with all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he writ unto me, nor was I angry with my <U+017F>elfe for my carele<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> now I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, whether or no you be a man of your word, and whether you love me; for if you do, and this be <U+017F>o, you will pre<U+017F>ently bring me one of them. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi> without any regard unto our friend<U+017F>hip, whether it was by vertue of <hi>Dorinde's</hi> command or out of revenge upon me, for putting that trick upon him, but he came that very night to lie with me, as he often u<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>tole away one which I received in his pre<U+017F>ence, and the next morning, as <U+017F>oon as he could get into <hi>Dorinde's</hi> Chamber, he brought it unto her: It contained the<U+017F>e words.</p>

               <p>You know, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> that upon <U+017F>uch Letters, they never any u<U+017F>e to write Super<U+017F>criptions, le<U+017F>t the Writer <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered by the Direction; and therefore <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> after a thou<U+017F>and thanks to <hi>Periander,</hi> went into her Clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cribed it, <hi>Unto Theombres,</hi> afterwards <U+017F>ealed it up very hand<U+017F>omely with a Seal, and giving it unto a creature of her own, in<U+017F>tructed him what he <U+017F>hould do, and commanded him to carry it unto <hi>Theombres</hi> in all ha<U+017F>te, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood, that he was to go out of Town the <U+017F>ame day: The fellow did as he was directed, and <U+017F>o nimbly, that whil<U+017F>t <hi>Theombres</hi> was reading the Letter, he <U+017F>lipt away, and came to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and told her what he had done. I refer it unto your imagination, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, whether the Husband was not amazed, when he <U+017F>aw his Wife's Letter, and much more, when he read it: It wrought this influence upon him, that whereas before he <U+017F>hould have gone out of the Town <U+017F>ingle, now he mu<U+017F>t go double, and carry his wife with him; but not before he had <U+017F>hewed the Letter unto her, and had <U+017F>hreudly reprehended her for it. She excu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe as well as <U+017F>he could, telling him, it was long <U+017F>ince this Letter was writ, and that it was <hi>Dorinde</hi> who had now written the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription of it. To which <hi>Theombres</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever <U+017F>he writ it <U+017F>he was to blame, and could not be excu<U+017F>ed. She replyed, that <hi>Dorinde</hi> and <U+017F>he being intimate friends, did often u<U+017F>e to write <U+017F>uch unto each other, and invite them<U+017F>elves thereby to come and vi<U+017F>it one another; and that <hi>Dorinde</hi> being angry with her, and knowing that he was to go out of Town, had, in revenge upon her, <U+017F>ent him this Letter, which truly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you may well believe to be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription is written with <hi>Dorinde's</hi> own hand; and that if <U+017F>he would, <U+017F>he could <U+017F>hew <U+017F>everall others of the like nature, as I might of hers had I been as carefull in keeping them as <U+017F>he is. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombres</hi> was <U+017F>omething <U+017F>atisfied with this excu<U+017F>e, yet not <U+017F>o, but he con<U+017F>trained her to go with him out of Town, and would not let her have more lea<U+017F>ure, then to write one word unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> and left it in the hands of her Maid, in whom <U+017F>he had good a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of her fidelity. For my part, I thought <U+017F>he had <U+017F>tayed at home, and that <hi>Theombres</hi> had gone by him<U+017F>elfe therefore I went at night to the u<U+017F>uall place of meeting. But this Maid opening the dore, <U+017F>he gave me <hi>Florice's</hi> Letter, and <U+017F>hut the dore again immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t me. and would not <U+017F>peak one <U+017F>yllable unto me: This made me fear <U+017F>ome dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous accident had hapned, and therefore returned to my lodging, where as <U+017F>oon as ever I got a

               <p>Oh heavens! how this Letter went to my heart, I was in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange confu<U+017F>ion of thoughts that I could not imagine why <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>hould write thus, I <U+017F>pent all that night in walking up and down my Chamber, and as <U+017F>oon as it was day, I <U+017F>ent a <U+017F>ervant to finde out a way, how I might <U+017F>peak with her who gave me the Letter; but it could not be, all that day: When night came, I under<U+017F>tood all from her, how <hi>Florice</hi> had an opinion, that I had given this Letter unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> which made her believe, that I did only di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, when I <U+017F>eemed to ca<U+017F>t off <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and did it only to delude her. I put my hand pre<U+017F>ently into my pocket, and not finding my Letter, I did <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that <hi>Periander</hi> had <U+017F>tollen it from me: After a thou<U+017F>and prote<U+017F>tations of my innocency unto this Maid, I went away with re<U+017F>olutions of revenge: But when I met my friend, and with a frowning brow taxed him with his theft, he an<U+017F>wered me, with a <U+017F>mile; If I have di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed you, <U+017F>aid he, I am <U+017F>orry; but you may well forget it, if you do but con<U+017F>ider, that now we are upon eeven termes, for your <U+017F>tealing of <hi>Dorinde</hi> from me by your artifice of the Mirror. But friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I have re<U+017F>tored your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, and you have cau<U+017F>ed me to lo<U+017F>e mine. I know not an<U+017F>wered he, how to give you <U+017F>atisfaction in that, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e by re<U+017F>toring her unto you, in acquainting her with my theft. Truth is, I did love <hi>Periander,</hi> and perhaps as much as I did any of the<U+017F>e Ladies; therefore I received his excu<U+017F>e, conceiving it to be the only means to reingratiate my <U+017F>elfe into <hi>Florice's</hi> favour: And therefore turning all into rallarie, we waited for <hi>Florice's</hi> return. But, <hi>Theombres</hi> being but halfe <U+017F>atisfied with his Wife's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>es, he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay a while in the Country, the better to di<U+017F>cover who made any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her, and to finde out her humour; and he <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>o long, that I was in the interim pa<U+017F>t my patience; therefore I went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cri<U+017F>ide,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing her, loved her; and the truth is, <U+017F>he did de<U+017F>erve it, for I never in all my life, <U+017F>aw a more lovely and attractive <U+017F>tranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had taken much delight in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas,</hi> had it been at any other <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on but being extreamly de<U+017F>irous to be at the place where <hi>Silvande:</hi> found <hi>Celadon's</hi> Letter, <U+017F>he was impatient at any thing which gave a <U+017F>top unto it: And this was the rea<U+017F>on, why upon the fir<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion which pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he made a <U+017F>igne unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> that it was time to be gone, and that <U+017F>he was weary of <U+017F>o long a <U+017F>tay. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that <hi>Phillis</hi> did not under<U+017F>tand her meaning, and likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>aw <hi>Hylas</hi> offering to continue his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Cri<U+017F>ide,</hi> <U+017F>he prevented him with the<U+017F>e words: I did not think, that the beauty of <hi>Phillis</hi> could have had <U+017F>o much power over <U+017F>o free a <U+017F>pirit, as to hold him in one di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e above an houre; but, <U+017F>ince her rigour does not con<U+017F>ider his con<U+017F>traint, let us <U+017F>hew our <U+017F>elves more kinde and di<U+017F>creet, in interrupting him; for, the heat of the day being over, walking will be more delightfull then talking. Upon this, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up, and the re<U+017F>t of the Company followed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas</hi> taking <hi>Phillis</hi> under the arme: I am very glad, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) that <U+017F>he, who is the mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, does re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome of that pain which you put upon me, and does <U+017F>ee the love I have unto you. He meant this by <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom he thought to be a per<U+017F>on that never had loved any: And <U+017F>ee how commonly our judgments are deceived by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and <U+017F>hewes; for, <hi>Phillis</hi> de<U+017F>iring to leave him in that opinion. Tho<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, who do love well, do never u<U+017F>e to give te<U+017F>timony of their affection by the report of per<U+017F>ons, who do not know how to love, but by their own ob<U+017F>equious <U+017F>ervices. And as for that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which you have been put to, in <U+017F>peaking <U+017F>o long, I believe you are as <U+017F>ufficiently payed for it, by my hearing you <U+017F>o long. This, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is the intolerable arrogance and ingratitude of all the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es in this Country. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the re<U+017F>t of her Companions, he lead her by the arme, and continued thus: Becau<U+017F>e you will not be obliged unto me, you will not only deny me the merit of my patience but you think I am beholding unto you for hearing me: By what Law, I be<U+017F>eech you, is this? The <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that a Lord doth impo<U+017F>e upon his Slave. Nay, rather, <U+017F>aid he, a Tyrant
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53526:137"/>
upon his People. Why, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you take me for a Tyrant? Surely there is this difference betwixt us that I do not u<U+017F>e any force or violence again<U+017F>t you. Can you <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and not blu<U+017F>h? Do you think it is not by force, that <hi>Hylas</hi> hath continued <U+017F>o long under your power? I pray, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, where are my Fetters, my Manacles, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ions, and my Pri<U+017F>ons? Ah! mo<U+017F>t ignorant, and too much di<U+017F><U+017F>embling <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> your Chains are <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely indi<U+017F><U+017F>olvable, that I would not be delivered from them, for all the freedome and liberty in the world. Judge, if your Manacles be not very <U+017F>trong, <U+017F>ince <hi>Hylas</hi> cannot break them; <hi>Hylas,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, whom a thou<U+017F>and Beauties could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold, nor keep him from breaking loo<U+017F>e from them all. In the mean time, <hi>Paris</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken <hi>Diana</hi> by her hand, <hi>Silvander,</hi> out of his di<U+017F>cretion kept a di<U+017F>tance; for he would force his affection, and in his re<U+017F>pect unto his Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, give place unto <hi>Paris,</hi> as all the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were very ready to pay all due re<U+017F>pects unto him, who for their <U+017F>akes; had quitted the grandure and eminency of his quality. As fortune was <hi>Mandonte</hi> was alone, and becau<U+017F>e <hi>I her<U+017F>ander</hi> was taken up with <hi>Laonice, Silvander</hi> took her hand, and re<U+017F>olved to wait upon her during all the voyage; and though he made this addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto her at the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e he knew not where to finde a better; yet afterwards, he was well plea<U+017F>ed with his choice, for this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e was both fair and di<U+017F>creet, and had <U+017F>ome features in her face and actions, which did much re<U+017F>emble <hi>Diana;</hi> not that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o fair as <U+017F>he, nor <U+017F>o like being together; but if a<U+017F><U+017F>under, they had much one of the other, in their re<U+017F>emblance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>ince he could not be with <hi>Diana,</hi> was very glad his lot fell upon one that had any thing like her; but much more, when by di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with her, he found a neerer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance in her Tone; and therefore, ever <U+017F>ince this day, he was much plea<U+017F>ed with her company; yet a little after, he payed very dear for his delight. <hi>Tireis</hi> waited upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Paris</hi> upon <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>o as <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>eeing his place was taken up by <hi>Silvander,</hi> he was forced to fall upon <hi>Laonice.</hi> She, who kept her eyes continually upon <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> did ob<U+017F>erve how that <U+017F>hepheard was much plea<U+017F>ed with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donte,</hi> and that <U+017F>he might know more, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> to go neerer them, which his jealous apprehen<U+017F>ions prompted him very ea<U+017F>ily to do; yet, they could not hear any thing, but common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. They had not walked above a quarter of an houre in a long Meadow, but <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>hewed them the Wood, unto which he would conduct them. Pre<U+017F>ently after, they entred into a thick Cops; and becau<U+017F>e the Path was very narrow they were con<U+017F>trained to go in file. At la<U+017F>t, <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, as their conductor, walked fir<U+017F>t, he much wondred, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome boughes of trees heaped one upon another, in the fa<U+017F>hion of an Arbour, which ob<U+017F>tructed his pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. All the Company going through this Arbour, came up to him, to know why he <U+017F>tayed, and <U+017F>eeing no path: How now <hi>Silvander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> do you that undertook to be our Guide, conduct us thus? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, that I have lo<U+017F>t the way which I went the la<U+017F>t morning; but, I believe this to be a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and better. The way, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is very good, if you had conducted us to Hunt, for I <U+017F>ee nothing but Wood. <hi>Silvander</hi> was vexed that he lo<U+017F>t his way, but he was more amazed then before, when he<U+017F>aw another more <U+017F>pacious Arbour in the form of a Temple: at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there was <U+017F>ome Ver<U+017F>es written, which <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>tayed to read. All the Company being weary they called upon him <U+017F>everall times. He, in a great amazement, turned towards <hi>Diana:</hi> Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, do not repent your <U+017F>elfe of the pains you have taken, in comming hither; for, though you are a little digre<U+017F><U+017F>ed of the way, yet, you <U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee here a wonder of the Wood: Then taking her hand, he conducted her to the entry: the re<U+017F>t of the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es followed in <U+017F>ile, and longed to <U+017F>ee this rarity of which <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>poke. Before the entrance was a Court of green gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, about thirty paces <U+017F>quare, environed with thick wood on three <U+017F>ides, <U+017F>o as none could <U+017F>ee them. A chry<U+017F>tall Fountain, which took its originall oppo<U+017F>ite to the Porch, or rather, Arbour, of this Temple, did, Meander like, run by the one <U+017F>ide, which rendred the place mo<U+017F>t delectable. This Grove was ever a place, that had been dedicated as <U+017F>acred unto the great <hi>He<U+017F>eus, Tentates,</hi> and <hi>Taramis:</hi> And there was no <U+017F>hepheard that ever dur<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ume to drive his Flock neer this Thicket; and the rea<U+017F>on why it was never frequented, was, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>turb the <U+017F>olitude and <U+017F>acred <U+017F>ilence of the <hi>Nymphs, Pans,</hi> and <hi>Egipans.</hi> The gra<U+017F><U+017F>e was never <U+017F>ullied, the wood never felt the axe, nor was brou<U+017F>ed by any cattle, and the Fountain was never defiled by any foot: <U+017F>o as this little Grove, dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed into the fa<U+017F>hion of an Arbour, or rather a Temple, did plainly demon<U+017F>trate, that it was dedicated unto <U+017F>ome deitie: And therefore all the<U+017F>e Shepheards approaching the entrance with reverence, before they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed any further, they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53526:137"/>
did read the Ver<U+017F>es which were written upon a Table of wood over the Porch: They were the<U+017F>e.</p>

               <p>It is evident, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> that the<U+017F>e boughes have been lately lopped and put into this order, for the leaves of them are yet green.

You <U+017F>ay very true indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but did you take this act as you ought to do, you would rather commend me for it for, in being obedient unto the commands of the divinities which are adored in this place, I do make it appear, by my great reverence of them, that I do reverence them as I ought to do; whereas you, who de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e their commands, do prophane the <U+017F>acred place by your pre<U+017F>umptuous bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e: for, your own <U+017F>oul, if it would not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, can tell you, that your affections are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred as is required. I <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer you pre<U+017F>ently, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander.</hi> Then he and all the company wa<U+017F>hed their hands, put off their <U+017F>hoes, and with bare feet entred into the Arbour. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> turning towards <hi>Hylas:</hi> Hearken, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my words. Afterwards reading the Ver<U+017F>es again, and lifting his eyes up to heaven, and kneeling: Oh great deity (<U+017F>aid he) who is adored in this place, I here enter into the <U+017F>acred Grove, being mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that I do not contradict thy will, knowing my love to be <U+017F>o holy, and <U+017F>o pure, that thou wilt be plea<U+017F>ed to accept the vowes and <U+017F>upplications of a <U+017F>oul <U+017F>o amorou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>anctified as mine; and it this profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion which I here make, be not true, puni<U+017F>h, O great deitie, this my perjury and pre<U+017F>umption.</p>
               <p>After this, with hands lifted up, and head bare, he entred into the Arbour, and all the re<U+017F>t after him, except <hi>Hylas.</hi> The place was <U+017F>pacious, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ixteen or <U+017F>eventeen paces round, and in the mid<U+017F>t, a great branch-<U+017F>oreading Oake; at the root of this Tree was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a gra<U+017F><U+017F>y Table, in the form of an Altar upon which <U+017F>tood a Picture, &amp; in it two <hi>Cupids</hi> drawn, who did <U+017F>trive with one another for a branch of Mirtle and Palm wreathed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As <U+017F>oon as this devout company was entred, every one fell upon their knees and after they had in private adored the deity of the place <hi>Paris</hi> approaching the Altar, and taking upon him the office of a Druide, having gathered <U+017F>ome Oake leaves: Accept (<U+017F>aid he) O great deitie, that is adored in this place, the humble devotion of all this zealous Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I do with all humility and devotion, offer unto thee in their names, a few leaves of this ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Tree, under who<U+017F>e <U+017F>hade it plea<U+017F>eth thee to be ador'd. Then every one aro<U+017F>e, and went unto the Altar, to look upon the Picture which was upon it; in which they <U+017F>aw two <hi>Cupids,</hi> as I told you, who holding in both their hands a branch of Mirtle and Palm wreathed together, the one did <U+017F>trive to take it from the other. The Limner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite in his Art; for the<U+017F>e little lovely Boyes were plump and fat, yet, their Mu<U+017F>cles and Nerves might be <U+017F>een which by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>triving <U+017F>eemed to be rai<U+017F>ed up; both their right thighes were advanced, and their feet almo<U+017F>t touched each other; both their armes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53526:138"/>
were <U+017F>tretched out, and their bodies leaned backwar I, as if they knew, that the further off a weight is, the heavier it is; and the weight of their little bodies, lent more <U+017F>trength unto their <U+017F>triving armes. Their faces were both fair, but blu<U+017F>hing, by rea<U+017F>on of the blood which came into them by <U+017F>triving, which the great veins upon their temples and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads did <U+017F>ufficiently te<U+017F>tifie. And the Arti<U+017F>t had been <U+017F>o carefull, and wrought it with <U+017F>uch indu<U+017F>try, that though he did repre<U+017F>ent an action, which made it appear, that both of them would vanqui<U+017F>h; yet, one might perceive by their countenances, that there was no enmity betwixt them, having, for all their Combat, mixed a kinde of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>miling in their eyes, and about both their mouths. Their Torches which were on each <U+017F>ide of them, which they had let fall, by chance, fell one again<U+017F>t another, <U+017F>o as they united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made but one, by this means added lu<U+017F>tre to each other, and gave the greater light with this Motto, <hi>Our Wills are but one.</hi> Their Bowes were <U+017F>o linked and twi<U+017F>ted one with the other, that they could not draw them but both together; their Quivers, which were hung upon their <U+017F>houlders, were full of Arrowes; but by the colour of their feathers one might know, that tho<U+017F>e which the one had, belonged unto the other, becau<U+017F>e in the gilded Quiver, were <U+017F>ilver feathered Arrowes, and in the <U+017F>ilvered Quiver, gilded Arrowes. The Company had looked long, and not under<U+017F>tood this piece, i the <U+017F>hepheard <hi>Silvande,</hi> at the reque<U+017F>t of <hi>Paris,</hi> had not interpreted the <U+017F>ignification The<U+017F>e two <hi>Cupids</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) do <U+017F>ignifie the Lover and the Loved; this Palm and Mirtle-wreath doth expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the victory of Love, for the Palme is an emblem of Victory, and the Mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Bowes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twi<U+017F>ted and linked <U+017F>o together, that one cannot draw them without the other, do teach us, that all things are <U+017F>o in commun betwixt friends, as the pui<U+017F><U+017F>ance of the one is that of the other, <U+017F>o as neither can do any thing, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e his Companion contribute his, which the changing of the Arrowes doth more illu<U+017F>trate. One may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ee by this conjunction of Bowes, and Flames, and change of Arrowes, and union of two Wills into one, that the Lover and the Loved are but one: So as I perceive, this Picture repre<U+017F>ents unto us that the endeavours of two Loves to get the victory one over the other, their conte<U+017F>t is not, who <U+017F>hould be be<U+017F>t Loved, but who <U+017F>hould be<U+017F>t Love, giving us to under<U+017F>tand, that the perfection of Love con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts, in <U+017F>triving how to Love, and not how to be Loved. Now if this be <U+017F>o, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he and turned towards <hi>Diana,</hi> you may <U+017F>ee, how much you are in my debt. I mu<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that after this rate I had rather be in your debt, than have you in mine. <hi>Hylas,</hi> who <U+017F>tood at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and dur<U+017F>t go no further, though he had a great de<U+017F>ire unto it, and the more, when peeping in, he <U+017F>aw the gra<U+017F><U+017F>y Altar, and Picture upon it: And becau<U+017F>e he could not well <U+017F>ee, he employed his ear with all attention, to hearken unto <hi>Silvander's</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and heard what he <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Diana.</hi> I perceive, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that neither you nor I are repre<U+017F>ented in this piece, <U+017F>ince they in it are both Lovers and Loved; you are loved, but do not love; and I do love but am not loved, and all this more by ill fortune, then by rea<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>There is no difference betwixt us, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> but in words; for I call that rea<U+017F>on, which you do call ill fortune, and yet it is the <U+017F>ame thing. If all the difference (<U+017F>aid he) were only in words I would not care; but the wor<U+017F>t is, that which you call rea<U+017F>on and I ill fortune, fills me full of all mi<U+017F>eries, and its contrary would make me the mo<U+017F>t happy <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the whole Univer<U+017F>e Afterwards he turned towards the Picture and as <hi>Diana</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered: I be<U+017F>eech you, my Faire<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he) do not talk any more of your <U+017F>mall affection to me, but let me <U+017F>ee what is yet more rare in this Picture. Then taking her by the hand, he read the<U+017F>e words, thus written in the bottom.</p>

               <p>Oh Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> it is mo<U+017F>t certainly <hi>Celadon</hi> that writ the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, it is without any manner of doubt: for, about three years <U+017F>ince, he did write them upon my Picture, which my Father had of me to give unto my Uncle <hi>Focion.</hi> Upon this, tears flowed from her eyes. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> fearing the re<U+017F>t of the Company would <U+017F>ee her: Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this is rather a cau<U+017F>e of rejoycing then <U+017F>orrow; for, if <hi>Celadon</hi> did write it as I do believe he did, certainly he is not dead, although you think he was drowned; and if it be <U+017F>o, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cau<U+017F>e of joy could you have. Ah Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, turning the other way, and pu<U+017F>hing her from her) for gods <U+017F>ake do not torment me with any <U+017F>uch language, <hi>Celadon</hi> is too certainly dead, by my folly; and I am mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable in the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e. I <U+017F>ee the gods are not yet contented with tho<U+017F>e tears, that I have already <U+017F>hed for him, <U+017F>ince they have brought me hither, to give me a fre<U+017F>h <U+017F>ubject for more: But, <U+017F>ince they will have it <U+017F>o, I will turn my <U+017F>elfe wholly into tears; and though I cannot wholly wa<U+017F>h away my offence by them, yet, I will never cea<U+017F>e, untill I have lo<U+017F>t either my eyes, or my life, or both. I do not tell you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that <hi>Celadon</hi> is alive; but I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that if he did write the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, I mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity conclude, that he is not dead. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, our Druides tell us, that we have <U+017F>oules which never die, although our bodies do; and <U+017F>o in that <U+017F>ence he may live. I have heard <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that it is our duty to give a buriall unto the dead, and to put a piece of mony in their mouths, to pay the Ferry-man, for wafting them over the Stygian Lake; and that <U+017F>uch as are deprived of buriall, are a hundred years wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about the places where they lo<U+017F>t their bodies; and how can you tell, but that the

<U+017F>oul of <hi>Celadon</hi> having lo<U+017F>t his body, and being denyed that charitable office, may be wandring about the fatall River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and <U+017F>till retain the <U+017F>ame affection and thoughts which he had before? Ah Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> the<U+017F>e are but meer phanta<U+017F>ms; <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> is certainly dead, and the<U+017F>e are the te<U+017F>timonies of his affection, and my folly. What I do <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> is grounded upon more then phantaims and Chimeraes, and I hint then upto you, out of my de<U+017F>ire to contribute unto your tranquillity. I do know it, Si<U+017F>ter replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> but con<U+017F>ider, that if I <U+017F>hould think <hi>Celadon</hi> alive, and afterwards finde him to be dead, nothing could pre<U+017F>erve my life; this would be, to <U+017F>ee him die twice: and the gods, and my own heart do know, how near his fir<U+017F>t death did bring me to my grave. Yet, you may receive this <U+017F>atisfaction by it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> as to know, that death could not extingui<U+017F>h the affection which he bore unto you. That, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> conduceth unto his glory and my puni<U+017F>hment. Nay rather, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> this con<U+017F>truction may be made of it, that he being dead, does cleerly and without a cloud <U+017F>ee, the pure and entire affection which you bear unto him, and that the jealou<U+017F>ie, which cau<U+017F>ed your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger again<U+017F>t him, did proceed only from the <U+017F>uperabundance of your love; for I have heard <U+017F>ay that our <U+017F>oules <U+017F>eparated from the bodies, do <U+017F>till <U+017F>ee and behold them. This, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> would be the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfaction that I can receive; for I do not doubt, but as my imprudence did give him great cau<U+017F>e of griefe, <U+017F>o this <U+017F>ight of my affection would give him contentment: For, if I did not love him above all the world, and if I do not continue <U+017F>til in the <U+017F>ame affection may the gods never love me. The<U+017F>e two Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were talking thus, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Diana</hi> entertained the re<U+017F>t of the Company, <U+017F>ometimes in reading the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which <U+017F>he found upon the Altar and <U+017F>ometimes a king <hi>Paris, Tircis,</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> what was their thoughts of the<U+017F>e things. There is not any here but knowes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> but this Picture was made for <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and conceives, that he who put it in this place, does not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis, Celadon</hi> who was drowned <U+017F>ome three or four months <U+017F>ince in the River <hi>Lignon?</hi> The <U+017F>ame, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander.</hi> Did he, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> love <hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> I have heard <U+017F>ay, that there was a mo<U+017F>t inveterate enmity betwixt their Families.</p>
               <p>The beauty of this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> was greater then their hatred; and <U+017F>ince he is dead, I hope there is no danger in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o. Nor do I believe there would, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> if he were alive; for, he being <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e, their affection could not offend any. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hearing what they <U+017F>aid of her, though her eyes were not yet dry, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but an<U+017F>wer them: The<U+017F>e tears, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, which I cannot hide, do te<U+017F>tifie, that <hi>Celadon</hi> did love me; but the<U+017F>e Manu<U+017F>cripts do te<U+017F>tifie, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hath rather offended again<U+017F>t Love then Duty: But, to give him <U+017F>atisfaction after his death, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, more then decency would permit me when he was alive, and <U+017F>ay, <hi>I did love him.</hi> Upon the<U+017F>e words, all the company came to her, and <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hewing her the papers which <U+017F>he had in her hand: Is this <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Celadon's</hi> writing? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> it is a <U+017F>igne he is not dead. Unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered, That is it of which we have been <U+017F>peaking; but <U+017F>he tells me, that <hi>Celadon's</hi> <U+017F>oul, which wonders about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> did write them. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> was he not buried? That's the rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> why he wanders thus; for they never made him a Tombe. This, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> was mo<U+017F>t carele<U+017F>ly done, to let <U+017F>o brave a <U+017F>oul as <hi>Celadon's</hi> <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o long pain for want of a little care. You may <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> how little tho<U+017F>e that are alive do care for the dead; <U+017F>o as I e<U+017F>teem them to be wi<U+017F>e, who bury them<U+017F>elves alive. Indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> it is very <U+017F>trange, that this <U+017F>hepheard; <U+017F>o much loved and lamented, not only by all his Kindred, but by all the Neighbourhood, <U+017F>hould not have that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table office done him, which many have, who are le<U+017F><U+017F>e loved. Perhaps <U+017F>aid <hi>Thor<U+017F>ander,</hi> the gods did <U+017F>o ordain it, to the end, he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon have that place he had <U+017F>o much loved, and being recompen<U+017F>ed with his love, he had rather <U+017F>tay <U+017F>ome while neer her he had adored. However, I conceive, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> that even as our bodies cannot be in the Aire, Water, or Fire, without much pain, becau<U+017F>e being ponderous and heavy, they mu<U+017F>t perpetually be unquiet, as long as they are in <U+017F>uch pure Elements, as have no <U+017F>olidity in them to re<U+017F>t upon; <U+017F>o the <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>eperated from the body, not being in its proper Element, as long as it is among<U+017F>t us, is in continuall pain, untill it enter into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where it will finde another Earth, another Aire, another Water, and another Fire, more perfect, proper, and <U+017F>uitable unto its nature, then unto our dull, and gro<U+017F><U+017F>e bodies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when my deare<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o much loved <hi>Cleon,</hi> dyed, I was in a re<U+017F>olution not to bury
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53526:141"/>
her, that I might have retained her deare<U+017F>t <U+017F>oul the longer about me; but, our Druides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of that error, and told me, as I have told you. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sivander,</hi> <U+017F>ince for went of buriall, men <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tay <U+017F>ome time longer in the place where they dyed, I heartily de<U+017F>ire all my friends, that if I do die in this Country not to bury me, that I may the longer look upon my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; for, there are no joyes in the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable unto that ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed vi<U+017F>ion, nor any pains that a <U+017F>oul can <U+017F>uffer, by being out of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element, but are recompen<U+017F>ed by it.</p>
               <p>That would do very well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> if after we be <U+017F>eparated from our bodies, we did retain our affections: but, our Sages tell us, that our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ibutes of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the gods did be<U+017F>tow them upon us, to the end, the race of men <U+017F>hould not fail; but after death, <U+017F>oules being immortall, and not in a capacity of engendring, our Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and our Loves are lo<U+017F>t in it, even as our de<U+017F>ires of eating, or drinking, or <U+017F>leeping. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> if <hi>Celadon</hi> did write the<U+017F>e Papers, it is not likely he hath lo<U+017F>t his affection &amp; love unto this Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e. Who knowes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> but that the gods, who are infinitely ju<U+017F>t, were plea<U+017F>ed to give him that particular <U+017F>atisfaction, in recompence of that pure and <U+017F>acred affection which he had unto that <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e? If <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> why <U+017F>hould not I hope to finde the gods as ju<U+017F>t and favourable unto me, as him, <U+017F>ince my affection <U+017F>hall not yield unto him or any other, either in purity or zeal? But, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> if the gods do <U+017F>hew him this as a favour, would it not be impiety, to deprive him of that contentment, by endeavouring to give him a buriall, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>et him out of this world? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> for the gods do favour him in it, only as a comfort in the pains which he is continually in, being con<U+017F>trained to be ab<U+017F>ent from heaven, <U+017F>o contrary to its nature.</p>
               <p>The Shepheards were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, when <hi>Phillis,</hi> e<U+017F>pied a place, which <U+017F>eemed, as if <U+017F>ome had been upon their knees, for <U+017F>uch marks were imprinted upon the earth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it was ju<U+017F>t oppo<U+017F>ite to the Altar, and <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o <U+017F>pying a piece of Parchment clo<U+017F>e by it, <U+017F>he went to <U+017F>ee what it was, and opening it, <U+017F>he found the<U+017F>e words.</p>

As they were thus talking, <hi>Diana,</hi> who looked upon them very narrowly, <U+017F>he found, that though the Inke was alike, yet there was <U+017F>ome difference on <U+017F>ome Characters, and then rubbing them with her finger, the new written went off, and the ra<U+017F>ure appeared; then holding the Parchment betwixt the Sun and her eye, all the ra<U+017F>ures and old writing ea<U+017F>ily appeared, which having found out: Now, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I can end both your di<U+017F>putes, for in one and the <U+017F>ame place, you may finde what you both <U+017F>eek for; you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> may finde it written as you did read, and you <hi>Hylas,</hi> as you did correct it. Then comming to them, <U+017F>he did demon<U+017F>trate it unto them both; for betwixt the Sun and the eye one might plainly <U+017F>ee, where the Parchment had been <U+017F>cratched, and might, though dimly, <U+017F>ee, what had been old written, and what newly. Every one of the Company did confirm what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, and all flocking about <hi>Hylas:</hi> Come, <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, <U+017F>aid they, tell us truly how you did this. <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe di<U+017F>covered by the <U+017F>trict ob<U+017F>ervance of <hi>Diana,</hi> was almo<U+017F>t forced to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the truth; yet, not before he had <U+017F>worn many an oath that it was the inju<U+017F>tice of tho<U+017F>e Lawes, which moved him unto it; for, <U+017F>aid he, they are <U+017F>o very unrea<U+017F>onable, as I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly forbear correcting them as they ought to be. None could forbear laughing, to hear him talk <U+017F>o, but more, when they con<U+017F>idered, into what a damp <hi>Silvander</hi> was <U+017F>truck at the fir<U+017F>t. And becau<U+017F>e it grew very late, and they had <U+017F>tayed very long in that place, <hi>Phillis</hi> would have carried back the Statutes to the place from whence <U+017F>he had them: But all were of opinion, that it was fit they <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t be corrected as they were at fir<U+017F>t; and that <hi>Hylas,</hi> to extenuate <U+017F>ome part of his offence, in entring into that place which he was forbidden, and for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to fal<U+017F>ifie the Statutes of Love, he was cen<U+017F>ured to era<U+017F>e all that him<U+017F>elfe had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which accordingly he did: More, <U+017F>aid he in obedience unto my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>e the anger of Love or <hi>Silvander.</hi> Take heed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that this be not too much pre<U+017F>umption and infidelity Had <hi>Hylas</hi> heard the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he would have replyed; but he being gone into the Arbour, no an<U+017F>wer was given. In the mean time, all the company went their waies, and took a little path which <hi>Silvander</hi> had cho<U+017F>en. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was out of hopes to hear any more newes of <hi>Celadon;</hi> that could plea<U+017F>e her, <U+017F>he had a minde to return back, and in order to that, <U+017F>he left <hi>Tircis,</hi> and came to him Me-thinks <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him it is too late to go any further, and night will <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e us, before we can return to our Cabins. That's true, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard; yet that, me-thinks, <U+017F>hould not hinder you from going on, <U+017F>ince we are <U+017F>o neer the end of our journey; and though you <U+017F>hould return, the day would not <U+017F>erve you above halfe the way. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> where <U+017F>hould we lie? The place unto which I <U+017F>hall conduct you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not far from the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e and I am <U+017F>ure the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> will bid you all very welcome. I would know, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whether this be agreeable unto my Companions. And then <U+017F>taying till the way was a little broader, <U+017F>he made <hi>Silvander's</hi> propo<U+017F>ition unto them. There was not one, who did not very well approve of it, <U+017F>ince it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to return unto their Townes by day light.</p>
               <p>In this re<U+017F>olution then, they went on and <hi>Silvander</hi> not quitting <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did <U+017F>hew her the Wood where he found the Letter, which cau<U+017F>ed this voyage. This <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is a place very retired to receive any Letters in. You will more think it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid he, when you are there; for, it is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>alvage and rude place, and the lea<U+017F>t frequented, of any about all the River <hi>Lignon.</hi> So as none could hit the way <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> except you and Love. For my part, <U+017F>aid he, I know what it is, and as for Love. I will be <U+017F>ilent; for, I have heard <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>ometimes when he would throw flames into a heart, he has burnt him<U+017F>elfe; and who can tell whether he did not <U+017F>o, by the beauty of my Mi<U+017F>tris? and if any thing cure him, it is doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e the Fillet which he hath before his eyes. Ah <hi>Silvander!</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e) that Fillet does not hinder, but he can <U+017F>ee when he plea<U+017F>eth, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53526:144"/>
hit <U+017F>o right upon the mark they are aimed at, as it is not likely one that's blinde did <U+017F>hoot them. I have <U+017F>een, wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)</hi> a blind man, who could hit the way unto every hou<U+017F>e, and turn at every turning in the Town, having gotten it by a long cu<U+017F>tome. And why may we not well <U+017F>ay, that Love, who is the prime and elde<U+017F>t of all the gods, hath by a long accu<U+017F>tomacy, learned to hit the hearts of men, though he be blinde; and to <U+017F>hew you, that it is more by cu<U+017F>tome then skill, ob<U+017F>erve, that he loves us only in the eyes, and yet hits our hearts: If he were not blinde, do you think he would wound with Love <U+017F>o many unequall per<U+017F>ons, Superious with Inferiours, and Shepheards with Queens. But I <U+017F>peak this as a per<U+017F>on intere<U+017F>ted, for I, that does not know what I am, it hath cau<U+017F>ed me to love <hi>Diana,</hi> who<U+017F>e merits are above the degree of any <U+017F>hepheards, and it hath made <hi>Paris,</hi> who is Son unto the Prince of <hi>Druides,</hi> to love a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e. As for your merits an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you do equall the perfections of <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> by her vertue, doth tran<U+017F>cend the grandure of <hi>Paris;</hi> <U+017F>o as the inequality is not <U+017F>o great, as to make you accu<U+017F>e Love of blindne<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>tood mute at this reply; not, but that he could ea<U+017F>ily have an<U+017F>wered, but becau<U+017F>e he was <U+017F>orry, he had by his words given know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his affection, and repented of them, fearing it would offend <hi>Diana,</hi> if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know of it. But by good fortune, his words were well addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; for <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> knowing what pure and <U+017F>incere affection he bore unto <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>he would mo<U+017F>t willingly have left him all a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. And the nature of all <U+017F>uch as know how to love well, is, never to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Love of another, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it be prejudiciall unto their own:</p>
               <p>By this time, they were come unto the Wood, and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aid unto her: This, wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, is the Wood which you have <U+017F>o much longed to <U+017F>ee, but being already Sun-<U+017F>et, we have not time to view it. If we do finde in it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, as many rarities, as we did in that from whence we came, I <U+017F>hall think our journey and time very well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they entred into the Wood, and it grew <U+017F>o dark, as they could not <U+017F>ee one another, nor follow, but by the voice; then going further into the Wood, he <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t his way, as he was forced to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that he knew not where he was: The cau<U+017F>e of this was a Plant over which he walked, which they of the Country do vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call <hi>Wander-weed,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it hath a quality, to make tho<U+017F>e that tread upon it to wander out of their way, and, as the common bruit was, there was much of it in that Wood. Whether this be true or fal<U+017F>e, I cannot tell; but <U+017F>o it was, that <hi>Silvander</hi> and all the Company could not finde their way again all that night, though he turned and winded almo<U+017F>t through all the Wood, and at the la<U+017F>t, they were all <U+017F>o wildred, as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to follow one another, by taking hold of each others clothes; for the night was <U+017F>o dark, as if it were <U+017F>o purpo<U+017F>ely, to hinder them from getting out of the Wood. <hi>Hylas,</hi> who by chance was got betwixt <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> I begin, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, to hope well in the <U+017F>ervice which I have done you. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis?</hi> Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he you are very much afraid to lo<U+017F>e me and whereas I was wont to follow you, now you follow me.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; but you mu<U+017F>t thank <hi>Silvander</hi> for it, whom you <U+017F>ay is your greate<U+017F>t enemy. I cannot tell <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> whether I <U+017F>hould more thank him for the favour I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you, or chide him, for the pains I have taken. You may judge of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> when you have put the plea<U+017F>ures and the pains which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, both into a ballance. I wi<U+017F>h, Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you would hold the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and judge which was the heavier. Every one did laugh at the good-will of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> who heard it, an<U+017F>wered him only thus: I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I am a blind man, who leads many others. But the wor<U+017F>t is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> they are blind only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they tru<U+017F>ted too much unto your eyes. If you had been out of the Company, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> we had not been <U+017F>o blinde. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> did I put out your eyes? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> but you did take away our means of <U+017F>eeing, holding us <U+017F>o long in di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es of your incon<U+017F>tancy, and by fal<U+017F>ifying the <U+017F>acred Lawes, which did put us upon the night. <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you put me in minde of tho<U+017F>e, who when they had found good Wine, did blame it, becau<U+017F>e they were drunk: Good friends (may the Wine <U+017F>ay) why did ye drink <U+017F>o much? And good friend, <hi>Silvander,</hi> why did you hearken to me <U+017F>o long? Did I nail your ears to any po<U+017F>t? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> there were <U+017F>tronger chaines in that company and place, then yours. But be it as it will, we are now <U+017F>o wandred out of the way, either by rea<U+017F>on of the night, of by going over the plant <hi>Wonder-weed,</hi> as there is no hopes of getting into the way again, untill it be day, or at the lea<U+017F>t, untill the Moon do <U+017F>hine. What's then to be done, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris?</hi> No better cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> then to re<U+017F>t our<U+017F>elves under one of the<U+017F>e Trees, untill the Moon do <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe. Every one

approved of the motion: And the <U+017F>hepheards <U+017F>preading all their Coats upon the ground, under the drye<U+017F>t Tree, the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es did <U+017F>it upon them, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>ted altogether till the Moon appeared.</p>
               <p>Although the night was already far <U+017F>pent, when the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es did <U+017F>it them<U+017F>elves down upon the Coats of the Shepheards; yet, being unaccu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch a Canopy as the Cope of heaven, and unu<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>it upon the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e in the night, they talked a long while, before any <U+017F>leep did <U+017F>eize upon their eyes: And becau<U+017F>e the horrour of the night did po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e them with fears, they laid them<U+017F>elves clo<U+017F>e upon an heap. <hi>Diana</hi> being next <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> did ask her, what fortune brought her into that Country? Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, the <U+017F>tory of it is both too long and too tedious; let this, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>erve for all, that the <U+017F>ame Love that is <U+017F>o Regent in your Villages, hath as great a Soveraignty over Ladies and Knights; and it is it which brought me hither into this <U+017F>tate, although my quality hath rai<U+017F>ed me above it. If it be only your fears of being tedious to us, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I dare undertake for all the Company, that this objection ought not to hinder you, from giving us a relation of it; for we have all longed to have the <U+017F>atisfaction from you: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no time more convenient than now, <U+017F>ince we are without the hearing of any <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. The rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> why I in particular do de<U+017F>ire it, is, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ee us a<U+017F><U+017F>under, do <U+017F>ay, that we re<U+017F>emble one another very much <U+017F>o as me-thinks, I am as much concerned in your fortune as my own, and obliged to enquire after it. It would be great glory unto me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Madonthe,</hi> to re<U+017F>emble <U+017F>uch a Beauty as yours; but I wi<U+017F>h, for your tranquillities <U+017F>ake, that your fortunes may never re<U+017F>emble mine. I am much obliged unto you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> for your good will; but every one hath their own loads, and knowes be<U+017F>t where the <U+017F>hoe doth pinch them, and others are not concerned further then by way of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: Therefore I be<U+017F>eech you give <U+017F>atisfaction unto our reque<U+017F>t Then I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave, <U+017F>aid <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> to <U+017F>peak in a low voice, that the <U+017F>hepheards, who are neer us, may not hear; for, I <U+017F>hould be extreamly a<U+017F>hamed, they <U+017F>hould be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my errours, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons which you <U+017F>hall under<U+017F>tand by the <U+017F>equell of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

               <p>IT is be<U+017F>t for me, wi<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creet Company, to relate the <U+017F>tory of my life unto you by night, that darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e may <U+017F>hadow my <U+017F>hame in relating my follies, for <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t I prai<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions, which made me quit the quality unto which I was born, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ume this in which you <U+017F>ee me: For, though I am now in this habit, with a <U+017F>heep-hook in my hand, yet, I am no <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, but de<U+017F>cended from Parents more noble. My Father, following the fortunes of <hi>Thierres,</hi> had gotten <U+017F>uch reputation of a Souldier, that in his ab<U+017F>ence, he commanded all his Armies; not becau<U+017F>e he was a Vi<U+017F>igot as he was, but becau<U+017F>e he had great authority among the Aquitains. This King did <U+017F>o love and honour him, that he was obliged to dedicate him<U+017F>elfe wholly unto him; in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice, be<U+017F>ides the E<U+017F>tate which he inherited from his Ance<U+017F>tors, he <U+017F>o enlarged his po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as there was none in all <hi>Aquitain</hi> that could vie with him in riches. Having lived thus many years, his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t griefe was, that he had no other Child but me. And though his death was <U+017F>uddain, yet it was with <U+017F>o much honour, as I hold it to be the be<U+017F>t piece of his fortune: For, after he had rai<U+017F>ed the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and pur<U+017F>ued <hi>Attiles</hi> as far as the Cathalaunique Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Thierres, Merovea,</hi> and <hi>Etius,</hi> gave him Battle. As fortune was, my Father fought that day upon the right hand of his King, who had the left Wing, and <hi>Merovea</hi> the Right; and almo<U+017F>t the whole <U+017F>trength of <hi>Attiles</hi> was upon <hi>Thierres</hi> <U+017F>ide. After a long fight, the King of the Vi<U+017F>igots was killed, and my Father al<U+017F>o, who, after he had received a hundred wounds, was found upon the body of his King, to defend whom, he received tho<U+017F>e blowes which were made at him; which <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond,</hi> his Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or and Son, did take <U+017F>o well, as he buried his Father and mine both in one Tomb; and after the Battle was won engraved mo<U+017F>t honourable In<U+017F>criptions, to his eternall memory. When my Father dyed, I was about <U+017F>even or eight years of age, and began then to re<U+017F>ent the rigours of Fortune: For <hi>Leontidas,</hi> who <U+017F>ucceeded my Father in his Charge, and whom <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond</hi> loved above all the Cavaliers in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> did u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch artifice, as I was committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Guardian<U+017F>hip, and almo<U+017F>t ravi<U+017F>hed from my own Mother, under a pretence, which they called, Rea<U+017F>on of State <U+017F>aying, that having <U+017F>uch great po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and <U+017F>o many places
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53526:145"/>
of <U+017F>trength he would <U+017F>ee, that I married my <U+017F>elfe unto <U+017F>uch a one, as was very well affected unto the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond.</hi> Thus was I deprived both of Father and Mother, the one, by death; the other, by rea<U+017F>on of State: Yet, Fortune was <U+017F>o favourable unto me, in the hone<U+017F>ty and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> that I could not de<U+017F>ire better offices then tho<U+017F>e I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, nor wanted he any thing, but the name of a Father. But his Wife was of another nature, for <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed me <U+017F>o cruelly, as I may <U+017F>ay, I could not hate death more then <U+017F>he.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Leontidas</hi> his de<U+017F>igne was, to educate me, untill I was at Marriage e<U+017F>tate, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be<U+017F>tow me upon his Nephew, whom he intended to adopt his Heir, having no Children of his own. But con<U+017F>traint being the greate<U+017F>t means to hinder a generous <U+017F>pirit from complacency, it hapned <U+017F>o, as his Nephew had never any affection unto me, nor I to him, both of us conceiving our Fortunes <U+017F>o noble, as we needed not any additions to make them greater. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, and <U+017F>ome others more <U+017F>ecret, did hinder our affections unto one another: But, when I came unto age of more di<U+017F>cretion, I found greater impediments then the<U+017F>e: For, the Court<U+017F>hip of many young Gallants, who addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves with abundance of honour and re<U+017F>pect, made me think, the faint and hollow love of <hi>Leontidas</hi> his Nephew did di<U+017F>honour me. On the other <U+017F>ide, he being vexed, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>leight him, he retreated, <U+017F>o as I never <U+017F>aw him, but as a <U+017F>tranger, of which I was not a little glad. And though the re<U+017F>pect which every one did bear unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the extraordinary favours which <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond</hi> <U+017F>hewed him did <U+017F>tave off many from openly declaring them<U+017F>elves; yet, there was a Cavalier, a neer Kin<U+017F>man unto <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas,</hi> who, notwith<U+017F>tanding all tho<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations did undertake to <U+017F>erve me, though he had but <U+017F>mall hopes to obtain. At the fir<U+017F>t, he had no de<U+017F>igne to embarque him<U+017F>elfe in good earne<U+017F>t, but only to keep him<U+017F>elfe out of idlene<U+017F><U+017F>e, and to make it appear, he had both merit and courage enough, to love and court the love, of her, that was e<U+017F>teemed the highe<U+017F>t Match in all the Court. When this young Gallant began to <U+017F>erve me, he was a man without any re<U+017F>pect, violent, and quick, and <U+017F>o couragious, that the prai<U+017F>e of Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was more his due, than that of Valiant. But, <U+017F>ince Love took him into di<U+017F>cipline, he changed all his imperfections into <U+017F>o many. Vertues, and made him <U+017F>o amiable as <U+017F>ince, he is grown the very pattern of civility and gallantry, unto all the Cavaliers of <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond.</hi> His name was <hi>Damon,</hi> neer kin<U+017F>man unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> of whom the King had at the fir<U+017F>t no good opinion; but <U+017F>ince he began to change, the King al<U+017F>o changed his minde. But <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas</hi> being one, that was extreamly ob<U+017F>ervant of every ones actions, he took <U+017F>uch notice of his de<U+017F>igne, that he could not endure him, becau<U+017F>e he thwarted his aimes, of giving me unto his Nephew: And to give a <U+017F>top unto this new court<U+017F>hip, he did <U+017F>o peremptorily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me from <U+017F>eeing him, and him, from <U+017F>peaking unto me, as both of us were extreamly offended at him. We, loving better becau<U+017F>e forbidden had ever <U+017F>ince a greater de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee each other than before, <U+017F>o as you may believe, that this prohibition was it only, which did oblige me to it. When <hi>Damon</hi> began fir<U+017F>t to court me, his humour was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto me, as I could not endure him; but, after <hi>Leontidas</hi> with menaces and har<U+017F>h lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage did expre<U+017F>ly forbid me <U+017F>eeing him, and <U+017F>eemed to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t me: he vexed me <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, as I re<U+017F>olved with my <U+017F>elfe never to love any other: And therefore I did with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible diligence correct his vices, which his nature did mo<U+017F>t incline him unto; <U+017F>ometimes blaming them in others and <U+017F>ometimes telling him, that my humour was not to love tho<U+017F>e that were addicted to them. Thus forming him into a new modell, when I <U+017F>aw the conditions of this young Cavalier were changed, I loved him much more, then if he had begun to <U+017F>erve me with the <U+017F>ame qualities and perfections; for, every one is much better plea<U+017F>ed with the works of their own hands, then any others: yet, I did carry my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly towards him as none could perceive that I did love him, and <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o upon my guard, as he had not <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to declare his minde unto me by his words: But at la<U+017F>t, thinking that all his <U+017F>ervice was lo<U+017F>t, if I did not know his intentions he re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take more heart, and put it to the venture: and becau<U+017F>e he thought it more expedient to do it by Letter then Tongue, after a long di<U+017F>putation in his minde, he writ this.</p>

                     <p>MADAM, <hi>It is extream temerity, to love an owner of <U+017F>o eminent perfections; but, I conceive it my duty to <U+017F>erve and adore them. And if you will extingui<U+017F>h the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

               <p>He was not a little perplexed, how he <U+017F>hould bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for he knew, that I would not receive it unle<U+017F>s by <U+017F>ome Artifice. And <U+017F>ee what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions Love hath. He came unto me <U+017F>eeming to entertain me with <U+017F>ome Court-newes, and told me two or three pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which hapned very lately: at the la<U+017F>t, he told me, that he had di<U+017F>covered a new League of Love, but feared to tell me the Parties; becau<U+017F>e the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was one of my friends, and the Cavalier one of his. Why, <U+017F>aid I unto him, do you think me to be <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creet, as I cannot conceal what is not fit to be known? Oh no, <U+017F>aid he; but my fear is, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould be an ill willer unto my friend.</p>
               <p>And why <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered I? a pure and hone<U+017F>t Love cannot offend any one. I plainly <U+017F>aw; (<U+017F>weet <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es) that he was perplexed, and knew not what to do; but I could not imagine, that it was any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e concerning his own particular, <U+017F>ince if he had any <U+017F>uch minde, he might have <U+017F>pok unto me long <U+017F>ince, having had opportunities to do it: And therefore I was very urgent with him, and more perhaps then I ought to be. And at the la<U+017F>t he told me, that as for their names, he dur<U+017F>t not tell them for <U+017F>everall con<U+017F>iderations, but he would let me <U+017F>ee a Letter which he had found that morning. Upon this, he put his hand in his pocket, and <U+017F>hewed me the Letter which he had writ unto me, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <U+017F>cruple, I took and read, but knew not his hand, becau<U+017F>e I had never <U+017F>een it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But as I had before a little de<U+017F>ire to know their names, <U+017F>o after the reading of it, my de<U+017F>ire was extream, and was more urgent then before: At which he <U+017F>miled, and put me off with <U+017F>ome bad excu<U+017F>es. Why <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, will you not give me <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfaction, as to tell me what I ask? I am affraid (<U+017F>aid he) that I <U+017F>hall offend you, if I <U+017F>hould obey; for <U+017F>he; unto whom this Letter is addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed is very much a friend of yours. Nay, certainly, <U+017F>aid I, you will much more offend me by your di<U+017F>obedience. Then I am (<U+017F>aid he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two great extreams; but, <U+017F>ince the fault which I <U+017F>hall commit is by your command, it will be the le<U+017F><U+017F>e, and therefore I will obey. Then taking the Letter, he read it aloud; but when he came to the end, he <U+017F>topt, and named no body. See, faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, the <U+017F>trange effects of Love; <U+017F>ometimes it hurries the poore<U+017F>t and ba<U+017F>e<U+017F>t <U+017F>pirits into incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible impudence, and other times it makes the highe<U+017F>t courage to tremble at <U+017F>uch things, as the meane<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on would not dorre at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damon</hi> <U+017F>erves for an example of this; <U+017F>ince he, whom no dangers could make <U+017F>tart, had not <U+017F>o much courage, as to tell his name unto a woman, and a woman, whom he knew, wi<U+017F>hed him no harm. But, as his courage failed him, <U+017F>o my under<U+017F>tanding more; for I might well have known by his fear, that it neerly concerned him; and I well believe, that it was Love which did infatuate me, intending by us, to make his pui<U+017F><U+017F>ance the better known unto others; otherwi<U+017F>e, certainly I had <U+017F>een it <U+017F>ince I did love him, and <U+017F>ince, they <U+017F>ay, the eyes of Love looks though <U+017F>tone-walls. However it was, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I did not apprehend it; and <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>tand <U+017F>ilent: What, <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, mu<U+017F>t I know no more? Truly I did think, that I had a greater power over you then I <U+017F>ee I have. From thence it is, an<U+017F>wered he, that my <U+017F>ilence proceeds; for, your too much power over me; makes me mute, and yet what I have <U+017F>aid might have <U+017F>ufficed you; for what can I declare more, after I have read the Letter, and you heard my voice? How, <hi>Damon,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I to him, extreamly amazed) was't your <U+017F>elfe that writ it? It was I, <U+017F>aid he and he'd down his head and looked upon the ground. Then I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, <U+017F>aid I, unto whom it is directed? Since it is your plea<U+017F>ure to know it (<U+017F>aid he directly) it is unto the fair <hi>Mandonthe.</hi> Upon this word, he was <U+017F>ilent, purpo<U+017F>ely, as I believe, to <U+017F>ee how I would receive his declaration. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I was much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, for I expected any other an<U+017F>wer then that; and though I did love him, and that with a re<U+017F>olved will; yet honour which ought to have the fir<U+017F>t place in our <U+017F>oules, did make me think, his words did offend me: And though I knew, that I my <U+017F>elfe was the cau<U+017F>e of his boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet would I not excu<U+017F>e him upon that, conceiving, that notwith<U+017F>tanding he ought to have held his peace. The truth is, the love I had unto him was a good Advocate for him, and though it could not quite qualifie my re<U+017F>entments of honour, yet it did infinitely <U+017F>weeten them. At the la<U+017F>t I an<U+017F>wered him thus: <hi>Damon,</hi> I did little expect this trea<U+017F>on from you, in whom I dur<U+017F>t have tru<U+017F>ted, as in my <U+017F>elfe; but, by this act, you have taught me never
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53526:146"/>
to tru<U+017F>t in any young and ra<U+017F>h per<U+017F>on; yet, I will not lay the whole blame upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I my <U+017F>elfe am partly guilty, in living with you heretofore as I have don: but, your over boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hall cau<U+017F>e me to be more advi<U+017F>ed for the future; I <U+017F>hall hereafter take heed, both of you, and all that re<U+017F>emble you. Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto me, if you call it trea<U+017F>on to love you, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I have betrayed you, and <U+017F>hall do as long as I live, knowing, that neither you, nor any in the world, can imagine the grandure of my affection: And if you do think, that my youth made me <U+017F>o bold, I <U+017F>hall maintain it again<U+017F>t all men, that never was age more prudent then this youth, nor ever any prudence more wi<U+017F>e then this temerity, which you blame me for. If I have failed, and that you are guilty of it, your manner of living with me is not the cau<U+017F>e, but becau<U+017F>e being <U+017F>o admirably fair, and full of all perfection, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any <U+017F>hould look upon you, and not commit the <U+017F>ame fault. Alas, did you not tell me, that a pure and perfect Love could not offend any? And why <U+017F>hould you now judge otherwi<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t me? But, if my words do offend you, here's <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that <U+017F>poke them, offers his brea<U+017F>t unto you, and the heart that adores you; cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e him as you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e, and if he refu<U+017F>e any thing you <U+017F>hall doom him unto (unle<U+017F><U+017F>e forbidding him to <U+017F>erve you) hold him for the wor<U+017F>t of Traitors, and the mo<U+017F>t unworthy of your favours of any man alive. Had you been contented (<U+017F>aid I unto him) to have given me <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timonies of your affection, by your humble re<U+017F>pect, and not by <U+017F>uch impudent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I had then found <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons to love you, as now I do to hate you. Do you think, <hi>Damon,</hi> I can put up the<U+017F>e injuries without revenge? Do you not remember who my Father was? Have you been ignorant of my life, and what care I have had, not only to be as I ought to be, but al<U+017F>o to pre<U+017F>erve my fame from all manner of <U+017F>candall? Con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e things, and if you do continue, you will make me per<U+017F>ecute you by all the waies I can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Madam (an<U+017F>wered he pre<U+017F>ently) never <U+017F>et before me any pains you can imagine; he that can endure the anger of your fair eyes, need not to fear all the torments in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e. Do not think I am ignorant who you are, nor from whom you are de<U+017F>cended; your vertues are too deeply engraved on my <U+017F>oul, and I am too much obliged unto tho<U+017F>e, who gave you a beeing in the world, ever to lo<U+017F>e the memory of them. But if I have only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you in words, and not out of any de<U+017F>igne, but to do you <U+017F>ervice, forget, Madam, I be<U+017F>eech you, and forgive my tongue; command me to be dumb, <U+017F>o you will let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore you in my heart, and I will never <U+017F>peak again. But, if you think your reputation, of which you are <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>tly tender, would be blemi<U+017F>hed, by my telling the world that I love you, you would take the only way to force me unto it, if you <U+017F>hould do according to your menaces; for, it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but my affection would break out, and <U+017F>o that which I now tell you in private, would be publi<U+017F>hed all over the Court; and, would not that much more offend you? Before you pronounce your doom again<U+017F>t me, I be<U+017F>eech you, Madam, con<U+017F>ider well upon what I have <U+017F>aid, and that if my fault have di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed you, why <U+017F>hould you do wor<U+017F>e, in publi<U+017F>hing it unto all the world?</p>
               <p>It would be a hard task for me (wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es) to repeat all the rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Damon</hi> alledged, and though I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e them well, yet I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you he did. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I do approve of their coun<U+017F>ell as very good, who <U+017F>ay, that a Lover ought not to declare his affection unto any Lady, before he have obliged her unto <U+017F>ome kinde of good will unto him, for then the offence which <U+017F>he receives by the declaration, will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated; and <U+017F>he will hearken unto his words with a more favourable ear. I did approve of it, I <U+017F>ay, at this time by experience; for, I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly part from him, though I did re<U+017F>ent the injury which he did me. And on the contrary, before our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, I did con<U+017F>ent he <U+017F>hould love and <U+017F>erve me, <U+017F>o it was with honour and di<U+017F>cretion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <hi>Leontidas</hi> had his eye perpetually upon us, I commanded him not to <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o often; and, to deceive him, to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble as well as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he could. I do remember, that at that time, <hi>Leontidas,</hi> though a great and a wi<U+017F>e Captain, yet was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with the love of <U+017F>ome woman, who <U+017F>eeming to love him, did get what mony they could from him, yet in <U+017F>ecret favoured others. <hi>Damon</hi> compo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome Ver<U+017F>es, which he <U+017F>ent unto me: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e we feared, le<U+017F>t if our Letters <U+017F>hould be lo<U+017F>t, our names would make known, what we de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ecret: I called him Brother, and he me Si<U+017F>ter.

               <p>But to return from whence I digre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Ever <U+017F>ince, <hi>Damon</hi> did <U+017F>o regulate and conform him<U+017F>elfe unto my will as I could not deny, but that I did love him; and indeed, he was <U+017F>uch a one, as it was hard to do otherwi<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially con<U+017F>idering, how his affection unto me, had made him change his vices into vertues. And becau<U+017F>e, to delude the eyes of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas,</hi> we did not <U+017F>peak together, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e as we accidentally met, and never in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of any; many had an opinion, that the generous <U+017F>pirit of <hi>Damon</hi> would not long endure the di<U+017F>dain which I u<U+017F>ed towards him, and that he was quite fallen off from me. <hi>Leontidas</hi> him<U+017F>elfe was al<U+017F>o deceived, though his Wife, who was of a very <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did <U+017F>till a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him of the contrary; and becau<U+017F>e he did mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire to be<U+017F>tow me upon his Nephew, to <U+017F>atisfie his minde, he <U+017F>et over me a Woman, who<U+017F>e office was, to be a <U+017F>pie over all my actions, without making any <U+017F>hew of it; her name was <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and well in years, yet of a very plea<U+017F>ing nature, but withall, as <U+017F>ubtle and crafty as ever lived. I was not <U+017F>o quick-<U+017F>ighted as <hi>Damon,</hi> for pre<U+017F>ently he di<U+017F>covered the de<U+017F>igne of <hi>Leontidas.</hi> But I, finding her to be very good company, and one that did <U+017F>trive all <U+017F>he could to plea<U+017F>e me, I could not believe <U+017F>he had any bad intention. He, continually telling me, that <U+017F>he would deceive me, and bidding me to take heed of her, we re<U+017F>olved to go more <U+017F>ubtlely to work: And becau<U+017F>e it was not in our di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e to turn her away, we thought it mo<U+017F>t expedient to <U+017F>eem, as if her company was very plea<U+017F>ing and welcome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: By this artifice we thought we <U+017F>hould oblige her, not to do all the ill offices <U+017F>he could, but to make <hi>Leontidas</hi> think, that we had no de<U+017F>ignes, but what we were willing he <U+017F>hould know.</p>
               <p>Oh how well advi<U+017F>ed had we been, if we had put this determination into execution, after a more <U+017F>olid con<U+017F>ideration. <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>eeing what carra<U+017F><U+017F>es I u<U+017F>ed, did <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to plea<U+017F>e me, that at the la<U+017F>t, I began in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to love her: And <U+017F>he on the other <U+017F>ide, taking notice of the applications which <hi>Damon</hi> made unto her, did believe, that he loved her; and this beliefe, together with the beauty of this young Cavalier did quickly invite <hi>Leriana</hi> to love him, <U+017F>o as there was none of us, but poor <hi>Damon,</hi> who was not deceived; yet he payed the deare<U+017F>t for our errours, though he knew all this from the fir<U+017F>t, yet could he not help it. I <U+017F>hall as long as I live remember the words he u<U+017F>ed, when he <U+017F>aid unto me: Si<U+017F>ter, you do love <hi>Leriana,</hi> but take heed <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erve it; I am afraid you will finde it, when it is too late her de<U+017F>igne is naught, both again<U+017F>t you and me; for, the Wife of <hi>Leontidas</hi> <U+017F>ets her over you, only as a <U+017F>pie: And believe it, the carra<U+017F><U+017F>es which you have commanded me to u<U+017F>e unto her, has made her believe, that I love her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>he wi<U+017F>heth me no harme. So much the better, Brother, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) for I know you cannot be in love with her, nor <U+017F>hall I be jealous. However, the good will <U+017F>he bears unto you, will perhaps keep him within compa<U+017F><U+017F>e, and hinder her from doing you any hurt. Pray heavens, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he, it falout <U+017F>o; but I am in fear, this affection will end quite contrary; for, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould continue my carra<U+017F>ses long unto her then, when <U+017F>he finds her <U+017F>elfe deceived and <U+017F>leighted. Oh heavens, what mi<U+017F>chiefe will <U+017F>he not be apt to do unto me? No, no, <U+017F>aid I unto him, <U+017F>he can never think to win upon you by:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53526:147"/>
force. I pray god, replyed he, that I prove a bad diviner, and that <U+017F>he do not do all <U+017F>he can to do us mi<U+017F>chiefe. I did <U+017F>ee, that this woman was very kinde unto him, but I could not imagine, <U+017F>he could be in love with him, only thought, that her application to him, was out of her de<U+017F>ire to be complai<U+017F>ant. Now though <hi>Leontidas</hi> did treat me with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet, the har<U+017F>h u<U+017F>age of his Wife, made me almo<U+017F>t weary of my life. I told <hi>Damon,</hi> that he ought to con<U+017F>ider the mi<U+017F>erable life which I led; that I had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but in him, nor con<U+017F>olation, but in <hi>Leriana;</hi> that I did not think, <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife had any intentions of <U+017F>etting <hi>Leriana</hi> as a <U+017F>py; or if they did, I thought they might be deceived, and that this woman thought her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o obliged by my carra<U+017F><U+017F>es, as I am almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he loves me. <hi>Damon</hi> <U+017F>eeing me in this opinion, could do nothing but <U+017F>hrug his <U+017F>houlders, and dur<U+017F>t never <U+017F>ince <U+017F>peak of it unto me, for fear of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing me. And <U+017F>ee what force this good opinion which we have of a per<U+017F>on, hath over us: I did plainly <U+017F>ee her applications unto <hi>Damon,</hi> but could not imagine it was with any bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions conceiving it to be only out of complacency. Oh how the vizard of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e vices, and makes us mi<U+017F>take them for vertues? And upon this ground, I was very angry with <hi>Damon</hi> very often, conceiving he did not treat <hi>Leriana</hi> as he ought, <U+017F>ince I had told him that I loved her, and that this was the lea<U+017F>t thing he could do for me, to make much of tho<U+017F>e whom I cheri<U+017F>hed. This <hi>Damon</hi> knew well enough, and dur<U+017F>t not complain, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould make the matter wor<U+017F>e, only nouri<U+017F>hed in his heart an extream hatred again<U+017F>t her which he had much ado to hide. On the contrary, <hi>Leriana</hi> did <U+017F>o grow every day in affection to him, that <U+017F>eeing he took no notice of it, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but write a Letter unto him, <U+017F>o full of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that <hi>Damon</hi> could not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble, but did put her<U+017F>o out of hopes, as <U+017F>he did not only <U+017F>tifle her love to him, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a mo<U+017F>t deadly hatred in its room: Could <U+017F>he have proved what <U+017F>he knew of our affection, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he would have done it, in accu<U+017F>ing him unto <hi>Leontidas;</hi> but our happine<U+017F>s was, that what familiarity <U+017F>oever was betwixt us, I never <U+017F>poke the lea<U+017F>t thing of it before her; but, <U+017F>ince that I found her <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle and crafty, as I did believe, if <U+017F>he could not have made any proofes, yet <U+017F>he would notwith<U+017F>tanding inform; but that which re<U+017F>trained her, as I thought, was her Letter which <U+017F>he writ unto <hi>Damon,</hi> by which <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas</hi> might have <U+017F>een her to be but a bad woman; yet, this con<U+017F>ideration was nothing, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he did <U+017F>eem to love <hi>Damon,</hi> only to in<U+017F>muate her <U+017F>elfe into the more credit: And doubtle<U+017F>s <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife had believed her, having entertained <U+017F>o good an opinion of her, as they thought her to be one of the grave<U+017F>t and wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Matrous in all <hi>Gaul.</hi> But as I was mi<U+017F>taken in my affection to her, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o <hi>Damon</hi> was much to blame; for, had he <U+017F>hewed me the Letter which <hi>Leriana</hi> writ unto him, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he had <U+017F>hewed me my errour, and we had not fallen into tho<U+017F>e misfortunes, in which <U+017F>ince we have lived; and the rea<U+017F>on, as I think, why he did not, was, becau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>harp an<U+017F>wer which he returned, fearing, if I <U+017F>aw it, I <U+017F>hould be angry with him. But however, he kept it <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret as I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Leriana</hi> plotting revenge upon this Cavalier, <U+017F>he conceived no way would bring it about, but <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions as I <U+017F>hould give her, thinking, that keeping in familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with me, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions would pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves, which would fit her purpo<U+017F>e; and in order to that, <U+017F>he courted me, and followed me as clo<U+017F>e as my own <U+017F>hadow. She having a mo<U+017F>t notable piercing wit, which would dive into the very thoughts of per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>he found, that <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> did love me; I <U+017F>ay, this <U+017F>ame <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee here with me. It is requi<U+017F>ite (<U+017F>age Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es) that I acquaint you with his condition, as for his per<U+017F>on, you <U+017F>ee what it is; Be plea<U+017F>ed to know therefore, that his Father following mine in all his martiall expeditions, they were both killed the <U+017F>ame day <hi>Thierres</hi> dyed: And this <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> being brought up of a child in my Fathers hou<U+017F>e; he conceived <U+017F>uch affection to me, as the difference of our qualities could not re<U+017F>train him from looking upon me otherwi<U+017F>e then he ought; and perhaps I might ignorantly be the cau<U+017F>e of it, for the great inequality betwixt us, made me receive his <U+017F>ervices, not as a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as a dome<U+017F>tick. But Love, who is blinde, did make him entertain <U+017F>uch thoughts, as were far from any grounds of rea<U+017F>on: yet <hi>Leriana,</hi> who was far more <U+017F>ubtle then I, having ca<U+017F>t her eyes upon him, and found out his intentions, <U+017F>he thought him a fit <U+017F>ubject for a begining of her revenge: She knew very well, that among<U+017F>t all the bitters of Love, there is none <U+017F>o <U+017F>harp as that of jealou<U+017F>ie, nor <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily infu<U+017F>ed into a <U+017F>oule that loves well; <U+017F>he began therefore to in<U+017F>inuate her <U+017F>elfe into familiarity with him, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will unto him, offering him all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that lay in her power; and briefly, did by

degrees get him acce<U+017F>s unto me, and opportunities to <U+017F>peak with me: But finding, that his mode<U+017F>ty would not permit him to declare his affection unto me, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to infu<U+017F>e more courage into him: And in order to that, one day when they were together, after <U+017F>ome far-off di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, to be a prologue unto the main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he told him, that <U+017F>he and I had often wondered, he <U+017F>hould never make choice of any Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, I could not imagine the cau<U+017F>e; that it could not be for want of will, for his age would not permit that; and therefore it mu<U+017F>t needs be want of courage, though if he did <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elfe out, he might get the favour of the faire<U+017F>t Lady in all the Court; and therefore that I could <U+017F>ee nothing but that, or that he thought none worthy of him. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander,</hi> who believed her, and who was touched to the very <U+017F>oul: Alas, alas, <U+017F>aid he, both my Lady and you, have but ill ob<U+017F>erved my actions, <U+017F>ince you have not found out my follies. Alas, I do love, and do love in <U+017F>uch a place, that it is better for me to <U+017F>it <U+017F>till in <U+017F>ilence, then declare it, in any hopes of obtaining. Slie <hi>Leriana</hi> knowing his meaning very well, yet <U+017F>eeming not to under<U+017F>tand him, did <U+017F>till turn and winde her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>o, as <U+017F>he got out of him the name of <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> but with <U+017F>o many excu<U+017F>es, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw it very requi<U+017F>ite to continue her de<U+017F>igne, in infu<U+017F>ing more courage into him; and therefore <U+017F>he told him, That <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw no <U+017F>uch inequality betwixt me and him, but that he might very well go on; that though Fortune did not favour him with any great E<U+017F>tate, nor could derive his Pedigree from any great Ance<U+017F>tours; yet, his vertues did <U+017F>upply tho<U+017F>e defects, and made him equall to me in merit. All this <U+017F>he told him, to make him the more confident of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, and much more which <U+017F>he invented; as, That <U+017F>he knew by my words, that I did very much e<U+017F>teem him, nay, love him, and was weary of <hi>Damon</hi> for his <U+017F>ake, and would often <U+017F>ay unto her, that <hi>Damon</hi> was changed into <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> Thus did <U+017F>he infu<U+017F>e as good a conceipt of him<U+017F>elfe as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could. Having, thus laid a foundation for her trea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he would now found how I <U+017F>tood affected; and <U+017F>ometimes naming <hi>Damon,</hi> as if by chance, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>till be harping upon <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and <U+017F>omething in his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. All this I did not under<U+017F>tand, for I had never ca<U+017F>t any eye upon him: And finding me to <U+017F>peak of him as of a per<U+017F>on indifferent, <U+017F>he had an opinion, that I would receive Letters, if they were hand<U+017F>omely given unto me. The time of the year was at hand, when it was cu<U+017F>tomary to pre<U+017F>ent New-years gifts: She conceived, that a pair of perfumed Gloves would be a hand<U+017F>ome cover for a Letter, and therefore procured one from <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and put it into the finger of a Glove, and when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her time, that the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t company was with me, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented her New-years gift unto me. By fortune, <hi>Damon</hi> was pre<U+017F>ent; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he feared, le<U+017F>t meeting with it, I <U+017F>hould not make it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one, <U+017F>he told me, that there was a <U+017F>eam unripped, and <U+017F>he would mend it: Upon this, <U+017F>he took that wherein the Letter was, leaving the other in the hands of tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>mell at it. But I finding the Paper in the finger, I asked what it was? To which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, that it was the <U+017F>eam which rippeed when I tryed them. I, who did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand this piece of <U+017F>ubtlety, replyed, that it could not be <U+017F>o. She, with incredible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe had ripped it, and that I could not have it untill it was mended. I perceived, that there was <U+017F>omething which was to be di<U+017F><U+017F>embled among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much company; but I was too young and <U+017F>imple to apprehend it, or to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble: Yet <hi>Damon,</hi> who had his eyes alwaies upon us, and who knew by experience how ingenious Love makes men, he pre<U+017F>ently conceived, that there was <U+017F>ome Letter in the Gloves, which mu<U+017F>t be concealed from him, but he could not devi<U+017F>e from whom it <U+017F>hould be; as for <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander,</hi> he was out of all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, yet, now he began to have <U+017F>ome thoughts of him. For my part, though I had a de<U+017F>ire to do nothing but what was fitting; yet I had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire to know, what it was which was in this Glove, and therefore retired as <U+017F>oon as I could. When I was alone, I took out the Letter, and opening it, I found the<U+017F>e words.</p>

               <p>The flatteries of this Letter did plea<U+017F>e me, but comming from <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> I was a<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, wondring that <U+017F>uch a one as he <U+017F>hould dare to look upon me in this way: I was al<U+017F>o offended with <hi>Leriana,</hi> thinking it <U+017F>trange <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be the bringer of any <U+017F>uch Letters; and I was long in con<U+017F>ultation with my <U+017F>elfe, whether I <U+017F>hould complain of her, or take no notice of it: I re<U+017F>olved at the la<U+017F>t to tell her, that I had throwne it into the fire, and never read it; and becau<U+017F>e I would flie all occa<U+017F>ions, as well to <U+017F>top all reports, as becau<U+017F>e I would have no occa<U+017F>ion to put away <hi>Leriana,</hi> who<U+017F>e humour was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto me; and though I knew <U+017F>he was in a fault, yet my youth, and the affection I had unto her, con<U+017F>trained me to forget it, and to <U+017F>eek for excu<U+017F>es in her behalfe. A few daies after, <U+017F>he came unto me; and becau<U+017F>e I did not wear the Gloves which <U+017F>he gave me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an opinion they came from <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> as well as the Letter, <U+017F>he asked me, what I had done with them? I have given them away, <U+017F>aid I unto her, becau<U+017F>e they were not fit for my hand. And the Paper within them, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what have you done with it? I threw it into the fire, an<U+017F>wered I; was it of any importance? Did you not read it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? And I an<U+017F>wering, No: She <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>he was very glad of it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was deceived by one whom <U+017F>he tru<U+017F>ted but <U+017F>he thanked god, that the fire had purged away the fault.</p>
               <p>What was it, (<U+017F>aid I unto her)? You <U+017F>hall never know from me, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that <U+017F>ince I did know what it was, which was within this houre, I was extreamly afraid you <U+017F>hould have read it, and came now purpo<U+017F>ely to hinder you. This crafty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did think, that I had read it; but finding me not <U+017F>o well di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, <U+017F>he thought it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to imprint a good opinion of her <U+017F>elfe in me, and to di<U+017F>semble as well as I. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew I loved <hi>Demon,</hi> <U+017F>he accu<U+017F>ed me with it, and condemned it; thinking that <U+017F>he could not build her de<U+017F>ignes upon a better foundation, then the ruines of that affection which I bare unto this Knight; and therefore <U+017F>he turned her wits wholly to ruine it: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew very well, that I had no ill opinion of my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that <hi>Damon's</hi> affection unto me, was the cau<U+017F>e of mine unto him; her de<U+017F>igne was therefore, to put me into <U+017F>ome doubts of him, conceiving there was no better way then jealou<U+017F>ie, and that a generous <U+017F>pirit does more re<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>dain, then any other offence: And though jealou<U+017F>ie may proceed from <U+017F>everall cau<U+017F>es, yet the principall is, when a Lover <U+017F>ees the party Loved, loves another, taking this new affection for an argument of di<U+017F>dain, and conceiving, that as <U+017F>he whom he loved did merit all his love, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o he ought to have all hers; in which <U+017F>he failing, he doth attribute it unto di<U+017F>dain.</p>
               <p>But when <U+017F>he went about to execute her de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>he found it to be a piece of no <U+017F>mall difficulty, <U+017F>ince this Cavalier did not look upon any woman but my <U+017F>elfe; be<U+017F>ides, it was requi<U+017F>ite, that <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ome power over her, of whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make me jealous, to the end, <U+017F>he might the better mould her unto her ends; moreover, that <U+017F>uch a one be <U+017F>ecret, and fair, and of <U+017F>uch a quality, as might <U+017F>eem probable <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erved to be loved; it was very hard for her to finde all the<U+017F>e qualifications in one per<U+017F>on: But <U+017F>he, who<U+017F>e acute wit never found any thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, after many a daies que<U+017F>t, in vain; at la<U+017F>t, re<U+017F>olved upon a Niece, whom <U+017F>he brought up, and to <U+017F>upply all defects by her <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety. This was a young wench, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Ormanthe</hi> young, both in age and <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who indeed was owner of a fair face, but <U+017F>o <U+017F>hallow in all attracts of Love, as very few deemed her fair; yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, <hi>Leriana</hi> had an opinion, that <U+017F>he could <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truct her, that where nature was defective, her art would <U+017F>upply. In order to this, <U+017F>he took <hi>Ormanthe</hi> to task, chid her for the little care <U+017F>he had of her <U+017F>elfe, told her, <U+017F>he might be a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>ee all her Companions courted and loved, who were much le<U+017F><U+017F>e fair then <U+017F>he was, and that <U+017F>he could not oblige the meane<U+017F>t Cavalier to love her; <U+017F>he told her, all this proceeded from her carele<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e and want of wit, and that for her part if <U+017F>he did not re<U+017F>olve upon better cour<U+017F>es, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>end her home to her Mother; for, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed any longer in the Court, <U+017F>he would arrive at no other title, but an old Maid. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> fearing that her Mother would give her but coor<U+017F>e treatment, if <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>end her home, <U+017F>he fell down upon her knees, with tears in her eyes, and be<U+017F>eeched her to pardon all her faults, and promi<U+017F>ed, that for the time to come, <U+017F>he would wholly conform her <U+017F>elfe unto her will. <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o good a beginning, continued: <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, all the<U+017F>e tears and prote<U+017F>tations will be in vain, if I do not <U+017F>ee you change your behaviour and way of living; all your Companions are courted, and you are the only one that is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53526:148"/>
not. Do you think it is not a great griefe unto me, to <U+017F>ee all the young Beauties in the Court waited upon, and when they walk, every one hath her Gallant to lead her, nay, <U+017F>ome two or three, and you the only one that none looks upon? This, believe it, is a great di<U+017F>grace unto you. Tho<U+017F>e who look you in the face, and finde it fairer then mo<U+017F>t of your Companions, mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, that if you be not courted, it mu<U+017F>t be, becau<U+017F>e you are poor, or that there is <U+017F>ome fault, either in your Race, or in your Per<U+017F>on: And truly, all this proceeds from your carele<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and from your rude and ru<U+017F>tick nature, which makes every one to <U+017F>hun you. And indeed, I know that <hi>Damon</hi> has a good minde to love you; I know it, becau<U+017F>e he has got <U+017F>ome of his friends to tell me as much, and yet he can never finde a way how to approach you, you are <U+017F>o inacce<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and becau<U+017F>e your retired humour will never give him an opportunity; he is the greate<U+017F>t Gallant in all the Court, and this would be a great honour unto you. Should this good fortune pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elfe unto any one of your Companions, Oh! how welcome it would be? What indu<U+017F>try and artifice would they u<U+017F>e to bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e? <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> let me tell you this once for all, if I do keep you here in Court any longer, I <U+017F>hall expect, and de<U+017F>ire you <U+017F>hall give, all occa<U+017F>ions unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to love you, and do not fear, to let others <U+017F>ee the favours you do him; for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne being to marry you, he will not think them di<U+017F>advantageous to him. This was the lecture which <hi>Leriana</hi> read unto this young Wench: And truly, it was <U+017F>eed not <U+017F>owed in barren ground, but produced plentifull effects. <hi>Ormanthe</hi> being naturally of a free and affable humour, without any di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and being put forward by <hi>Leriana's</hi> in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <U+017F>he did ever <U+017F>ince that day apply her <U+017F>elfe with <U+017F>o many carra<U+017F><U+017F>es unto <hi>Damon,</hi> that he and all that <U+017F>aw it did wonder: The noi<U+017F>e of it went <U+017F>o far, as I came to hear of it, and that by the artifice of <hi>Leriana,</hi> who by the means of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> cau<U+017F>ed it to be <U+017F>poken of in a place, where I might come to know of it; and to the end I <U+017F>hould think there was no jugling in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> never <U+017F>poke of it, but cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome of his friends. However, I could not believe, <hi>Damon</hi> could love this fooli<U+017F>h Wench better then me; <U+017F>ince me thought, her beauty did not equall mine, as my Gla<U+017F>s a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me: Moreover, when I con<U+017F>idered my extraction and <hi>Ormanthe's,</hi> I could not imagine, he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his choice, as to <U+017F>leight me for <U+017F>uch a one; which this crafty <hi>Leriana</hi> knowing very well, <U+017F>he was put upon a greater piece of artifice. There was an old woman, Aunt unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> who had lived all her life in much honour and reputation: <hi>Leriana</hi> did contrive the matter <U+017F>o, as this good old woman was acquainted with the carra<U+017F><U+017F>es, which <hi>Ormanthes</hi> u<U+017F>ed unto <hi>Damon,</hi> which were <U+017F>uch, as when <U+017F>he heard of them, <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>t untill <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for <hi>Leriana;</hi> and <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for her, to meet her in my Chamber, purpo<U+017F>ely that I might <U+017F>ee when <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke unto her. Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was long, and the anger that I ob<U+017F>erved in them, made me de<U+017F>irous to know (when this good old woman was gone) what the matter was. She <U+017F>eemed very unwilling to tell me, and <U+017F>tood a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an an<U+017F>wer: At the la<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e I was very urgent with her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me. See, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he called me) how <U+017F>ubtle <hi>Damon</hi> is; but yet, not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle as my <U+017F>elfe: he thought, that by his feigning love to you I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ee the affection which he bears unto <hi>Ormanthe:</hi> This <U+017F>ubtlety had been good, had it been unto any other but my Niece; but, this doth <U+017F>o neerly concern me, that I mu<U+017F>t needs look neerly unto it; and he hath carried the matter <U+017F>o far beyond all prudence, as he mu<U+017F>t needs be blind that doth not <U+017F>ee it. I think, that I have been told of it by above a hundred per<U+017F>ons, and this good old woman came hither purpo<U+017F>ely to tell me of it; it is growne the common talk, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>honourable to my Niece, as I were to blame if I did <U+017F>uffer it, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is under my charge. I have chid <hi>Ormanthe</hi> many times for it, but I think he hath bewitched her: For my part, I know not which way <U+017F>he takes him; for, though <U+017F>he be my Niece, yet, I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, there is not any one more unlikely to make one in love with her, then <U+017F>he. Oh! how the<U+017F>e words went to my heart? I retired into my Clo<U+017F>et, whither this crafty woman followed me, being too well experienced in <U+017F>uch accidents, to be ignorant of the operation the<U+017F>e words had in me. And becau<U+017F>e I did put my whole confidence in her when we were alone, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to re<U+017F>train my tears, or conceal from her my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which I had <U+017F>o long hid. Oh! what extream contentment <hi>Leriana</hi> received by this declaration: And though her whole de<U+017F>igne was only to divert me from the love of <hi>Damon;</hi> yet, <U+017F>he knew it was not yet time to <U+017F>trike, but mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t weaken it a little more, before <U+017F>he did down-right attempt it: And in order to that, <U+017F>he would needs make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <U+017F>he was very much a friend unto that Cavalier, purpo<U+017F>ely, becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould not mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t her; and therefore <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke thus unto me: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that you
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53526:149"/>
have ea<U+017F>ed my heart; yet I am <U+017F>orry, I <U+017F>hould buy my ea<U+017F>e at the expence of your <U+017F>orrowes. Had I thought that <hi>Damon</hi> had loved you, I <U+017F>hould never have feared his loving my Niece; he is a man of better judgment, then to change you for any other, it is only but <U+017F>ome fla<U+017F>h of youth, which makes him go a little a<U+017F>tray from you, he will return again, I warrant you; and therefore let not this withdraw your affection from him: However, I make no doubt, but this act does much afflict you, and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth you as much, as if it were <U+017F>ome grand injury; and the rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e Love is a child, and is offended at a trifle. But, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, let it not trouble you any more; if you will but u<U+017F>e a remedy which I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>cribe, you <U+017F>hall both be pre<U+017F>ently cured, I will warrant you. Do you not know, that an over great light doth dazle? and that too great a noi<U+017F>e doth deaf? So perhaps the beams of your affection, <U+017F>hining too freely upon him, hath le<U+017F><U+017F>ened his love; for my part, I am apt to believe it <U+017F>o: I know, young <U+017F>pirits are ordinarily <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>uch things, and being too well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of what they enjoy, they grow carele<U+017F><U+017F>e, and kick at abundance, which does beget in them new de<U+017F>ires. But again<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as again<U+017F>t many others, contraries mu<U+017F>t be applied. I am confident, that if you did but <U+017F>eem a little to withdraw from him, he will pre<U+017F>ently return to his duty, and cry you mercy for his fault. You may believe, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I do love you, becau<U+017F>e I u<U+017F>e this language unto you; and I do give you the <U+017F>ame coun<U+017F>ell, as, if it were my ca<U+017F>e, I would take my <U+017F>elfe. In conclu<U+017F>ion, this cunning Piece of <U+017F>ubtlety <U+017F>o di<U+017F><U+017F>embled the matter, as, with many thanks, I promi<U+017F>ed to follow her coun<U+017F>ell. It hapned, that <hi>Damon</hi> finding me <U+017F>omething faint towards him, and laying the blame upon the carra<U+017F><U+017F>es which <hi>Ormanthe</hi> u<U+017F>ed towards him, did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees withdraw from her, and <U+017F>hunned her as much, as if he had been the Woman, and <U+017F>he the Man. <hi>Leriana</hi> took notice of it as well as I; and not to let <U+017F>lip any good occa<U+017F>ion, one day, when we were by our <U+017F>elves in my Clo<U+017F>et, <U+017F>he asked me, whether her coun<U+017F>ell was not good? and whether I would not believe her another time? And I an<U+017F>wering, Yes: She continued; Then, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) we-mu<U+017F>t do as good Phy<U+017F>icians u<U+017F>e to do, who having prepared the humours by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>leight medicines, do afterwards draw them quite away by remedies more <U+017F>trong. I will acquaint you with an art, which I have <U+017F>een much u<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t Lovers. There is nothing which a Lover does more <U+017F>harply re<U+017F>ent, then paugs of jealou<U+017F>ie, nor which awakens him more, nor will <U+017F>ooner make him return to his duty: If <hi>Damon</hi> were a little touched with it, you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>oon he would return, how he would ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe at your feet, and acknowledge his offence. I could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh when I heard the<U+017F>e words, thinking, that I was not able to obtain <U+017F>o much power over my <U+017F>elfe; yet con<U+017F>idering, what good effects her fir<U+017F>t coun<U+017F>ell produced, I re<U+017F>olved to believe her in this: But, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) of whom <U+017F>hall we make u<U+017F>e of for this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e? She dur<U+017F>t not propound <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> unto me, becau<U+017F>e of the former pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, but <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>ire it <U+017F>hould proceed from me, and therefore <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me thus: This que<U+017F>tion, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, is very pertinently asked, and it mu<U+017F>t be advi<U+017F>edly thought upon; for, he mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch a one, as will not hurt your reputation, and therefore I do conclude, he mu<U+017F>t be one, of whom you may ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e, and one, <U+017F>o far inferiour to you, as you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw when you plea<U+017F>e, and he not dare to be offended, or that every one <U+017F>hould believe you did but fool him. Then looking upon the ground, and <U+017F>cratching her head, as if <U+017F>he were much puzled to finde out one, upon a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>he looked upon me, and <U+017F>aid; Why <U+017F>hould we look <U+017F>o long for one that is <U+017F>o neer? who better then <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> you may do what you plea<U+017F>e with him, and he dare not be offended; be<U+017F>ides, he is di<U+017F>creet, and has no <U+017F>mall affection unto you already; <U+017F>o as I cannot imagine one more fit for <U+017F>uch a purpo<U+017F>e then he. When <U+017F>he named <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> I remembered the <U+017F>ormer pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and did think, that <U+017F>he made choice of him <U+017F>ooner then any other, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he loved him; but al<U+017F>o I knew, that his quality and di<U+017F>cretion was <U+017F>uch, as were very <U+017F>uitable for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him for: And though my high <U+017F>pirit did forbid me to ca<U+017F>t my eyes upon one of <U+017F>o mean a rank; yet, my affection unto <hi>Damon,</hi> and my de<U+017F>ire to recall him, did make me conde<U+017F>cend unto <hi>Leriana's</hi> coun<U+017F>ell: And therefore I began to look with a more favourable a<U+017F>pect upon <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and to talk with him; but it was with much <U+017F>hame, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any <U+017F>aw me. <hi>Damon,</hi> who<U+017F>e affection was extream, did pre<U+017F>ently perceive this alceration. And <hi>Leriana</hi> told <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> that his di<U+017F>creet and humble carriage unto me, had wrought <U+017F>uch good effects, as that I loved him almo<U+017F>t as well as he loved me. The lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of a favour from me, <U+017F>eemed to be great and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantiall; and though I did behave my <U+017F>elfe to him in a way of indifferency, yet, the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllable I <U+017F>poke, was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <U+017F>entence; and this made him to brisk up him<U+017F>elfe, and look bigger then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53526:149"/>
and all by the fal<U+017F>e hopes which this <U+017F>ubtle woman had infu<U+017F>ed into him: So as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> <U+017F>oon ob<U+017F>erved all this; &amp; calling to minde the Letter which he <U+017F>aw me receive in a pair of Gloves, and from thence drawing many di<U+017F>advantageous couclu<U+017F>ions, both again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe and me, he did believe, that through the <U+017F>olicitations of <hi>Leriana,</hi> I had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the affection of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and rejected him. After he had patiently endured thus a while, in hopes of <U+017F>ome change, but finding none, he being not able to endure it any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, re<U+017F>olved to upbraid me with it; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leriana</hi> was continually with me, he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly finde any opportunity of <U+017F>peech with me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in the Chamber of <hi>Leontidas:</hi> And therefore, as I was ri<U+017F>ing from the Table, and far off this woman, he <U+017F>eeing that he could have no better occa<U+017F>ion, did clo<U+017F>e with it, and <U+017F>aid unto me: Is all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e you have a minde to kill me, or becau<U+017F>e you would try, how a per<U+017F>on that loves infinitely can endure rigour? I an<U+017F>wered him faintly, Your death does concern me no more, then my rigours concern you. He would have replyed, but <hi>Leriana</hi> came to us, and by her pre<U+017F>ence, con<U+017F>trained <hi>Damon</hi> to be <U+017F>ilent; and be<U+017F>ides, I turned towards her, and did not give him the lea<U+017F>ure. This crafty woman looking upon me, did make a <U+017F>igne, that this was an effect of her advice, and afterwards whi<U+017F>pering in my ear; This <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is a very good beginning, continue your <U+017F>leighting him, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee a <U+017F>trange operation. Ah, mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle woman! <U+017F>he had good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, a <U+017F>trange operation; for it did operate <U+017F>o, as made me as mi<U+017F>erable a woman as ever was. So, <U+017F>age Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I did continue <U+017F>leighting him, and would not daigne <U+017F>o much, as to turn towards this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who went out of the hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much out of him<U+017F>elfe, as he was ready to <U+017F>heath his Sword in his own brea<U+017F>t; and I believe, had not his intention of killing <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained him, he had executed this <U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olution again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf: And that which hindred him from falling pre<U+017F>ently upon <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> was his fear of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing me, knowing that it would be a great wound unto my reputation, if, upon that account, he <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ault him; and therefore, when the <U+017F>ury of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was a little cooled, he went on, and <U+017F>tudied for <U+017F>ome other pretence of quarrell. When he met <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her cu<U+017F>tome, came, and took him about the neck he was in no very good humour, did pu<U+017F>h her a little back, and told her, That he wondred <U+017F>he was not afraid of that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, which all people would give upon <U+017F>uch actions. Whom <U+017F>hould I fear, or care for, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <U+017F>o I be but plea<U+017F>ing and welcome unto you? Were it of no other, <U+017F>aid <hi>Damon,</hi> yet you ought to <U+017F>tand in fear of <hi>Leriana.</hi> Of <hi>Leriana</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and laughed)? <hi>Damon,</hi> you are deceived, for I am <U+017F>ure, that I cannot plea<U+017F>e her better, then to carra<U+017F><U+017F>e and make much of you. This Cavalier knowing, that <hi>Leriana</hi> wi<U+017F>hed him ill and hearing the<U+017F>e words, did pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect <U+017F>ome trea<U+017F>on; which to prevent, and taking <hi>Ormanthe</hi> a<U+017F>ide, he de<U+017F>ired her to tell him, how <U+017F>he knew, that <hi>Leriana</hi> would be plea<U+017F>ed with her for this? <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who was far from a deep Polititian, and who thought, to excu<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elfe, by laying the fault upon her Aunt, <U+017F>he told him all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Leriana,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <U+017F>he had laid upon her <U+017F>o to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damon,</hi> who was very wi<U+017F>e, after he had a little thought upon it, did plainly <U+017F>ee, that the change in my affection did proceed from an opinion, that he loved this Wench; and <U+017F>eeming to take no notice of it, he left her, with a re<U+017F>olution to tell me, let <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>ay what <U+017F>he would. Fortune, it <U+017F>eemed, favoured him with a fit opportunity; for the <U+017F>ame day, <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond</hi> intended to hunt; and becau<U+017F>e the Queen was wont to accompany him, I, with the re<U+017F>t of my Companions, took hor<U+017F>e, and waited upon her. The Stag being rou<U+017F>ed, and all the Doggs following full cry after him, all the Company full <U+017F>peed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Cha<U+017F>e. Now began all the Hunters to part; tho<U+017F>e who had the flighte<U+017F>t Hor<U+017F>e, left the re<U+017F>t behinde them. <hi>Damon,</hi> who was well mounted, kept his eye <U+017F>till upon me, and <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>eparated from all the Company, he took into a way which he thought I would pa<U+017F><U+017F>e; and feigning that his Hor<U+017F>e had fallen upon him, he <U+017F>eemed as if he had hurt his leg; and to procure the more beliefe of it, he dirtyed his head and <U+017F>houlder on the one <U+017F>ide and his Hor<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, giving his Man charge to keep at a di<U+017F>tance. When I was pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing the way, he cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and taking my Hor<U+017F>e by the Bridle, he <U+017F>tayed him; at which I was much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, fearing, that his love had tran<U+017F>ported him beyond his di<U+017F>cretion: but fearing, that if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem too fearfull, he would grow more bold; I made a vertue of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and <U+017F>poke to him in a confident tone, <U+017F>aying: What do you mean, <hi>Damon?</hi> how dare you be <U+017F>o bold as to interrupt me in my way? Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, which hath no Law, hath con<U+017F>trained me to commit the fault: if, after you have heard me, you <U+017F>hall deem it worthy of puni<U+017F>hment, I will promi<U+017F>e you to receive it, or any thing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53526:150"/>
that <U+017F>hall give you <U+017F>atisfaction. Then lifting his eyes up to heaven: Oh ye gods, (<U+017F>aid he) who hear and <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ecrets of all di<U+017F><U+017F>embling hearts, be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es unto what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto this fair One, and if I do not <U+017F>ay truth, you are not ju<U+017F>t, if you do not puni<U+017F>h me before her fair face. Then turning towards me; I will not at this time, fair <hi>Mandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) either excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe, or accu<U+017F>e you, for the choice you are plea<U+017F>ed to make of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> before me, and your forgetting <U+017F>o many vowes and oaths which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the gods to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e: But I mu<U+017F>t needs complain again<U+017F>t my fortune, which will not let me avoid that mi<U+017F>ery, which I do fore<U+017F>ee. As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Leriana</hi> came to you, me thought <U+017F>ome <hi>Daemon</hi> foretold me, of the harm which <U+017F>he would do me; you know, how oft we re<U+017F>olved never to confide in her; but, my bad de<U+017F>tinies, more <U+017F>trong then all our re<U+017F>olutions, hath made you change your minde, and would needs have you to love her: If you do but finde any contentment in it, though I endure the mo<U+017F>t cruell torments that ever <U+017F>oul <U+017F>uffered; I <U+017F>hall thank the gods, and pray them to continue it. But, it being a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to leave you in any doubt of my fidelity; and though I know it will be in vain, and that you will not credit it; yet, I mu<U+017F>t needs tell you, how maliciou<U+017F>ly and craftily <U+017F>he hath ruined all my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Then he told me, how <hi>Leriana</hi> loved him, how <U+017F>he had carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, how he rejected her, and how deadly <U+017F>he did hate him for this refu<U+017F>all; and to verifie what he told me, he <U+017F>hewed me the Letters which <U+017F>he had written unto him, and acquainted me with the coun<U+017F>ell and in<U+017F>tructions <U+017F>he gave <hi>Orman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> to apply her <U+017F>elfe unto him, only to make me believe, he was in love with her; and acquainted me, how he came to the knowledge of all this, and how this malicious woman did not value the honour of her Niece, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he could thereby ruine me, and make you love <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> which <U+017F>he knew <U+017F>he could never do, but by ravi<U+017F>hing from me the honour and happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your favour. But Oh ye gods! is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ever bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e? can I <U+017F>o much as ever doubt it, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw the Letter in the Gloves, and <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o kinde unto him, that is <U+017F>o much unworthy of you? But, what better evidence then your own words, can I have to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me, that I am mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable, that I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that I am for ever lo<U+017F>t?</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> <U+017F>ince it is my bad fortune to be a cau<U+017F>e, that the generous <U+017F>pirit which I ever knew to be in you, is not only <U+017F>tained with Incon<U+017F>tancy, but with a choice that is ba<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>honourable; I am re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>urvive your affection, but will make it appear, that I have love enough to wa<U+017F>h away your offence with my blood. Imagine, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> how I was amazed at this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>truck with fear, as I could not an<U+017F>wer him, or <U+017F>peak one word of a long time. And when I began, with intention to give him all the <U+017F>atisfaction he could de<U+017F>ire, I <U+017F>aw the Cha<U+017F>e comming upon us, and it was <U+017F>o neer us, as, not to be <U+017F>een alone with <hi>Damon,</hi> I was con<U+017F>trained to part from him, and had not time to <U+017F>ay any more but this: Truth <U+017F>hall alwaies prevail. Then <U+017F>witching my Hor<U+017F>e, I rid into the Wood, very <U+017F>orry that I could not give him a better an<U+017F>wer. I would have commanded him to follow me if I dur<U+017F>t, but I was afraid any <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee us together, and therefore referred it untill a better occa<U+017F>ion. Now ob<U+017F>erve, I be<U+017F>eech you, how the gods does mock at mortall prudence; I made choice of the next morning, to put poor <hi>Damon</hi> out of his pain, and it was that day which brought him more torment.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you how he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away that night, it is ea<U+017F>ily imagined that he had not any good re<U+017F>t; but, as <U+017F>oon as day came, he went out of his Chamber; and it being about the houre I was u<U+017F>ed to ri<U+017F>e, he went to walk in a Gallery, out of which, he might <U+017F>ee into my Chamber, when the dore was open, intending to go in, as <U+017F>oon as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood that I was out of my bed. But, as fortune was, I awaked very late that morning, as well, becau<U+017F>e I was weary with hunting the day before, as becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>at up very late, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and mu<U+017F>ing upon the Letters which <hi>Leriana</hi> writ unto him, and he had given unto me: In which I found <U+017F>uch <U+017F>upplications and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as were mo<U+017F>t unworthy of any woman; for in the conclu<U+017F>ion of one of them, I found the<U+017F>e words: <hi>Accept, Oh deare<U+017F>t and lovely</hi> Damon, <hi>the prayers of her, that wholly gives her <U+017F>elfe unto you, upon no other condition, but only to be yours; and this, if not out of Love, yet, I be<U+017F>eech you, out of Pitty.</hi> Truly I was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it, and I vexed <U+017F>o, that I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o extreamly deceived, as I could not clo<U+017F>e my eyes a long time after I was in bed. But whil<U+017F>t <hi>Damon,</hi> as I told you, was walking in this Gallery, <hi>Leriana,</hi> who <U+017F>aw him there, would try, whether a Lover could be put to death by di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; for, having found <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o at the <U+017F>ame time, <U+017F>he carried him unto a window, ju<U+017F>t under that on which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> leaned <U+017F>ometimes, when he was weary with walking; and having ob<U+017F>erved, that he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53526:150"/>
was there at that time, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke thus unto <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> in a voice loud enough, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely to be heard: And to the end you may know, dear Brother, that <hi>Mandonthe</hi> does really love you, and that <U+017F>he does but laugh at all tho<U+017F>e, who think <U+017F>he loves them, <U+017F>he commanded me ye<U+017F>terday, when <U+017F>he came from Hunting, to give you this Ring, which <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed to be made purpo<U+017F>ely for you: She de<U+017F>ires you to love her, and to wear it as a <U+017F>ymbol of your affection; <U+017F>he hath another, which <U+017F>he wears her <U+017F>elfe, ju<U+017F>t like it, which <U+017F>he will alwaies wear, as an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that her will <U+017F>hall never differ from yours, more then the Ring <U+017F>he <U+017F>ends you differs from hers. Oh heavens! what trea<U+017F>on is this? Is it po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible <U+017F>uch villany <U+017F>hould be invented by any human <U+017F>pirit? For the truth is, I had a Ring ju<U+017F>t like that which <U+017F>he gave him, and had worn it long; and this wicked Devill got an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to be <U+017F>ecretly counterfeited, purpo<U+017F>ely for this end. <hi>Damon,</hi> who, as I told you, leaned upon the window, and hearing her voice, did pre<U+017F>ently know it, and leaning his head further out of the window, to hearken more attentively, he heard all the<U+017F>e words that I have told you: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did put her arme out of the window, purpo<U+017F>ely that <hi>Damon</hi> might <U+017F>ee the Ring, he remembered very well, that he had <U+017F>een me have <U+017F>uch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whil<U+017F>t he was thus leaning him<U+017F>elfe out of the window, he heard <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> an<U+017F>wer her: I <U+017F>wear by all the gods (<U+017F>aid he) that this Ring is <U+017F>o beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions welcome unto me, as I do wi<U+017F>h <hi>Mandonthe</hi> may never love me, if I do not wear it to my grave, as a te<U+017F>timony, that I am eternally hers, and that it is infinitely dearer unto me, then my own heart. Upon this, he took it, and after many ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, he put it upon his finger.</p>
               <p>Whether or no <hi>Damon</hi> was tran<U+017F>ported, and whether he had not rea<U+017F>on to tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>e the limits of duty, I leave you to judge, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana;</hi> and yet, he had <U+017F>o much power over him<U+017F>elfe in his anger, as he neither did nor <U+017F>aid any thing, which could give any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, le<U+017F>t if any knew it, he might be hindered in the execution of his de<U+017F>igne. At the <U+017F>ame time, the Queen went into the Temple, to be pre<U+017F>ent at the <U+017F>acrifices which were offered almo<U+017F>t every morning; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lcontidas's</hi> Wife never left her, I went al<U+017F>o, as the re<U+017F>t of the Court Ladies did; of which, <hi>Damon</hi> not being adverti<U+017F>ed untill we were all in our Coaches, he took Hor<U+017F>e, and overtook us, as we were entring into the Temple. And <U+017F>ee how unfortunate we were, I was fully re<U+017F>olved to admit of all his excu<U+017F>es, and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him that I did love him, what demon<U+017F>trations <U+017F>oever I had given to the contrary; and to make good my words, I would have broke off all friend<U+017F>hip with <hi>Leriana,</hi> and all familiarity with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and <U+017F>ought out for opportunity to tell <hi>Damon</hi> as much. But he, being abu<U+017F>ed by the trea<U+017F>on of fal<U+017F>e <hi>Leriana,</hi> when he <U+017F>aw me, he looked with <U+017F>uch an angry brow, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>leighted me, as I became offended with him, not knowing or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining what cau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>o to do; yet, pre<U+017F>ently after, remembring how I had made him jealous, I did excu<U+017F>e him. We all went into the Temple, and the <U+017F>acrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, during which, I ob<U+017F>erved, that he looked upon me very often, but, with <U+017F>uch angry eyes, and brow beating frownes, as plainly <U+017F>poke him to be very much tran<U+017F>ported. But hear, I be<U+017F>eech you, into what an exta<U+017F>ie this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did hurry him: When the <U+017F>acrifice was offered, and every one in the mid<U+017F>t of their zeal and devotion upon their knees, he ro<U+017F>e up, and with a loud voice uttered the<U+017F>e words: Oh great god, who art adored in this <U+017F>acred place, by all this devout a<U+017F><U+017F>embly; if thou bee<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, why do<U+017F>t thou not puni<U+017F>h a <U+017F>oul, that is the mo<U+017F>t perfidious, and mo<U+017F>t cruell, in all the world? I demand ju<U+017F>tice of thee in her pre<U+017F>ence, to the end, that if <U+017F>he have any thing to alledge in her defence, <U+017F>he may: but, if <U+017F>he cannot, and thou not puni<U+017F>h her, I will <U+017F>ay, thou art either unju<U+017F>t, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant.</p>
               <p>You may imagine, wi<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, in what a ca<U+017F>e I was in, and how fearfull I was, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay more, and make it known, that it was I of whom he <U+017F>poke. All the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly turned their eyes towards him, as well, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>poke with a voice full of terrour, as becau<U+017F>e of his unaccu<U+017F>tomed way of doing it. But he, after this, <U+017F>aid no more, only kneeled down upon his knees, and <U+017F>eemed very zealous at his devotion. This moved many unto various cen<U+017F>ures; and it was well for me, that I had a Hood over my face, which kept it from being <U+017F>een; for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, my very blu<U+017F>hes would have betrayed me, and told all the congregation, that it was I he meant, His friends and kin<U+017F>men thought this prayer to be very un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable, and as <U+017F>oon as all divine <U+017F>ervice was done, they <U+017F>ought for him, to tell him their opinions; but, they all mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed of their aimes, for he thru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe into the croud, and <U+017F>lipt away to his lodging; where, after he had <U+017F>et all his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e in order, he writ a Letter unto me, and put it into his pocket; then writ the<U+017F>e words unto <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander.</hi>

               <p>He gave command unto a young man, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Halladine,</hi> who <U+017F>erved him, and whom he loved very well, both for his affection and ingenuity, that he <U+017F>hould bring him a Hor<U+017F>e to the out-<U+017F>ide of the Town-walls, and another for him<U+017F>elfe, and this in all ha<U+017F>te, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, as none <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee <hi>Halladine</hi> did as he was commanded. And when they were thus both out of the Town, <hi>Damon</hi> left the high-way, and chu<U+017F>ing out a place fit for his purpo<U+017F>e, and out of the common pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, he acquainted <hi>Halladine</hi> with his intention, gave him his in<U+017F>tructions and the Letter which he writ unto <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> The young man, de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>erve his Ma<U+017F>ter according to his commands, found out <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and delivered his me<U+017F><U+017F>age <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omely, as none took any notice of it. But, why <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>pend any more time upon this <U+017F>ubject? <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> went, they fought, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was Conquerour, and left <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> bleeding upon the place, with three dangerous wounds in his body: 'Tis true, <hi>Damon</hi> was but in little better condition; but he had <U+017F>trength enough to take the Ring, which <hi>Leriana</hi> gave to <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> off his finger, whil<U+017F>t he was in a <U+017F>ound; and getting upon his hor<U+017F>e, he rid away, commanding <hi>Halladine</hi> to follow him.</p>
               <p>As for my part, I had a great de<U+017F>ire to give this Cavalier all contentment, and looked about for him with as <U+017F>earching eyes as any in the company, wondring I could not <U+017F>ee him. After dinner and not dreaming of this mi<U+017F>chance which hapned, as I and one of my Companions was walking in the Garden, I <U+017F>aw <hi>Halladine</hi> comming, who addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe unto me, asked, if <hi>Leriana</hi> was not here lately? And cau<U+017F>ing her to be called, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto her in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leriana,</hi> My Ma<U+017F>ter knowing how welcome the newes I bring would be unto you, hath commanded me to tell it unto you, not for any affection that is betwixt you, but becau<U+017F>e knowes <hi>Mandonthe</hi> loves you. Then he related the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and afterwards continued on: When he was got on Hor<U+017F>eback again, <U+017F>aid he, and when I <U+017F>aw him ride into places lea<U+017F>t frequented, I wondred; for he was much wounded, and I could not chu<U+017F>e but cell him, that I thought it more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <U+017F>eek out a good Chirurgion, to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e his wounds. He an<U+017F>wered me, we <U+017F>hall finde one pre<U+017F>ently <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> never fear it. I thought he had <U+017F>aid true, and believed him, following him <U+017F>till, with abundance of pitty, for he had lo<U+017F>t a great abundance of blood. At la<U+017F>t, he came to the banks of the River <hi>Garrone,</hi> and to a place where there was <U+017F>uch a Precipice, as was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to look down. Being come unto this place, he would light from his Hor<U+017F>e; but he was <U+017F>o weak with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>o much blood, as I mu<U+017F>t needs help him to alight. Then leaning his back again<U+017F>t the Rock, he pulled a Paper out of his pocket, and holding it in his hand, <U+017F>aid unto me: This Letter is directed unto the fair <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> be <U+017F>ure you give it unto her. Then pulling out the Ring which he took from <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander;</hi> Give her this al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid he unto me, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her from me, that death is very welcome to me, <U+017F>ince I have given a te<U+017F>timony, that I did de<U+017F>erve it better then he unto whom <U+017F>he gave it; and <U+017F>ince my <U+017F>word hath <U+017F>ent him out of the world, whom <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>o worthy of it: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her by her own merits, and the affection <U+017F>he once vowed unto me, that <U+017F>he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow it hereafter upon one, who<U+017F>e Love is di<U+017F>honourable to her, and who could no better keep it. I took the Letter and the Ring which he gave me; but <U+017F>eeing he had not <U+017F>trength enough to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain him<U+017F>elfe, and that he grew very pale, I took him under the arme, bad him be of good heart, and not thus be a murderer of him<U+017F>elfe: And pulling out my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe, I would have <U+017F>topped that wound which bled the mo<U+017F>t But he, taking it ha<U+017F>tily out of my hand: Stay, <U+017F>tay, <hi>Hallidane,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, never think of living, now I am out of <hi>Mandonthe's</hi> favour. Then holding my handkerchiefe under his wound, be received the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53526:151"/>
blood as it ran out; and when it was almo<U+017F>t full, he held it to me, and <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words: Make it appear, <hi>Halladine,</hi> upon this la<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion, that my love to thee, and my choice of thee for thy fidelity, was de<U+017F>erved: And as <U+017F>oon as I am dead, carry this Letter and this Ring unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and this handkerchiefe full of blood unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> and tell her, that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could never be <U+017F>atisfied with doing me hurt as long as I lived, I have <U+017F>ent her this blood to <U+017F>top her in<U+017F>atiable malice. Oh Sir, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) <U+017F>hall I live to <U+017F>ee you die for any woman living? Rather command me to <U+017F>heath my <U+017F>word in their hearts, and to let them know, they are not worthy to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a noble Cavalier in this manner But, <U+017F>ee the height and <U+017F>trength of his affection! though he was in <U+017F>uch a pittifull weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he could hardly <U+017F>peak; all he was able to do, was, to lean again<U+017F>t the Rock: yet, when he heard me utter the<U+017F>e words, he <U+017F>tarted up in fury, took his <U+017F>word in his hand, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had killed me, had I not <U+017F>aved my <U+017F>elfe by nimblene<U+017F><U+017F>e. And <U+017F>eeing he could not reach me: Away, away, thou wicked and di<U+017F>loyall Servant, (cryed he out) dare<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o irreverently of the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erving Woman in the whole Univer<U+017F>e? If I live, thou <U+017F>halT die by no other hand but mine. Then finding extream feeblene<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>eize upon him, he endeavoured to get near the point of the Rock: You do lo<U+017F>e, this day, Oh faire<U+017F>t <hi>Madonthe,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) him, who<U+017F>e affection is onely worthy of your merits. Then, (Oh heavens!) he leaned over the Rock to throw him<U+017F>elfe down, and was almo<U+017F>t quite gone, when I <U+017F>uddenly took hold of his Helmet; but, his weight, and the terrour of the Precipice, was more likely to pull me after him, than I to pull him out of it; and, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that fear of death made me let go my hold, to <U+017F>ave my own life. I ran to the bottom of this Precipice, fetching a great compa<U+017F><U+017F>e round about, in hopes to finde him there <U+017F>wimming down the <U+017F>tream: But alas! I could never <U+017F>ee, nor ever finde more, of the body of my poor Ma<U+017F>ter. When I had done all I could, and all in vain, I thought it my la<U+017F>t duty to fulfill his la<U+017F>t commands, and therefore I came hither. It is to you, Madam, (<U+017F>aid he) that this Letter and this Ring is due<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; and though they be <U+017F>prinkled with his blood, yet, be not afraid to take them, for, it is the mo<U+017F>t noble and generous blood that ever came out of a man. And this is thy due (<U+017F>aid he to <hi>Leriana,</hi> and gave her his handkerchief full of blood) take it, and glut thy damned rage; and be <U+017F>ure, that if the gods be ju<U+017F>t, they will <U+017F>houre vengeance upon thee. Upon this word, he threw the handkerchiefe at her <U+017F>eet, and beginning to cry, he went away in a <U+017F>ad and de<U+017F>perate <U+017F>ury, and would not give one word more.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, how this me<U+017F><U+017F>age went to my heart. I cannot, if I would, expre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>ad apprehen<U+017F>ions; I was <U+017F>o quite pa<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elfe, as they carried me to my Chamber; and, as fortune was, I met tho<U+017F>e that brought <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> who was not quite dead. When I was come to my <U+017F>elfe again, and my <U+017F>pirits a little better <U+017F>etled, I ca<U+017F>t my eye upon the Ring which <hi>Halladine</hi> brought me; I took it to be the <U+017F>ame I did ordinarily wear, and comparing them together, I found no difference, but that it was a little newer and bigger. I could not imagine why they <U+017F>hould be made <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t alike, nor who gave it unto <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander.</hi> At la<U+017F>t, I read the Letter, and found it to be thus written.</p>

Tho<U+017F>e who were in the Chamber, being ignorant of the cau<U+017F>e I had for the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at them. But <U+017F>he, who had the readie<U+017F>t wit in her wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, of any that ever breathed, went from me, holding up her hands and eyes, and told them, that, to hee great griefe, I was mad, and quite out of my wits, which they ea<U+017F>ily believed, having heard me utter <U+017F>ome odd expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and thus <U+017F>he went out of my Chamber with this excu<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> recovered, for his wounds were not mortall, and the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood only was the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>ounding. Pre<U+017F>ently after, I al<U+017F>o began to be my <U+017F>elfe again and to enquire, what reports went of me at Court: I under<U+017F>tood, that every one talked according to their <U+017F>everall fancies, but that all in generall blamed me for the death of <hi>Damon,</hi> and how every one thought, that <hi>Leriana</hi> had told many a tale unto <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife; and at the <U+017F>ame time, I <U+017F>aw <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> come into my Chamber: The very <U+017F>ight of him made me <U+017F>tart, and having no minde to <U+017F>peak with him, when he fell down upon his knees at my beds <U+017F>ide, I turned my head the other way. 'Tis very true, Madam, <U+017F>aid he) you have no rea<U+017F>on to look upon a man, who, of all men in the world, is the mo<U+017F>t unworthy of your a<U+017F>pect; for, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I merit that le<U+017F><U+017F>e, then any man that lives, <U+017F>ince I have given you <U+017F>o much cau<U+017F>e to hate me. But, if your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e will be plea<U+017F>ed to daigne me a hearing, perhaps you will not deem me <U+017F>o culpable as now you do. And becau<U+017F>e I an<U+017F>wered him very <U+017F>harply and would not give him leave to <U+017F>peak, my Nur<U+017F>e, who was with me, took his part, and told me, that I ought to hear him; for, if he were not in fault, I had no rea<U+017F>on to treat him <U+017F>o; and, if he were in fault, then I might, after a hearing, with more rea<U+017F>on bani<U+017F>h him my pre<U+017F>ence. Well, well, <U+017F>aid I, what do you think he will, or can, alledge? I know as well as he, he will <U+017F>ay, that the affection he bears unto me, hath forced him to do what he did: But, what have I to do with his affection, if it be <U+017F>o prejudiciall to me? I <U+017F>hall not, Madam, (<U+017F>aid he unto me) in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t only upon that affection you <U+017F>peak of, though perhaps to any other, that might be a better plea and excu<U+017F>e, as you think it; but, I <U+017F>hall go further, and tell you, that never any were <U+017F>o perniciou<U+017F>ly &amp; <U+017F>ubtlely con<U+017F>ened, as you and I have been by <hi>Leriana.</hi> And hereupon he told the whole <U+017F>tory of her jugling artifice, how <U+017F>he infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much confidence into him, as to look upon me, to <U+017F>peak unto me, to a<U+017F>pire unto my favour; how <U+017F>he puffed him up by reports unto him of favours from me, what <U+017F>tratagems <U+017F>he invented again<U+017F>t <hi>Damon,</hi> how <U+017F>he made the world believe he loved <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> how <U+017F>he in<U+017F>tructed <U+017F>illy <hi>Ormanthe</hi> for that purpo<U+017F>e, and how <U+017F>he gave him a Ring from me, which he conceived to be the cau<U+017F>e of the quarrell betwixt <hi>Damon</hi> and him. Now Madam, (<U+017F>aid he, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) do you think it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but that <U+017F>uch hopes as <U+017F>he infu<U+017F>ed into me, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>well the mo<U+017F>t prudent <U+017F>oul that ever was? Alas, I dare not <U+017F>o much as wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>o great a happine<U+017F>s; but me-thinks, I may in rea<U+017F>on be excu<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>ince I was meerly drawn in, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ed up with vain hopes by the artifice of <hi>Leriana,</hi> with who<U+017F>e per<U+017F>idie I thought fit to acquaint you, that you may hereafter beware of her, and her wicked devices, with which <U+017F>he has cheated both you and me. Then he let me under<U+017F>tand, how this wicked woman, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he could no longer deceive me and him, and being al<U+017F>o reprehended by <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, for having <U+017F>o little care of me; <U+017F>he, to excu<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elfe, had told them all that her <U+017F>ubtle imagination could devi<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t us; how I was in love, and how I was loved by many, and <U+017F>o many, as <U+017F>he could hardly number them: and among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e whom <U+017F>he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> were not forgotten. At which, <hi>Leontidas</hi> was <U+017F>o angry, and his Wife more, both again<U+017F>t me and again<U+017F>t him, as he thought it fit to acquaint me with it, to the end, I might take the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e I could. And la<U+017F>tly, he made <U+017F>uch humble <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that I would pardon him, for daring to love me, and <U+017F>uch <U+017F>erious prote<U+017F>tations, to live for the future as he ought, that I was con<U+017F>trained by the intreaties of my Nur<U+017F>e, to pardon him.</p>

But now, wi<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with one of the greate<U+017F>t villanies that ever was invented again<U+017F>t an innocent per<U+017F>on. I told you before, how <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> by <hi>Leriana's</hi> command, was extreamly fond of <hi>Damon;</hi> and you mu<U+017F>t know, that <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>o ill favoured, nor <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ted, but her kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es to him were well accepted, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he proved to be with Child. The poor <U+017F>illy Wench pre<U+017F>ently acquainted her crafty Aunt with it, who at the fir<U+017F>t was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed and offended at it; but afterwards having recour<U+017F>e to her accu<U+017F>tomed <U+017F>ubtlety, <U+017F>he plotted and intended to make u<U+017F>e of this occa<U+017F>ion, to make <hi>Damon</hi> believe, that I had this Child by <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander;</hi> and therefore <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>ly charged <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> to tell no body of it in the world; and afterwards, becau<U+017F>e her belly began to <U+017F>well, <U+017F>he taught her how to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elfe, that it might be<U+017F>t deceive the worlds notice. But when <hi>Damon</hi> was dead; and that all things were changed, yet <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to pur<U+017F>ue her plot, and make u<U+017F>e of it to my ruine; and thus <U+017F>he went to work. Since this <U+017F>ad accident of <hi>Damon,</hi> I kept my bed almo<U+017F>t continually unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in the afternoones I ro<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elfe up in my Clo<U+017F>et, and there <U+017F>tayed till nine or ten of the clock at night, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining my own melancholly thoughts alone, and none knew where I was, except my Nur<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ome Maides that waited upon me, whom I had charged, to tell none in the world where I was. And becau<U+017F>e it might be thought <U+017F>trange I never went to the Queen, if it were known I was not <U+017F>ick, I faigned my <U+017F>elfe to be <U+017F>o; and to deceive the Phy<U+017F>icians, I did not complain of a Feavour or any other known di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>ometimes of a Megrim, othertimes of my Teeth, of the Collick, and <U+017F>uch like. And becau<U+017F>e my friends would <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>end to vi<U+017F>it me, not daring to come them<U+017F>elves, for fear of offending <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, who were very potent with the King and Queen, I commanded my Nur<U+017F>e to put <U+017F>ome of the Maides into my bed, who <U+017F>hould receive the me<U+017F><U+017F>ages for me, and who faigning to be unwilling to <U+017F>peak, my Nur<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould make the an<U+017F>wer; the Windowes being clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut and the Curtains drawn, no light almo<U+017F>t came into the Chamber, <U+017F>o as none could tell whether it was I or no. <hi>Leriana</hi> knew by her Niece, that it was my con<U+017F>tant cu<U+017F>tome to <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elfe up in my Clo<U+017F>et, every afternoon: And becau<U+017F>e I was no hater of <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> though <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>imply in<U+017F>trumentall in my mi<U+017F>ery, therefore I permitted her to be alwaies among<U+017F>t my Maides: for, what <U+017F>he had done, was not out of any malice unto me: And at this time, <U+017F>he told <hi>Leriana</hi> all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages concerning me, more out of <U+017F>implicity, then any hatred unto me. But her Aunt, who<U+017F>e aime was ab<U+017F>olutely to ruine me and my reputation, nay, even to take away my life, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould make known all the villany unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> <U+017F>he thought, that <U+017F>he had met with a fit occa<U+017F>ion to effect her wicked de<U+017F>ires. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ure, <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> had acquainted me with her arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and tricks, which <U+017F>he had u<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Damon</hi> and me <U+017F>he turned all her affection to him into mortall hatred. And there being never in this world a <U+017F>pirit <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>ubtlety and malice, as this woman, <U+017F>he aimed to be revenged upon <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> and me both at once; and thus <U+017F>he had laid her plot. She asked <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> how long <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elfe to have been with Child? and upon reckoning up of the time, <U+017F>he found, that <U+017F>he was within a month of her Account; of which <hi>Leriana</hi> was very glad: And after <U+017F>he had bid her be of good courage, <U+017F>he commanded her, to keep her big belly very clo<U+017F>e, and that as <U+017F>oon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>he found any throwes of Labour to be upon her, then to acquaint her; and in the mean time to get into my bed in my room as oft as <U+017F>he could. And making this to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her trea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he went unto the Wife of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> and falling down upon her knees, mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eeched her to pardon her carele<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e in ob<U+017F>ervance of me. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew, that the aimes of this Lady were more at my E<U+017F>tate then me, and <U+017F>ince there was no likelyhood, that her Nephew would marry me, <U+017F>he added the<U+017F>e words: If you will be plea<U+017F>ed, Madam, to take me into your favour again, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew you a mo<U+017F>t infallible and ju<U+017F>t way to make all <hi>Madonthe's</hi> E<U+017F>tate yours. The Lady hearing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition, <U+017F>o <U+017F>uitable to her humour, <U+017F>he began to hearken unto it, and asked her, what way was it that <U+017F>he meant? I <U+017F>hall in few words acquaint you, (<U+017F>aid this wicked devill) but, Madam, upon condition, that you will pardon a new fault which I <U+017F>hall acquaint you withall. And commanding her to <U+017F>peak freely, <hi>Leriana</hi> thus continued: <hi>Madonthe,</hi> (in the per<U+017F>on of whom, god, Madam, <U+017F>eemes to love you, <U+017F>ince he would not let her be in your hou<U+017F>e) is the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable and lo<U+017F>t woman in all <hi>Aquitain;</hi> and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I never thought, that one <U+017F>o young as <U+017F>he could have deceived one of my age; her mode<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, her high looks her family from whence <U+017F>he is de<U+017F>cended, and tho<U+017F>e good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which <U+017F>he had of you, might well move me to an<U+017F>wer for her cha<U+017F>tity as for my own; and yet for all this, I have di<U+017F>covered, that <U+017F>he is with Child, How! <hi>Madonthe,</hi>

with Child, <U+017F>aid the Lady? Yes, Madam, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leriana)</hi> and more then that, <U+017F>he is ready to be brought to Bed. But how, replyed <U+017F>he, and from whom do you know this? Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to pardon me, and to believe that I was not <U+017F>o carele<U+017F><U+017F>e in the charge which you gave me, as you imagine: Con<U+017F>idering her demeanour, I might ea<U+017F>ily be deceived, and could never imagine, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ever look <U+017F>o low, as to love <U+017F>uch a man as <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> I <U+017F>ee now, that jealou<U+017F>ie has clearer eyes then any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for <hi>Damon</hi> found this out, which my eyes could never <U+017F>ee. At la<U+017F>t, I came to know it by the means of a Midwife, unto whom <U+017F>he had addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe for a Medicine, to make her <U+017F>elfe mi<U+017F>carry: But, the good woman being vertuous, and hating <U+017F>uch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, did an<U+017F>wer her, That <U+017F>he could not, becau<U+017F>e now the Child was entirely formed, nay, ready to be born; but, <U+017F>he would do thus much for her, <U+017F>he could make her labour <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>peedy, as none <U+017F>hould ever know any thing. Now this woman came and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me. And becau<U+017F>e I was very de<U+017F>irous to know who the father was, I asked her, if <U+017F>he could <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any per<U+017F>on? Very hardly <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it be <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> for, as oft as I looked upon her belly, or <U+017F>he thought upon the danger <U+017F>he was in <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ay nothing el<U+017F>e, but, Ah <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> thy affection will co<U+017F>t me dear. This makes me judge it to be him. Now Madam I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider, how could I keep her from this man? a dome<U+017F>tick, a ba<U+017F>e man, infinitely her inferiour: Could I ever imagine, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould look <U+017F>o low as him? But, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he hath rendred her <U+017F>elfe unworthy of your alliance, let her be puni<U+017F>hed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her merits, and make her an example unto all of her age, whil<U+017F>t you do enjoy that Fortune and E<U+017F>tate, which <U+017F>he is unworthy of; and this is the way: You know, Madam, that by our Lawes, every woman who offends in Cha<U+017F>tity, is to die by fire. We <U+017F>hall very ea<U+017F>ily convict her of this crime, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he hath a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it in her own belly. And becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e who are thus condemned, do not only lo<U+017F>e their lives, but their E<U+017F>tates are al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>i<U+017F>cate to the King, be you the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hall beg <hi>Mandonthe's. Leontidas</hi> came into the Room, and finding <hi>Leriana</hi> there: How (<U+017F>aid he to his Wife) can you endure the <U+017F>ight of her, who is the cau<U+017F>e of our di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures? His Wife, full of de<U+017F>ire to be Mi<U+017F>tris of my E<U+017F>tate, went to him, and took him to the window, there told him how the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tood: And though he was a per<U+017F>on of honour, and a generous minded man; yet, <U+017F>he wrought <U+017F>o with him, that at the la<U+017F>t he con<U+017F>ented unto what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired: So calling <hi>Leriana,</hi> he commanded her to tell him the truth, and be <U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ay no more, then what <U+017F>he could ju<U+017F>tifie. She, with an incredible impudence, repeated all, that before <U+017F>he had told unto his Wife, and farther told him, that if he would not believe her, let him finde out any Midwife, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he were one that was unknown to me, and let him receive the truth from her report. <hi>Leontidas</hi> thought this to be a good way &amp; the next morning he <U+017F>ent for one. It hapned <U+017F>o, as that day her Niece, by her command, was in my place in bed; and to keep my Nur<U+017F>e for taking any notice of what <U+017F>he intended to do, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for her unto her Chamber, under pretence of <U+017F>ome earne<U+017F>t bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with her, <U+017F>o as there was none in my Chamber of any judgment; and <U+017F>o <hi>Leriana</hi> going in with the Midwife, and having fully in<U+017F>tructed her Niece what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he went unto her, and <U+017F>aid: Madam I promi<U+017F>ed to bring one unto you, who would admini<U+017F>ter <U+017F>ome comfort unto you; I have now kept my word. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> in a low voice, an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he was very welcome. Are you plea<U+017F>ed, Madam, <U+017F>aid the Midwife, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee in what condition you are in? Yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ormanthe.</hi> Then <U+017F>he put her hand into the bed, and upon her belly, and did <U+017F>uch things as are u<U+017F>uall upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions: and as fortune was, the Child <U+017F>tirred, <U+017F>o as the pains of Labour were pre<U+017F>ently upon the poor Wench; and in le<U+017F><U+017F>e then two houres, <U+017F>he was, without any noi<U+017F>e, or any in the Room that could take any notice, brought to bed.
<hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>eeing things fall out <U+017F>o well according to her de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent the two Maids who were in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon two <U+017F>everall errands, and <U+017F>o was alone in the Chamber; <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed her Niece within an houre after to ri<U+017F>e, and in the mean while, they held the little Child unto the fire. Then to compleat her trea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he, with the Midwife, carried it <U+017F>tark naked unto <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas,</hi> being very de<U+017F>irous that every one <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee it as <U+017F>he went out of my Chamber and Lodgings: I heard it cry into my Clo<U+017F>et where I was, but never mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting any <U+017F>uch villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I would not be diverted from my <U+017F>ad thoughts. She addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf fir<U+017F>t unto the Wife of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> and this te<U+017F>timony, together with the Midwife, did give her <U+017F>uch a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, as <U+017F>he did believe it, and <hi>Leontidas</hi> al<U+017F>o. But the better to cover her trea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he be<U+017F>eeched the Lady to content her <U+017F>elfe with my E<U+017F>tate, and that if <U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>pare my life, <U+017F>he was confident, con<U+017F>idering the fault I had committed, that I would be willing to cloi<U+017F>ter up my <U+017F>elfe all the re<U+017F>t of my daies, among<U+017F>t the Druides Daughters or Ve<U+017F>talls:
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53526:153"/>
and that this would be acceptable unto god, to <U+017F>ave my life, and not to <U+017F>tain <U+017F>o noble a Family as mine with an act <U+017F>o infamous. That though my fault was great yet <U+017F>he could not forget the affection <U+017F>he once did bear unto me, as long as I did behave my <U+017F>elfe as I ought; and therefore <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but make this reque<U+017F>t. The Wife of <hi>Leontidas</hi> having no de<U+017F>igne upon my life, but only upon my E<U+017F>tate, did con<U+017F>ent unto it; but <hi>Leontidas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, being a man of honour, was long before he could con<U+017F>ent unto it: But at la<U+017F>t the importunities of his Wife, together with the di<U+017F><U+017F>embling tears of <hi>Leriana,</hi> and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his obligations unto my Father; all the<U+017F>e did <U+017F>o work with him, as they both commanded <hi>Leriana</hi> to per<U+017F>wade me, unto what <U+017F>he had propo<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>But this not being the de<U+017F>igne of this devilli<U+017F>h woman, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired them fir<U+017F>t to let <U+017F>ome daies pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, and be<U+017F>eeched <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, to let <U+017F>ome go with her, to <U+017F>ee in what condition I was: Which they did, commanding an old Lady, and an old Cavalier, in whom they had good a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, to wait upon <hi>Leriana.</hi> She, with the Midwife, after the Child was put to Nur<U+017F>e, conducted them into my Chamber, went to my bed, and when <U+017F>he found me not in it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed amazed; <U+017F>he turned up the clothes, and <U+017F>hewed them the <U+017F>ignes of a Woman in Child-bed; and faigning not to know where I was, did <U+017F>eek about for me, and at la<U+017F>t found me in my Clo<U+017F>et: She called them unto her, and <U+017F>hewed me unto them through the chincks of the dore. All this while I knew nothing, but was then laid down upon a little Couch, with my hand under my head, mu<U+017F>ing upon the mi<U+017F>erable fate of <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>o as they might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ad thoughts of my heart by my face. This wicked wretch made them believe, that my being ill proceeded from my being newly brought to bed, which they, <U+017F>eeing my <U+017F>ad po<U+017F>ture, did very ea<U+017F>ily believe: And being thus deceived, they returned, and made their report unto <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife. In the mean time, <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>taying alone with the Midwife, did change the <U+017F>heets of my bed, and all things, that might give any knowledge of what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Afterwards conjured the woman not to <U+017F>peak of it, but to ob<U+017F>erve the time and the place very preci<U+017F>ely; and then they went out of my Lodging. My Nur<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently after returned, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altered in my Chamber, did wonder at nothing, but not to <U+017F>ee <hi>Ormanthe</hi> in my bed; but, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he made no great matter of it. Night being come, and the u<U+017F>uall time of my going to bed, I went into it, and <U+017F>lept till the morning, without any manner of imagination of the<U+017F>e things. In the mean time, <hi>Leriana</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <U+017F>trange Me<U+017F><U+017F>ages and Orations in my name, telling <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife that I did mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech them to have pitty upon me; that I did acknowledge my life to be in their hands; that I did wholly give my <U+017F>elfe unto them, and that I de<U+017F>ired no more, but to be <U+017F>hut up in <U+017F>ome retired place, where none could <U+017F>ee me; that as <U+017F>oon as I was able to <U+017F>tir abroad, I would come and beg pardon for the fault which I had committed, and de<U+017F>ire leave to <U+017F>eque<U+017F>ter my <U+017F>elfe from the world. To be briefe, wi<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, this helli<U+017F>h woman did <U+017F>o well manage her wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>ix weeks pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus on. In the mean time, <hi>Ormanthe</hi> was <U+017F>o well recovered, as if <U+017F>he were a Maid again, and <U+017F>o, as none could imagine <U+017F>he had been with Child, but was fairer then before. <hi>Leriana</hi> had <U+017F>o well in<U+017F>tructed her, that when I asked her, why <U+017F>he went away without telling me? <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, That <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not knock at my dore for fear of di<U+017F>turbance, and that when <U+017F>he went, <U+017F>he thought, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not have <U+017F>tayed away above two or three daies at the mo<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o thought to have returned, before I <U+017F>hould take notice <U+017F>he was gone, though her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with her Aunt did keep her longer. I received her excu<U+017F>e, and only told her, that <U+017F>he might well have asked leave.</p>
               <p>Things being in this condition, <hi>Leriana</hi> feared nothing now, but the being convinced of a lie, and therefore re<U+017F>olved to execute her malicious de<U+017F>igne. She had two Co<U+017F>en germans which were Souldiers, and had gotten the reputation of the mo<U+017F>t valiant Blades in all the Court of <hi>Torri<U+017F>mond;</hi> moreover, they were poor, and had no other hopes, but in being Heires unto <hi>Leriana's</hi> e<U+017F>tate. She, intending to make u<U+017F>e of their valour did oblige them both by pre<U+017F>ents, and by giving them fre<U+017F>h hopes of her E<U+017F>tate; which did tie them <U+017F>o unto her, that <U+017F>he could not command any thing which they would not execute. After <U+017F>he had made her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ure of them, <U+017F>he began to change her tale with <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, telling them, that I took courage; that I did not now think any more of leaving the World, but that I had quite forgotten my duty unto them. To be briefe, within a few daies after, <U+017F>he told them, that now there was nothing to be hoped from me, but by force, and that I did deny all; and in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>o much offended at me, as <U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, I was not worthy of that favour which they would <U+017F>hew me. And becau<U+017F>e the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53526:154"/>
Wi<U+017F>e of <hi>Leontidas</hi> gaped <U+017F>till after my E<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>he asked her, how <U+017F>he could convince me? We have, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, very good witne<U+017F><U+017F>es; but, though we had not, yet <U+017F>ince truth is on our <U+017F>ide, I have <U+017F>ome that will maintain it by Armes again<U+017F>t any who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hall maintain the contrary: And you know, Madam, that <U+017F>uch things as are dubious, and cannot be made apparent by convincing proofes, the truth of them is to be tryed by Armes. <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas,</hi> who was a per<U+017F>on of honour, and who began to be very angry at the craft which he conceived I u<U+017F>ed: No, no, <U+017F>aid he, I am very certain <U+017F>he is in a fault; it <U+017F>hall be my <U+017F>elfe who will accu<U+017F>e her, and I will maintain it again<U+017F>t all men whom<U+017F>oever. <hi>Leriana,</hi> who had made her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ure of her two Co<U+017F>en-germans and who above all de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>eem very affectionate unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> <U+017F>he turned towards his Wife: Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, I had rather die, than my Lord <U+017F>hould enter into Armes upon this occa<U+017F>ion; I be<U+017F>eech you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from it, or el<U+017F>e I prote<U+017F>t I will meddle no more in the matter: I have <hi>Leotaris,</hi> my Cou<U+017F>en german, and his Brother, who will undertake the charge; and indeed it is mo<U+017F>t fit they <U+017F>hould, for it is not hand<U+017F>ome to beg the E<U+017F>tate of one, whom he doth accu<U+017F>e. <hi>Leontidas</hi> per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in his will; but his Wife would by no means <U+017F>ee him in <U+017F>o much danger, and thinking it not hand<U+017F>ome he <U+017F>hould be my accu<U+017F>er, and at the <U+017F>ame time beg my E<U+017F>tate of the King, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o prevailed with him, that he referred it unto the Kin<U+017F>men of this woman. This being the re<U+017F>olution, <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>pake unto <hi>Leotaris,</hi> promi<U+017F>ed him her E<U+017F>tate, made an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of it by Writing; and briefly, <U+017F>o obliged him and his Brother, as they would have attempted either again<U+017F>t heaven or hell; and, right or wrong, would arme them<U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t me. <hi>Leriana</hi> being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured on this <U+017F>ide, backed by the opinion of very many, and al<U+017F>o with the authority of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented her <U+017F>elfe before the King, accu<U+017F>ed me, offered to prove her accu<U+017F>ation, and <U+017F>ett forth the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o colourably, as every one believed it to be true: And le<U+017F>t <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover all her wicked devices and forgeries, <U+017F>he made him a party in the accu<U+017F>ation, <U+017F>aying, he was the Father of the Child purpo<U+017F>ely to di<U+017F>able his te<U+017F>timony again<U+017F>t her.</p>
               <p>The Queen, who was a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e full of honour and vertue, did joyne her prayers with the accu<U+017F>ation of this wicked woman, and did require I <U+017F>hould be puni<U+017F>hed according to the rigour of the Law. <hi>Leontidas</hi> is called, who being a<U+017F>hamed of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, made the <U+017F>ame reque<U+017F>t. This act being to the di<U+017F>honour of his family, his wife be<U+017F>eeched the Queen, to become a mediator for the E<U+017F>tate, which the King did freely grant: And yet this good Prince calling to memory, the good <U+017F>ervice which my Father had don <hi>Thierres</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was very <U+017F>orry for this dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. The fir<U+017F>t newes I heard of all this, was, when the Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice came to <U+017F>eize upon me locked up my Chamber and Clo<U+017F>et and carried me before the King, never telling me for what. Oh heavens, in what a ca<U+017F>e was I in, when I heard the words of <hi>Leriana?</hi> it was long before I could <U+017F>peak; at la<U+017F>t, recollecting my <U+017F>elfe, I kneeled down before the Queen, be<U+017F>eeched her not to believe this wicked woman; I prote<U+017F>ted unto her by all that is <U+017F>acred, there was no <U+017F>uch thing, that there could be no proofe again<U+017F>t my cha<U+017F>tity, and be<U+017F>eeched her out of pitty to favour the cau<U+017F>e of a mo<U+017F>t innocent. The King was more moved at my words then the Queen; whether it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e he remembered the <U+017F>ervices of my Father, or becau<U+017F>e my youth and face moved him to pitty; but <U+017F>o it was, that turning towards <hi>Leriana:</hi> If you do aver (<U+017F>aid he) any thing which is not true, I do vow by the <U+017F>oul of my Father, that you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffer the <U+017F>ame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment which you have prepard for others. Sir, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with an impudent brow) I will prove what I <U+017F>ay, both by Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es and by Armes. And both, <U+017F>aid the King, are allowed you. Then cau<U+017F>ing us to be <U+017F>eparated, I was committed to <U+017F>afeguard, and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> al<U+017F>o; and it was commanded that witne<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>hould be produced: Then the Midwife and the Nur<U+017F>e of <hi>Ormanthe's</hi> Child, did te<U+017F>tifie their knowledge in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; the old Cavalier and the old Matron of whom I <U+017F>poke, did the like; <U+017F>he produced <U+017F>everall witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, who <U+017F>aw her go out of my Chamber with the Child. To be briefe, the proofes were <U+017F>uch, as if god had not pre<U+017F>erved my innocency, I had been condemned. By fortune, the Judges being in my Chamber, and reading the Depo<U+017F>itions again<U+017F>t me, I knew not what to do in this affliction but only to have recour<U+017F>e unto the gods; and then, lifting up my hands and eyes to heaven, I prayed; Oh! ye mo<U+017F>t omnipotent gods who do <U+017F>ee into my heart, and know, that I am innocent of all this which I am accu<U+017F>ed of, be my <U+017F>upporters, and declare my innocency. And then, as if in<U+017F>pired by <U+017F>ome good angell, I turned my <U+017F>elfe towards the chimney, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing my <U+017F>peech unto the Judges: If the<U+017F>e accu<U+017F>ations (<U+017F>aid I unto them) be true. I be<U+017F>eech the gods that I may never breathe again; and if they be fal<U+017F>, I be<U+017F>eech them, that this hot coal may not burn me: Then pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>tooping, I took up a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53526:154"/>
great coal of fire, and held it in my hand naked, till it was extingui<U+017F>hed, not being at all burned. The Judges amazed at this proof, would needs touch the coal, to try whether it was cold, but they quickly withdrew their hand; then they looked into my hand, to <U+017F>ee if there was any <U+017F>igne of burning, but they found it no more touched, then if it had never touched fire; you may imagine whether they were a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed or no: But <U+017F>o it was, they made a report of this unto the King, who ordained, that <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>hould be acquainted with it, to <U+017F>ee, if this te<U+017F>timony of my innocence, would make her decline her accu<U+017F>ation: But <U+017F>he alledged, that I had procured <U+017F>ome receipt, which kept the fire from burning me, and that her Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es which <U+017F>he produced were without exception, and that this proofe by fire might perhaps have been allowed, if it had been ordained and appointed by the Judges; but, <U+017F>ince it proceeded from my own will, it was to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected of much artifice. To be briefe, <U+017F>age Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>he <U+017F>moothed over her villany with <U+017F>o many colourable arguments of truth, as all the favour I could obtain from the King, was, to ordain, that the matter <U+017F>hould be tryed by Armes, and that within fifteen daies, we <U+017F>hould finde out the Cavaliers, which <U+017F>hould enter into the li<U+017F>ts for us.</p>
               <p>The newes of all this was quickly di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed throughout all <hi>Aquitain,</hi> <U+017F>o as my Mother heard of it as well as others; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leriana</hi> had produced <U+017F>o many Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as almo<U+017F>t all others did, that I had committed the fault whereof I was accu<U+017F>ed; and <U+017F>he having lived alwaies in great honour and <U+017F>ame, it grieved her <U+017F>o much, as <U+017F>he fell <U+017F>ick, and being old withall, <U+017F>he died within ten or twelve daies after <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t heard of it; but, in <U+017F>uch a bad opinion of me, as <U+017F>he would never <U+017F>end to <U+017F>ee me nor a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me in my ju<U+017F>tification. And <U+017F>ee how many <U+017F>everall waies the gods were plea<U+017F>ed to afflict me; for, this grieved me more, then I am able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. Thus was I without Father or Mother, de<U+017F>titute of all friends, and univer<U+017F>ally blamed by every one. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I did many times intend to throw my <U+017F>elfe out of the window, to rid my <U+017F>elfe out of <U+017F>o many <U+017F>orrowes; but, <U+017F>till the gods pre<U+017F>erved me in hopes that my innocency would at la<U+017F>t appear, putting into my minde, that if I <U+017F>hould die <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hould leave all <hi>Aquitain</hi> in a bad opinion of me. But, when <hi>Leriana</hi> offered <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother for her Champions, and when neither <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> nor I could name any, as well, becau<U+017F>e we were not prepared for it, as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e no man would enter into <U+017F>o bad a quarrell, as every one thought this was: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, and now more then ever grieved for poor <hi>Damon,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elfe, that had he been alive, I could not have wanted a Champion. <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, he mu<U+017F>t defend his cau<U+017F>e by fighting, both with <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, one after another. But the terme being pa<U+017F>t, the King in favour allowed us eight daies longer, and they being pa<U+017F>t, he added three more: without any further delay, at the expiration of which, we were brought into the Li<U+017F>ts, I all in mourning, and without any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but the Officers of ju<U+017F>tice; and <hi>Leriana,</hi> on the contrary, all triumphant, and in the company of many Gallants; <U+017F>he was upon another Scaffold, oppo<U+017F>ite to that where I was. <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother were already in the Li<U+017F>ts, armed <hi>Cap apé,</hi> and bravely mounted vaunting the more, becau<U+017F>e they believed to finde no Antagoni<U+017F>t but <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> for none el<U+017F>e could we finde, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leontidas,</hi> who was the Kings favourit, did take <hi>Leriana's</hi> part; and tho<U+017F>e who heretofore had made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of Love unto me, and would have undertaken a hundred <U+017F>uch Combats for me, were now all cold and backward, becau<U+017F>e I had <U+017F>leighted them for <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> Thus you may <U+017F>ee, a fal<U+017F>hood is hardly to be known from truth, when it is <U+017F>ubtlely di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed with a hand<U+017F>ome glo<U+017F><U+017F>e. At la<U+017F>t, <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> enters the Li<U+017F>ts again<U+017F>t them both, hoping, that the ju<U+017F>tice of his cau<U+017F>e would bear him out. It was ordained by the Judges, that if during the Combat, any Cavalier would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent him <U+017F>elfe for me, he <U+017F>hould be received; and that <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, might fight with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> both together, or <U+017F>everally, if they would. The<U+017F>e two Brothers were men of great courage, and per<U+017F>ons of honour, <U+017F>o as they would undertake him one after another; but <hi>Leriana</hi> would not by any means <U+017F>uffer it, <U+017F>o as they ran both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again<U+017F>t him. Judge, <U+017F>age Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, in what a condition I was; I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that I was <U+017F>o much out of my <U+017F>elfe, as I could not <U+017F>ee any thing. I looked at. At la<U+017F>t, the command was given, and the Trumpets <U+017F>ounded. <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> who was couragious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, putting his confidence in the gods, and ju<U+017F>tice of his cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>et <U+017F>purrs to his Hor<U+017F>e, and with his Lance, hit the Brother of <hi>Leotaris,</hi> and doing him no hurt, brake it; but he him<U+017F>elfe at the <U+017F>ame time, was di<U+017F>mounted by two Lances, with the <U+017F>adle betwixt his legs. <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o great an advantage on her <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he was all joy; I, on the contrary, all fear. <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe in this extremity, did not for all that lo<U+017F>e his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53526:155"/>
but running to his Hor<U+017F>e, he pulled the bridle off from his head, before his Antagoni<U+017F>ts could return upon him: The Hor<U+017F>e being of a high <U+017F>pirit, and finding him<U+017F>elfe without either bridle or <U+017F>adle, began to run up and down the place, and, as if the gods had in<U+017F>pired him, came to <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, and began to paw with his feet, and bite with his teeth, kicking and bounding, and did <U+017F>o fiercely a<U+017F><U+017F>ault them that they, in lieu of fighting with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> had enough to do to defend them<U+017F>elves from this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: This did amu<U+017F>e them a while, becau<U+017F>e they could not kill him <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as they did imagine becau<U+017F>e of his nimblence and perpetuall motion; but at the la<U+017F>t, they di<U+017F>patched him, and being animated the more again<U+017F>t <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> re<U+017F>olved to di<U+017F>patch him al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ently; and therefore falling both upon him in the heat of their fury, he had no other way but to run clo<U+017F>e to his dead Hor<U+017F>e, which lay ga<U+017F>ping in the end of the Li<U+017F>ts, and which did him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice after his death; for the Hor<U+017F>es of his enemies did boggle <U+017F>o at him, that their Riders could hardly come neer him, and this prolonged the Combat: At the la<U+017F>t, <hi>Leotaris</hi> <U+017F>eeing he could not get his Hor<U+017F>e any neerer he alighted from him, and <U+017F>o did his Brother from his; and leaving their Hor<U+017F>es both loo<U+017F>e in the place, went both up to <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and fell upon him, who certainly did as much as one man could well do, but having to deal with two of the <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t Cavaliers in all <hi>Aquitain,</hi> at once, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to make any long re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. He had received <U+017F>everall wounds, and lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much blood, as he had not <U+017F>trength to defend him<U+017F>elfe any longer, when the gods, out of pitty unto me, did <U+017F>end a Cavalier, who de<U+017F>ired entrance into the Li<U+017F>ts, in defence of me and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander:</hi> The dore was pre<U+017F>ently opened unto him; and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> in great extremity, he <U+017F>purred his Hor<U+017F>e furiou<U+017F>ly up unto them; but when he was come neer, he <U+017F>tooped, and cryed out unto them; Hold Cavaliers, and do not any longer offend again<U+017F>t the Lawes of Chivalrie; come off that wounded man, and fall both upon me, who am <U+017F>ent hither purpo<U+017F>ely to puni<U+017F>h you. <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother hearing his voice, did recoile, and were <U+017F>orry that they were both on foot, and therefore ran towards their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es: But the <U+017F>tranger rid up to them, and told them, That if they had their Hor<U+017F>es, they <U+017F>hould receive it as a courte<U+017F>y from him, and not from their own nimblene<U+017F><U+017F>e. But get up, <U+017F>aid he, I <U+017F>corn to take the advantage of my Hor<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t you. They both did infinitely e<U+017F>teem this generous act of this <U+017F>tranger; but I was very <U+017F>orry for it, conceiving, that he might very well have taken all advantages again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e, who had fallen both at once upon <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> But this <U+017F>tranger had more noble thoughts, and would not let that which was blamable in others, be any example unto him<U+017F>elf. Whil<U+017F>t I was in the<U+017F>e thoughts, <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris</hi> and his Brother had both mounted them<U+017F>elves, who never con<U+017F>idering the courte<U+017F>ie they had received, fell both at once upon him; but they found a <U+017F>tronger arme to deal with, then <hi>Ther<U+017F>anders.</hi> I cannot, <U+017F>age Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, particularize this Combat unto you, for my fears were <U+017F>uch, as I hardly <U+017F>aw it; let it <U+017F>uffice I tell you, that this <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>uch wonderfull <U+017F>trength and valour, that <hi>Leriana</hi> thought him a devill, and not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man. After they had fought a while, I perceived, that though he was <U+017F>ingle, yet he had the advantage of them. As for <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> he was <U+017F>o weak, as he was not able to ri<U+017F>e. But this <U+017F>tranger, to the wonder of all the <U+017F>pectators, did give the Brother of <hi>Leotaris</hi> <U+017F>uch a fatall blow, that he <U+017F>truck his head from his <U+017F>houlders. <hi>Leotaris</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, his fury <U+017F>welled with revenge: But the <U+017F>tranger, having now to do with no more but him, did wound him in <U+017F>o many places, that he was <U+017F>o weak with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood, as he fell from his Hor<U+017F>e to the ground, and falling with his head foremo<U+017F>t, the weight of his body and his armes broke his neck. The <U+017F>tranger alighting from his hor<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>eeing him dead, he went unto <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> helped him to ri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>et him upon one of the Hor<U+017F>es of his enemies; and then taking his own, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto the Judges, and a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, if he had any more to do? And they an<U+017F>wering, No: Then he required that I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>et at liberty, which was commanded that very minute. Then he came unto me, and asked me, if he could do me any further <U+017F>ervice? Yes, Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, in two things; the one, to conduct me home, and re<U+017F>cue me from the tyranny of tho<U+017F>e, who have ravi<U+017F>hed me from my deare<U+017F>t Mother; and the other is, that I may know the name of him, unto whom I owe both my life and my honour. As for my name (an<U+017F>wered he) I <U+017F>hall take it as a favour, if you will not force me to make it known; And as for waiting upon you, unto the place where you de<U+017F>ire to be, I <U+017F>hall do it, <U+017F>o it may be pre<U+017F>ently.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t things went thus on my <U+017F>ide in this place, the gods did evidence, that they never for<U+017F>ake the innocent; for it hapned, that my poor Nur<U+017F>e, having not <U+017F>o much courage as to <U+017F>ee me die, and thinking it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> could maintain it out again<U+017F>t two
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53526:155"/>
<U+017F>uch Cavaliers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed in my Chamber, crying and making mo<U+017F>t lamentable moan. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who had received all the courte<U+017F>ies <U+017F>he could de<U+017F>ire, both from her and me, was exceedingly moved at it, and being very <U+017F>imple without any <U+017F>ubtlety, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but tell her, how her Aunt alwaies a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her, that I <U+017F>hould not die, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired, that I <U+017F>hould be beholding unto her for my life, to the end, I <U+017F>hould be a better friend unto her. Ah! <U+017F>weetheart, <U+017F>aid the Nur<U+017F>e, it is mo<U+017F>t certain our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t die, if <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> be overcome, the King him<U+017F>elfe, according to the Lawes, cannot <U+017F>ave her. Alas, alas, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> <U+017F>hall my Lady be burned? Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid my Nur<U+017F>e, it is too <U+017F>ure. Ah me! mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable wretch that I am, replyed the Wench, how can I ever expect that the gods will pardon me for her death? Why, <U+017F>aid my Nur<U+017F>e, are you any waies guilty of her death? Oh Mother! <U+017F>aid <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> if you will promi<U+017F>e me to tell no body, I will tell you a <U+017F>trange accident. And my Nur<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he told her, that it was <U+017F>he who had the Child, and told her all that I have related unto you. Sweetheart, <U+017F>weetheart, <U+017F>aid my Nur<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently, let us go pre<U+017F>ently and <U+017F>ave her life; believe it, the gods will be well plea<U+017F>ed with it; and moreover I will undertake, you <U+017F>hall have what you will of my Lady. Thus was the truth di<U+017F>covered.</p>
               <p>The Wench followed my Nur<U+017F>e, who, to be briefe, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her<U+017F>elfe to the Queen, and acquainted her with the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, whil<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tranger was talking unto me.</p>
               <p>The wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Leriana</hi> being thus di<U+017F>covered, both by Armes, and the confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this Wench, the King commanded, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be burned in the <U+017F>ame fire that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for me; though <U+017F>he did inveigh again<U+017F>t her Niece, <U+017F>aying, That my Nur<U+017F>e had <U+017F>uborned her, and that <U+017F>he was not of age to be a competent Witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially again<U+017F>t her above all others, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had chid and cha<U+017F>tized her for the<U+017F>e vices. But all the<U+017F>e alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were invalid, the truth was evident enough, by the particulars and circum<U+017F>tances which this Wench did <U+017F>peak of, and by the report of the Midwife, who confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>he never <U+017F>aw her face. Every one began to clap their hands and the people <U+017F>eeing the villany of <hi>Leriana,</hi> began to throw <U+017F>tones at her. The King commanded ju<U+017F>tice <U+017F>hould be executed, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elfe ready to be throwne into the fire, being much moved at the memory of all her wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed the truth; <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired audience, declared all her wicked practices, asked me pardon, and then voluntarily threw her <U+017F>elfe into the fire, where <U+017F>he ended her daies, to the contentment of all tho<U+017F>e, who heard of her wicked and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious waies.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things were thus in agitation, the Cavalier who had delivered me, de<U+017F>iring not to be known (as it is thought) retired him<U+017F>elfe, and none took notice which way; and I not finding him, was extreamly grieved, he <U+017F>hould depart with <U+017F>o few thanks for what he had done: I u<U+017F>ed all the means I po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could to hear of him; but after all enquiry, all I could hear, was the next morning from a Country man, who met him, and whom he de<U+017F>ired to come unto me from him, and let me know, that had he not been urged by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream importancy, he would have <U+017F>tayed longer, and waited upon me whither I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him; but he had promi<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to a Lady, who lived towards the Town of <hi>Gergovia;</hi> and that if I had any more <U+017F>ervice to command him, I might hear of him at the Golden Mount; and that he might be known, he would not change the Device which was upon his Shield. Then asking the man, what it was, becau<U+017F>e I was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed the day before, that I took no notice of it? He told me, that it was a Tiger feeding upon the Heart of an Human body, with this Motto, <hi>Thou give<U+017F>t me a Death, and I maintain thy Life.</hi>

               <p>Now, di<U+017F>creet Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, to abridge my <U+017F>tory, it was ordered, that I <U+017F>hould be free from the Guardian<U+017F>hip of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e his Wife had begged my E<U+017F>tate, and be <U+017F>et clearly at liberty. The poor <U+017F>illy <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was only <U+017F>educed by the <U+017F>ubtlety of her Aunt, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>hut up in one of tho<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>es de<U+017F>igned for <U+017F>uch puni<U+017F>hments, where the women there do live very well, only they mu<U+017F>t never come out. I <U+017F>hall now make a <U+017F>trange relation unto you: I did <U+017F>till love <hi>Damon</hi> mo<U+017F>t extreamly, and the memory of him <U+017F>ince his death was <U+017F>o imprinted in my <U+017F>oul, that he was commonly alwaies before my eyes: But <U+017F>ince this accident, and <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw this <U+017F>trange Cavalier, I know not how, but I began to change my fir<U+017F>t affection, and placed it upon him; and though I never <U+017F>aw his face, yet, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I love him, <U+017F>o as it may be <U+017F>aid, I was in love with a face of Armour: I know not whether my obligation to him was the cau<U+017F>e of it, or whether his valour and courage, and noble minde, forced me unto it; but <U+017F>o it is, I never loved any <U+017F>ince that day, but this unknown Cavalier; and in te<U+017F>timony of it, after a long expectance
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53526:156"/>
of his return, and hearing no newes of him, I re<U+017F>olved to go my <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Gergovea,</hi> and the Golden Mount: After I had con<U+017F>ulted with my <U+017F>elfe about this de<U+017F>igne, I acquainted <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> with it, who offered me all his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and I addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe unto him, rather then unto any other, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ince the day he fought for me, he had wholly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him<U+017F>elfe unto my <U+017F>ervice; and becau<U+017F>e I had often heard him <U+017F>ay, that he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely de<U+017F>irous to know that valiant Cavalier, who had <U+017F>o bravely relieved us. I gave out therefore, that I would go and vi<U+017F>it my E<U+017F>tate; I prepared my Train, I left the Court, and came to my own hou<U+017F>e, where leaving all my retinue, I took with me only my Nur<U+017F>e for a companion, and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> to defend me, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>etforwards towards the Golden Mount. The Country was extreamly rough and mountainous, almo<U+017F>t never without <U+017F>now and ice; my poor Nur<U+017F>e dyed there, and having interred her, I was much grieved to be alone with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander;</hi> but I pre<U+017F>ently met with <hi>Tircis, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> who<U+017F>e company plea<U+017F>ed me <U+017F>o much, that, not to lo<U+017F>e it, I re<U+017F>olved to put on the habit of a Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, as now you <U+017F>ee me, and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> in the habit of a Shepheard. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had <U+017F>tayed a while among<U+017F>t the Mountains, in hopes to hear <U+017F>ome newes of him I was in que<U+017F>t of, I re<U+017F>olved to come into this Country, <U+017F>ince he appointed us to make that way, thinking, that when I came to <hi>Gergovea,</hi> I <U+017F>hould haply finde this Cavalier, unto whom I was <U+017F>o much obliged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madonthe</hi> was thus telling her <U+017F>tory, and not without bedewing her cheeks with tears, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Paris</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepheards were talking together; for their mindes were po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with that malady, which above all others is an enemy to <U+017F>leep. For <hi>Tircis,</hi> he loved his decea<U+017F>ed <hi>Cleon,</hi> although he was out of all hopes of ever <U+017F>eeing her again. And becau<U+017F>e there was none of them <U+017F>o free as the incon<U+017F>tant <hi>Hylas,</hi> he bore it out the be<U+017F>t of any in the company, and was lea<U+017F>t troubled with his Love. <hi>Tircis,</hi> thinking upon his dear <hi>Cleon,</hi> he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>igh very loud, and <hi>Silvander</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time did the <U+017F>ame. See, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what difference there is betwixt the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>ighes. What is the difference, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris?</hi> The difference is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> doth <U+017F>igh <U+017F>o, to cool the fire which <U+017F>corcheth him; and <hi>Tircis</hi> <U+017F>ighes and blowes, to kindle that fire which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did <U+017F>corch him. <hi>Hylas</hi> had <U+017F>aid very well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> if he had <U+017F>aid, he had thought <U+017F>o; for this is only a meer imagination of a <U+017F>oul that knowes not how to love. How now, <hi>Tircis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you al<U+017F>o upbraid me, that I know not how to love? I thought there had been none but that fanta<U+017F>ticall <hi>Silvander,</hi> who had been of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. If you would judge according to rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> you would be of our opinions. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is it requi<U+017F>ite, that to love well, I mu<U+017F>t needs Idolize one that's dead, as you do? Did you but know how to love, aright, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis)</hi> que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you <U+017F>hould meet with <U+017F>o great a misfortune as mine, you would think your <U+017F>elfe obliged in duty <U+017F>o to do. How, how, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> in love with a Grave, a Coffin? believe it, <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, I will never be in love with any <U+017F>uch Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es: But, come a little to rea<U+017F>on, what contentment, and what end do you aime at in <U+017F>uch a love? Love, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> is a great god, which can aime at or de<U+017F>ire nothing but him<U+017F>elf; he is his own Center, and has no aime or inclination, but what begins and ends in him<U+017F>elfe: Love is like a Ring, it begins where it ends, and ends where it begins; it is perpetuall, it aimes at no ends, but is plea<U+017F>ed and contented with its own nature. The<U+017F>e are delicate dreames indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas;</hi> for my part, I believe them to be all fables, invented by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>illy women. What is it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis)</hi> which you think <U+017F>o far from truth? All that you <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> is <U+017F>o palpably gro<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I were mad if I did not <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>implicity of them.</p>
               <p>You <U+017F>ay, Love de<U+017F>ires nothing but it <U+017F>elfe, and I <U+017F>ay, we <U+017F>ee the contrary; for we never de<U+017F>ire any thing, but that which we have not. If you did under<U+017F>tand, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Tircis,</hi> how by the infinite power of Love, two per<U+017F>ons becomes but one, you would know, that a Lover can de<U+017F>ire nothing but him<U+017F>elfe; for as <U+017F>oon as you do under<U+017F>tand, how a Lover is transformed into the per<U+017F>on Loved, and the per<U+017F>on Loved into the Lover, and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes but one, though being Lover and Loved they are two, you would finde, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>ince the Lover de<U+017F>ires nothing but the per<U+017F>on Loved, and <U+017F>ince he is him<U+017F>elfe both the Lover and the Loved by this conjunction, he can de<U+017F>ire nothing but him<U+017F>elfe. See, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how the old Proverb is truly verified, one Errour begets a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. You would per<U+017F>wade me into a beliefe of things impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, as, that the Lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the per<U+017F>on Loved: why, by this argument, I am <hi>Phillis,</hi> for I do love her, and yet I am <hi>Hylas,</hi> and I do de<U+017F>ire her. The conclu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not good, for you do not love her: Had you <U+017F>aid, that I, in loving <hi>Diana,</hi> were transformed into her, you had
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53526:156"/>
<U+017F>aid right. Well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> are you then <hi>Diana?</hi> is your Cap there changed into a Coyfe, and your Coat into a Gown? My Cap, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> does not love her Coife. Very good (<U+017F>aid the incon<U+017F>tant <hi>Hylas)</hi> if you be changed into <hi>Diana,</hi> you <U+017F>hould then dre<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe in the habit of a woman: It is not hand<U+017F>ome, that <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e as you are, <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe thus in the habit of a man. There was none in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany could forbear laughing at the plea<U+017F>ant expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this merry <U+017F>hepheard; <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> him<U+017F>elfe could not hold: But afterwards, he an<U+017F>wered him thus: I will, if I can, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your errour: Know therefore, that there are two parts in a man, the one is the Body, which we <U+017F>ee and touch, and the other is the <U+017F>oul, which we cannot <U+017F>ee nor touch, but is known by words and actions; for neither words nor actions are parts of the Body, but of the Soul, which makes u<U+017F>e of the Body only as an in<U+017F>trument and organ; for the body does not <U+017F>ee of it <U+017F>elfe, nor under<U+017F>tand, it is the Soul which does it; and <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>equence, when we do love, it is not the Body which loves, but the Soul; and <U+017F>o it is only the Soul which transformes it <U+017F>elfe into the per<U+017F>on Loved, and not the Body. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do love the Body as well as the Soul; and <U+017F>o, if a Lover be changed into the thing Loved, my Soul <U+017F>hould be changed as well into the Body of <hi>Phillis,</hi> as into her Soul This <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> does thwart the Lawes of Nature; for a Soul, which is <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, cannot become a Body, no more then a Body can become a Soul. If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the change be but in part, and that part be the Soul, it is that part which I do lea<U+017F>t care for. In this, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> you do make it evidently appear, that you do not love; or at lea<U+017F>t, that you do love again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on: For the Soul ought not to deba<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elfe, unto that which is interiour unto it <U+017F>elfe; and therefore they <U+017F>ay, that Love ought to be betwixt equalls; that is a Soul to love a Soul, which is its equall, and not the Body which is its inferiour, and which Nature gave him only as an in<U+017F>trument. Now to make it appear, that the Lover becomes the party Loved, and that if you do love <hi>Phillis, Hylas</hi> is <hi>Phillis;</hi> and if <hi>Phillis</hi> love <hi>Hylas, Phillis</hi> is <hi>Hylas,</hi> con<U+017F>ider what the Soul is; It does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, Shepheard, of the Will, the Memory, and of the Under<U+017F>tanding: Now Philo<U+017F>ophers do hold, that we can love only that, which we do know; and if the knowledge, and the thing known, be one and the <U+017F>ame thing, it mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently follow, that the knowledge of him who Loves, and her who is loved, is the <U+017F>ame. That if the Will of a Lover, ought not to differ from the Will of the per<U+017F>on Loved, and if he do <U+017F>eek her by his thoughts, which is onely an effect of the Memory, as well as by his corporeall eyes, who can doubt, but that the Memory, the Under<U+017F>tanding and the Will, being changed into the per<U+017F>on loved, his Soul, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of the<U+017F>e three faculties, is changed al<U+017F>o. By <hi>Tautates</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> you fetch it very high; and though I have been long a Student in the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian</hi> Schooles, yet I cannot reach you. It was there, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> where I learned this Philo<U+017F>ophy. Though you have puzzled my brains with your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,,</hi> yet you cannot demon<U+017F>trate unto me, that a Lover is changed into the Loved, <U+017F>ince there is one part left out, which is the Body. The Body, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not a part, but only an organ or in<U+017F>trument of the Soul; and if the Soul of <hi>Phillis</hi> were <U+017F>eparated from her Body, would it not be <U+017F>aid, there is the Body of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and not <hi>Phillis</hi> her <U+017F>elfe? And if that be properly <U+017F>poken, then it mu<U+017F>t be under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Phillis</hi> is <U+017F>omewhere el<U+017F>e; and if you do love aright, it is into that <hi>Phillis</hi> into which you <U+017F>hould be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; <U+017F>o as if this be <U+017F>o, you can have no de<U+017F>ire out of your <U+017F>elfe: for, compri<U+017F>ing all your love in your <U+017F>elfe, you do al<U+017F>o comprize all your de<U+017F>ires within your <U+017F>elfe. If it be <U+017F>o, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> that the Body is but the in<U+017F>trument, which <hi>Phillis</hi> maketh u<U+017F>e of, I will give you that <hi>Phillis,</hi> and let me have the re<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ee whether you or I <U+017F>hall be better contented. But to end all our differences, it were good if we could get a little <U+017F>leep. Upon this, he was <U+017F>ilent, and would not give any further an<U+017F>wer: Al<U+017F>o all the Company by little and little fell a<U+017F>leep, except <hi>Silvander,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>oul being <U+017F>welled with abundance of reall affection, he could not clo<U+017F>e his eye of a long time after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Madonthe,</hi> as I told you before, had related the <U+017F>tory of her fortune unto the<U+017F>e fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es; and becau<U+017F>e a great part of the night was already <U+017F>pent, <U+017F>leep did by degrees <U+017F>teal into the eyes of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and her: But <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who could not <U+017F>leep, <U+017F>till talked with <hi>Diana,</hi> who for her part, <U+017F>eeing how extreamly <hi>Silvander</hi> loved her, <U+017F>he began al<U+017F>o to love him, although her affection to him did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly begin, <U+017F>he not taking any notice of it: At the fir<U+017F>t, it was no more, then a meer acknowledgment of his merit, (<U+017F>o requi<U+017F>ite is Knowledge before Love) and afterwards, ordinary conver<U+017F>ation with him, did win her to a liking of his company; at la<U+017F>t, his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her, with <U+017F>o
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53526:157"/>
much reverence and di<U+017F>cretion, made her love him; yet without any de<U+017F>igne or intention <U+017F>o to do. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who entertained the <U+017F>ame thoughts of <hi>Celadon,</hi> not being in di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e to <U+017F>leep, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Madouthe</hi> both fa<U+017F>t, al<U+017F>o thinking that none could hear her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke thus unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Si<U+017F>ter, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that one imprudent act doth draw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <U+017F>orrowes after it, and when one fault is once committed, it requires abundance of wi<U+017F>dome to repair it. Con<U+017F>ider, I be<U+017F>eech you, how this crime which I committed again<U+017F>t the affection of <hi>Celadon,</hi> hath hurried me into a <U+017F>ea of <U+017F>orrowes; I do verily believe, that as long as I live, nay, and after my death too, if the dead have any knowledge of pa<U+017F>t acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I believe they have, I <U+017F>hall never cea<U+017F>e my grief, for my offending again<U+017F>t the fidelity of <hi>Celadon;</hi> yet, you <U+017F>ee unto what a pa<U+017F><U+017F>e this fault hath brought me: This love, which with <U+017F>o much paines and care I have <U+017F>o long kept <U+017F>ecret, and would hardly acquaint my deare<U+017F>t companions with it; <U+017F>ee, I <U+017F>ay, how I do at this houre my <U+017F>elfe di<U+017F>cover it unto <U+017F>trangers, who are not any waies in the world obliged unto me. Ah! could I recall that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I have lo<U+017F>t, me-thinks I could manage it with more prudence. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> all human imbecillity hath this property, that the malady can very hardly be known untill it be pre<U+017F>ent; the gods them<U+017F>elves only will be e<U+017F>teemed perfect and wi<U+017F>e: And you mu<U+017F>t think, that if the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon</hi> which you cau<U+017F>ed, had not fallen out that way, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it had <U+017F>ome other; for, there is nothing firme and truly <U+017F>olid among<U+017F>t men. I cannot <U+017F>ay, but perfect prudence may a litle fore<U+017F>ee, and mitigate the<U+017F>e accidents; but believe me, Si<U+017F>ter, we mu<U+017F>t know withall, that we are all but human, and full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. You <U+017F>ee, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> how <U+017F>ome do pa<U+017F><U+017F>e their lives: more <U+017F>weetly than others, or at the lea<U+017F>t, their actions are not <U+017F>een or known unto the world; and I need not go any further for an in<U+017F>tance, then in your misfortune in <hi>Philander;</hi> but who can blame you for it? Ah Si<U+017F>ter! <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> there is no <U+017F>harper reproofes of our faults, then the knowledge that we our <U+017F>elves have of them. It is very true, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but you mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that as any good which we do enjoy; is better and greater for being known; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>orrowes and pains, when they are known, are far more bitter and <U+017F>marting: And hence it is, that every one <U+017F>trives to hide and conceal the afflictions which befall them, and oftentimes had rather they were greater and <U+017F>ecret, then le<U+017F><U+017F>e and publick. Now, Si<U+017F>ter, there is one thing, which my affection to you prompts me to adverti<U+017F>e you of, unto which me thinks your prudence ought to apply <U+017F>ome remedies; and I am <U+017F>ure, if before my misfortune did befall me, I had met with a friend who had freely <U+017F>poken unto me, I <U+017F>hould not have been <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly a<U+017F>hamed as I am. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> this is a great argument of your good affection to me; and you will infinitely oblige me, if not only now, but alwaies, you will tell me your opinion of all my actions, freely, and clearly, and e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now, when all are a<U+017F>leep.</p>
               <p>Although the<U+017F>e two Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es did think, that none did hear them, yet they were deceived; for <hi>Laonice,</hi> who was in the company, although <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be a<U+017F>leep, yet <U+017F>he was awake; and being extreamly de<U+017F>irous to hear more, that <U+017F>he might, according to her de<U+017F>igne do them a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, <U+017F>he li<U+017F>tened with a mo<U+017F>t attentive ear. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>eeing all his company a<U+017F>leep, and hearing the <U+017F>heph earde<U+017F><U+017F>es talking, he thought that he heard the voice of <hi>Diana;</hi> and having an itching de<U+017F>ire to hear their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>tole <U+017F>o gently neer them upon his hands and knees, as he could hear them very di<U+017F>tinctly; and by fortune, he came ju<U+017F>t as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did begin to <U+017F>ay thus.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what I <U+017F>aid unto you ye<U+017F>terday in you ear, when <hi>Silvander</hi> di<U+017F>puted with <hi>Phillis?</hi> Was it not (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> concerning the affection of that <U+017F>hepheard towards me?

Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> after <U+017F>he had a while con<U+017F>idered upon it) I <U+017F>ee you make your love unto me mo<U+017F>t evidently appear, and will keep any thing <U+017F>ecret which I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay; I will therefore open my very heart unto you, but with a hearty de<U+017F>ire, that what e're I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay may go no further, no, not to <hi>Phillis</hi> her <U+017F>elfe, if it be no offence to the friend<U+017F>hip that is betwixt you. I <U+017F>hould think, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> my <U+017F>elfe unworthy of your love, if I <U+017F>hould impart any <U+017F>ecret which you <U+017F>hall tru<U+017F>t me withall, unto any other; nay, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53526:157"/>
to be a mo<U+017F>t horrid Traitor: And as for <hi>Phillis,</hi> be confident, Si<U+017F>ter, that as I would not do any act which might wound that affection I bear unto her, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall never make me offend again<U+017F>t the love I have vowed unto you. Not that I have any diffidence in the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of <hi>Phillis,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> but becau<U+017F>e I would, if I could, hide it from my own <U+017F>elfe. Upon this, <U+017F>he pau<U+017F>ed a while, and then continued: When I lo<U+017F>t <hi>Philander,</hi> (as, Si<U+017F>ter, I have told you) I was <U+017F>o exceedingly grieved at it, that for a long time after, I re<U+017F>olved never to love any again, but to <U+017F>pend all the re<U+017F>t of my mourning daies in an eternall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood: For, though <hi>Philander</hi> was not my Husband, yet I do verily believe he had been, if he had <U+017F>urvived <hi>Philidas.</hi> In this re<U+017F>olution, I may mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>afely and truely prote<U+017F>t unto you, I have lived hitherto, <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any love, as if I had neither any eyes or ears, to <U+017F>ee or hear any motion that was pre<U+017F>ented unto me in that kinde; <hi>Amidor,</hi> kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto <hi>Philidas,</hi> can te<U+017F>tifie as much, who, though of a wavering humour, had parts <U+017F>ufficient to make him<U+017F>elfe loved, and who before he married <hi>Alf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>runte,</hi> did often offer to take me upon what conditions <U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hould require: Witne<U+017F><U+017F>e al<U+017F>o the poor <hi>Nican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> I call him poor, becau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>trange cour<U+017F>e which he took after my refu<U+017F>all. To be briefe, witne<U+017F><U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e, who <U+017F>ince that day have made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of love unto me. The memory of <hi>Philander</hi> has unto this very day <U+017F>o defended me again<U+017F>t all others, as I have not had <U+017F>o much as any thought of love. But I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>ince the faigned addre<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Silvander,</hi> I perceived my <U+017F>elfe much changed: I know, this <U+017F>hepheard at the fir<U+017F>t, did only court me for a wager; and yet as <U+017F>oon as he began, his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es did plea<U+017F>e me. On the contrary, the generous <hi>Paris</hi> did very really love me, and quitted the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of his quality for my <U+017F>ake and yet for all his merits, I could finde in my <U+017F>elfe no other love unto him, then that of a Si<U+017F>ter unto a Brother. To finde out the rea<U+017F>on of all this, is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but yet it is mo<U+017F>t certainly true. Now, Si<U+017F>ter, if I do <U+017F>ay, that I do love <hi>Silvander</hi> after another manner, mi<U+017F>take me not; do not think that I am in love with him, but that I do re<U+017F>ent the very <U+017F>ame beginings, which I remember I re<U+017F>ented at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my affection unto <hi>Philander.</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> unto her) what is it which plea<U+017F>eth you be<U+017F>t in him? Fir<U+017F>t, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> I perceive, he never loved any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this cannot be attributed unto any <U+017F>tupidity of his under<U+017F>tanding, <U+017F>ince he does plainly evidence the contrary by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: Then he does <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omely <U+017F>ubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, and gives me <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>olute power over his will, as he never <U+017F>peaks a word, but he fears the offending me. Then again, there is a continued and con<U+017F>tant di<U+017F>cretion in all the actions of his life, you <U+017F>hal never <U+017F>ee him either too much or too little in any thing he does: and la<U+017F>tly, which is the prime cau<U+017F>e of my amity, I do think him to be an hone<U+017F>t, plain, open-hearted man, and without vice. I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> I do ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame qualities to be in this <U+017F>hepheard; and for my part, I do think, that if ever the heavens do de<U+017F>tinate you to love any, you will be very happy in him. But let me tell you, that if you will avoid di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e all your prudence. I do wonder, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> why you <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion unto me; for know, that though I do love him better then any other I ever <U+017F>aw, <U+017F>ince the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Philander;</hi> yet, I would not have him to know it, or that I have any intention to let him <U+017F>erve me; and that if he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o bold, as to declare it unto me, I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, I would treat him <U+017F>o, as he <U+017F>hould never dare to <U+017F>peak of it twice unto me. But, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what is then your intention? To puni<U+017F>h us both, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana;</hi> I mean to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e him for his pre<U+017F>ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in loving me, and al<U+017F>o to puni<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elfe, for my fault in liking him, to the end, we may both be more ju<U+017F>t, and better advi<U+017F>ed. But, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> this de<U+017F>igne in my apprehen<U+017F>ion is very pernicious; for by this, you bring your <U+017F>elfe no <U+017F>atisfaction, but much <U+017F>orrow, and perhaps extream <U+017F>hame. Take heed, le<U+017F>t in holding a flint, you <U+017F>trike fire, if you <U+017F>trike it again<U+017F>t any thing which is harder, and <U+017F>o the hidden fire di<U+017F>cover it <U+017F>elfe. Young <U+017F>pirits and hearts, if they do love well, and if they be prudent, they will di<U+017F>creetly hide their affections, and not di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>e them unto any of their acquaintance; but, when they are <U+017F>trucken, I mean, when they are rigorou<U+017F>ly u<U+017F>ed, then they are <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible they <U+017F>hould di<U+017F><U+017F>emble. And this, believe it, cannot be without abundance of vexation and <U+017F>orrow, in the <U+017F>oul of her that is concerned; for, on which <U+017F>ide <U+017F>oever the reports go, they cannot be advantagious to the woman. Your wi<U+017F>dome, Si<U+017F>ter, does enable you, to give very good coun<U+017F>ell unto any other; but the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t eyes are often blinde in their own ca<U+017F>e: And this invites me to ask you, Whether do you love this <U+017F>hepheard? or you do not love him? for if you love him not, then break off all manner of conference, and all corre<U+017F>pondency with him, and <U+017F>o entirely and <U+017F>peedily,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53526:158"/>
that he may not have one <U+017F>park of any hopes from you: And in this, do not flatter your <U+017F>elfe and <U+017F>ay, that a woman cannot help it, if men will needs love her, no more then <U+017F>he can hinder them from looking upon her; this is an excu<U+017F>e to fool <U+017F>ome <U+017F>illy per<U+017F>on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: For, at the very fir<U+017F>t, the fire mu<U+017F>t be quenched, all hopes mu<U+017F>t be taken from him, not in part, but totally and entirely. If there be found <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ome opinionative and ob<U+017F>tinate man, it is only for a few daies; for certainly, Love, no more then all other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, cannot live without nutriment, and the proper nutriment of Love, is Hope. But then, if you do love, as you <U+017F>ay, and as indeed he de<U+017F>erves, then, Si<U+017F>ter, me thinks it is a great folly, to deprive your <U+017F>elfe of that which plea<U+017F>eth you. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth is not alwaies honourable, nor rea<U+017F>onable; and <U+017F>ince they are not, vertue commands us to <U+017F>hun them; and, for my part, I had rather die, than do otherwi<U+017F>e. I make no que<U+017F>tion of it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for I am mo<U+017F>t confident of <hi>Diana's</hi> vertue. But pray let us <U+017F>ee whether this act be contrary unto rea<U+017F>on or honour. Is it any way in the world contrary to rea<U+017F>on, to love a generous, wi<U+017F>e, hand<U+017F>ome, and di<U+017F>creet Shepheard? For my part, it <U+017F>eemes unto me <U+017F>o full of rea<U+017F>on, as I can <U+017F>ee no contrariety in it. Now any thing that is rea<U+017F>onable, cannot be di<U+017F>honourable; and <U+017F>ince it is not, why <U+017F>hould you not love him? It is an ea<U+017F>y matter to conclude in the advantage of this <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> as long as none does contradict it; but to argue thus: Is it rea<U+017F>onable that <hi>Diana,</hi> who hath ever held a good repatation among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es of this Country, <U+017F>hould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an unknown <U+017F>hepheard? one, who has nothing but him<U+017F>elfe, and what his ingennity acquires? I believe you will decline from your fir<U+017F>t opinion upon this con<U+017F>ideration: And upon this cau<U+017F>e, I am fully re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>uffer his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es and affection no longer, then I can faigne and <U+017F>eem not to believe it: But, if be <U+017F>hould bring me to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I could not umbrage my <U+017F>elfe under this <U+017F>hadow, I do prote<U+017F>t I will pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>card him and never permit him to <U+017F>ee me; or, if he did either <U+017F>ee me, or <U+017F>peak to me, or love me, I will treat him in <U+017F>uch a manner, as he <U+017F>hall believe me in good earne<U+017F>t, and, I think love me no longer. And what will you your <U+017F>elfe do, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> in the mean time? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I will love him, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and I will puni<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elfe for my offence in <U+017F>o doing. I do fore<U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that this vain Chimera will afford you but fal<U+017F>e contentment, and that this de<U+017F>igne will beget in you many a mortall di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, and thinking that none did hear them, <hi>Laonice</hi> was <U+017F>o attentive, that not to lo<U+017F>e one <U+017F>yllable of what was <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t hardly breathe, for, there was nothing which <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire, as to di<U+017F>cover this which <U+017F>he heard.

It was well for him, that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es had a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to <U+017F>leep, otherwi<U+017F>e it had been impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but he <U+017F>hould have di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elfe to be there, by <U+017F>ome of his deep and groaning <U+017F>ighes; for, he could not obtain <U+017F>o much of him<U+017F>elfe, as to go further and <U+017F>igh at ea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous was he to hear the end of their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and therefore I <U+017F>ay, it was well for him, that after they had bid goodnight unto each other, they pre<U+017F>ently fell a<U+017F>leep; for then he retired, and went to his companions, looking whether any of them were awake; and finding them to be all fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep, he began to entertain his own thoughts, and lifting up his eyes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated upon the Stars, and the various Chimaeraes which were formed in the Clouds; but he found none among<U+017F>t them <U+017F>o various as his own thoughts, upon the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which he had heard, buying his knowledge, that <hi>Diana</hi> loved him, very dear, making a doubt, whether he was more obliged to his curio<U+017F>ity, which let him know <U+017F>he loved him, or di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged unto it, for hearing that cruell re<U+017F>olution which <U+017F>he had taken. This imagination held a long debate in his <U+017F>oul: At la<U+017F>t, Love, out of very pitty, clo<U+017F>ed his eyes, and <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to fall a<U+017F>leep.</p>
               <p>But now it is full time to return unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> whom we have long left in his Cell, without any company but his own thoughts, which had no other <U+017F>ubject for them<U+017F>elves, but his pa<U+017F>t happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and his pre<U+017F>ent mi<U+017F>ery. Fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen daies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus on, with <U+017F>o little care of his life, that <U+017F>orrowes nouri<U+017F>hed him more, then any other thing which he eat: All his delight was in his imaginations in which he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away his daies and nights, which were all one to him, <U+017F>ince being <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tant from the eyes of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> all <U+017F>eemed dark. There was not one pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in all his life which came not then into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53526:158"/>
and to his mi<U+017F>ery, he alwaies <U+017F>tayed longe<U+017F>t upon tho<U+017F>e, that were mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ad, as mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable to his pre<U+017F>ent condition: If at any time he had any more plea<U+017F>ing, he pre<U+017F>ently gave them a check, as not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a <U+017F>oul, to <U+017F>ee any contentment. Thus <U+017F>pending his time in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad exerci<U+017F>es, and his food being very bad, his countenance was <U+017F>o altered, as it was not knowable; and certainly he could not have lived long, if the heavens, (who perhaps re<U+017F>erved him for <U+017F>ome better fortune) had not <U+017F>ent him <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>olation.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ame day that he e<U+017F>caped out of <hi>Galathea's</hi> hands, by the help of <hi>Adamas, Silvia,</hi> and <hi>Leonida, Galathea</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to wait upon her Mother unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome publick ceremonies of joy which they were to perform, for the happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e which <hi>Clidaman</hi> had in the Army of the <hi>Francs.</hi> But when <U+017F>he came there, and heard that <hi>Celadon</hi> was e<U+017F>caped, <U+017F>he was in <U+017F>uch a fury again<U+017F>t <hi>Leonida,</hi> that <U+017F>he forbid her to come into her pre<U+017F>ence: This fair Nymph being weary of the Courts noi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he retired to the hou<U+017F>e of her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> who was as tender of her, as if <U+017F>he had been his own Daughter, as well by rea<U+017F>on of Con<U+017F>anguinity, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was recommended unto him by <hi>Belizar</hi> his Brother, before his death. And though <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t all hopes from her pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, yet, <U+017F>he was very glad to recover her liberty at that rate; but much more, in hopes to <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon</hi> again, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing he would be near <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and though <U+017F>he believed, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> would da<U+017F>h all her hopes in him, yet <U+017F>he thought it would be a mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing <U+017F>atisfaction unto her, to <U+017F>pend all her time neer him: And therefore finding <hi>Paris</hi> to be very well di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto <U+017F>uch a vi<U+017F>it, about <U+017F>ome two daies after <U+017F>he came unto her Uncles, they went both together unto the Townes where the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when <U+017F>he came there, and enquired of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and heard that he was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but that they all believed him to be dead, <U+017F>he was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed: However, in <U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was an adorer of <hi>Diana,</hi> and in plea<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe with their good company; <U+017F>he was a frequent vi<U+017F>itant, and grew into <U+017F>uch familiarity with the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that they did infinitely love her, and <U+017F>he them, and lived with them as if <U+017F>he were a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, with which kinde of life, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>he would often go unto them with <hi>Paris,</hi> and it being not above a mile betwixt both their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <U+017F>he would often go by her <U+017F>elfe; and the way was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, by rea<U+017F>on of the delectable River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the delightfull Groves which <U+017F>he went through, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be weary. It hapned then, that re<U+017F>olving one day to go alone, <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the Bridge, and walking along the River <U+017F>ide; though there was no path, yet the way was delight<U+017F>ome, by rea<U+017F>on of the plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he took in looking at the fi<U+017F>hes, which flocked by troopes unto the River <U+017F>ide; and <U+017F>o delighting her <U+017F>elfe along the water <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he came unawares unto the Fountain, where <hi>Celadon</hi> u<U+017F>ed to gather his <hi>VVater-Cre<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> which was his food. As fortune was, that <U+017F>hepheard being laid down, was fallen a<U+017F>leep a little before. When the Nymph fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>pied him, <U+017F>he took him for <hi>Lycidas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e two Brothers were both of a <U+017F>tature and proportion, and u<U+017F>ed to habit them<U+017F>elves both alike; and though <hi>Celadon</hi> was a little bigger, and had a more full and plea<U+017F>ing face, yet comming neerer him, <U+017F>he was mi<U+017F>taken, as well, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought <hi>Celadon</hi> was not in that Country, as, becau<U+017F>e his face was much changed; or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> being full of jealou<U+017F>ie, as <U+017F>he knew he was, might very well be retired from all company into that <U+017F>olitary place: And therefore <U+017F>he <U+017F>ett her <U+017F>elf down by <hi>Celadon,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be <hi>Lycidas;</hi> but <U+017F>eeing he did not wake, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to go on her voyage, and leave him to his re<U+017F>t: but before <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied a little bag, wherein he was wont to keep his Letters, which hung a little out of his pocket; <U+017F>he gently took them, without any di<U+017F>turbance to his <U+017F>leep, and after this piece of theft, <U+017F>he went away, leaving the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard a<U+017F>leep, who pre<U+017F>ently after awaked; and becau<U+017F>e the Sun began to be hot, he went for <U+017F>hade unto the thicke<U+017F>t part of the Wood: But the memory of his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e being the Center of all his thoughts, he opened a little Ca<U+017F>e which he wore about his neck, in which was the Picture of <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and after he had a while contemplated it, he read the<U+017F>e words, which formerly he had written upon the <U+017F>ide of it.</p>

               <p>Alas poor mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, how can<U+017F>t thou now <U+017F>ay, that being deprived of the true good, the fal<U+017F>e ones <U+017F>hould comfort thee? The good thou ha<U+017F>t is meerly imaginary, and the true good is ravi<U+017F>hed from thee, by her who is the owner of it. Afterwards loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon the Picture, and <U+017F>peaking unto it, as if to <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> her <U+017F>elfe: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53526:159"/>
Oh my faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he) that I <U+017F>hould thus di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you? But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that having di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed you, I <U+017F>hould yet live? If I did di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e, it is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that it <U+017F>hould be with my will; nor is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire to live after <U+017F>uch a crime. If <U+017F>he would have me live, Oh! why does <U+017F>he bani<U+017F>h me from that place in which I can only live? And if <U+017F>he would have me die, why does <U+017F>he not po<U+017F>itively command it? But alas, what more expre<U+017F><U+017F>e command can I expect, then her command never to come into her pre<U+017F>ence? She knowes, that the <U+017F>ight of her is my life; and in forbidding me to <U+017F>ee her, does <U+017F>he not command me to die? This, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, were enough to make me <U+017F>eek a death, did I not know, how that which is rea<U+017F>onable in the judgment of others, is without any <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of rea<U+017F>on in her. All others think it a thing mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, to love tho<U+017F>e that love her, and that amity ought to be rewarded with amity; but <U+017F>he thinks it rea<U+017F>onable, to hate tho<U+017F>e who do love and adore her. Why then <U+017F>hould I not think, that this command of living from her, is rather to make me live and <U+017F>uffer the more, then to abridge my pain by an anticipated death? But that cannot be it which <U+017F>he requires of me; for <U+017F>he knowes well enough, that I am not able to live <U+017F>o. Did <U+017F>he ever demand of me any proofes, but <U+017F>uch as are impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible? witne<U+017F><U+017F>e this command from her own mouth, and tho<U+017F>e Letters, by which <U+017F>he commanded me to counterfeit affection unto another. Then <U+017F>hutting up that dear Picture to read tho<U+017F>e Letters which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent him: Well, <U+017F>aid he <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t not live to my own contentment, I will live to her glory. Then putting up the little ca<U+017F>e into his brea<U+017F>t, he put his hand into his pocket, to take the Letters which were in a little bag, but when he could not finde them, he turned out all that he had in both his pockets, and not yet finding them, he went to his Cave, thinking that he had left them there; but not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them neither, there was not a tu<U+017F>t in all the Cave, nor betwixt the Cave and the Fountain, nor between the fountain, and all the places he had been at that day, but he turned it over and over; nay, not a leaf which was likely to hide them, but he <U+017F>ought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; <U+017F>o vexed was he at the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous was he to finde them: For, as the<U+017F>e Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were infinitely dear unto him, as being written by the fair hand of his deare<U+017F>t <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>o he loved them, as the witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of his fidelity, and as the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had in the mi<U+017F>erable life which he led. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing all his laborious que<U+017F>t to be in vain, and that there was no hopes of finding the<U+017F>e beloved Letters: Alas, alas, (<U+017F>aid he, lifting his eyes up to heaven) what unju<U+017F>t <hi>Daemon</hi> hath ravi<U+017F>hed from me that little remnant of contentment which I had? for a <hi>Daemon</hi> certainly it mu<U+017F>t needs be, <U+017F>ince no mortall ever u<U+017F>eth to come hither; or if they did, they would never have been <U+017F>o cruell. Well, well, <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, yet thou art happy in this thy mi<U+017F>erable life, though thou ha<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e happy te<U+017F>timonies of thy pa<U+017F>t felicity; comfort thy <U+017F>elfe in thy lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and render thanks unto heaven, that hath made thee <U+017F>o conformable unto the will of thy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and make it appear, that neither her rigour, nor the force of Fate, can ever make thee weary in obeying her, nor ever <U+017F>eparate thee from the thoughts of her; it is but <U+017F>it, that <U+017F>ince thou ha<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>t her good-will, thou <U+017F>houlde<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o lo<U+017F>e all manner of con<U+017F>olation.</p>

                        <hi>IT <U+017F>eemes, my Son, that you have le<U+017F><U+017F>e courage then I have: You <U+017F>ay, that it is a <U+017F>igne, that I do love the le<U+017F><U+017F>e, but <U+017F>ee how I prove the contrary: That which makes me <U+017F>urport all the mi<U+017F>eries which I endure for your <U+017F>ake, is certainly the affection which I bear unto you. Now that affection which makes me <U+017F>urmount the greate<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>eries, mu<U+017F>t needs be great; and therefore this courage which you blame in me, is a mark of my great affection. Never be <U+017F>tartled at the threats of our common Enemies (for <U+017F>o,</hi> Celadon, <hi>I call call them, and not Parents) if you will have me think your affection equall unto mine; which, for your <U+017F>ake, does not only <U+017F>urmount, but <U+017F>corn, all manner of mi<U+017F>eries and afflictions.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> read this Letter, not well knowing what <U+017F>he did: Now <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that it was <hi>Celadon</hi> and not <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and much more, when <U+017F>he remembered, that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> had <U+017F>poken to her of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch Letters. Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, certainly it is <hi>Celadon:</hi> Where was my eyes, that I could not know him when I <U+017F>aw him? Then <U+017F>he lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up the Letters, and went with all <U+017F>peed unto the Fountain, where <U+017F>he left him; but extreamly angry <U+017F>he was with her <U+017F>elfe, when <U+017F>he found him not there, and broke into many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of griefe: Then <U+017F>he turned about every way, to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>he could finde any relicks of him; but he was retired into his Cave, after his long and laborious <U+017F>earch, for what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>tolne. At the la<U+017F>t, Love, which is alwaies very circum<U+017F>pect, prompted her to take notice, that the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e about the Fountain was troden, and that there was a new Path, not halfe beaten; <U+017F>he imagined very aptly, that this Path would conduct her to the place where the <U+017F>hepheard was: And indeed, <hi>Celadon</hi> u<U+017F>ing to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e between his Cave and that place, had made a kinde of a Path. <hi>Leonida</hi> then taking it for her guide; <U+017F>he had not followed it foure or five hundred paces, but <U+017F>he came to the Rock, where <hi>Celadon</hi> made his retreat; yet, the trees and bu<U+017F>hes being very thick about it, <U+017F>he was afraid to approach neer, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould prove the den of <U+017F>ome Wolfe or wilde Boar, or at the lea<U+017F>t, of many Serpents. As <U+017F>he was <U+017F>tanding thus in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, <U+017F>he thought that <U+017F>he heard him breathe, which a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her, that <U+017F>ome was there; but knowing, that Serpents do <U+017F>ometimes hi<U+017F><U+017F>e in the <U+017F>ame manner, <U+017F>he therefore trode very circum<U+017F>pectly and cautiou<U+017F>ly, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oftly, that <hi>Celadon</hi> never perceived her: And though <U+017F>he did afterwards make <U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e, yet the <U+017F>hepheard was <U+017F>o attentive upon his own thoughts, that he took no notice of her. Now <U+017F>he was got <U+017F>o neer the entrance, that <U+017F>he heard him breathe plainly, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>peak, yet <U+017F>he could not under<U+017F>tand the words; but comming a little neer, and putting her head a little into the entrance, <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>ay thus: Now heart begin to hope well; for, as the <U+017F>nuffe of the Lamp cea<U+017F>eth to burn, when the flame hath con<U+017F>umed all the Oyle; <U+017F>o may I hope my mi<U+017F>eries will cea<U+017F>e,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53526:160"/>
having by little and little con<U+017F>umed all the comforts and contentments that I have. Oh happy lo<U+017F><U+017F>e! how I would cheri<U+017F>h thee, if by thy means, I go out of this mi<U+017F>erable life which I lead? Oh my deare<U+017F>t Papers! how I would ble<U+017F><U+017F>e the day on which you were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hed from me, if my grieving for your lo<U+017F><U+017F>e would end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
                  </gap>? For, alas! there is no hopes left, that my <U+017F>orrowes <U+017F>hould ever end, but with my life. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing this, was moved with much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion knowing him now to be <hi>Celadon;</hi> and was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden joy, that though <U+017F>he had a great de<U+017F>ire to let him complain on, and hearken longer what he <U+017F>aid; yet, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to go to him with open armes, and cry unto him: Ah <hi>Celadon,</hi> away with the<U+017F>e lamentations and <U+017F>orrowes, you have had too many of them; 'tis time now to change your cour<U+017F>e of life, and enjoy <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant dayes. You may ea<U+017F>ily imagine, that <hi>Celadon</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, when he heard this voice upon a <U+017F>udden, and <U+017F>eeing her come unto him, for he had not <U+017F>een any of a long time; and his <U+017F>pirits being wholly retired into his thoughts, <U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken all this, before he heard or knew what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid. He <U+017F>tarted up upon a <U+017F>udden, but the life which he had lived, and bad food together, had <U+017F>o weakened him, that he was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>it down again pre<U+017F>ently. Then the Nymph gave him lea<U+017F>ure to recollect him<U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>itting down by him, took him by the hand.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Celadon,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) did you <U+017F>o impatiently de<U+017F>ire to get out of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>'s hands, only to live thus? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, our company <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing to you, that you had rather be among<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>le<U+017F><U+017F>e Rocks and wild Woods? The Shepheard having recollected his <U+017F>pirits, did faintly an<U+017F>wer: You <U+017F>ee, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> unto what Love hath brought me, and what power you have over tho<U+017F>e that love you. How is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that Love <U+017F>hould make you thus neglect your own pre<U+017F>ervation? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <U+017F>hepheard, that you, who vaunts to know what Love is, <U+017F>hould doubt, but that my affection can endure the greate<U+017F>t extremities? However, replyed the Nymph, if I were condemned to die, I would at the lea<U+017F>t ask him that condemned me, the rea<U+017F>on why I am condemned. What better rea<U+017F>on can be given, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> then that <U+017F>he, who has the <U+017F>overaigne power over me, will have it <U+017F>o? <U+017F>o as the rea<U+017F>on of my ill-being is, becau<U+017F>e my well-being di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth her. Oh <hi>Celadon!</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Nymph, and pittyed him) in what a mi<U+017F>erable condition you are? See, <U+017F>age Nymph, <U+017F>aid he, how you are mi<U+017F>taken, I cannot de<U+017F>ire more happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, then the mi<U+017F>ery which I endure; for, can I wi<U+017F>h a greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, then to plea<U+017F>e her? If my mi<U+017F>ery plea<U+017F>e her can I grieve for it? No, no, I mu<U+017F>t rejoyce at what<U+017F>oever is plea<U+017F>ing unto her. Oh happy <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) and in one thing the more happy, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> does not know that thou art happy. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>tood a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, and looked upon him with admiration: At la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>he had been a long while mute, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>hepheard, that if this be the way to love, there is only you among<U+017F>t all men living, that can follow it. But, <U+017F>hepheard, take heed, that as many good things are corrupted and <U+017F>poiled with abu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o your melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ob<U+017F>tinacy do not corrupt your affection. I care not for all the accidents that can come, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>o my Love be not offended. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> do you love <hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> You aske me a que<U+017F>tion, an<U+017F>wered he, unto which you are able to give an an<U+017F>wer your <U+017F>elfe. If you do love her, (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) you ought to love all that's hers, and if <U+017F>o, then you ought to love your <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o entirely hers, that you are not your own. Since I do love <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> replyed the <U+017F>hepheard, I ought to hate all that <U+017F>he hates: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hates the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Celadon,</hi> why then, fair Nymph, <U+017F>hould not I? Every one, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is obliged, to have a greater care of their own pre<U+017F>ervation, then of the love or hatred of any other. That Law, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, is good and allowable among<U+017F>t Men, but not among<U+017F>t Lovers. Why, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, do they cea<U+017F>e to be Men, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lovers? If you do mean a man, <U+017F>aid he, that is <U+017F>ubject unto all <U+017F>orts of mi<U+017F>eries and inquiotudes, I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that a Lover remaines a Man <U+017F>till; but, if that Man have any will of his own, and judges of things as they are, and not according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of another I deny, that a Lover is a man, <U+017F>ince as <U+017F>oon as ever he becomes a Lover, he does <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe of his will and judgment, as he neither willeth nor judgeth, but as <U+017F>he willeth and judgeth whom he loves. Oh, the mi<U+017F>erable condition of a Lover! (<U+017F>aid the Nymph). But much more mi<U+017F>erable (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) is he, that loves not, <U+017F>ince he cannot enjoy the mo<U+017F>t perfect and highe<U+017F>t happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the world affords; for, the very lea<U+017F>t of Loves joyes, does exceed all others that the world hath without it. Is there any plea<U+017F>ure comparable unto tho<U+017F>e, that con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the thought? When a Lover thinks upon the beauty of her that he loves; nay, when he does but remember any one of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53526:160"/>
her actions, nay, even the very place where he la<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw her; do you think he would change his contentment, for any diver<U+017F>ion in the whole Univer<U+017F>e? He is <U+017F>o jealous, and <U+017F>o care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to entertain this very thought, that le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould make any a <U+017F>harer with him, he will retire into the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary and unfrequented places, that he can finde; he cares not for the <U+017F>ociety of men, or all the delights that men can devi<U+017F>e, and u<U+017F>e to court with <U+017F>uch care, <U+017F>o he may but enjoy his own thoughts. Now, <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>ince the contentment of thoughts are <U+017F>uch, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of any human heart <U+017F>hould think to endure <U+017F>o much bli<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to enjoy the <U+017F>ight of her whom he loves, to hear her <U+017F>peak, to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand, to hear her own mouth pronounce the word, <hi>I love you?</hi> Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould hear this, and not be ravi<U+017F>hed, and be di<U+017F>ordered with too much felicity and delight? I do not mention tho<U+017F>e great and la<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>urances, which one receives when he is loved, nor tho<U+017F>e langui<U+017F>hments in the brea<U+017F>t of the per<U+017F>on loved; for, the<U+017F>e are contentments of <U+017F>o high a nature, as they cannot be gu<U+017F>ted without tran<U+017F>port, and ab<U+017F>olute ravi<U+017F>hment out of our <U+017F>elves, nor can they be expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by any words, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e imperfectly. Now tell me, fair Nymph, whether the condition of a Lover be <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable now, I <U+017F>ay, when you know what high felicities he does enjoy? I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid the Nymph, after <U+017F>he had heard him with admiration) that <hi>Celadon</hi> does love, if to love be, to be out of his wits, and to live only upon bare thoughts. Alas! I cannot chu<U+017F>e but think his condition extreamly mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in finding <U+017F>uch contentments in <U+017F>uch vain imaginations and Chimeraes; and I am <U+017F>o far from thinking them felicities, as my opinion of the contrary is much fortified. But Shepheard, let us leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee it will do you no good, and tell me, how you have lived <U+017F>ince I left you? Wi<U+017F>e Nymph, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I have lived <U+017F>ince you met me, <U+017F>o have I lived <U+017F>ince I parted from you; for, as <U+017F>oon as ever I left you, I <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elfe up in this place, expecting untill either Love or Death relea<U+017F>ed me. But why, <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do you not go unto your own Town, where your friends and kindred do <U+017F>o much grieve for you? <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, who has a far greater power over me, than either any Parents or friends, hath forbidden me ever to <U+017F>ee her, untill <U+017F>he command; and therefore, as I told you, I have <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elfe up in this Cell, untill either Love or Death relea<U+017F>e me. But, if my adored Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e had commanded me never to <U+017F>ee her again, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had <U+017F>hut my <U+017F>elfe up in my grave with death: And as <U+017F>oon as I came to my <U+017F>elfe again, after my fall into the River, I knew, that <hi>Lignon</hi> would not give me a death, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did not peremptorily command it; but, remembering her words, and that her bani<U+017F>hment of me was not for ever, only untill <U+017F>he commanded me to return, I have lived in this manner as you <U+017F>ee, expecting till Love recall me, as it <U+017F>eemes <U+017F>he hath promi<U+017F>ed; or el<U+017F>e untill death do it for her, which <U+017F>hall be welcome unto me in this life which I live. But poor deceived <U+017F>hepheard, replyed the Nymph, how can you ever hope <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call you, as long as <U+017F>he is ignorant where you are? Love, an<U+017F>wered he, which conducted me hither, knowes the place well enough where I am, and does daily vi<U+017F>it me; and <U+017F>ince it is by it, that I do hope <U+017F>he will recall me, there is no doubt, but it will without me let her know the place, unto which it hath conducted me. If your imaginations, replyed the Nymph, had an influence upon others, as they have upon your <U+017F>elfe, all this you <U+017F>ay might perhaps be; but believe it, <U+017F>hepheard, the gods will never help tho<U+017F>e, who will not help them<U+017F>elves; and do not think, that I <U+017F>peak without good rea<U+017F>on, for I am very certain, that if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did know you were alive, <U+017F>he would pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire your company. How fair Nymph, (<U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently) do you know that? I know it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, by that <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e which <U+017F>its in her face. Perhaps, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, that proceeds from <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e. But where have you <U+017F>een her <U+017F>ince we parted? I <U+017F>hall be very glad, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to entertain you with a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this <U+017F>ubject, and to relate unto you all that hath hapned <U+017F>ince we parted, <U+017F>o I can but by it cheer you a little up, and rou<U+017F>e you out of this dull kinde of life. Believe it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that the <U+017F>ight of you does bring me more content, then any thing in the world could, except <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and <U+017F>ince I am deprived of her, your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e will be very plea<U+017F>ing unto me.

break it off, and fini<U+017F>h it another time, when any convenient opportunity <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elfe. Know therefore, that in my return from conducting you, I came into the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>oures,</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time when <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was taking Coach, to go unto <hi>Marcelies,</hi> and carrying <hi>Galathea</hi> with her; becau<U+017F>e being de<U+017F>irous to render thanks unto <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> for the happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e of her Son <hi>Clidaman,</hi> which he had in the Battle again<U+017F>t the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians,</hi> <U+017F>he would by all means have <hi>Galathea</hi> with her, purpo<U+017F>ely to render the <U+017F>olemnity more celebrated. And becau<U+017F>e retardment in <U+017F>uch actions as the<U+017F>e, does in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort re<U+017F>emble oblivion; and oblivion, ingratitude; <U+017F>he departed <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>carcely gave the Nymph time to tell us what we <U+017F>hould do with you; and though <U+017F>he was extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, yet <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not let it appear, le<U+017F>t <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hould take notice of it, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies held her by the hand, not out of any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, but only the more to carra<U+017F><U+017F>e her. <U+017F>he being thus con<U+017F>trained to go with her into the Coach, all that <U+017F>he could do, was to <U+017F>ay thus unto me: You, <hi>Silvia,</hi> and <hi>Lucinde,</hi> come after us in my Coach, and follow us with all the ha<U+017F>te you can. I made a low reverence, and <U+017F>hewed by my actions, that I did under<U+017F>tand what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid; but I did not intend to obey her, becau<U+017F>e my aimes were only upon you: And though I did well enough fore<U+017F>ee her anger, yet, I preferred the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which I intended to you, above it, chu<U+017F>ing rather to fail in my duty to that Nymph, then in my affection to you. However, faigning as if my going out were in obedience to my Uncle, I met <hi>Silvia,</hi> who was in que<U+017F>t of me, and I told her, how you was e<U+017F>caped, whil<U+017F>t none took any notice of you. But I was never in all my life <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, as when in my return from you, I met <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> as they were taking Coach; for, I had been utterly undone, if they had <U+017F>pied me out of the dores. But I did addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe unto my Uncle and <hi>Silvia:</hi> Father, <U+017F>aid I unto him, and <U+017F>miled, and you my dear Companion, you mu<U+017F>t needs both of you help me out in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Daughter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> never fear any blame for what you have done, as long as it is but what you ought to do, nor ever grieve upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions; the gods, upon whom all events depend, are <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, as they will ever bear you out; and if at any time the contrary <U+017F>eem to happen, take <U+017F>peciall notice, Daughter, that it is to redouble the contentment, and as if they hapned only to augment your joyes. And becau<U+017F>e it is very expedient, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pre<U+017F>erve your <U+017F>elfe in the favour of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>hall te<U+017F>tifie, that you did not any thing, but what <U+017F>he knowes of very well; and to make the matter more ea<U+017F>ie for you, I am contented, that you <U+017F>hall both of you have <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of me; for, I <U+017F>hall not be <U+017F>orry that he <U+017F>hould think, that I do hate any thing which is contrary unto vertue: and I would permit you to charge me down-right with the act, but that it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>omething in her e<U+017F>teem, only to draw her off from tho<U+017F>e fooli<U+017F>h and fal<U+017F>e ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which <hi>Climanthes</hi> hath infu<U+017F>ed into her. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle did encourage us to continue in this laudable de<U+017F>igne: Afterwards he went home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and we towards <hi>Marcelles;</hi> but fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ulted together, what An<U+017F>wers <U+017F>hould be given unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould contradict one another, knowing very well, that no eye is <U+017F>o quick and penetrating, as the eye of Jealou<U+017F>ie. In the mean time, <hi>Galathea</hi>'s minde was only on her dear <hi>Lucinde,</hi> commending my wit and <U+017F>ubtlety in putting you into that habit, hoping, that under that <U+017F>hadow, <U+017F>he might without any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition have you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with her; not, <U+017F>hepheard, that <U+017F>he had ever any uncha<U+017F>t or unworthy thoughts, but de<U+017F>igning to marry you, and not daring to declare it as long as <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> lived, <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he might alwaies have you in her pre<U+017F>ence under that umbrage. And though <U+017F>he could not doubt of the affection which you had unto the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> yet flattering her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>he hoped, that the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o much grandore and magnificence, would ea<U+017F>ily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your love from that <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as hugging her <U+017F>elfe in the<U+017F>e thoughts, <U+017F>he was the mo<U+017F>t contented woman in the world, and nothing <U+017F>eemed tedious into her, but the length of the way: But, when <U+017F>he came to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and did not <U+017F>ee her dearly beloved <hi>Lucinde</hi> among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of her Nymphs, Oh! how <U+017F>he was di<U+017F>ordered? and what ha<U+017F>te did <U+017F>he make in going to her Chamber, and from her Chamber into her Clo<U+017F>et? I, who plainly fore<U+017F>aw this <U+017F>torme, did follow her, but not with that alacrity as u<U+017F>uall; and I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that being in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort guilty of trea<U+017F>on, I did fear her pre<U+017F>ence; and yet, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he did call, I ran unto her, and commanding me to <U+017F>hut the dore: Well <hi>Leonida,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) what's become of <hi>Celadon?</hi> Madam, (<U+017F>aid I unto her, <U+017F>eeming much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed) I cannot tell; for, as <U+017F>oon as ever you were gone, <hi>Silvia</hi> and I looked for him all over the Palace, and not finding him, we cannot devi<U+017F>e what <U+017F>hould become of him, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> can tell us.

Go, go, <hi>Leonida,</hi> go immediately to your Uncle; if <hi>Celadon</hi> be there, bring him hither, or otherwi<U+017F>e, never come again into my pre<U+017F>ence; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elfe, I <U+017F>hall make you fell the <U+017F>mart of this offence, as well as my <U+017F>elfe.

Madam, replyed <hi>Silvia,</hi> give me leave to tell you, what coun<U+017F>ell my Mother gave unto me when I left her: Daughter, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) when<U+017F>oever any of your Companions does you any injury, remember that you never <U+017F>hew as if you wi<U+017F>hed them any ill, untill you have found the means how to be revenged; for, if you do it at another <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>hew teeth before you be able to bite, it will but exa<U+017F>perate them the more again<U+017F>t you. So, Madam, you <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>hew your <U+017F>elfe di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed at <hi>Adamas,</hi> untill you can make him re<U+017F>ent your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, le<U+017F>t when he <U+017F>ees him<U+017F>elfe out of your favour, he <U+017F>hould either <U+017F>ay or do <U+017F>omething, that may more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. Thus by the prudence of this Nymph, <hi>Galathea</hi>'s anger again<U+017F>t me, was partly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, and <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to make no <U+017F>hew of any di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure to my Uncle, untill times changed; of which, <hi>Silvia</hi> did pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>e me, to the end, <hi>Adamas</hi> might be at the Fea<U+017F>ts, which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> prepared.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, <hi>Polemas</hi> was not without abundance of vexation; for he <U+017F>aw, that by every Letter which came from the Army, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However, I lived a life in the mean time not di<U+017F>agreeable to my minde, had I had the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which now I have, of <U+017F>eeing you.

the Nymph. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>he is one of the faire<U+017F>t, the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that I know, and one who de<U+017F>erves a good fortune; and I pray unto <hi>Tautates,</hi> that <U+017F>he may enjoy all the good fortune in the world. I am of your opinion, <U+017F>aid the Nymph; but I do not believe, that <U+017F>he will marry <hi>Paris,</hi> for <U+017F>he has told me, that truly <U+017F>he does love and honour him, that <U+017F>he knowes what an honour it is he <U+017F>hould make any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her, and what a great advantage <U+017F>uch a Match would be to her; but yet, though <U+017F>he knowes not why <U+017F>he cannot love him otherwi<U+017F>e then as a Brother, and that though <U+017F>he knowes him to be a man of great merit, yet <U+017F>he can love him no otherwi<U+017F>e. How, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> and interrupted her) does <U+017F>he <U+017F>peak of the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>o familiarly unto you? I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I think it very <U+017F>trange, when I remember her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was wont to be <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erved and clo<U+017F>e, even from her be<U+017F>t beloved Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> that they knew very little of her intentions. Oh <U+017F>hepheard! (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) there is great alterations within this three or foure Months, <U+017F>ince you have been there; for <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> are all one, they are alwaies together; and <U+017F>ince your <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Diana</hi> may be <U+017F>aid to <U+017F>ucceed in your room. Moreover, if you remember <hi>Silvander,</hi> whom they called, the Shepheard without affection, he is now <U+017F>o deeply in love, that except <hi>Celadon,</hi> none is comparable to him; and it came thus to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: <hi>Phillis</hi> and he fell into <U+017F>ome difference concerning their merits; and becau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hepheard, being educated in the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian Schooles, and having an excellent acute wit, did produce better and more valid rea<U+017F>ons, then that <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e could, <U+017F>he, out of a plea<U+017F>ant humour, propounded, that <hi>Silvander,</hi> to give a te<U+017F>timony of his merits, <U+017F>hould court and <U+017F>erve <hi>Diana</hi> with as much ob<U+017F>equious ob<U+017F>ervance, as if he did really love her. The <U+017F>hepheard accepted of the propo<U+017F>ition, upon condition, that <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>hould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to do the <U+017F>ame. After much di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and I, did ordain, that both of them <U+017F>hould court and <U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that at the three months end, that <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould judge, which of them two had mo<U+017F>t merits to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves loved. This being thus re<U+017F>olved, <hi>Diana</hi> was made choice of to be their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>ince this time, <hi>Phillis</hi> hath acted a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate part <U+017F>o very well, as no <U+017F>hepheard could better acquit him<U+017F>elfe. Now, <U+017F>ee what is the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of this fiction, <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, as I told you, was all in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, is become by his counterfeiting <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> as every one does plainly <U+017F>ee that he goes farther then the bounds of a <U+017F>iction; and I know, that <hi>Diana</hi> will give her judgment on his <U+017F>ide; for, though <U+017F>he is a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e of great mode<U+017F>ty and wi<U+017F>dome, yet it is well enough known, that this court<U+017F>hip does not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her; and for my part, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I know no <U+017F>hepheard, except <hi>Celadon,</hi> who is more worthy to be loved. And becau<U+017F>e of this faigned court<U+017F>hip, <hi>Phillis</hi> is almo<U+017F>t continually with <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> leaves her as <U+017F>eldome as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can. <hi>Lycidas,</hi> your Brother, thinks, that there is a matter of Love betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and is <U+017F>o fully per<U+017F>waded of it, as he is <U+017F>o jealous, that he cannot endure they <U+017F>hould be together. And <U+017F>ince <hi>Phillis</hi> cannot bani<U+017F>h her <U+017F>elfe from the company of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <U+017F>ince <hi>Diana</hi> is alwaies with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> with <hi>Diana,</hi> poor <hi>Lycidas,</hi> not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, never <U+017F>ees <hi>Phillis,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e at <U+017F>uch meetings when he cannot avoid it. This is a great alteration indeed (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>ad <hi>Celadon)</hi> and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e they are all much to be pittyed, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who is fallen into the very wor<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of Love; but I do not think it <U+017F>trange, for I know, the nature of my Brothers temper was alwaies apt to take <U+017F>uch impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: For my part, I mu<U+017F>t prote<U+017F>t, that we are not Brothers in that: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that I was once jealous, but I think it is, becau<U+017F>e all Lovers are once in their lives <U+017F>ubject unto it, as they <U+017F>ay little Children are, of a certain dangerous malady, which never comes unto them but once. <hi>Phillis</hi> al<U+017F>o is to blame, who, having given <U+017F>o many a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urances of her good-will unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> will <U+017F>uffer him to enter into any doubt of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but I do believe, that <U+017F>he knowing this jealou<U+017F>ie of my Brother does proceed from an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of Love, <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffers it with more patience. As for <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that two <U+017F>ubjects for love <U+017F>hould be more equally met; for, as <hi>Diana</hi> does <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Silvander</hi> in Beauty and E<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>o the vertue and merits of the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, do equally ballance the Scales: Yet, I do infinitely pitty them both, for I know them mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>olute Ma<U+017F>ters of them<U+017F>elves and actions; but now I know by experience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a Chaos of confu<U+017F>ion and troubles they are plunged <U+017F>o as I mu<U+017F>t needs pitty them, for making <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>advantageous change. Thus, wi<U+017F>e Nymph, we may <U+017F>ee, that there is no a<U+017F><U+017F>ured happine<U+017F><U+017F>es among<U+017F>t mortalls. <hi>Celadon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, you would be <hi>Tautates</hi> him<U+017F>elfe, if you could per<U+017F>wade them, that they are not much happier
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53526:163"/>
then before; nay, <hi>Silvander</hi> him<U+017F>elfe thinks <U+017F>o, who<U+017F>e company is much more plea<U+017F>ant then it was wont to be, as I have heard from tho<U+017F>e who knew him before. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> I am of that <U+017F>hepheards opinion; for, though there be <U+017F>ome pains in the life of Love, I pray tell me, in what kinde of life there is not <U+017F>o as well? But if you do con<U+017F>ider tho<U+017F>e contentments which a Lover receives, in loving and being loved, I believe you will agree with me, that there is no happier life then that of Love. Ah <hi>Celadon!</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Nymph, with a great <U+017F>igh) how dearly are tho<U+017F>e contentments bought, I refer it unto your own <U+017F>elfe, if you would but ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Every one that loves, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> does not meet with <hi>A<U+017F>trea's.</hi> But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>ince you are of this opinion, why do you <U+017F>ay, you pitty them? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> as it is a plea<U+017F>ing thing to conquer, <U+017F>o the contrary, to be conquered; therefore I fear, that there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of labour and pains to be taken in Love, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be overcome or a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed at the difficulties, and retire, before they have <U+017F>urmounted them. And therefore, have I not good rea<U+017F>on to pitty tho<U+017F>e, who I <U+017F>ee do enter into a danger, the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue whereof is <U+017F>o uncertain? But I do much wonder, how you <U+017F>hould know <U+017F>o much of <hi>Diana,</hi> whom I know to be alwaies the mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>erved and <U+017F>ecret of all our Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es. The love of <hi>Paris,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, is the cau<U+017F>e of it, who hath made me <U+017F>ee her ofter then otherwi<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould. I had a good inclination of my own to go unto your Town, in hopes to finde you there; and when I was thinking upon <U+017F>ome good excu<U+017F>e for it, I met with <hi>Paris,</hi> who, that night I returned, <U+017F>poke thus unto me: Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid he, for <hi>Adamas</hi> would have us call Brother and Si<U+017F>ter) do you remember how much contentment we received that night, we lay in the Town of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and how plea<U+017F>ing their conver<U+017F>ation was? I, who knew very well he had been oft there <U+017F>ince, did an<U+017F>wer him thus: I do, Brother, <U+017F>aid I; but I do believe, you have a better memory then I, and, as I have heard, have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rea<U+017F>on. It is true, <U+017F>aid he unto me; and I cannot deny, but that the merits of tho<U+017F>e fair and di<U+017F>creet Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, have much invited me to get their friend<U+017F>hip, and more then I make appear. Brother, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you tell me more then I aske. 'Tis no matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, and <U+017F>miled, I will ingenuou<U+017F>ly tell any thing unto you, in hopes, that you will not deny me one reque<U+017F>t that I <U+017F>hall make unto you, and which I do conjure you unto by our friend<U+017F>hip. Aske what you will Brother, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) for I cannot deny you any thing upon that conjuration. I be<U+017F>eech you then, (<U+017F>aid he) that <U+017F>ince you do not return unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> you will be plea<U+017F>ed to walk <U+017F>ometimes upon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away <U+017F>ome afternoones in the company of tho<U+017F>e fair and di<U+017F>creet Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and give me leave to wait upon you: you will think this place here to be very dull, having been accu<U+017F>tomed <U+017F>o long to the Court; but the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> have <U+017F>hades <U+017F>o cool and plea<U+017F>ant, as it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould be weary: you shall <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ilver <U+017F>treams <U+017F>o clear, and <U+017F>o filled with all <U+017F>orts of fishes, as you will admire; you shall hear all <U+017F>orts of Birds make the Woods Eccho, with a thou<U+017F>and varieties of voices; you shall finde <U+017F>uch clear, cool, and curious Fountains, as will invite you to drink of them.

No, no, <U+017F>aid he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that would be too trouble<U+017F>ome to you, and nothing conducing to my ends; I only de<U+017F>ire you to be with tho<U+017F>e Shephearde<U+017F>ses, and let me accompany you. I <U+017F>hall do, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what you would have me, <U+017F>aid I unto him; but take heed, this way do not prejudice your de<U+017F>igne; for in <U+017F>eeing <hi>Diana,</hi> under colour of keeping me company, <U+017F>he may perhaps think her <U+017F>elfe not obliged unto you for your vi<U+017F>it. <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto me, is not a per<U+017F>on who in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts upon <U+017F>uch ceremonious vanities, but is able out of her judgment to di<U+017F>cern my actions, and di<U+017F>cerning them, commend my di<U+017F>cretion.</p>
               <p>This re<U+017F>olution then was fixed upon among<U+017F>t us; and that very night, <hi>Paris</hi> told <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that if he thought good of it, he would wait upon me the next day a hunting, and that I much de<U+017F>ired it. Whither<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him; for <U+017F>uch was my love to her Father, as I can never <U+017F>ufficiently acquit my <U+017F>elfe of it unto his Daughter. This declaration did an<U+017F>wer the expectation of <hi>Paris,</hi> and therefore the next day, as <U+017F>oon as we had dined, we went down the Hill of <hi>Lacquier,</hi> and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over the River <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> at <hi>Trelin</hi> Bridge, we followed the River-<U+017F>ide, untill we were over again<U+017F>t <hi>Boutreux,</hi> we left the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e on the right hand, and came unto a little ri<U+017F>ing hill, from whence we might <U+017F>ee all the turnings and windings of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the Plaines, where the Shepheards and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es did drive their Flocks to feed: Then, by a little path, we de<U+017F>cended into the plain: See, Brother, <U+017F>aid I unto him, and pointed with my finger, yonder upon the right hand, is that tuft of Trees, where I fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis;</hi> and had you been with me in <hi>Silvia's</hi> room, perhaps we had ob<U+017F>erved more then we did; for, we being weary with walking, we fell a<U+017F>leep, and in the mean time, the<U+017F>e three <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es came, and <U+017F>at down clo<U+017F>e by us, and not <U+017F>pying us, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e they did not <U+017F>it in <U+017F>ilence; but as ill-fortune was, when we awaked, they were gone. 'Tis true, that <U+017F>ince I came by my <U+017F>elfe, and it was then when you met me, and when I heard all the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Diana.</hi> Ah Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid he up on a <U+017F>udden) I remember the time very well; it was then when I began to love another above my <U+017F>elfe. But, Si<U+017F>ter, I conjure and be<U+017F>eech you, by all obligations of friend<U+017F>hip, to tell me all that you know: Does <U+017F>he love any one? See, <U+017F>aid I, and <U+017F>miled, how jealous you are already? What did it concern you, if I knew more? Be contented, that I tell you what I think is requi<U+017F>ite and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for you to know. Ah cruell Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he unto me, you u<U+017F>e me as they do Children, <U+017F>hew them an Apple, to make them the more de<U+017F>ire it, and then not give it them. Lovers indeed, <U+017F>aid I, are little different from Children. But, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid he, can you not tell me, whether <U+017F>he loves me or no? It is more to be feared, that <U+017F>he will not love you, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) then that <U+017F>he will love any other. Although you threaten me extreamly, <U+017F>aid he, yet I am more glad of the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which you give me, that <U+017F>he loves no other; then I am <U+017F>orry for the doubt which you make, that <U+017F>he will not love me. Why, an<U+017F>wered I, will you not enjoy a good, if another have any <U+017F>hare with you? Before I can give you a full an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t make a long di<U+017F>tinction of Goods; but I will briefly tell you, that there are <U+017F>ome, which the more communicable they are, the better they are; and others, which are more to be e<U+017F>teemed, the le<U+017F><U+017F>e they are communicable: and in this la<U+017F>t order, mu<U+017F>t I rank the Goods of Love. I think, an<U+017F>wered I, that if I were in a capacity of loving, I <U+017F>hould be of the <U+017F>ame beliefe. But, let not this fear dimini<U+017F>h the favours you receive; for you may be mo<U+017F>t certainly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that tho<U+017F>e favoure you receive from her, (if ever you arrive at that Good) they will not be common.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> I have made this long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto you, to the end you may judge, how deeply <hi>Paris</hi> is in Love. Now I <U+017F>hall tell you <U+017F>omething concerning <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Walking thus down into the Plain, we e<U+017F>pied <hi>Silvander,</hi> who <U+017F>itting under a Tree, was <U+017F>o intent unto the Mu<U+017F>ick of his Bag-pipe, as he took no notice how <hi>Diana,</hi> knowing his voice, <U+017F>tole gently behinde a Bu<U+017F>h to hear him, and not be <U+017F>een; and <hi>Diana</hi> was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to hear, that <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing her, and having the <U+017F>ame curio<U+017F>ity, did <U+017F>teal on the other <U+017F>ide, un<U+017F>een either by <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Silvander;</hi> but we were mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ed at <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who being upon a little Hill, looked upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> as <U+017F>he crept gently upon the ground, le<U+017F>t <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her; for having an opinion, that the love which <U+017F>he bare unto that Shepheard, was the cau<U+017F>e of her de<U+017F>ire to hear him, he <U+017F>tood with cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed armes, and eyes <U+017F>o fixed upon her, as if he were a Statue; I had not known him at that di<U+017F>tance, but for <hi>Paris,</hi> who <U+017F>aw him often. Now as we were walking down the Hill, we <U+017F>aw your Brother pul down his Hat upon a <U+017F>udden, and turning his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53526:164"/>
back upon his Shephearde<U+017F>s, he came <U+017F>tamping towards us, and never <U+017F>aw us; but <U+017F>till as he went, <U+017F>cratched his head, <U+017F>tamped upon the ground, <U+017F>truck him<U+017F>elfe upon the brea<U+017F>t, and lifted his eyes often up to heaven. The<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate actions made us very de<U+017F>irous to hear what he <U+017F>aid, and therefore hiding our <U+017F>elves behinde a great Bu<U+017F>h which was by the way <U+017F>ide, we took notice, that upon a <U+017F>uddian he fell down, as if he had been troubled with a fit of the falling <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s: We <U+017F>tole neerer and neerer unto him, untill we could hear him <U+017F>igh out a hundred <U+017F>ymptomes of jealou<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>aying, That he had all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to be jealous, and that all oaths, and former a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of affection, <U+017F>hould never per<U+017F>wade him to the contrary; but that he was jealous with judgment, <U+017F>ince he <U+017F>aw <hi>Phillis</hi> upon her knees before him <U+017F>he loved. Then after a hundred <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, we <U+017F>aw him ri<U+017F>e up, and look backward, to <U+017F>ee what <hi>Phillis</hi> did, and a little after, went neerer her, then returned again to the place from whence he came. He did not perceive us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e he was <U+017F>o totally taken up with his thoughts of <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>o as I think, if we had <U+017F>tood directly before his eyes, he could not have <U+017F>een us. We followed him; and when he had couched him<U+017F>elfe clo<U+017F>e by <hi>Phillis,</hi> we couched behinde him, and heard <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>ing the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es.</p>

This Shepheard perhaps had continued longer, if <hi>Driope, Diana</hi>'s Dog, had not broke loo<U+017F>e from her, and run fawning upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> for he was wont to make very much of him for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>se's <U+017F>ake. The Shepheard pre<U+017F>ently ro<U+017F>e up, and looked round about, but could not <U+017F>ee her; yet, he <U+017F>aw <hi>Lycidas</hi> hearkening, and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing him ri<U+017F>e, went to him, as <hi>Diana</hi> de<U+017F>ired; but as <U+017F>he went towards him, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied <hi>Lycidas,</hi> which made her change her intention; for <U+017F>he knowing, that he was jealous of <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>he turned another way: and this made <hi>Lycidas</hi> the more <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her, thinking <U+017F>he did it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely to hide it from him. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who knew both their hearts, and being re<U+017F>olved to augment the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he faigned, as if he did not <U+017F>ee <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and ran unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> and taking her hand, did imprint two or three zealous ki<U+017F><U+017F>es upon it; afterwards asked her, how <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did? The Shephearde<U+017F>s was very <U+017F>orry that <hi>Lycidas</hi> did <U+017F>ee all this, and <U+017F>o perplexed at it, as <U+017F>he knew not how to an<U+017F>wer him. <hi>Paris</hi> and I, who intended to follow <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> we now went unto <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis. Lycidas,</hi> extreamly ill <U+017F>atisfyed with all this, turned another way, as if he had never <U+017F>een us. We foure being together, we went that way <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> went, after <hi>Silvander</hi> had taken order, both for his ownflock, and that of <hi>Phillis</hi>'s. This was a <U+017F>ore heart-burn unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and his jealou<U+017F>ie was much more increa<U+017F>ed by it, when he <U+017F>aw that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <U+017F>o carefull about the flock of <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>o as your Brother was continually turning his head towards us, to <U+017F>ee what we did.</p>
               <p>I profe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> and interrupted her) he is much to be pittyed; for I have found, by my little experience of it, that jealou<U+017F>ie is one of the mo<U+017F>t extream fortunes of a Lover. But, fair Nymph, what became of him afterwards? I cannot tell, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for I <U+017F>aw him not all the day after: and as for us, we went unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <U+017F>tayed for our company: and we <U+017F>pent all that day together with much contentment: <hi>Paris,</hi> he applyed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Diana; Silvander,</hi> unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> and I unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom indeed I finde to be mo<U+017F>t worthy of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s affection. Fair Nymph, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to be a little more inqui<U+017F>itive. What is it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you de<U+017F>ire to know of me? Did you ever hear, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a voice as hers? has <U+017F>he not a kinde of an harmonious accent in her pronunciation, which charmes the ear? Certainly <U+017F>he has, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, and that which mo<U+017F>t takes me, is, that <U+017F>he u<U+017F>eth no art or affection in her language, but all her expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions are plain, and full of mode<U+017F>ty and civility. But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>weet Nymph <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> did <U+017F>he never <U+017F>peak of me? She did, <U+017F>aid I, but it was my <U+017F>elfe who began the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for I knew, the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o little of you, was, the opinion which every one had of your affection to her. For heavens <U+017F>ake, <U+017F>weet <hi>Leonida,</hi> (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard) tell me what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e you had together? It was not much, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) yet I know not whether I <U+017F>hall remember it or no: I was very de<U+017F>irous to hear what was become of you; and when <hi>Paris</hi> de<U+017F>ired me to go unto your Town, I had not the confidence to <U+017F>peak of you: And when I <U+017F>aw <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>o deeply in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> as he minded nothing but her, and not finding you among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I was extreamly troubled. At la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I told her, how I did not think, that the <U+017F>hepheards of <hi>Lignon</hi> had been <U+017F>o civilized as I found them: The fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>tayed with them, was purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee, whether the reports I had heard were true; and <hi>Silvander</hi> that day confirmed them all. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> is a very well accompli<U+017F>hed <U+017F>hepheard. But, Madam, had you come at another time, I believe you would have found better <U+017F>atisfaction; for there was a time, when we had a mo<U+017F>t excellent company of <U+017F>hepheards. What is become of them, an<U+017F>wered I? Some, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, are dead, as the poor <hi>Celadon;</hi> others are <U+017F>o grieved for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of him, as they are grown <U+017F>o many lumps of melancholly, and frequent none, but <U+017F>olitary places, as <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the accident, as they have quite left the fatall <hi>Lignon:</hi> and indeed, we are all <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad ever <U+017F>ince, as we do not <U+017F>eem the <U+017F>ame we were. <hi>Celadon,</hi> replyed I, was not that he whom I heard talk off, when I was la<U+017F>t here? The <U+017F>ame, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, with a deep <U+017F>igh) Was he your Cozen (<U+017F>aid I unto her)? No, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but on the contrary, his Father and mine were mo<U+017F>t mortall enemies: But, Madam, he was the mo<U+017F>t gentle and fine<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepheard in all the Country; and though there was a mo<U+017F>t deadly enmity between our two families, yet his <U+017F>weet and good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions con<U+017F>trained me, and every one that knew him, to re<U+017F>ent his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e. At this <U+017F>he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour and putting her hand before her eyes, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed as if the rubbed her forehead. I perceived by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that you were not yet returned unto her, <U+017F>ince I left you; and knowing, that <U+017F>he could not tell me any thing, that could <U+017F>atisfie my longing de<U+017F>ires
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53526:165"/>
of <U+017F>eeing you, and that <U+017F>uch talk would only grieve her, I changed di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, it being late, <hi>Paris</hi> and I retired. It was then I heard from <hi>Silvander</hi> of your Brother's jealou<U+017F>ie; for walking by the River <U+017F>ide, I asked him the cau<U+017F>e of your Brother's <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and why we could never <U+017F>ee him? And he told me, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> being a devoted <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> he was jealous of her and him; and that he, to torment him the more, did <U+017F>eem as if he were in love with <hi>Phillis,</hi> and gave out all the demon<U+017F>trations of it that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could. Thus, <hi>Celadon,</hi> did we <U+017F>pend that day; and <U+017F>ince that, becau<U+017F>e I could not hear any newes of you, I vi<U+017F>ited this Company every day, thinking, that being in the company of tho<U+017F>e whom you loved, I was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort with you. This was the rea<U+017F>on, that when <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> after great preparations of joy, was con<U+017F>trained to leave them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e of the newes of <hi>Merovea</hi>'s death, though <hi>Silvia,</hi> by the command of <hi>Galathea,</hi> did let me know, that I might return unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> when I would, yet I would not go, becau<U+017F>e I took abundance of delight in the <U+017F>ociety of the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>creet <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es. Why (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> did <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> grieve <U+017F>o, for the death of that King? Becau<U+017F>e (as I believe) <hi>Clidamant</hi> was with him, (an<U+017F>wered I). Now, le<U+017F>t my Uncle <U+017F>hould make me return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Nymph, I did conceal <hi>Silvia's</hi> Letter from him. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> tell me truly, do you not envie me, for <U+017F>eeing <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <U+017F>peaking with her as oft as I would? I <U+017F>hall not be <U+017F>orry at any thing that plea<U+017F>eth you, an<U+017F>wered he; but I could wi<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elfe a <U+017F>hare in the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. And why (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) do you deprive your <U+017F>elfe of it? Ah <hi>Leonida!</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) could you but look into my heart, you would <U+017F>ee I do not; but I can take no delight in <U+017F>eeing her, and in <U+017F>eeing her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed. But why (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) do you think <U+017F>he will be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>eeing you? Becau<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) <U+017F>he hath commanded me never to <U+017F>ee her, untill <U+017F>he command otherwi<U+017F>e. How can <U+017F>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand otherwi<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> if <U+017F>he never <U+017F>ee you, nor knowes where you are, but thinks you to be dead? Ah Nymph, (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard) Love is a mo<U+017F>t pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant god; and as he has blindely found out a way to bani<U+017F>h me her pre<U+017F>ence, he may al<U+017F>o finde a way to recall me when he plea<U+017F>eth. Are you then re<U+017F>olved (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> not to pre<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elfe before her? I had rather die, an<U+017F>wered he, and therefore let Love do as it li<U+017F>ts. Upon this, he aro<U+017F>e, purpo<U+017F>ely to change di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and taking the Nymphs hand, he came to the dore of his Cave; but when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him in the light, and perceiving him <U+017F>o extreamly altered, <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>train her tears; which <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>eeing: Nay, nay, <U+017F>weet Nymph, <U+017F>aid he, never grieve at the alteration which you finde in my face, for it is a <U+017F>igne, that ere long I <U+017F>hall have a long re<U+017F>t. It would be too tedious to relate all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. But, to be briefe, all her arguments and per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions could obtain from him no more, then this, that he would <U+017F>uffer her to vi<U+017F>it him <U+017F>ometimes. At the la<U+017F>t, the Sun being almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>et, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to leave him, with a promi<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee him very often.</p>
               <p>For all <hi>Leonida's</hi> re<U+017F>olution, of not loving <hi>Celadon,</hi> yet could <U+017F>he not extingui<U+017F>h the flames of her fir<U+017F>t affection to him; <U+017F>o difficult a thing it is to expell this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, when it has once taken deep root in a heart which entertains it; and therefore this meeting with him was no <U+017F>mall contentment unto her; but her <U+017F>orrowes, to <U+017F>ee him in <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>erable condition, were as great, and the greater, when <U+017F>he thought upon his <U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olution; <U+017F>o as her joyes to finde him, and her <U+017F>orrowes to finde him thus, did a little puzzle her which to adhere mo<U+017F>t unto: All the way <U+017F>he went, <U+017F>he was inventing what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take, to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade him from this cour<U+017F>e of life: Sometimes <U+017F>he was in a minde, to acquaint the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with it, in hopes, that her influence might effect it. But this minde changed, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered, that this was the way to put her <U+017F>elfe out of all hopes to get his love, knowing very well, that if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> once knew he was alive, and could finde him, <U+017F>he would give him <U+017F>uch <U+017F>weet demon<U+017F>trations of her good-will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as would bla<U+017F>t all her hopes of him. Changing therefore this opinion, and having heard, that <hi>Adamas</hi> had been a great lover of <hi>Celadon's</hi> Father, <U+017F>he thought it expedient to acquaint him with his cour<U+017F>e of life, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her <U+017F>elfe, that he would do all that was requi<U+017F>ite and fit. Yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered, that the place where <hi>Celadon</hi> was, was as fit a place as <U+017F>he could wi<U+017F>h, to enjoy his company alone, and to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e her own pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he conceived the be<U+017F>t way was, to acquaint none as yet, but to try what time would doe, and to divert him from his <U+017F>ad thoughts as much as <U+017F>he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could; and if <U+017F>he found, that her pre<U+017F>ence and artifice could not work upon him, then it would be time enough to acquaint her Uncle. This then was the cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he fixed upon; and to effect it, <U+017F>he failed not to vi<U+017F>it him every day. The <U+017F>hepheard knowing, that all this could not proceed from any thing but love, he was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at it, thinking, that if he <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53526:166"/>
<U+017F>o much indulgency from this Nymph, he did offend again<U+017F>t the promi<U+017F>e of fidelity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e: Be<U+017F>ides, he thought all tho<U+017F>e houres that were <U+017F>pent in the<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>its, were lo<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e they kept him from entertaining his own dear and <U+017F>weet thoughts; <U+017F>o as in lieu of growing more joyfull, he became more <U+017F>ad; which the Nymph perceiving, and <U+017F>eeing that he did every day grow leaner and paler; <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ulted with her <U+017F>elfe, and at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to have recour<U+017F>e unto the <U+017F>age advice of the grave <hi>Adamas;</hi> but to acquaint him with it in <U+017F>uch a manner, as he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ure not to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any thing, to her di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
               <p>Being therefore one evening in a better humour then ordinary, <U+017F>he went unto her Uncle, whom <U+017F>he found walking upon a Tarra<U+017F><U+017F>e, which had the pro<U+017F>pect of all that plain from whence <U+017F>he came: After <U+017F>alutation, the Druide asked her, where <U+017F>he left <hi>Paris?</hi> To which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, that all the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were <U+017F>o kinde and civill, as to accompany them as far as the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <hi>Paris</hi> went to conduct them back again: But, Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I have met with a fine encounter, which <U+017F>tayed me <U+017F>o long, that I thought <hi>Paris</hi> would have been back before me. What is it <U+017F>aid the Druide? It is <hi>Celadon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonida;</hi> you mu<U+017F>t know, that <U+017F>ince he went from the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>aures,</hi> in lieu of going to his kindred and friends, he has retired him<U+017F>elf into a Cave, where he <U+017F>o hides him<U+017F>elf from all his acquaintance, as every one yet thinks him dead. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> does he <U+017F>o? I believe, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>h, that he is very <U+017F>ick in minde, and will not live long, for he can <U+017F>carcely go; he eats nothing but gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, and is grown <U+017F>o lean and <U+017F>ad, as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know him. Why, think you, <U+017F>aid the Druide, that it is in his minde? I conceive <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>peaks after an interrupted manner, and <U+017F>o little, as it is ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee, that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth him; I do believe, the love he bears unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is the cau<U+017F>e of it. If it be <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> he is the more like unto his Father; for, <hi>Alcippe</hi> was once <U+017F>o very much tran<U+017F>ported with his love unto <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that I did never in all my life <U+017F>ee one commit greater follies; and therefore it was, that he left a Country-life for the Court, and continued long in the exerci<U+017F>es of Chivalry. Is it lawfull for them, <U+017F>aid <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> thus to change their quality? Child, <U+017F>aid the Druide, neither <hi>Celadon</hi> nor any of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards about the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> nor mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e about the <hi>Loire</hi> and <hi>Furan,</hi>
are of a wor<U+017F>e extraction then you your <U+017F>elfe are; you mu<U+017F>t know, that their Ance<U+017F>tours made choice of this kinde of life, as mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>weet, and lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject unto inquietudes. Indeed, this <hi>Celadon,</hi> of whom you <U+017F>peak, is your neer kin<U+017F>man: For, the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Laigneau</hi> and his, did branch both out of one <U+017F>tock, <U+017F>o as <hi>Lindamor</hi> and he are your Co<U+017F>ens in the <U+017F>ame degree: My Grandfather, and the great Grandfather of <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> were Brothers. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing how neerly they were allied, was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, fearing le<U+017F>t this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>anguinity <U+017F>hould forbid the banes of her loving him, as Love commanded her to do; yet, le<U+017F>t her Uncle <U+017F>hould take any notice of her fears, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him; That <U+017F>ince they were <U+017F>o neerly allyed, they were the more obliged to have a care of him, and that the <U+017F>avage life he led was <U+017F>uch, as <U+017F>he verily believed he could not live long. It is very fit, <U+017F>aid the Druide, that we have all the care of him that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we can; and therefore, to <U+017F>hew my indulgency towards him, I will go unto the Cave of the old <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and con<U+017F>ult with her about him: Perhaps the heavens have a care of him, and keep him thus hid, to prevent <U+017F>ome great misfortune; for I have known <U+017F>ome others, that have been <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>erved from divers bla<U+017F>ts of malignant fate, which did threaten them. Whil<U+017F>t they were thus talking, <hi>Paris</hi> came in, and interrupted them, for they would not acquaint him with it, <U+017F>o as <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went betimes to bed, that they might be the more early up in the morning, to go unto <hi>Cleontine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> is a great Rock, re<U+017F>embling a pointed Diamond, which <U+017F>tands in the mid<U+017F>t of the plain towards Mount <hi>Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> between the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>aures;</hi> were it a little more upon the right hand towards <hi>Laigneau,</hi> then <hi>Marcelles, I<U+017F><U+017F>aures,</hi> and Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> did make a perfect Triangle. It <U+017F>eemes Nature took delight in imbelli<U+017F>hing this place above all others in the Country; for, it being elevated in the very heart of this Plain, <U+017F>o equally on all <U+017F>ides, it rai<U+017F>ed it <U+017F>elfe by <U+017F>uch eeven degrees, and at the top did leave ju<U+017F>t room for a Temple, which was dedicated unto <hi>Tautates, He<U+017F>ius, Tharames,</hi> and <hi>Belinus;</hi> and being the mo<U+017F>t famous in all the <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> it is here where the <hi>Lubages,</hi> the <hi>Sarronides,</hi> the <hi>Vaces,</hi> and the <hi>Bardes,</hi> do dwell in <hi>Grattoes,</hi> which they have made about the Temple, in which they a<U+017F><U+017F>emble them<U+017F>elves when the Druides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them. But that which is mo<U+017F>t admirable, is, that this great Rock, which is above foure thou<U+017F>and paces about, when it begins to ri<U+017F>e from the levell, and above foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53526:166"/>
paces high, and at the top above five hundred paces broad; yet, it is <U+017F>o covered with earth, planted with Vines, <U+017F>o full of gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o green, that tho<U+017F>e of the Country cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting its name, do call it Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> or green Mountain, in lieu of Mount <hi>Vatodun,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies the Mountain and dwelling of Prie<U+017F>ts or Sacrifices; for in the language of the <hi>Celts, Dunum</hi> <U+017F>ignifies Fortre<U+017F><U+017F>e; and <hi>Vates,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> language, <U+017F>ignifies Prie<U+017F>ts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or <U+017F>uch as give Oracles; and <U+017F>ince the <hi>Gaules</hi> had any communication with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they have not only mixed their language, but al<U+017F>o their manner of <U+017F>acrificing, complying them<U+017F>elves with a victorious people, <U+017F>o made <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>cellany, as they do retain unto them<U+017F>elves equally halfe <hi>Roman,</hi> halfe <hi>Celt.</hi> This Mountain became thus peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with <hi>Bardes, Eubages, Surronides,</hi> and others, by <hi>Dryus,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t In<U+017F>titutor of the Druides, who in<U+017F>pired this place with a certain kinde of divinity, and left a mark of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Po<U+017F>terity. This Rock, which, for its magnitude, may well be called a Mountain, is naturally <U+017F>o hollow, as within it is but one va<U+017F>t Vault; it hath three entrances, <U+017F>o <U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that a Coach may enter; they are commonly kept <U+017F>hut, and opened only when the Oracle is to be con<U+017F>ulted with, and then a Druide, after a <U+017F>acrifice, opens the dore, and askes the que<U+017F>tion: Pre<U+017F>ently there i<U+017F><U+017F>ues an impetuous winde, which comming from the concavities of this Vault, makes a <U+017F>trange confu<U+017F>ed noi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeming to be a kinde of ill pronounced voice. The Druide holding his head as far in as he can, <U+017F>tayes there, with his mouth open as long as the noi<U+017F>e continues; afterwards comes away, with his hair di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, his eyes <U+017F>taring, his face changed, and voice altered from what they were, and with actions, as if tran<U+017F>ported, does give the Oracle, which very often, the pronouncer her <U+017F>elfe does not under<U+017F>tand.</p>
               <p>Now the<U+017F>e three entrances, are dedicated unto three of their gods, or indeed, unto one god under three <U+017F>everall names; the one unto <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> whom they con<U+017F>ult with in matters of War; the other unto <hi>Thamaris,</hi> when future events would be known; and the other unto <hi>Belinus,</hi> unto whom all Lovers do addre<U+017F><U+017F>e their <U+017F>acrifices and <U+017F>upplications. And the<U+017F>e three entrances are never all open at a time, but upon the <U+017F>ixteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> when having gathered abundance of <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto,</hi> they come and <U+017F>trew it all about the Vault. At this time, if the Soveraigne Lady of the Province have a Daughter, <U+017F>he may enter, and make choice of him whom <U+017F>he will have for her Husband; with whom, and the grand Druide, they may view all that is in this Cave, and <U+017F>ee all the wonders which the great Druide left in it.</p>
               <p>This was the place unto which <hi>Adamas</hi> with <hi>Leonida</hi> did re<U+017F>ort in the morning, to con<U+017F>ult with <hi>Thamaris;</hi> and after the <U+017F>acrifice of a white Bull, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tome, and after <hi>Cleontine</hi> had dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe in <hi>Vervin,</hi> and <U+017F>prinkled the blood of the <U+017F>acrifice at the entrance, <U+017F>he put a piece of Lawrell in her mouth and chewed it; then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dore with a branch of <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto,</hi> pre<U+017F>ently it opens with a great noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of the hinges, leanes all her body in, and opening her mouth to receive the winde which comes out of the Cave, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayes there a good while, and at la<U+017F>t, comes unto the place of <U+017F>acrifice, where the Druide and all the re<U+017F>t do <U+017F>tay upon their knees, and bare-headed, praying unto <hi>Tentates.</hi> When <U+017F>he is come back, <U+017F>he goes unto the Altar, and there, with an afrighted vi<U+017F>age, and hair <U+017F>taring, with a <U+017F>trange hoar<U+017F>e voice, <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words.</p>

               <p>Ah! River, River continued he, thou that art a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, how I am now the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable, as formerly I was the mo<U+017F>t happy, <U+017F>hepheard in the world, why wa<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>o mercile<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to <U+017F>ave my mi<U+017F>erable life when it was in thy power to put an end unto all my <U+017F>orrowes, by taking this pittifull life away? Will things that are in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible con<U+017F>pire again<U+017F>t me, and deny me that, which naturally they be<U+017F>tow upon others? But perhaps thou art loth to lo<U+017F>e thy third <U+017F>cource, knowing that my tears did more abundantly <U+017F>well thy Chanell, then both tho<U+017F>e from whence thou ha<U+017F>t thy originall: If this was the motive that moved thee unto this cruell pitty, I'le a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thee, thou art not deceived <U+017F>ince as long as I live, my tears <U+017F>hall never fail thee. Upon this la<U+017F>t word, a mo<U+017F>t profound <U+017F>igh gave a <U+017F>top unto his voice, <U+017F>o as for a while his tongue was <U+017F>ilent; and as he was beginning again, <hi>Leonida</hi> unawares <U+017F>tirred. He turning his head that way, he was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, to <U+017F>ee <hi>Adamas</hi> with her in that place; he pre<U+017F>ently aro<U+017F>e, and came to <U+017F>alute the Druide, who advanced towards him. The thin and pale looks of <hi>Celadon</hi> did not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> And having former experience of the force of Love, he conceived, that this violent malady might reduce him unto a more dangerous condition, if no remedies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Therefore after common <U+017F>aluations and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he took him by the hand and cau<U+017F>ed him to <U+017F>it down and then began this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto him: Son, what a <U+017F>trange condition is this, in which I finde you? Was it to live thus, that you reque<U+017F>ted me to help you out of the pain that you were in, within the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F>saures?</hi> Did you intend to <U+017F>hut your <U+017F>elfe up in this Cave, and live like a <U+017F>alvage from the <U+017F>ociety of men? You are born, <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto a better fate, the great <hi>Thamaris</hi> tells me as much; he has be<U+017F>towed upon you great Flocks, and large Pa<U+017F>tures; and do you think your <U+017F>elfe not obliged to render an account of them? All under the cope of heaven is his, we are all but his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e he will exact a particular accompt; and, Soh, when that time
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53526:167"/>
comes, what will you then an<U+017F>wer? Although he hath <U+017F>ubmitted the<U+017F>e things unto our wills; yet, our very wills are not our own, and we may expect a <U+017F>evere puni<U+017F>hment, if we di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of our <U+017F>elves otherwi<U+017F>e than as we ought. How can you think it rea<U+017F>onable to live without any care of Flocks, or Friends, or Kindred, or Men? Dare you contemn tho<U+017F>e remedies, which that great god hath upon this occa<U+017F>ion put into your hands? Perhaps you will <U+017F>ay, that your affection unto the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> does force you unto it. But, Son, con<U+017F>ider well with your <U+017F>elfe, that if you have offended her, all your <U+017F>ervices cannot wipe away the offence, as long as you keep at di<U+017F>tance from her; and if you have not offended her, how can you ever hope or think <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know your innocency, if <U+017F>he never <U+017F>ee or hear of you? Now, my Son, I do grant, that for the time pa<U+017F>t, you had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to ab<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elfe from her pre<U+017F>ence, nay, from all the world, to the end <U+017F>he may <U+017F>ee, what power <U+017F>he hath over you, and that you value the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of her favour as the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your rea<U+017F>on. But now that time is expired, you mu<U+017F>t now return unto your <U+017F>elfe again, and make it appear, that you are both in Love, and that you are a man. Though your <U+017F>orrowes may deprive you of your rea<U+017F>on, yet, now rea<U+017F>on ought to revive, that <U+017F>he may not repent of having a Servant who is not a Man. Unto this <hi>Celadon</hi> returned this cold an<U+017F>wer: I would to god, Father, that your <U+017F>apient advice were addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto one capable to receive it; as for me, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, there remaines nothing of a man in me but my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, having lo<U+017F>t both my under<U+017F>tanding and my will; and I believe, this memory that remains with me, is only as a nouri<U+017F>hment of my <U+017F>ad thoughts; <U+017F>o as he whom you now <U+017F>ee before you, is not <hi>Celadon</hi> the Son of <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whom the great Druide <hi>Adamas</hi> heretofore did honour with his friend<U+017F>hip; but he is only one, that the heavens con<U+017F>erves here among<U+017F>t the Woods, as a te<U+017F>timony, that <hi>Celadon</hi> knowes how to love. In an<U+017F>wer unto all you object, let this <U+017F>erve for all, <hi>I love:</hi> For, <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> if I do love, I need not fear, that <hi>Tharamis</hi> will be offended at me, for doing that which Love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <U+017F>ince he would have me, or at lea<U+017F>t permits me, to love. Now tho<U+017F>e who do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a thing, they permit all that depends upon it; and who can deny, but that this mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life which I lead, is a dependency of this love? Can he be called a Lover, who has eyes that will look upon any thing but that he Loves? Ah! Father, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I do love, and I am blinde unto all Flocks, and Friends, and Kindred, and all Men living. If the heavens, as you <U+017F>ay, have given me any thing, why <U+017F>hould it exact an account of me, <U+017F>ince I do re<U+017F>igne them back again as freely, as ever they were be<U+017F>towed upon me? If any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be required of <hi>Celadon,</hi> it mu<U+017F>t be required of her who<U+017F>e <hi>Celadon</hi> is; as for me, I have nothing to account of, for I have re<U+017F>igned all, the heavens would have it <U+017F>o, for it is by de<U+017F>tiny that I do love, and the heavens do know it: As <U+017F>oon as ever I had any will, I gave my <U+017F>elf wholly unto her, and have continued <U+017F>o ever <U+017F>ince. To be briefe, the heavens are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed with it, otherwi<U+017F>e I had not been <U+017F>o happy as I was many years. If therefore the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would have it <U+017F>o, do know it, and were plea<U+017F>ed with it; how can they in ju<U+017F>tice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h me, for doing that, which I cannot chu<U+017F>e but do? Do what thou wilt with me, Oh great <hi>Thamaris</hi> let what will become of my flocks, let my Friends and Kindred have what opinion of me they plea<U+017F>e; they all ought to be <U+017F>atisfied with this an<U+017F>wer, that, <hi>I do love.</hi> But, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> will you alwaies live thus? The election (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) does not depend upon him, that hath neither will nor under<U+017F>tanding.</p>
               <p>If you do, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas)</hi> you will cea<U+017F>e to be a man. That (replyed the <U+017F>hepheard) has been a long time the lea<U+017F>t of my cares. But, if you do love, <U+017F>aid the Druide, why do you not enforce your <U+017F>elfe to <U+017F>ee her whom you love? If I do love, an<U+017F>wered he, do you think I will di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e or di<U+017F>obey her whom I love; nay, do you think, that I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive extream contentment and delight in plea<U+017F>ing and obeying her? But, <U+017F>aid the Druide, <U+017F>he does not know that you do obey her. It is no matter, an<U+017F>wered he, whether <U+017F>he do or no, I mu<U+017F>t do my duty. The Druide knew not whether he <U+017F>hould e<U+017F>teem him for the acutene<U+017F><U+017F>e of his wit in the<U+017F>e an<U+017F>wers, or blame him, for the errours he was in: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that his malady was not yet at the height, therefore he would not apply any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent remedies, untill he had tryed <U+017F>ome more milder; and therefore, after a while of <U+017F>ilence, he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> what I have <U+017F>aid, was, becau<U+017F>e I thought my <U+017F>elfe obliged unto it by the Lawes of friend<U+017F>hip, and duty of my charge, and not to contrary you in any thing; only one favour I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire from you, which I hope you will not deny, <U+017F>ince it will conduce much unto my contentment: You mu<U+017F>t know, that I have a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom I love above all the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings, which the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Tharamis</hi> hath be<U+017F>towed upon me; I have long wanted my greate<U+017F>t contentment, in wanting her, and I am afraid,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53526:168"/>
it will be longer before I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee her again. Now the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw you at the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F>soures,</hi> 'tis true, I loved you for <hi>Alcippe</hi>'s and <hi>Amarillis</hi>'s <U+017F>ake, but much more, for your great re<U+017F>emblance of my deare<U+017F>t Daughter; therefore I conjure you, by her that hath mo<U+017F>t power over you, to be plea<U+017F>ed, that I may <U+017F>ometimes interrupt your <U+017F>olitude, that I may in your face <U+017F>ee the Picture of her, whom I love above all the world. The <U+017F>hepheard, who was full of courte<U+017F>y, an<U+017F>wered, That he would take it for a very particular favour, if he would be plea<U+017F>ed to take the paines; and that he thanked Nature for favouring him <U+017F>o much, as to give him a re<U+017F>emblance of any he loved; and that if he had not excluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe from all the world, he would come to his hou<U+017F>e and pre<U+017F>ent him his <U+017F>ervice. To be briefe, <hi>Adamas</hi> re<U+017F>olved to vi<U+017F>it this <U+017F>hepheard very often, hoping by degrees to draw him out of his melancholly Cell. True it was, that <hi>Alexis</hi> his Daughter had a little re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of this <U+017F>hepheard; and <U+017F>he being by their Lawes to <U+017F>tay among<U+017F>t the Druides Daughters, in the Cells of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> untill <U+017F>he was forty years of age, <hi>Adamas</hi> did take delight in <U+017F>eeing <hi>Celadon,</hi> who had a kinde of re<U+017F>emblance of her. It had been ordained by <hi>Dis Samothes,</hi> and <U+017F>ince confirmed by great <hi>Druis,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t In<U+017F>titutor of the Druides, that tho<U+017F>e Prie<U+017F>ts which had any Sons, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>end the elde<U+017F>t of them unto the Schooles of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> where they <U+017F>pent ten years in learning their Science, ten years more in teaching others; and ten years more yet, they officiated in the publick Sacrifices and Judgments: and afterwards they might return to their homes, and exerci<U+017F>e the charge of Druides throughout all <hi>Gaul.</hi> If they have none but Daughters, they are con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>end their elde<U+017F>t, after ten years of age, unto the <U+017F>ame place; where they are in<U+017F>tructed, do in<U+017F>truct, and at la<U+017F>t, judge, as I told you before. For, the <hi>Gaules</hi> do build very much upon the judgment of the<U+017F>e Female Druides: And the<U+017F>e times being expired, they may return to their Fathers, and may marry.</p>
               <p>Now this cour<U+017F>e being re<U+017F>olved upon, <hi>Celadon</hi> was he that reaped the mo<U+017F>t profit by it; for <hi>Leonida</hi> did at the fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tore unto him tho<U+017F>e Letters, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>tole from him, which was a good pre<U+017F>age of better fortune, having often heard <U+017F>ay, that as one misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <U+017F>eldome comes alone, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o one good fortune drawes on another. And he being very often vi<U+017F>ited, <U+017F>ometimes by <hi>Leonida,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes by the Druide, he was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad thoughts, which would quite have con<U+017F>umed him; be<U+017F>ides, the care of <hi>Adamas</hi> was <U+017F>uch, as he <U+017F>ent him victualls very often <U+017F>ecretly, which much revived his drooping <U+017F>pirits.</p>
               <p>The affection of this Nymph, and the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> was a happy encounter for <hi>Celadon,</hi> for both of them were carefull of him beyond mea<U+017F>ure, and indeed beyond their duty and quality; but, the greate<U+017F>t comfort unto this <U+017F>hepheard, was, that this Nymph furni<U+017F>hed him with Pen, Inke, and Paper, becau<U+017F>e being alone, he did employ him<U+017F>elfe much in putting his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate thoughts into writing, which gave him much contentment in the reading them. For, the wounds of Love are of <U+017F>uch a nature, that the more they are <U+017F>mothered and kept in, the more they fe<U+017F>ter; and talking of them is as <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne a remedy, as can be received in ab<U+017F>ence. Now <hi>Adamas</hi> conceived, that too much thinking did but fe<U+017F>ter and rancle the melancholly of this <U+017F>hepheard, and therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed him to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away his time, <U+017F>ometimes in the <U+017F>acred Groves, which were neer, and there engrave <U+017F>ome fancies upon the barks of Trees, and furni<U+017F>hed him with tooles fit for the purpo<U+017F>e. This Shepheard having gotten a little more <U+017F>trength, and recovered <U+017F>ome of his former complexion, al<U+017F>o rea<U+017F><U+017F>uming his under<U+017F>tanding facultle, he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of this good coun<U+017F>ell which <hi>Adamas</hi> gave him, to <U+017F>hun this carele<U+017F><U+017F>e and idle kinde of life wherein he lived; and therefore he took his advice, and fell to work. <hi>Adamas</hi> in this did, like a good Phy<U+017F>itian, con<U+017F>ider the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which he was to cure, and there <U+017F>ea<U+017F>oned all his coun<U+017F>ells with <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ignes of Love. You <U+017F>ee, Son, <U+017F>aid he unto him, that though according to our Statutes, we ought not to erect Temples unto <hi>Teutates, He<U+017F>ius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis</hi> our god; yet, <U+017F>ince the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their Armes, brought in <U+017F>trange gods unto <hi>Gaul,</hi> and lo<U+017F>ing our antient freedome, we were con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after their fa<U+017F>hion, we have Temples, in which our god is adored among<U+017F>t us; and becau<U+017F>e the cu<U+017F>tome of it is become a Law, it is lawfull for you, <hi>Celadon,</hi> to dedicate part of this Grove, not only unto the highe<U+017F>t and prime divinity, but as a mo<U+017F>t perfect work of that divinity, unto your fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> which our great god will as well allow, as tho<U+017F>e Temples that are dedicated by <U+017F>trangers, unto the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fortune,</hi> unto the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Sickne<U+017F>s,</hi> or the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Fear.</hi> Therefore, <U+017F>aid he unto him, let me advi<U+017F>e you to prime and dre<U+017F><U+017F>e up this goodly Oake, to cut away the thick underwood, and make a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53526:168"/>
place, which we will dedicate unto <hi>Amity.</hi> At the root of the Oake, ca<U+017F>t up a bank of gra<U+017F>s, in form of an Altar, upon which I will <U+017F>et a Table, which <U+017F>hall be an emblem of <hi>Amity.</hi> When this is fini<U+017F>hed, we will make another more <U+017F>pacious, which <U+017F>hall be under that Oak, which truly is one mo<U+017F>t admirable; for out of one <U+017F>tock three branches do grow, and afterwards reunite them<U+017F>elves into the <U+017F>ame bark.</p>
               <p>You <U+017F>ee, (<U+017F>aid he unto him) that this is a mo<U+017F>t lively <U+017F>ymbol of <hi>Teutates, He<U+017F>ius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis</hi> our god. How, Father (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> you name foure, and yet you <U+017F>ay, our god? you <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid, gods; and I have ob<U+017F>erved, that you have u<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ame expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion more then once. Son (<U+017F>aid the Druide) this is one of our greate<U+017F>t my<U+017F>teries in divinity; and though we Druides ought not to reveal it unto any, but <U+017F>uch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed in our Schooles, yet I <U+017F>hall declare unto you as much, as you are capable to under<U+017F>tand.</p>
               <p>Know therefore, my Son, that the great <hi>Dis, Samothes,</hi> pre<U+017F>ently after the divi<U+017F>ion of men, by rea<U+017F>on of the confu<U+017F>ion of Languages, being well in<U+017F>tructed by his Grandfather, both in the wor<U+017F>hip of the true God, and in other Sciences, he came by the <hi>Armorick</hi> Sea into this Country, which yet unto that very day we called <hi>Gaul,</hi> and which a little after, changed it for the name of <hi>France:</hi> Who afterwards peopling it, he <U+017F>etled his Scepter there, planted the Religion of his Fathers, and in<U+017F>tructed <U+017F>ome of the be<U+017F>t Wits among<U+017F>t them with his own Documents and Sciences, who ever <U+017F>ince after his own name were called <hi>Samothes.</hi> This man was the fir<U+017F>t King of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing both unto god and men, that he had a long, pro<U+017F>perous, and peaceable Raigne; and after him his Po<U+017F>terity in <U+017F>uch renown, as all the world did ring with his, and the valour of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> u<U+017F>urped the Dominion of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of our own civill di<U+017F><U+017F>entions, who being full of animo<U+017F>ity and faction among<U+017F>t our <U+017F>elves, did invite them among<U+017F>t us, and asked aide of them, who<U+017F>e ambition hath <U+017F>ince devoured us; teaching us, but too late, that no <U+017F>trangers will ever love us better than we do our <U+017F>elves. But that great god, whom <hi>Samothes</hi> taught us to adore in purity of heart, not de<U+017F>iring to continue his anger again<U+017F>t us for ever, after we had been a while under the Dominion of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, did deliver us from them by the Armes of the <hi>Francks,</hi> who <U+017F>ay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves to be de<U+017F>cended from the ancient <hi>Gaules.</hi> Now to return unto our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. The fourth King which raigned in <hi>Gaul,</hi> who de<U+017F>cended from the great and holy <hi>Samothes,</hi> was the wi<U+017F>e and learned <hi>Dryus,</hi> from whom the Druides took their denomination. But tho<U+017F>e are mi<U+017F>taken, as well as the over-bold <hi>Greeks,</hi> who boa<U+017F>t, that they were <U+017F>o called from their word <hi>Drys,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies an Oake; for, before Letters or Learning ever came into <hi>Greece,</hi> we called them Druides, and the Sciences were in <hi>Gaul</hi> before they did know <U+017F>o much as how to read, as the name of Druide teacheth us, which in the Language of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothes's</hi> Grandfather does <U+017F>ignifie, <hi>Contemplator,</hi> from the word <hi>Dri<U+017F><U+017F>im;</hi> and, as you know (my Son) our principall part of Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in contemplation of the works of God.</p>
               <p>Now this great <hi>Dis, Samothes,</hi> and after him, our holy <hi>Dryus,</hi> did command us to wor<U+017F>hip god, not according to the erroneous cu<U+017F>tome of Nations, but as they had been taught by their Fathers, and becau<U+017F>e the dull ignorance of the people was <U+017F>uch, as they could not comprehend that <U+017F>upream goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and infinite power, which they called <hi>Thau,</hi> comprehending all, they gave him three names; <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies <hi>Strong; Belinus,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies <hi>Man god;</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies <hi>Pre<U+017F>erver,</hi> teaching us by the<U+017F>e three names, that god is the omnipotent Creator and Pre<U+017F>erver of men. But <U+017F>ince, through the alteration of time, and ignorance of people, which changeth all things, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially names, in lieu of <hi>Thau,</hi> they <U+017F>ay <hi>Thauta,</hi> and <hi>Thautes,</hi> and <hi>Theutates.</hi> In lieu of <hi>Jehus, Belenas,</hi> and <hi>Thaharamis,</hi> the a<U+017F>piration in the middle being har<U+017F>h to pronounce, they <U+017F>ay, <hi>He<U+017F>us, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis:</hi> And the people had <U+017F>uch a power over the more knowing part of men, as they, to be under<U+017F>tood, were forced to call them as the people did, and con<U+017F>ent unto their errour.</p>
               <p>But, Father, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, are not <hi>Teutates, He<U+017F>us, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> the <U+017F>ame gods which are called <hi>Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Apollo?</hi> Are all the<U+017F>e but one god? Son, <U+017F>aid the Druide, I wi<U+017F>h I were able to make you under<U+017F>tand what you ask; but where your under<U+017F>tanding will not reach, let the beliefe which you have in me <U+017F>upply. Know therefore, that <U+017F>trangers <U+017F>eeing how the <hi>Gaules</hi> adored and called upon <hi>Thautates</hi> in all their affaires, when they took any journey, and in all their actions; moreover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering, that they were naturally lovers of eloquence, they thought, that it was <hi>Mercury</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53526:169"/>
whom they called upon, <U+017F>aying, that he was the god of Eloquence, the director in Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, the inventor of Arts, and the Protector of all Merchants and Traffick. Afterwards ob<U+017F>erving, that in our Wars we invoked <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> they thought him to be <hi>Mars,</hi> who was by them held to be the god of Armes. And when we de<U+017F>ired to be purged from our <U+017F>ins, they <U+017F>aw us call upon <hi>Thamaris,</hi> &amp; they thought him to be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> from whom they expect all cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement, by rea<U+017F>on of the thunderbolts that are attributed unto him. Be<U+017F>ides, they conceiving, that pardon of <U+017F>ins being to be had from the greate<U+017F>t of all the gods, they <U+017F>aid he mu<U+017F>t needs be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant. Then, becau<U+017F>e we had recour<U+017F>e unto <hi>Belinus,</hi> when we wanted health for our <U+017F>elves or friends, or de<U+017F>ired to have children, they per<U+017F>waded them<U+017F>elves, that it mu<U+017F>t needs be their <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom they thought to be the fir<U+017F>t inventor of Phy<U+017F>ick; be<U+017F>ides, attributing unto him the guidance of the Sun; nay, very often taking the one for the other; and knowing, that the Sun gave life unto all Animalls, and moreover, that Man and the Sun did generate Man, they had <U+017F>om rea<U+017F>on to think, that it was our <hi>Belinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But mo<U+017F>t certain it is (dear Son) that there can be but one god; for, if one be not omnipotent and all pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant, he is not god: if there were two omnipotents, or two pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F><U+017F>ants, the omnipotency and the pui<U+017F><U+017F>ancy would be divided. Moreover, they mu<U+017F>t needs be either alike or di<U+017F>like; if they be alike in all things, they mu<U+017F>t be the <U+017F>ame, and <U+017F>o only one; if they be di<U+017F>like, then good mu<U+017F>t be different from good, which cannot be. I in<U+017F>tance only in the<U+017F>e familiar arguments, becau<U+017F>e I will not puzle your under<U+017F>tanding with <U+017F>uch as are more ob<U+017F>cure and more <U+017F>ublime, although they be <U+017F>tronger and more pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing. I did ever believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that there was but one god and one lord over us all, and above all the re<U+017F>t of the gods; but, I believed al<U+017F>o, that as among<U+017F>t Men, we <U+017F>ee, that Kings have their <U+017F>ubordinate Officers, <U+017F>o that there are inferiours or petty gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, which is the <U+017F>upream and great one of all, whom we call <hi>Tautates,</hi> and the others, <hi>He<U+017F>ius, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> which, next to him, are to be adored. This beliefe (an<U+017F>wered the Druide) hath <U+017F>ome colour and rea<U+017F>on in it, yet it is a great errour; for tho<U+017F>e whom you named la<U+017F>t are not gods, but only denominations of the great <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates:</hi> But, though I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, he hath <U+017F>ubordinate Officers under him, as Terre<U+017F>triall Kings have; yet, you mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand, that wor<U+017F>hip and adoration is due only unto one god. Why then, Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> are they placed in our Temples <U+017F>o neer the great <hi>Tautates?</hi> Son (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas)</hi> I told you before, that the Romans mixed their Religion with ours: You mu<U+017F>t know, that by our Lawes, it is forbidden to make any image of god; for, an Image being a repre<U+017F>entation of <U+017F>omething, and there mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome proportion betwixt the thing repre<U+017F>enting and the thing repre<U+017F>ented; we do conceive, that there is nothing among<U+017F>t men, which can hold any proportion or re<U+017F>emblance with god, and therefore we do expre<U+017F>ly forbid it; and indeed, we do di<U+017F>allow of any Temples, thinking it mo<U+017F>t gro<U+017F><U+017F>e ignorance to imagine, an infinite immen<U+017F>e deitie within any walls can be confined; and think it a mo<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>umptuous boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e to imagine, any hou<U+017F>e can be worthy of him. And therefore, after the manner of the Antients, the Father and Grandfather of the great <hi>Samothes,</hi> did command us to adore god in Groves and in Fields; yet, Groves were con<U+017F>ecrated unto him, by the devotion of the people, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be profaned: And in tho<U+017F>e places, they made choice of great Oakes, under which god was wor<U+017F>hipped. And hereupon it was, that the <hi>Romans</hi> entring into our Country, and <U+017F>eeing our <U+017F>acred Groves and manner of our Sacrifices, did with amazement <U+017F>ay, that we, among<U+017F>t all men, had the greate<U+017F>t knowledge of god, and that the <hi>Gaules</hi> were the mo<U+017F>t religious and fulle<U+017F>t of devotion, of any people in the world. But the Conquerors alwaies giving what Lawes they li<U+017F>t unto the Conquered, they did mo<U+017F>t tyrannically u<U+017F>urp, not only upon our Land, but our Souls al<U+017F>o; changed our ceremonies, made us wor<U+017F>hip their gods, forced us to build Temples, and to receive their Idolls, to repre<U+017F>ent <hi>Tautates, He<U+017F>ius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> under the figures of their <hi>Mars, Mercury, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e this went much again<U+017F>t the con<U+017F>ciences of our Druides, one of their Emperors by publick Edict in Senate, bani<U+017F>hed and aboli<U+017F>hed our Religion, and cha<U+017F>ed the Druides out of the Empire: But for all that, the great <hi>Tautates</hi> permitted this only, to make tryall of their vertues, and not to aboli<U+017F>h them; manife<U+017F>ting, that he never does entirely for<U+017F>ake the good. So as maugre the malice and tyranny of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we have <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome purity in our Sacrifices, and wor<U+017F>hip god as he ought to be, and even in this Country, we have ever acknowledged the power of the<U+017F>e u<U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, out of the re<U+017F>pect they alwaies had unto <hi>Diana,</hi> of whom they think our great
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53526:169"/>
Nymph is a repre<U+017F>entation. And now at this time, the <hi>Francks</hi> have brought with them their Druides, and making it appear they were formerly <hi>Gaules,</hi> our authority and <U+017F>acred cu<U+017F>tomes are revived again in <U+017F>plendor. But, Father (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> I have <U+017F>een in our <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Groves, Images of great <hi>Dis</hi> and of <hi>Hercules.</hi> The rea<U+017F>on of that was, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas)</hi> becau<U+017F>e they were men and not gods; and being but men, they may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented. But (replyed <hi>Celadon)</hi> if they be not gods, why do you <U+017F>et them upon Altars? You mu<U+017F>t know, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas)</hi> that they were men, who for their vertues were like unto gods, and as <U+017F>uch, we ought to honour them, and pre<U+017F>erve their memory, to the end, others may take them for paternes of vertue: But <U+017F>trangers, who were ignorant of our intentions, did think, that we did adore and wor<U+017F>hip them, and <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Dis</hi> was <hi>Pluto,</hi> from whom we <U+017F>ay we are de<U+017F>cended; and gave unto <hi>Hercules</hi> the <U+017F>irname of <hi>Gaulois,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e we much honour his memory, as well becau<U+017F>e he was full of heroick vertues, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e he married the fair <hi>Galathea</hi> our Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and Daughter of <hi>Celtes</hi> our King. You tell me things, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> which do much ravi<U+017F>h me, and I be<U+017F>eech you, Father, go on, and tell me what I <U+017F>hall do, when I <U+017F>hall enter into tho<U+017F>e Temples, where I <U+017F>hall finde the Images of <hi>Jupiter, Mars, Pallas, Venus,</hi> and <U+017F>uch like gods and godde<U+017F><U+017F>es. Son, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adamas,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t be very well advi<U+017F>ed when you do go thither: and above all, be <U+017F>ure you do not take them for gods, but only Vertues Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ances, and Effects of one onely god. In <hi>Jupiter,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t adore the omnipotency and maje<U+017F>ty of god; in <hi>Mars,</hi> his power; in <hi>Pallas,</hi> his wi<U+017F>dome; in <hi>Venus,</hi> his beauty, and <U+017F>o of all the re<U+017F>t: By this means, you will render unto our great <hi>Tautates,</hi> that wor<U+017F>hip which is his due, and <U+017F>hew your <U+017F>elfe ju<U+017F>t unto tho<U+017F>e vertuous Per<U+017F>ons and Heroes, in honouring them dead, as you would have done if they had been alive. And <U+017F>o much for this time; and if you do frequent my company, I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with more. Now, Child, leaving this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, let us make the form of a Temple here in this Grove, which was long <U+017F>ince dedicated unto <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> our god: It being in a Grove, we <U+017F>hall ob<U+017F>erve our antient Ordinances; and becau<U+017F>e a Temple, we <U+017F>hall obey the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers. I will write upon this miraculous Oake, the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name of <hi>Teutates;</hi> and upon the three branches, that on the right hand, I will write <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> on that in the middle, <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and on that upon the left hand, <hi>Belinus;</hi> and then upon the top of all, where they are united together, we will engrave the <U+017F>acred name of <hi>Teutates,</hi> to <U+017F>hew, that we mean only one god, under the notion of the<U+017F>e three words or nominations.</p>
               <p>If I dur<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover unto you the <U+017F>acred and profound my<U+017F>teries of our religion, I <U+017F>hould acquaint you with an Interpretation, which <hi>Samothes,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t knowing man, did leave unto us, and which, by tradition from Father to Son is come unto us, how that the<U+017F>e three names do <U+017F>ignifie three per<U+017F>ons, which are but one god, <hi>god the mighty, god the man,</hi> and <hi>god the pre<U+017F>erver;</hi> the father, the <U+017F>on, and the pre<U+017F>erver; and all the<U+017F>e three, do make but one <hi>Tautates,</hi> which is god: And it is unto the Mother of this <hi>god man,</hi> unto whom our Druides, twenty ages ago, did dedicate an Altar in the Cave of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> with the <U+017F>tatue of a Virgin upon it, holding a Child in her armes, with this In<U+017F>cription: <hi>To the Virgin, who <U+017F>hall bring forth a Child.</hi> But the<U+017F>e my<U+017F>teries are too high for your capacity, and le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould profane them, it is better to be <U+017F>ilent. Let us go on with our work. Perhaps <U+017F>ome learned Druide may come into this <U+017F>acred Grove, and will adore <hi>Teutates</hi> in purity of heart as we do; he will commend our work, and approve of our good intentions.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Druide di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon the hidden my<U+017F>teries of his religion; and becau<U+017F>e they were above the under<U+017F>tanding of the <U+017F>hepheard, he would <U+017F>ay no more. But as <U+017F>oon as tho<U+017F>e three names were engraved upon the Tree, they kneeled down and adored them, and never approached them, but with abundance of reverence. Now le<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hould be tired in his devotion by working, he called the Temple by the name of the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> And, Son, <U+017F>aid he, this is no offence unto the great god, <U+017F>o you honour this <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> only, as the mo<U+017F>t perfect piece of work that ever they <U+017F>hewed unto men. <hi>Celadon</hi> did ea<U+017F>ily con<U+017F>ent unto this, and with incredible zeal, he worked <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>iduou<U+017F>ly, as within a few daies he fini<U+017F>hed the Temple, according to the Druide's appointment, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his diligence and indu<U+017F>try, and the more to encourage him, did bring him the Lawes of Love, and the Embleme of reciprocall Amity. But approaching the Altar of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> he knew not what to <U+017F>et upon it; yet after he had a while thought upon it: If you were a good Limner, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I am <U+017F>ure the features of the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> face is very fre<U+017F>h in your memory, you may draw her Picture, and <U+017F>et it upon this Altar, which
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53526:170"/>
is dedicated unto her; but <U+017F>ince you are not yet <U+017F>o good an Arti<U+017F>t, I will cau<U+017F>e a Table to be made, and only write her name upon it. To which, the <U+017F>hepheard returned this an<U+017F>wer: You have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on, Father for your beliefe, for the features of her faire<U+017F>t face are not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed fre<U+017F>h in my memory, <U+017F>o as me thinks I alwaies <U+017F>ee her; but al<U+017F>o her <U+017F>peech, her garb, her attire, and all her actions, are <U+017F>o lively in my <U+017F>oul, as me-thinks I do continually <U+017F>ee them. But, though I am no Arti<U+017F>t in Limning, yet I am able to <U+017F>hew you her re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, upon condition, you will re<U+017F>tore it unto me again: Upon a promi<U+017F>e of which, he unbuttoned his brea<U+017F>t, and opening the Ca<U+017F>e which he wore about his neck, he <U+017F>hewed him <hi>A<U+017F>trea's</hi> Picture: But, Father, (<U+017F>aid he) if you do lo<U+017F>e it, or not re<U+017F>tore it unto me again, mo<U+017F>t certainly I <U+017F>hall die, no excu<U+017F>e or con<U+017F>olation can <U+017F>ave me. After <hi>Adamas</hi> had vowed by <hi>Tautates,</hi> that he would re<U+017F>tore it, the <U+017F>hepheard, after a mo<U+017F>t zealous ki<U+017F><U+017F>e of it, did tru<U+017F>t it into his hands. The Druide looking upon it: Truly, Son, (<U+017F>aid he) I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I never <U+017F>aw a face more fair, nor in which I di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>o much mode<U+017F>t love and <U+017F>weet <U+017F>everity; happy is the Father of <U+017F>uch a Child, and happy the Mother who bare her, happy the eyes who <U+017F>ee her; but infinitely happy he that mu<U+017F>t enjoy her. Afterwards he put it up into the Ca<U+017F>e, with a promi<U+017F>e to re<U+017F>tore it very <U+017F>hortly, which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, within five or <U+017F>ix daies.</p>
               <p>It was in this place, where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and all the Company did finde <U+017F>o many Ver<U+017F>es and Writings of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s; for he was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed with his works, that he was continually before the Image of his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and adoring her in his very <U+017F>oul; As imaginations and fancies came into his head, he writ them down, and laid them upon the Altar, as offerings unto the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> It was this <U+017F>hepheard and <hi>Adamas</hi> whom <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aw in the night; for the Druide, by frequenting him <U+017F>o continually, did make him forget mo<U+017F>t of his <U+017F>ad thoughts; and the <U+017F>hepheard al<U+017F>o, did think him <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o exceedingly obliged unto him, for his indulgent a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as he did infinitly honour him. <hi>Leonida,</hi> <U+017F>ince this, went not <U+017F>o oft to vi<U+017F>it the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e as <U+017F>he was wont. In the mean time, <hi>Celadon</hi> lived thus, <U+017F>ometimes more, <U+017F>ometimes le<U+017F><U+017F>e afflicted, even as his thoughts gave him leave, untill he met with <hi>Silvander,</hi> into who<U+017F>e hands he put the Letter which he writ unto the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who <U+017F>ince, cau<U+017F>ed all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es and <U+017F>hepheards to come into this place, where having lo<U+017F>t their way, they were con<U+017F>trained to re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, with intention to depart as <U+017F>oon as the <hi>Moon</hi> began to appear; but the paines and toile which the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es had taken all the day, and a great part of the night, had <U+017F>o tired them, that they <U+017F>lept longer than they intended; for when the <hi>Moon</hi> was up, and very light, the <U+017F>hepheards them<U+017F>elves were all a<U+017F>leep. But on the contrary, the <U+017F>ad <hi>Celadon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cu<U+017F>tome, was up betimes, purpo<U+017F>ely to entertain his own thoughts, and none met him, for his u<U+017F>e was, to walk mo<U+017F>t out when others <U+017F>lept, and <U+017F>hut up him<U+017F>elfe all the day. The <hi>Sun</hi> did not yet appear, when it was his fortune to walk towards the place where this company was; and being wholly taken up with his <U+017F>ad thoughts, never minding any thing about him, never man was <U+017F>o planet-<U+017F>truck as he was, when upon a <U+017F>udden he e<U+017F>pied <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> <U+017F>he had a thin handkerchief upon her eyes, which did a little cover her face, one arme under her head, and the other by her <U+017F>ide, her petticoat a little ruffled up, <U+017F>o as one might <U+017F>ee the delicate proportion of her leg; the admirable purene<U+017F><U+017F>e of her neck was plainly <U+017F>een, the azure veins upon a <U+017F>nowy skin did ravi<U+017F>h; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was a little <U+017F>trait laced, <U+017F>he unlaced her <U+017F>elfe, and the rich trea<U+017F>ure of her brea<U+017F>ts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; her hair was loo<U+017F>e and lay negligently upon her lovely cheeks. Oh! what a vi<U+017F>ion was this unto <hi>Celadon?</hi> he was <U+017F>o amazed, that he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>tock <U+017F>till, without any pul<U+017F>e or breath, or any <U+017F>igne of life, but the beating of his heart, and his <U+017F>ight which was fixed upon this fair object. It was with him, as with tho<U+017F>e who have been long in darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and come <U+017F>uddenly into the rayes of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and are dazled with too much light, and cannot <U+017F>ee. Pre<U+017F>ently after, having a little recollected him<U+017F>elfe, he began to con<U+017F>ider what he <U+017F>aw; looking <U+017F>ometimes upon her lovely face, <U+017F>ometimes upon her brea<U+017F>t, who<U+017F>e trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures were never before di<U+017F>covered; and he wi<U+017F>hed, <hi>Argos-like,</hi> that he had a body all of eyes. But in the mid<U+017F>t of this plea<U+017F>ing contemplation, a thought came into his minde, which bla<U+017F>ted all his joy. Retire, retire, unfortunate <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid he) retire from this ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed place, let it be no longer profaned with thy unhallowed eyes: Ha<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon forgot her commands? Do<U+017F>t thou not remember, it is not lawfull for thee to pre<U+017F>ent thy <U+017F>elfe before her eyes? Away, away, for <U+017F>hame offend no longer. Thus he went away, with folded armes, and eyes lifted up to heaven, as if he had left heart <U+017F>oul life, and all behinde him: His thoughts and his way were much different; for the further he went from <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:53526:170"/>
the more his thoughts followed him. When he was out of <U+017F>ight, he was <U+017F>o troubled, as he was forced to <U+017F>tay: To go on, <U+017F>aid he, I cannot; to return, I dare not; and to <U+017F>tay here, is to no purpo<U+017F>e: What then <U+017F>hould I do? Go, go, <U+017F>aid he, and receive that favour, which the heavens, unasked, does be<U+017F>tow upon thee. But how can I contradict the command of her, whom I did never di<U+017F>obey? But, an<U+017F>wered he, it is not contradicting her command; for <U+017F>he did not command me, not to <U+017F>ee her, for then I <U+017F>hould put out my eyes; but her command was, that I <U+017F>hould not come in her <U+017F>ight; and how can <U+017F>he <U+017F>ee me when <U+017F>he is a<U+017F>leep? Take Love therefore for thy guide, and under his conduct go and adore her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with this con<U+017F>ideration, he turned back, and went as <U+017F>oftly as he could, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould awake her; as <U+017F>oon as he came <U+017F>o neer as to <U+017F>ee her, he kneeled down, adored her, and pre<U+017F>ented this prayer unto her, in a whi<U+017F>pering voice.</p>
               <p>Oh great and pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant godde<U+017F><U+017F>e! <U+017F>ince it is more god-like to pardon then to puni<U+017F>h, I mo<U+017F>t devoutly pro<U+017F>trate my <U+017F>elfe upon my knees before you. I will not argue the matter with you, nor aske, whether my torments, which I have <U+017F>uffered through my <U+017F>ins, be not above the grandure of them, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>inned ignorantly; only I beg for pitty. Shew your <U+017F>elfe all divine in pardoning, and remitting me to my lo<U+017F>t felicity; for my <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion may as well move you to pardon, as my unknown offence unto puni<U+017F>hment.</p>
               <p>This was the prayer of the <U+017F>ad <U+017F>hepheard, not daring hardly to let the words go out of his lips, for fear of waking her, unto whom they were addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Then he aro<U+017F>e and went neerer to her, the better to look upon her: As he was deeply in his contemplation, <hi>Phillis</hi> turned her <U+017F>elfe from one <U+017F>ide to the other, yet not opening her eyes, nor waking. This put <hi>Celadon</hi> in <U+017F>uch a fright, that he ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could unto his <U+017F>ad habitation, where he no <U+017F>ooner was, but thinking upon this encounter, and that of the day before, he knew not whether he <U+017F>hould take it as a good or a bad pre<U+017F>age. At the la<U+017F>t, thinking upon that Letter which he put into the hand of <hi>Silvander,</hi> (for he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did know of it) he re<U+017F>olved to hazard another; and therefore, to lo<U+017F>e no time, he went to write it; le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be too late, and the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es awake. He <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cribed this as he did the fir<U+017F>t, and went with all ha<U+017F>te to the place where he left his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; but being afraid <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be awake when he came neer her, he crept behinde <U+017F>ome Trees, and looking every way, he knew they were <U+017F>till a<U+017F>leep; but he found the company was greater then he perceived at the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e then he did not <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>hepheards, of whom we <U+017F>poke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and, to <U+017F>ee whether any of them was of his acquaintance, he went gently towards them; the fir<U+017F>t he <U+017F>aw was <hi>Silvander:</hi> Oh faithfull friend, (<U+017F>aid he, in a low voice) how much am I obliged unto thee, for doing more for me then I dur<U+017F>t ever ask? Then turning his eyes upon the other foure <U+017F>hepheards, he knew none of them; yet he thought, he had <U+017F>een <hi>Tircis</hi> heretofore. Finding them all thus a<U+017F>leep, he went towards the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es. The Sun was already a good height, and finding pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the leaves, it began to <U+017F>hine in <U+017F>ome places upon them, <U+017F>o as if this <U+017F>hepheard had been as impartiall a Judge of Beauty, as he was a perfect Lover, he could hardly have told unto which of all the<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould have given the prize of Beauty: But as the long griefs of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had then made her yield <U+017F>omething unto <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>o the affection of this <U+017F>hepheard did <U+017F>upply that defect, and gave judgment on <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>'s <U+017F>ide. Then looking particularly upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he kneeled down, and could not chu<U+017F>e but ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her fair hand, afterwards did put the Letter into her brea<U+017F>t; and being tran<U+017F>ported with love, he could not chu<U+017F>e but ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her mouth: Oh how the <U+017F>hepheard was ravi<U+017F>hed! he had almo<U+017F>t quite forgot all fears of waking her, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <U+017F>o upon her, that <U+017F>he began to awake, and opened her drou<U+017F>ie eyes, when he was halfe ri<U+017F>en up; and had not the Sun-beams, which <U+017F>hined upon her face, dazled her eyes, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had known him; this was the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ee him, but as a <U+017F>haddow, and when <U+017F>he began to look after him, her hair was <U+017F>o intangld with a few ru<U+017F>hes that was under her head, that they did hinder her; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but cry out aloud <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>tarted up and asked her what the matter was? But <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>peak, but <U+017F>till untangled her hair. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> up, and let a paper fall, <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, and was very officious to take it up, following her <U+017F>ome twenty paces from the place where they lay. Then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>at down under a Tree, extreamly pale, and ready to <U+017F>wound, which <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing, <U+017F>he helped her all <U+017F>he could; and when <U+017F>he was a little come unto her <U+017F>elfe: Oh dear Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> with a deep <U+017F>igh) what is this which I have <U+017F>een? Then <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ilent a long while, and could not <U+017F>peak for <U+017F>ighing; a little after,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53526:171"/>
<U+017F>he began with a very great <U+017F>igh, and <U+017F>aid: Oh Si<U+017F>ter, I have <U+017F>een <hi>Celadon,</hi> I mean his Gho<U+017F>t. At this word <hi>[Celadon]</hi> her voice failed, and her tongue could not do its office; but <U+017F>he joyned her hands together, and li<U+017F>ted her eyes up to heaven, as if from thence <U+017F>he begged help. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing her in this condition believed, that <U+017F>he had been in <U+017F>ome afrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dream: Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, there is no credit to be given unto any dreams, they are no more but the working of the fancy and imagination, upon <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ubjects as have been <U+017F>een or thought upon; nor are they any pre<U+017F>ages of things future, only images and fancies of things pa<U+017F>t. Ah Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> this was no dream; I <U+017F>aw him with the<U+017F>e eyes, and as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw I looked upon him, he vani<U+017F>hed into aire. Perhaps, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> you did but think your <U+017F>elfe to be awake, for <U+017F>o it often happens in <U+017F>leep. No, no, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> I was awake. And how did you <U+017F>ee him, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis?</hi> I was (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> betwixt <U+017F>leeping and waking, when I heard <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ighing about me, even about my face; and when I opened my eyes, I <U+017F>aw the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Celadon</hi> before me: but, Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! how glorious and full of light it was? the Sun it <U+017F>elfe had no more <U+017F>plendent lu<U+017F>tre; And, Si<U+017F>ter, I was even dazled at the <U+017F>ight of it, untill I came hither; but as <U+017F>oon as ever I did ca<U+017F>t my eye upon him, he vani<U+017F>hed like lightning. Oh glorious Soul! thou had<U+017F>t good rea<U+017F>on not to let the <U+017F>ight of her fully thee, who was <U+017F>o undi<U+017F>creetly carele<U+017F><U+017F>e of thy life. How infinitely am I obliged unto thee, who having <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on to hate me, yet makes it appear, that thy love continues. <hi>Phillis,</hi> with much amazement, did now believe, that certainly it was the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and therefore <U+017F>aid thus unto her: All we can do for tho<U+017F>e who are departed this life, is to pre<U+017F>erve their memory, to talk often of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to render them the la<U+017F>t office of pitty, which is buriall; therefore I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is requi<U+017F>ite, for your own contentinent, and <U+017F>atisfaction of this <U+017F>oul, who <U+017F>o much loved you, that you do cau<U+017F>e a Tombe to be built, in which it may re<U+017F>t, and to pre<U+017F>erve the memory of him among<U+017F>t us as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we can. That <U+017F>hall I do, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> as long as any life is in me. But, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> would it not be taken ill, that I, who am not a kin unto him, <U+017F>hould render him this la<U+017F>t office of a Sepulcher? What can be <U+017F>aid, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis)</hi> but that his kindred neglecting their duty, you have done what they ought to have done? Were he alive, there might <U+017F>ome doubt be made of it; but being dead, they may well imagine, that your pa<U+017F>t amity, which is known as well as your name, would require <U+017F>o much of you. As <hi>Phillis</hi> was thus talking to her, <U+017F>he held in her hand the paper which <U+017F>he took up, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> ca<U+017F>ting her eye accidentally upon it, and knowing it to be <hi>Celadon</hi>'s hand, <U+017F>he asked her, what Letter that was which <U+017F>he held in her hand? <hi>Phillis</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he took it up, <U+017F>eeing it fall from her as <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e. I did feel <U+017F>omething (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> fall from my brea<U+017F>t; but I was <U+017F>o much out of my <U+017F>elfe, that I never minded it. Then taking it, and reading the Super<U+017F>cription, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, it was that Letter which <hi>Silvander</hi> found. That cannot be, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> for I have that in my pocket; and putting her hand into it, <U+017F>he pulled it out. What <U+017F>hould it then be, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> I am <U+017F>ure it is the <U+017F>ame hand. Then reading it, <U+017F>he found the<U+017F>e words.</p>

Now did the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es believe, that <hi>Celadon</hi> was dead indeed, and Love made <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> re<U+017F>olve, to render him the la<U+017F>t duty of her amity. Then <U+017F>he went to wake <hi>Diana</hi> and the other <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e it was late; when they came, they found <hi>Silvander</hi> looking upon <hi>Diana</hi> as <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept; and, gazing like an immovable Statue, he uttered the<U+017F>e words in a very loud voice: Oh! how this fair one deprives me of that re<U+017F>t which <U+017F>he takes her <U+017F>elfe? See how many <hi>Cupids</hi> play about her lovely face! Who can chu<U+017F>e but love her, and lo<U+017F>e that re<U+017F>t which <U+017F>he findes? To look upon her and to love her, is one and the <U+017F>ame thing. And if <U+017F>he captivate thus when <U+017F>he is a<U+017F>leep, and without de<U+017F>igne, what is <U+017F>he able to do when <U+017F>hee's awake, and will u<U+017F>e her power?</p>
               <p>He <U+017F>poke thus loud, becau<U+017F>e he was not afraid of awaking her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he commanded him <U+017F>o to do, as <U+017F>oon as the Moon <U+017F>hined. But <hi>Celadon's</hi> good fortune would not have it <U+017F>o, to the end he might enjoy the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>eeing his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e in that place. After <hi>Silvander</hi> had uttered the<U+017F>e words, he kneeled down to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand; but fearing to be <U+017F>een by the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who he <U+017F>aw were not in their places, he ro<U+017F>e up, very <U+017F>orry he had done <U+017F>o much, if he were <U+017F>een. In the mean time, the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es looked upon him, and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was very de<U+017F>irous to divert <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> Never tru<U+017F>t me, Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) if this <U+017F>hepheard do not love <hi>Diana,</hi> and is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle as he thinks him<U+017F>elfe. I <U+017F>poke ye<U+017F>terday with <hi>Diana</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> very <U+017F>adly) and for ought I could perceive, he can expect nothing but much <U+017F>orrow; for, <U+017F>he will neither love him, nor <U+017F>uffer him to love her. That re<U+017F>olution (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> may in a <U+017F>hort time bring <hi>Silvander</hi> into the <U+017F>ame condition with <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> into the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate with <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Ah Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea) Silvander</hi> may run that fortune; but as long as <hi>Diana</hi> is free from love, her fortune will never be <U+017F>o bad as mine. I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> that if <U+017F>he be really exempt from love <U+017F>he is not in that danger; but, if <U+017F>he be exempt only out of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulat<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, what think you then? That <U+017F>he will be happy only in opinion, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and in deed and truth mi<U+017F>erable. But there is no likelyhood of that, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s humour, and <hi>Silvander</hi>'s perfections, being <U+017F>uch, that neither the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e nor he, can be <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>uch dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters. Upon this, <hi>Phillis</hi> took her by the hand and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towards <hi>Diana;</hi> yet an<U+017F>wered her; Oh Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you are deceived, if you be of that opinion: for, as concerning the merits of <hi>Silvander,</hi> believe it, that when a <U+017F>hepheard has a de<U+017F>igne to plea<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>pru<U+017F>eth him<U+017F>elfe up, and is quite another man from what he really is: And hence it is, that we often wonder to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hepheards loved and welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who are thought not at all plea<U+017F>ing or hand<U+017F>ome; and from hence, I believe, the Proverb came, that, Love makes all <U+017F>eem hand<U+017F>ome: Nay, I will <U+017F>ay more, I never yet <U+017F>aw any <U+017F>hepheard di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her he courted, if there were not <U+017F>ome other occa<U+017F>ion of hatred then his love; for, their court<U+017F>hip and de<U+017F>ire to plea<U+017F>e, does make them dre<U+017F><U+017F>e up them<U+017F>elves in the <U+017F>moothe<U+017F>t garb they can, purpo<U+017F>ely to render them<U+017F>elves complai<U+017F>ant: as this is the quality of all in generall, <U+017F>o more <U+017F>pecially in <hi>Silvander,</hi> who<U+017F>e wit, and hand<U+017F>ome compo<U+017F>ure by nature, may ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>upply all defects. And as for the humour of <hi>Diana,</hi> her affection unto <hi>Philander</hi> is an infallible argument, that <U+017F>he hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of Love; and why may not that which was once, be again. For my part, I do believe, Love is as good an Archer as ever he was, and has not forgotten the skill he u<U+017F>ed, the fir<U+017F>t time he wounded her: and <hi>Silvander</hi> may have the <U+017F>ame fortune <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had. In this (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> you and I do differ in opinion, and I do think it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hould ever love again; for I think, a Maid, who never was in love, may ea<U+017F>ily be allured by the plea<U+017F>ing flatteries of it; but impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that a <U+017F>tayed per<U+017F>on, who did once love, and lo<U+017F>t the per<U+017F>on loved, <U+017F>hould ever let love take any root again in her <U+017F>oul: And me-thinks the Cypre<U+017F><U+017F>e-Tree is a right emblem of my affection, which, when once cut, never puts out branch again. As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they were come <U+017F>o neer unto <hi>Diana,</hi> that <hi>Phillis</hi> could make no other an<U+017F>wer but this: Si<U+017F>ter, we <U+017F>hall quickly <U+017F>ee, which of our opinions is the right.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es were thus talking, <hi>Paris, Hylas, Tircis,</hi> and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> being awakened by <hi>Silvander,</hi> they came to the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o loud, that they awaked <hi>Diana.</hi> She was much a<U+017F>hamed, to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elfe almo<U+017F>t quite undre<U+017F>t, among<U+017F>t all that good company; and therefore holding her hair with one hand, and covering her brea<U+017F>t with the other, <U+017F>he went further from them behinde <U+017F>ome Trees: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> followed her, and whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe, related unto her <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>'s vi<U+017F>ion, how the Letter fell from her brea<U+017F>t, and how <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had re<U+017F>olved to build a Tombe for the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>ince his Kindred neglected it.

This office (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana)</hi> is indeed full of piety and pitty, and for my part, I <U+017F>hould not di<U+017F>approve of it, if it would not be an occa<U+017F>ion of much talk and wonder, that the enmity of your Parents <U+017F>hould be changed into <U+017F>o much good-will. What wonder will it be, replyed the <U+017F>ad <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e? It would be more <U+017F>trange, if this enmity <U+017F>hould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue after death. If <hi>Celadon</hi> were alive, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould not let the affection which I bear unto him, be known. But, alas! <U+017F>ince to my <U+017F>oules eternall <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, he is not alive, I would not have both earth and heaven ignorant of it. And upon this rea<U+017F>on, I do ground my re<U+017F>olution; my friends will never finde fault with any thing that <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e me, and as for the re<U+017F>t, I will never deprive my <U+017F>elfe of my contentment, to content them.

Then <hi>Paris</hi> turning towards <hi>Tircis,</hi> de<U+017F>ired him to make choice of one that was fit, and <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Blame me not, I be<U+017F>eech you, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> for the fault which I have committed, for it is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be <U+017F>o neer you, and think upon any thing el<U+017F>e. That excu<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana)</hi> might be mine as well as yours; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o neer you, my thoughts al<U+017F>o might have been as much of you. If your merits and mine were equall, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Paris)</hi> or our wills the <U+017F>ame, then perhaps it might have been your excu<U+017F>e as well as mine. If there was any fault, it was on my <U+017F>ide, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana.</hi> Yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, for there was nothing in me which could take up your thoughts. I do not apprehend that to be the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> for I do e<U+017F>teem and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you as I ought to do. I would to god, <hi>Diana,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Paris)</hi> that you were as ju<U+017F>t as you are fair. Wherein do you think me unju<U+017F>t, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana)</hi> for how <U+017F>hould I e<U+017F>teem and honour you more then I do? This e<U+017F>teem and this honour, of which you <U+017F>peak (<U+017F>aid he) is not that which I demand; but if you would be plea<U+017F>ed to change this e<U+017F>teem into affection, and this honour into familiarity, I <U+017F>hould be fully contented and <U+017F>atisfied. I know you (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) more rea<U+017F>onable, then to de<U+017F>ire any more: Content your <U+017F>elfe, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> that I do love and e<U+017F>teem you as much, as if you were my Brother: I know, that I being a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and you as you are, I ought not to go any further; but I had rather offend again<U+017F>t the Lawes of civility, than di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure to have it <U+017F>o. This, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> is a beginning of what I de<U+017F>ire, but not all. In this (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana)</hi> as in all things el<U+017F>e, your de<U+017F>ires mu<U+017F>t be ruled by rea<U+017F>on. Is it not rea<U+017F>onable (<U+017F>aid <hi>Paris)</hi> that <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hould make choice of one, whom <U+017F>he will create happy, and with whom <U+017F>he may live happily? This choice (replyed <hi>Diana)</hi> is a piece of great difficulty, and I will ever refer it unto tho<U+017F>e, that are wi<U+017F>er than my <U+017F>elfe. Who are they, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris?</hi> Who <U+017F>hould they be, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> but my Mother and my Uncle? <hi>Paris</hi> would have replyed, if <hi>Tircis</hi> had not interrupted him, and told him, that he had found out a fit Pole. <hi>Diana</hi> was very glad of this, for this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e began to vex her. <hi>Paris,</hi> on the contrary, was very <U+017F>orry; for he de<U+017F>ired to know of her, whether <U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to let him <U+017F>peak unto them concerning it. But <hi>Diana</hi> fearing it, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired <hi>Phillis</hi> not to be <U+017F>o far from her as <U+017F>he had been, le<U+017F>t <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>hould fall into this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e again: But having made choice of a Pole, they tryed to cut it; but their knives not being <U+017F>trong enough, they were con<U+017F>trained only to mark it, and <U+017F>tay till <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> returned, believing, that <hi>Silvander</hi> would not forget any thing that was requi<U+017F>ite for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Walking therefore towards the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>till hoping to fall into his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e again, they e<U+017F>pyed, as they were going out of the Wood, a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>itting under a <U+017F>hady Sycamour, and her hair being very long and curled, as it covered her almo<U+017F>t all over as <U+017F>he <U+017F>at, they could not imagine what it <U+017F>hould be; but approaching a little neerer, they knew her to be a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; yet, <U+017F>ince her di<U+017F>hevelled hair would not let them <U+017F>ee her face, they were very de<U+017F>irous to approach neerer: And as they were looking upon her, they <U+017F>aw a young <U+017F>hepheard come, and fall upon his knees before her, who <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ed her before <U+017F>he had time to ri<U+017F>e: Neither this <U+017F>hepheard nor <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e were known unto any of this Company, although they were both inhabitants in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town. As for the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he might well be <U+017F>aid to be fair, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of her hair and habit, rather added then took away from her hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F><U+017F>e. But this Company was mo<U+017F>t of all amazed, to <U+017F>ee another <U+017F>hepheard, who e<U+017F>pying them, did look upon them with a <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed action, yet had a de<U+017F>ire to conceal it, and him<U+017F>elfe both; <U+017F>ometimes he thru<U+017F>t his head out of the bu<U+017F>h which covered him, and hearkened what they <U+017F>aid with a mo<U+017F>t attentive ear; othertimes he did <U+017F>hake and <U+017F>cratch his head, and upon a <U+017F>udden hold both his hands up to heaven, then let them fall again in a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate po<U+017F>ture. To be briefe, he was <U+017F>o impatient to <U+017F>ee them together, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion appeared in all his actions. On the other <U+017F>ide, the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with the <U+017F>ight of him that kneeled before her, as <U+017F>he would not daigne him a look, but made all the ha<U+017F>te <U+017F>he could in dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe, that <U+017F>he might be gone from that place. <hi>Diana</hi> and her Company <U+017F>eeing the beauty and di<U+017F>dain of this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, al<U+017F>o the affection and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of him that kneeled before her, and the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ions of him that looked on, they had a great de<U+017F>ire to know more of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; and therefore, untill <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> returned, they approached as neer as they could un<U+017F>een unto
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53526:173"/>
them, &amp; then they heard the <U+017F>hepheard with a deep <U+017F>igh <U+017F>ay thus unto her: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that neither my de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>erve you, nor the power you have to make your <U+017F>elf adored, <U+017F>hould have any prevalence with you? I know not (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he di<U+017F>dainfully) what your de<U+017F>ires are, nor what my power is; but I am <U+017F>ure, that any thing which comes from you can never plea<U+017F>e me. This (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) is the wor<U+017F>t of misfortunes that ever could befall me. If cu<U+017F>tome (replyed the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e) do make things difficult to be ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>upported, me thinks you <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>o deeply re<U+017F>ent the misfortunes of it, <U+017F>ince you have been <U+017F>o long accu<U+017F>tomed unto it; for, ever <U+017F>ince the fir<U+017F>t houre you decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your minde unto me, I did <U+017F>o cleerly acquaint you with mine, as you might that fir<U+017F>t time have known as much, as you have <U+017F>ince found, or ever <U+017F>hall do. Oh <hi>Doris,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard) if my <U+017F>oul were as regardle<U+017F><U+017F>e of your di<U+017F>daines, as your heart is of my prayers, certainly I <U+017F>hould never have re<U+017F>ented them: But alas, this cu<U+017F>tome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as he, who has a heavy burthen upon his back, the longer he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it, the more in<U+017F>upportable it is. The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e was a long while without reply, and was intent only upon dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe; but <U+017F>eeing he offered to begin again, <U+017F>he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his <U+017F>peech: <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, all your language is to no purpo<U+017F>e; and let me tell you this once for all, that I will neither love nor be loved; and unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will have me mo<U+017F>t abominably hate you, trouble me no more. Oh ye gods! (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard) what di<U+017F>mall doom is this? Then turning towards her: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid he unto her, that the gods <U+017F>hould be weary of being adored by mortalls, and that you <U+017F>hould be weary of being <U+017F>o by me? Nay, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never wonder at it, for I am no godde<U+017F><U+017F>e; or if I were, any <U+017F>acrifice <U+017F>hould be more acceptable unto me than yours; and I had rather be without any temples or altars, then have <U+017F>uch adorers. Upon this la<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he had done dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe, and therefore <U+017F>he took up her <U+017F>heephook and went away, leaving this poor <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly afflicted, that he had not power or boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing her depart thus, <U+017F>he had a minde to call upon her; but <U+017F>eeing al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he went towards the other <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>he thought it better to <U+017F>tay, and hear more: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the other <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>eeing her comming towards him, he went to meet her, and held her by the gown, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould go away; <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to be out of his hands, but the <U+017F>hepheard pre<U+017F>ently kneeled down, and begged pardon for his fault. It is not your fault only in thus holding me, that you ought to repent of, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; but, <U+017F>hepheard, becau<U+017F>e of that fault, which hath quite extingui<U+017F>hed all the good-will which I did bear unto you. As for that, an<U+017F>wered he, in lieu of language, I will expiate it with my blood and life; but dare not beg, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in <U+017F>ilence and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ince indeed I do not well know what it is <hi>Palemon,</hi> replyed <U+017F>he, there is none <U+017F>o ignorant, as he that will not know when he may: But that is all one to me, for I am <U+017F>o perfectly cured of the wound, that there is not any mark of it remaines. It is an ea<U+017F>ie matter, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard to cure a wound that was but very <U+017F>mal. I will not tell you, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, how it began to fe<U+017F>ter, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould increa<U+017F>e your vanity; but let me tell you, that I had rather die, then relap<U+017F>e into that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e out of which I am recovered; and I had rather never <U+017F>ee any whil<U+017F>t I live, then <U+017F>ee you in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and <U+017F>tate in which you were wont to be: Al<U+017F>o, I charge you to talk no more of it, nor to retain me by any force. Since you are plea<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>aid he, to forbid me <U+017F>peaking; yet, I be<U+017F>eech, permit me to <U+017F>ing, what my heart does <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ent. Then he <U+017F>ighed, and <U+017F>ung out the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es; which <U+017F>he, to vex him, an<U+017F>wered.</p>

               <p>Though <hi>Doris</hi> was very tart in all her an<U+017F>wers, yet the <U+017F>hepheard did take <U+017F>ome kinde of delight in <U+017F>eeing and hearing her talk, but <U+017F>he, de<U+017F>iring to avoid his company, <U+017F>he came towards the place where <hi>Diana</hi> was, who <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he could not hide her <U+017F>elfe any longer, <U+017F>he and her company advanced towards this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and after common <U+017F>alutations, <U+017F>aid unto her: I wonder not, <U+017F>weet <hi>Doris,</hi> that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards whom I <U+017F>ee with you, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much captivated with your beauty, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>uch, as tho<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t needs be blinde, that do not admire it; but, I mu<U+017F>t needs wonder at the cruelty you u<U+017F>e towards them, <U+017F>ince you are the only <U+017F>he, who di<U+017F>daines that which is their own, and which you have gotten by <U+017F>uch fair and deer armes. Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Diana</hi> was <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <hi>Palemon</hi> came to them, and heard <hi>Doris</hi> return this an<U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>Sage <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that beauty, which out of your complai<U+017F>ance you are plea<U+017F>ed to call mine, is mo<U+017F>t really and truly your own, and to be admired by all <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ee you: And I do not know with what armes I have captivated the<U+017F>e you <U+017F>peak of unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>uch as are very unhappy in making <U+017F>uch a conque<U+017F>t.

This pa<U+017F><U+017F>age did <U+017F>o <U+017F>ting the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that one could not get a good word from her all that day.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Leonida</hi> and the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> were in que<U+017F>t of a convenient place to <U+017F>it down in, they e<U+017F>pied <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es in the Wood, comming towards them; for, the Trees being at a good di<U+017F>tance from one another, without any underwood, one might <U+017F>ee a great way, both through and beyond it. When <hi>Leonida</hi> asked who they were, none could tell her; but when they were a little neerer, <hi>Hylas,</hi> who was among<U+017F>t them, was known to be one; and pre<U+017F>ently after, the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F>ses were al<U+017F>o known to be <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> with whom <hi>Hylas</hi> met upon the way, and <U+017F>tayed with them, never thinking upon the Inke which he went to <U+017F>eek; and had they not asked him whither he went, and from whence he came, he had not remembered what he went about; but this que<U+017F>tion putting him in memory, he de<U+017F>ired them to <U+017F>tay a little, till he went for the Inke, and he would return to them. Then he acquainted them with the Ceremony of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Tombe, unto which they came to be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants; but they came too late. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> not knowing who they were, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee them. And <hi>Hylas,</hi> who<U+017F>e tongue was never mute, came on a jolly pace, <U+017F>inging the<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es.</p>

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of</hi> Doris <hi>and</hi> Palemon.</head>
               <p>I Have ever been of opinion, great and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, and you, venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante,</hi> that if there be any obligations among<U+017F>t Mankinde, to tye one unto another, it is Amity: Whether this be <U+017F>o or no, I refer it unto the judgment of any who were ever loved. I being thus in this beliefe, after I had been long loved by this <U+017F>hepheard, I thought my <U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged, to render him amity for amity. The truth is, this amity at the fir<U+017F>t, had but a very <U+017F>lender and faint beginning, and I could not imagine, it <U+017F>hould ever grow into that magnitude it did; it did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly take <U+017F>o deep a root by long continued conver<U+017F>ation, as when I perceived it, I found it was not in my power to root it out; and <U+017F>o, as I never que<U+017F>tioned his affection, nor could he de<U+017F>ire any thing of me, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not, atlea<U+017F>t, in any rea<U+017F>on. Yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, I know not how, to my mi<U+017F>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when he was in full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of me, he did even then mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t me, <U+017F>o as he was not contented, I <U+017F>hould leave frequenting all tho<U+017F>e whom I was accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>ee, but would needs have others deprived of <U+017F>eeing me; <U+017F>o as not being contented with my not vi<U+017F>iting any of my Companions, but if any of them came to <U+017F>ee me, it was a thing intolerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>Have I not all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to be offended at him, for this bad opinion of me, which his jealou<U+017F>ie hath infu<U+017F>ed into him? For gods-<U+017F>ake judge, into what extream tyranny is his amity changed: Yet neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e, rather then di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him, I cho<U+017F>e ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lo<U+017F>e the good-will of all my friends, neighbours, and acquaintance, rather then he <U+017F>hould receive any dis-<U+017F>atisfaction from me. God knowes, in what a <U+017F>trange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>traint I lived; and though I did <U+017F>trive to be as agreeable to his humour as I could, and to content him, and though it was plea<U+017F>ing to me <U+017F>o to do; yet, my <U+017F>trange retiredne<U+017F><U+017F>e from all <U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, from all my friends and acquaintance, as if I were <U+017F>ick of <U+017F>ome infectious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, was extreamly hard unto me. If this jealou<U+017F>ie of his did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his affection unto me, was not he as much obliged to do as much for me, as he con<U+017F>trained me to do for him? But he was <U+017F>o far from that, as during all this time, which I may well terme a <U+017F>alvage life, (for truly <U+017F>o was mine become, only to be <U+017F>uitable unto his humour) he would not vi<U+017F>it me above halfe a quarter of an houre in a day, vi<U+017F>its <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort, as I could do no more then <U+017F>ee him, but hardly <U+017F>peak one word unto him. Judge; I be<U+017F>eech you, whether I have not good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, that his affection is turned into tyranny, <U+017F>ince he was growne like unto tho<U+017F>e, who at the fir<U+017F>t, under a colour of good husbandry, do afterwards grow <U+017F>o niggardly, both unto them<U+017F>elves, and tho<U+017F>e that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, as they will not allow a <U+017F>ufficient competency to live upon. For, I do believe, his life was no more plea<U+017F>ing unto him, then mine unto me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in this, that his was voluntary, and mine con<U+017F>trained. But <U+017F>ee, whether I was not very good unto him, and loved him very well: I endured all his tyranny without the lea<U+017F>t murmur; and had not he him<U+017F>elfe relea<U+017F>ed me, I my <U+017F>elfe never had. The la<U+017F>t te<U+017F>timony which I gave him of my obedience (for <U+017F>o I may phra<U+017F>e it, better then affection) was <U+017F>uch, as was enough to qualifie all his perver<U+017F>e and odd humours.</p>
               <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know, great Nymph, that I lived very young without Father or Mother, under the tuition of a Brother, who being elder then I, was ever <U+017F>o affectionate
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53526:176"/>
and indulgent towards me, as he did very well <U+017F>upply the want of Father, both in the education of my Per<U+017F>on, and management of my E<U+017F>tate, and abundantly officious, in doing me the offices of a very Father. He being thus good unto me, common rea<U+017F>on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides other con<U+017F>iderations, commanded me, to conform my <U+017F>elfe unto his will, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, and contrary him in nothing. <hi>Palemon,</hi> without any con<U+017F>ideration of all this, would needs have me ab<U+017F>olutely to break off from him; not that I <U+017F>hould go out of his hou<U+017F>e, for he knew not whither el<U+017F>e I could go, but that I <U+017F>hould not have any core<U+017F>pondency with tho<U+017F>e whom he loved; nay that I <U+017F>hould forbid them the <U+017F>ight of me. Tho<U+017F>e who live under the authority of another, do know, whether this be fea<U+017F>able or no. Yet, to let him <U+017F>ee, how ready I was, to give him any te<U+017F>timony of my affection, I did attempt to give him <U+017F>atisfaction in this. My Brother, among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of his neighbours, did love a <U+017F>hepheard who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon,</hi> a man, truly, who was qualified with all good conditions to render him amiable and plea<U+017F>ing; he was wi<U+017F>e, civill, re<U+017F>pective, affable, couragious, and a good friend, and among<U+017F>t <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, he was the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in all the Town. The<U+017F>e qualities did invite my Brother to love him, and there grew <U+017F>o greet a familiarity between them, that they were never a<U+017F><U+017F>under. Now I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that as he loved my Brother very well, yet I know not, whether he ob<U+017F>erved any thing in me which plea<U+017F>ed him, or whether it was, that he bore good will unto the Si<U+017F>ter for the Brothers <U+017F>ake; yet <U+017F>o it was, that I knew he loved me. Now you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, whether I did not behave my <U+017F>elfe as I ought to do with <hi>Palemon:</hi> As <U+017F>oon as ever I knew this, I told him of it, and related unto him all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and all the demon<U+017F>trations of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I ob<U+017F>erved in him. If I had had any de<U+017F>ignes, you may imagine, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done thus. Oh heavens! what reverence, what honour, and what <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion did this <U+017F>hepheard render unto me? His merits and affection were <U+017F>o worthy of all entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with my Brother's friend<U+017F>hip, that as I did under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>ince, he did intend to marry us together. But I, notwith<U+017F>tanding the relation of a Brother's friend, did receive his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es with more <U+017F>aintne<U+017F><U+017F>e, then any other: For knowing he loved me, I thought it an injury unto the affection of <hi>Palemon,</hi> if I gave him any countenance, though civility in any other might have done it without offence. This was the man, whom <hi>Palemon</hi> charged me not to <U+017F>ee. And how do you think it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to obey him? <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>mon</hi> had a greater de<U+017F>ire to obey me, then <hi>Palemon</hi> had rea<U+017F>on for his reque<U+017F>t; for, how could I give him <U+017F>atisfaction? which way <U+017F>hould I forbid him my Brothers hou<U+017F>e, who perhaps loved him better then he loved me? However, I took <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon</hi> a<U+017F>ide, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my will. I will manife<U+017F>t my affection unto you, <U+017F>aid he, not only by the effects of my affection, but al<U+017F>o by the effects of your hatred: You are plea<U+017F>ed, without any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you could have any hopes in me, you had the more rea<U+017F>on to be angry; but <U+017F>ince you cannot, what plea<U+017F>ure can you take, in rendring me mi<U+017F>erable by loving me, without any hopes, but in my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure? You need not u<U+017F>e any more words to per<U+017F>wade me (an<U+017F>wered he; my affection, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted unto your will, prompts me unto more then you can <U+017F>ay: I <U+017F>hall, untill the very la<U+017F>t minute of my life, do what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall command me, without any other aime, end, or de<U+017F>igne, but only to obey you.

Now, I be<U+017F>eech you, were not all the<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies of my affection enough, to oblige this ungratefull <U+017F>hepheard for ever unto one?

I much de<U+017F>ired to know the cau<U+017F>e of his retreat, and therefore I did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a faithfull friend to go unto him from me: But no other an<U+017F>wer could be gotten, but this, that, <hi>Love drives out Love, as one naile dxives out another.</hi> Upon this, I had two conceptions: Fir<U+017F>t, that he was fallen in love with <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and this <U+017F>econd love had driven out the fir<U+017F>t unto me. Secondly, that by his <U+017F>leighting of me, he gave me coun<U+017F>ell to do the <U+017F>ame. Being thus abandoned and for<U+017F>aken, though it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly requi<U+017F>itie to u<U+017F>e my be<U+017F>t armes again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch an accident, yet would I not make u<U+017F>e of any <U+017F>uch, as my enemy <U+017F>ent me; for <U+017F>corning them as his, I thought them unworthy of my <U+017F>elfe, and I e<U+017F>teemed them perfidious, becau<U+017F>e I e<U+017F>teemed their Inventor <U+017F>o. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e therefore unto other remedies, which, though more <U+017F>low, yet more certain in their effects, which was, Time: Time, I <U+017F>ay, was my Armes, and it which taught me the u<U+017F>e of them; it was both my Phy<U+017F>ician and my Phy<U+017F>ick. And truly, as mo<U+017F>t things that are <U+017F>low, are yet mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>o the cure it wrought, was through; not for a day, but I thank god, for all the re<U+017F>t of my life. I <U+017F>ay, I do thank god, for indeed I had abundance of rea<U+017F>on; for great Nymph, when I call into my memory the life I lived, as long as this perfidious man <U+017F>eemed to love me, and compare it with that which I do live now, I mu<U+017F>t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s, that I am more obliged unto him for betraying me, then I am unto <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying me For then, (I cannot call it a life, but a <U+017F>lavery) my affection was not affection, but obedience; and his love was not love, but tyranny. Now this di<U+017F>loyall man, being (as I believe) envious at my happy life, or el<U+017F>e not contented with once triumphing, he mu<U+017F>t needs make a <U+017F>econd attempt: And, as at the fir<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed me by <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and great demon<U+017F>trations of a violent affection, <U+017F>o he thinks now to catch me with the <U+017F>ame bait: And therefore, Oh great and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, you <U+017F>ee him here on his knees before me, u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch language and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as they do who are really in love. But he does not con<U+017F>ider, that finding my <U+017F>elfe weake<U+017F>t on that <U+017F>ide, I have more <U+017F>trongly fortified it: I am fully re<U+017F>olved to hold him out at armed end, let him attempt as long as he will; his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, in lieu of love, have renewed <U+017F>uch extream di<U+017F>dain of him in my <U+017F>oul, that I cannot endure the very <U+017F>ight of him: And if his de<U+017F>igne was to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, he hath brought it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e; but if that be not his de<U+017F>igne, (as he <U+017F>wears, and would make me believe, it is not) but that, as a ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment from heaven, he hath revived his flame, that he him<U+017F>elfe was the only author of his own misfortune, and that he is prepared for puni<U+017F>hment; I mu<U+017F>t then confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that in giving me this occa<U+017F>ion of revenge upon the wrong he hath done me, he is a ju<U+017F>t man, but <U+017F>till no good Lover. But yet, why does he tell me of his misfortunes and mi<U+017F>eries? me, I <U+017F>ay, who would not <U+017F>o much as remember that he is in the world. Or why does he take up <U+017F>uch Armes, as thinking to hurt me with them, he wounds him<U+017F>elfe? He cannot ever have any hopes to obtain any thing from me, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>oul <U+017F>marts with the memory of what is pa<U+017F>t, as oft as I look upon him. Let him therefore let me alone, and leave me, to enjoy that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which he conferred upon me by a contrary de<U+017F>igne. If the heavens, as often they do, have converted that unto my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which he prepared for my mi<U+017F>ery, why is he <U+017F>orry I <U+017F>hould enjoy it? I know better how to make u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e favours from heaven, then he hath of tho<U+017F>e, which I have done him heretofore. Let him acknowledge and confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the heavens have mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>tly maintained my cau<U+017F>e, and defended my innocent affection again<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t ungratefull and perfidious per<U+017F>on, that ever pretended to be a Lover. If, like a lo<U+017F>ing game<U+017F>ter, he ask any thing for his la<U+017F>t hand, this, great and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, is all I can do for him; I will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>atisfied for his ingratitude, and forgive it; I will pitty him, upon condition, he will never <U+017F>ee me, nor trouble me any more; and this <U+017F>hall be all the revenge I will take, for all his injuries.</p>
               <p>Thus the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e ended, with <U+017F>o much colour in her face, as rendred her fairer then <U+017F>he was wont to be. Then <hi>Leonida</hi> perceiving, <U+017F>he had no more to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he commanded <hi>Palemon</hi> to <U+017F>peak, what he had to <U+017F>ay for him<U+017F>elfe. Then the <U+017F>hepheard ri<U+017F>ing up, after an humble reverence unto the Nymph, he began thus.</p>

                              </gap> me undeceived, and convinced of that errour wherein I have long lived, if I can call that a life, which hath brought me more torments then death it <U+017F>elfe. I do mo<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, all that this fair <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e hath related unto you, is mo<U+017F>t true, and that I am infinitely more obliged unto her then either <U+017F>he or I can expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. But having heard her reproach me, for complaining, that the heavens, as envious of my bli<U+017F><U+017F>e, hath kept me from it, I <U+017F>hould think this to be a greater occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>orrow, and to accu<U+017F>e it of inju<U+017F>tice, did I not know, that all men are in the like condition, and that there is no perfect contentment here below. I cannot chu<U+017F>e but beg leave to grieve, for the wrong this fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e hath done unto that affection, which <U+017F>he hath promi<U+017F>ed me, by mi<U+017F>interpreting mine, and taking that for an injury, which <U+017F>he ought to take for the greate<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>urance and demon<U+017F>tration of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But, Oh great god of Love! how dare I complain again<U+017F>t her, <U+017F>ince thou ha<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to think all well that <U+017F>he doth? I will therefore u<U+017F>e no complaints again<U+017F>t her, for my heart will not give me leave to contradict her in any thing. But, Oh wi<U+017F>e Nymph, I will endeavour to let you <U+017F>ee, by telling the truth, that <hi>Palemon</hi> doth love, and that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> has no rea<U+017F>on to believe the contrary. And, to be as briefe as I can, <U+017F>he does confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I did love her, and that <U+017F>he did love me; but why does <U+017F>he upbraid me with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity? Her rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e I was jealous, and I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was. But if <U+017F>he did love me as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he did, for loving her, why <U+017F>hould my affection be plea<U+017F>ing to her, and not the effects of my affection? If all that looked upon her, made me jealous, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation, their words, nay, their very lookes, made me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious, was not this a mo<U+017F>t certain te<U+017F>timony, that I did infinitely love her? She hath often told me, that to doubt of her, was to offend her, and to make a <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter con<U+017F>truction of her. Ah great Nymph, did this fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e know as well how to love, as her eyes do to make her adored, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ay, that this was rather extream love, and the high opinion of her, which made me doubt her. Had I not thought her mo<U+017F>t worthy to be <U+017F>erved by every one, I <U+017F>hould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought, that every one had <U+017F>erved her. And had I not been of that beliefe, how could I have been jealous of every one? Jealou<U+017F>ie therefore, Oh fair <hi>Doris,</hi> is not a le<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>igne of affection and violent love, then <U+017F>ighes and tears are; for, it hath its originall from the knowledge one hath of the perfections in the per<U+017F>on loved; but <U+017F>ighes and tears do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proceed from her cruelty only, and from the torments which they re<U+017F>ent by rea<U+017F>on thereof. She therefore knowing, (Oh great Nymph) that I was jealous, ought <U+017F>he not therefore to encrea<U+017F>e her affection, in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to ballance the weight which mine endured? but on the contrary, <U+017F>he rewards me with cruelty, <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe unties the knot of that amity, which <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices and demon<U+017F>trations of a perfect affection, ought to have made indi<U+017F><U+017F>olvable. And to give <U+017F>ome colourable pretence for all this, <U+017F>he alledgeth faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e and coldne<U+017F>s on my <U+017F>ide, and negligence and carele<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e, which, alas, was only in her own opinion. She alledgeth, that at that time, I ab<U+017F>ented my <U+017F>elfe from her. Indeed, when I con<U+017F>ider this allegation, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all actions may be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, when the effects produce contrary <U+017F>emblances, or are not known unto tho<U+017F>e, that have intere<U+017F>t in them. If I <U+017F>hould ask you, fair <hi>Doris,</hi> what opinion you had of me, when my fortune had brought me into your acquaintance, I am confident you will <U+017F>ay, that I loved <U+017F>erved, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and adored you, with as much faithfull zeal of true affection, as ever any <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard could. And let it not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, if before this great Nymph and reverent Druide, I be<U+017F>eech and conjure you to tell them, who that <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e is, that ever I adre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe unto, except you; or you ever heard of? If you do not know, nor ever heard of any, but mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, my affection was never placed any where el<U+017F>e, why do you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me? and why <U+017F>hould you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, and put a mi<U+017F>interpretation upon my actions? Me-thinks it is but very ill Logick, to conclude, that <hi>Palemon</hi> did love me; but becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>ees me not <U+017F>o oft as he was wont, therefore he does not love me. Were it not a better piece of <U+017F>ophi<U+017F>try in the Schooles of Love, to argue thus? <hi>Palemon</hi> does not <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o oft as he was accu<U+017F>tomed, but I know there is <U+017F>ome urgent occa<U+017F>ions which keeps him away. Had you been thus compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate upon the torments I endured, in being ab<U+017F>ent from you,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53526:177"/>
and judged others by your <U+017F>elfe, you had never <U+017F>o cruelly offended him, who did never offend again<U+017F>t the affection which he promi<U+017F>ed. But perhaps you will ask me, what I did mean by <U+017F>o many minute vi<U+017F>its, whereas formerly whole daies would not content me? I <U+017F>hall tell you, Oh <U+017F>age Nymph; and when you have heard me, you will not make <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter con<U+017F>truction of my actions, as this fair one doth of my fidelity; only I be<U+017F>eech you to con<U+017F>ider, the kinde of life which I led at that time, and among<U+017F>t what company I lived. I can, and truly, <U+017F>ay, Oh great Nymph, that never man lived a more <U+017F>alvage life then I; no, not <U+017F>uch, who<U+017F>e profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion is to inhabit among<U+017F>t Rocks and De<U+017F>arts, excepting only, when my affection con<U+017F>trained me once a day to <U+017F>ee her; for, as <U+017F>oon as day began to dawn, I went out of my Cabin, and <U+017F>hunning all manner of company, I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn untill dark night, retiring my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>ometimes into the mo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e and unfrequented Caves, and other times upon the tops of the highe<U+017F>t Mountains, <U+017F>o <U+017F>olitarily alone, as nothing but my own thoughts could finde me out; but they <U+017F>till kept me <U+017F>o good company, as they did often invite me unto <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch place, from whence I might <U+017F>ee her habitation, thinking the very <U+017F>ight of the happy walls where <U+017F>he dwelt, to be no <U+017F>mall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olation unto me. Nothing could withdraw me from this kinde of <U+017F>olitary life; no, not the friend<U+017F>hip of Neighbours, nor duty to Parents, nor care of my Flocks, nor any thing in the world el<U+017F>e, but only my de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing her every day once, and that in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>hort vi<U+017F>its, as, to my <U+017F>orrow alwaies when I returned, I thought I did but only go thither, and not <U+017F>ee her. Now my extream affection unto her was the cau<U+017F>e, why I did not acquaint her with my rea<U+017F>on for this kinde of life.</p>
                           <p>Now, great and wi<U+017F>e Nymph, it was ever my opinion, that he who loves as he ought to do, ought to be more tender of her honour whom he loves, then of his own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The malice of ill di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed men is never <U+017F>o weak nor drou<U+017F>ie, but it may alwaies finde out <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubject to a<U+017F>per<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that are mo<U+017F>t vertuous: And at this time, our frequent vi<U+017F>its were eyed, and gave occa<U+017F>ion unto tho<U+017F>e malignant <U+017F>pirits, to <U+017F>pit their venome, and talk very broadly; and yet, <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely, that all the diligence I could u<U+017F>e could never bring me to know, who were the authors of the<U+017F>e poy<U+017F>onous Impo<U+017F>tures. What <U+017F>hould I do in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e? To undertake a long voyage, I could not, becau<U+017F>e I was not a free Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter of my own actions; and to cea<U+017F>e to love her, had been to cea<U+017F>e to live. Since our great familiarity was it, which gave a colour for their calumny, what could I better do, then <U+017F>top the black mouthes of <U+017F>candall, by abridging my <U+017F>elfe of my own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in not being <U+017F>o frequently with her? For, I thought my <U+017F>elfe obliged to pre<U+017F>erve her honour and reputation, at any rate what<U+017F>oever. If <U+017F>he complain, that I did not acquaint her with this untill now, <U+017F>he may as well complain again<U+017F>t my extream love of her; for, the rea<U+017F>on why I did not impart it unto her, was, becau<U+017F>e I was loath to make her a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in my <U+017F>orrowes; for I know, that <U+017F>he, who was ever <U+017F>o carefull to keep her honour free from all calumny, could not endure to hear of the<U+017F>e, without extream vexation, and <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entment.</p>
                           <p>Now, great Nymph, I be<U+017F>eech you to con<U+017F>ider, by this mo<U+017F>t true relation, whether <U+017F>uch effects are u<U+017F>uall among<U+017F>t vulgar affections, and from thence you may perceive the quality of mine; and being <U+017F>uch, as gives a manife<U+017F>t proof of its grandure, why may I not, and with rea<U+017F>on, aske as well <U+017F>ome proofes of hers, <U+017F>ince love is never requited but with love again. As for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon,</hi> which <U+017F>he alledgeth as a great matter of complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t me, I conceive, my apprehen<U+017F>ions of him did not proceed from an ill grounded jealou<U+017F>ie, as <U+017F>he termes it, but from abundance of rea<U+017F>on; for this <U+017F>hepheard, as <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe confe<U+017F><U+017F>eth, being <U+017F>uch a one as he is, it was probable, <U+017F>he would rather love him then <U+017F>corn him. Moreover, the friend<U+017F>hip betwixt her Brother and him, was no <U+017F>mall ground for my <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions; but e<U+017F>pecially, the favourable eye which <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t upon him, which indeed was <U+017F>uch, as knowing of my jealou<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he was more to be blamed, for behaving her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o, then I, for thinking <U+017F>o: And indeed, their Marriage was openly <U+017F>poken of, <U+017F>o as from hence I had <U+017F>trong grounds for jealou<U+017F>ie; and <U+017F>he, to cleer her <U+017F>elfe, had good rea<U+017F>on to do as I reque<U+017F>ted. If friend<U+017F>hip have a priviledge above love, <U+017F>he might well have denyed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t; if it have not, why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he think it <U+017F>trange, my love <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire a preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above that amity, which <U+017F>he had unto her Brother?</p>
                           <p>From hence it was, great Nymph, that all our mi<U+017F>eries had their originall; for when I was angry with her, for the countenance which <U+017F>he gave unto this <U+017F>hepheard; <U+017F>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered me, that her Brothers affection unto him was the cau<U+017F>e of it. But when I replyed, that the report of her Marriage unto him was <U+017F>o common, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

to hear it: What would your fanta<U+017F>ticall <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, with an angry look) have me to do? You may call it what you plea<U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) but I <U+017F>hall never be at re<U+017F>t, untill I <U+017F>ee him bani<U+017F>hed from you. Well, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with a more angry eye) I will give you <U+017F>atisfaction this time; but I wi<U+017F>h this may be the la<U+017F>t of your odd humours. <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe in <U+017F>uch a manner, as made me more <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her, then if <U+017F>he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed me with <U+017F>ome hand<U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e. This made me re<U+017F>olve to look more narrowly into the matter, and tru<U+017F>t unto no eyes but my own. Oh mo<U+017F>t unhappy diffidence! Oh what an abominable re<U+017F>olution was this, which hath co<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much <U+017F>orrow, <U+017F>uch extream tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <U+017F>o many tears? In order therefore unto this de<U+017F>igne, I <U+017F>pied out a time, when <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon</hi> went unto her Chamber; for, as fortune was, either for di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, or for <U+017F>ome ill di<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he kept her bed that day: And going up a back pair of <U+017F>taires, which conducted to her Lodgings, I came through a Lobby into a little Clo<U+017F>et, which had a dore over again<U+017F>t her bed. Such was my misfortune, as I could, through the key-hole, <U+017F>ee all they did, but being at too far a di<U+017F>tance, I could not hear one word.</p>
                           <p>I <U+017F>aw, and too plainly for my contentment, this <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>it by her bed-<U+017F>ide; I <U+017F>aw him take her hand, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>e it <U+017F>everal times; I <U+017F>aw him talk bare-headed, and at la<U+017F>t, ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her lip, without any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and for ought I could ob<U+017F>erve, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered him with no words of anger. Oh heavens! what a dagger was this to my heart? I knew not what to do with my <U+017F>elfe; I knew not how I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer this and live. But, <U+017F>uch was my extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affection unto her, that though I had the<U+017F>e bitter re<U+017F>entments, yet it made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantly to endure any thing, which I thought plea<U+017F>ing unto her. <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon</hi> went away, and I al<U+017F>o; he, very ill <U+017F>atisfied with me; and I, ab<U+017F>olutely mad at him. Thus did Love drive us both away.</p>
                           <p>Now, I be<U+017F>eech you, great Nymph, tell me: Would you have thought I had loved her, had not this gone to my very <U+017F>oul? Could my re<U+017F>entment be le<U+017F><U+017F>e, then to retire my <U+017F>elfe? or, Could it be carried with more di<U+017F>cretion, then never to <U+017F>peak of it unto any? I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I did endeavour to regain my liberty; and when I found abundance of difficulty, in unloo<U+017F>ing the cords wherewith <U+017F>he held me, I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>everall times to my <U+017F>elfe, That I would cut tho<U+017F>e I could not untie. And when I was thus <U+017F>triving with my <U+017F>elfe, it is true, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent one of her friends unto me. But what could I think of her me<U+017F><U+017F>age more, then that it was a continuation of her delu<U+017F>ions? Could I po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly give the lye unto <U+017F>uch dear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es, as my own Eyes? So, being full of anger, I made that an<U+017F>wer which <U+017F>he thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of, which was, <hi>That one Nail drives out another.</hi> Now, <U+017F>ince I had a beliefe, that <U+017F>he had thus ungratefully betrayed me, how could I give her a milder check? I was obliged unto as much by the Lawes of my affection, which would not let me lie now, no more then before. If <U+017F>he took it in any other <U+017F>en<U+017F>e then I intended it, her innocence was the cau<U+017F>e of it, and my error made me <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o. She does not know of any other Love, that ever driv my love of her out of my heart; and yet, my fears of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing her, hath even untill this time, deprived me of my greate<U+017F>t contentment. When I at any time re<U+017F>olved to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid her for all this, Love, which had ever a great prevalence in my <U+017F>oul, re<U+017F>trained me, and gave me a check, telling me, that this would too much offend her, whom I once lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <U+017F>o well; that it was not hand<U+017F>ome to twit her with her faults, and make her a<U+017F>hamed of them; but that I <U+017F>hould be well contented, with being loo<U+017F>e from tho<U+017F>e perfidious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, in which I had been <U+017F>o long entangled. Oh! this advice was mo<U+017F>t pernicious unto me; for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, had I at the fir<U+017F>t told her what I had <U+017F>een, <U+017F>he would have related unto me all that <U+017F>he had done; and <U+017F>o I <U+017F>hould have received as much <U+017F>atisfaction, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and contentment, as I have <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uffered torments and mi<U+017F>eries. But ab<U+017F>enting my <U+017F>elfe wholly from her, it was long before I knew, that <hi>Pante<U+017F>mon</hi> had left her: And the wor<U+017F>t was, I dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o much as enquire, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould hear <U+017F>omething, which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e my griefe. At la<U+017F>t, my love being <U+017F>tronger then my re<U+017F>olution or my anger, I did by degrees go neer her, and at the very fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, forgetting all the wrongs which, as I thought, I had received, I applyed my <U+017F>elfe more unto her then ever before. But how did I finde her? <U+017F>he had the <U+017F>ame eyes, the <U+017F>ame mouth, and the <U+017F>ame beauty; but <U+017F>he was not the <U+017F>ame <hi>Doris,</hi> who, when I left her, loved none but <hi>Palemon,</hi> e<U+017F>teemed none but <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed none but <hi>Palemon.</hi> At this <U+017F>ad return, I <U+017F>aw nothing but di<U+017F>dain, found nothing but hatred and re<U+017F>ented nothing but rigour and anger; <U+017F>o as untill very now, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to let her know, the cau<U+017F>e of my retirement, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would never let me tell her, but <U+017F>till interrupted my <U+017F>peech.</p>
                           <p>Now, Oh great Nymph, if the<U+017F>e things be not te<U+017F>timonies of a mo<U+017F>t faithfull and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent

love, I will not de<U+017F>ire her favour; though the favour which I ask, is not a pardon of any fault committed again<U+017F>t love, but only, for loving her too much, perhaps more then <U+017F>he would have me, or more then <U+017F>he believes. If Love would let me complain again<U+017F>t her, as in rea<U+017F>on I may, I <U+017F>hould tell her, that the hath done abundance of wrong, both unto Love, unto <hi>Doris,</hi> and unto <hi>Palemon:</hi> For, Love may complain, that <U+017F>he hath extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed that fire, which blazed with <U+017F>o pure a flame, that Vertue it <U+017F>elfe could not be offended with its heat; and in lieu of it, <U+017F>he has kindled flames of anger and <U+017F>pleen, <U+017F>o <U+017F>mothered with black <U+017F>moak, that in lieu of enlightning her <U+017F>oul, they fill it full of darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e and confu<U+017F>ion. But <hi>Doris</hi> has greater rea<U+017F>on of compliant, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>leight a ground <U+017F>hould make her perjured, and break <U+017F>o many reiterated Oathes, <U+017F>worn unto that unfortunate <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, never to change her minde. And what can <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer <hi>Palemon,</hi> if he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay unto her: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, unthankfull <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>o many years <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies of affection, <U+017F>o many a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of my fidelity, <U+017F>hould not make you have a better conceipt of me? 'Tis true, I was jealous; but was it not a fruit of Love? I be<U+017F>eech you, why not jealous, if amorous? Who <U+017F>hould I be jealous of, but of her I love? But, admit it be a fault, and ought to be puni<U+017F>hed; is it not the rigour of ju<U+017F>tice, to equall the puni<U+017F>hment to the crime? But admit, that it ought to equall it, and that an eye for an eye, and an arme for an arme, ought to expiate the <U+017F>in; yet, why <U+017F>hould you puni<U+017F>h me for being jealous of you? for then, the <U+017F>ame puni<U+017F>hment ought to be inflicted upon you, <U+017F>ince you were al<U+017F>o jealous of me. Is this an act glorious, and worthy of a Lover? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will <U+017F>ay unto me, You ca<U+017F>t me off, and quitted me, and has therefore rendred your <U+017F>elfe unworthy of any favour. Well, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I did ca<U+017F>t you off; you mu<U+017F>t therefore ca<U+017F>t me off al<U+017F>o; and perhaps you have done it already. Suppo<U+017F>e us to be both upon equall tearmes, I have ca<U+017F>t you off, and you have ca<U+017F>t me off. But now, when I return again, with abundance of repentance and <U+017F>orrow for what is pa<U+017F>t; are not you obliged by the Law of Like, to do the like? Here I am upon my knees before you, with as many bitter tears of repentance, as ever Lover had; and can your anger extend <U+017F>o far, as not to re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me into my former happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Forgivene<U+017F><U+017F>e is the greate<U+017F>t glory of the gods, and it has this operation, that it converts the greate<U+017F>t offenders into the greate<U+017F>t lovers.</p>

               <p>I Be<U+017F>eech you, great and pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Nymph, and you, venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante,</hi> to <U+017F>tay your judgment, untill you have heard me, that you may have the better conu<U+017F>ance of our differences, and be able to put a ju<U+017F>t conclu<U+017F>ion unto all our mi<U+017F>eries and inquietudes. I have loved this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, even from her very Cradle; I have never <U+017F>ince cea<U+017F>ed loving her, but <U+017F>till encrea<U+017F>ed in my de<U+017F>ires to do her <U+017F>ervice: I have endured all her di<U+017F>daines, and patiently <U+017F>uffered her, to place all her affection upon another, before my face. Length of time has not le<U+017F><U+017F>ened my love, nor diverted my de<U+017F>igne; her rigours could never afright me, and yet hitherto, I could never make her leave the lea<U+017F>t of her cruelties. She equally ballanced her <U+017F>elfe with favours unto <hi>Palemon,</hi> and disfavours unto me, and ever mo<U+017F>t cruelly <U+017F>corned both my love and patience. But all was one, all her affronts did but the better enure me, to endure the intolerable burthen of them; they were <U+017F>o far from diverting me from her <U+017F>ervice, that the more difficulties and mi<U+017F>eries I met with, the more did they confirme the violence of my love. Oh heavens! can any man, infected with this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, be wi<U+017F>e? Can he look for any cure, when his will cannot con<U+017F>ent unto it? All <U+017F>uch as give me any coun<U+017F>ell again<U+017F>t Love, are my declared enemies; and though all manner of hopes were bla<U+017F>ted, yet my affection was unalterable, it was never in the lea<U+017F>t degree <U+017F>tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or le<U+017F><U+017F>ened. No, great Nymph, I had rather die, then dimini<U+017F>h the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of that flame, which burned me. She has <U+017F>een me <U+017F>everall times <U+017F>wim in tears before her; <U+017F>he has <U+017F>een me fall at her feet, out of my wits. But neither my tears, nor danger of my life, could ever obtain any thing from her, but <U+017F>corn and mockery: A ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment whereof had been revenged upon <hi>Palemon,</hi> if my love could have con<U+017F>ented unto any thing, that might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e this cruell one. But this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of revenge was <U+017F>o unable to make me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>igne, as I am <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>he cannot taske me with the lea<U+017F>t blemi<U+017F>h in my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay of me, I may truly, without any o<U+017F>tentation,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53526:179"/>
give my <U+017F>elfe the name of, <hi>A Lover without a fault;</hi> for jealou<U+017F>ie could never finde any harbour in my <U+017F>oul, as it did in this too happy <U+017F>hepheard; nor did I ever think any ill, or finde any fault with any of her actions. Love can be my witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that even her very rigours were welcome to me, when I con<U+017F>idered, that they were plea<U+017F>ing unto this fair <hi>Doris.</hi> And though I am not <U+017F>o far out of Fortunes favour, but any other <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e would perhaps look upon me with a favourable eye; yet mo<U+017F>t certain I am, that I never profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed any fidelity to them, but abundance unto her. But Love, not to let <U+017F>o much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain go unpuni<U+017F>hed, and not to for<U+017F>ake a Love <U+017F>o pure as mine, hath <U+017F>uffered her to re<U+017F>ent the bitterne<U+017F><U+017F>e of di<U+017F>dain, by the divorce betwixt her and this <U+017F>hepheard. But before <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ever loved her, I did; yet, for all her bitter treatment, <U+017F>he never <U+017F>aw the lea<U+017F>t altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me. I was the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>erved her, I am the only one that has continued con<U+017F>tant, and <U+017F>hall be for ever in the <U+017F>ame minde. I do not <U+017F>et the<U+017F>e things before her eyes by way of reproach, but for truthes-<U+017F>ake only; yet <U+017F>uch truths, as <U+017F>hall not put her unto any <U+017F>ad remembrances, for <U+017F>o I mu<U+017F>t needs phra<U+017F>e my pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervices. And though her cruelty hath been <U+017F>uch unto me, yet mu<U+017F>t I in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort excu<U+017F>e her, <U+017F>ince being engaged unto <hi>Palemon,</hi> perhaps <U+017F>he had offended again<U+017F>t her fidelity, in doing otherwi<U+017F>e. But now, when, thanks be to the Fates, <U+017F>he hath quitted him, what rea<U+017F>on or colour can <U+017F>he have for her cruelty, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he tells you, that <U+017F>he loved <hi>Palemon,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought it rea<U+017F>onable, to love him who loved her. Upon her own ground, rea<U+017F>on, and judgment, I do appeal unto you, great Nymph, <U+017F>wearing unto you by her fair <U+017F>elfe, for a greater oath cannot be, that never did any Beauty cau<U+017F>e a greater, more <U+017F>incere, or more faithfull love, then that of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> unto the fair <hi>Doris.</hi>

               <p>Thus <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> ended his Oration, with <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations of a perfect love, as all that heard him were partners in his re<U+017F>entments. And the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Doris,</hi> <U+017F>eeing he had <U+017F>aid all he could, after an humble reverence, an<U+017F>wered thus.</p>
               <p>Great Nymph, I am very <U+017F>orry for this <U+017F>hepheard's <U+017F>ake, that all he hath <U+017F>aid is true; for, <U+017F>ince he loves me <U+017F>o well, it grieves me, that he <U+017F>hould be ill treated; yet, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that the fault is not in me, but it is him<U+017F>elfe only, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ues his ill fortune. The fir<U+017F>t time he declared his minde unto me, we were both <U+017F>o young, that neither knew what Love was; <U+017F>o as what he <U+017F>aid unto me, moved me no more, then a per<U+017F>on who was nothing at all concerned. Afterwards, he travelled, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he found me not mine own, for I had given my <U+017F>elf unto <hi>Palemon:</hi> So that, as at the fir<U+017F>t time, he might complain of my ignorance in love; <U+017F>o at this <U+017F>econd, he might much more complain of my too much knowledge in it. But he has no rea<U+017F>on at all to complain again<U+017F>t me; for, <U+017F>hepheard, can you complain again<U+017F>t me, who was not capable of love, for not loving you? Lay the blame upon Nature; accu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Lawes unto which <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>ubmitted us all. Then, can you think it <U+017F>trange, I will not love you, when my will was not my owne? Alas, I have but one heart, and one <U+017F>oul, and one will. You may with more rea<U+017F>on complain, (and that me-thinks is the only plea you have) that you did addre<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe unto me too <U+017F>oon, and returned too late. You <U+017F>ay that I never looked upon you, but with <U+017F>corn, but was ever very aver<U+017F>e from <U+017F>hewing any favour unto you. Truly, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> if you rightly interpret my actions, you will finde, that you are more obliged unto me for that, then if I had done otherwi<U+017F>e For, had you received any <U+017F>atisfaction from me, unto what a <U+017F>trange extremity would your love have been driven, that was <U+017F>o great, maugre all my rigours? Con<U+017F>ider, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> that favours from me, would rather have been aggravations, then any con<U+017F>olations in your mi<U+017F>ery: Be<U+017F>ides, I could not have <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, without much offence unto that <U+017F>incere affection, which I had promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that it is ju<U+017F>t to love one that loves us; but I do not <U+017F>ay, it is inju<U+017F>tice, not to love all tho<U+017F>e, that have any affection unto us; for if it were, there would be no fidelity nor a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in love; if it were <U+017F>o, you your <U+017F>elfe were obliged, to render a reciprocall love unto the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Bebliena,</hi> who is ready to die for you. But I mean, that a woman being free from all other affection, may, without blame, love him that loves her, if there be no other rea<U+017F>on of hatred, but his love. Now this ca<U+017F>e is nothing re<U+017F>emblant unto that betwixt you and me; for I being engaged another way, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any new affection with you, without a ruine of that which I have contracted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Had I di<U+017F><U+017F>embled with you, or held you in hopes with any <U+017F>mooth language, you might with rea<U+017F>on complain again<U+017F>t me; but, if I did ever tell you my minde plainly and freely, are you not obliged unto me for it? Have I not a thou<U+017F>and times over entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, conjured, nay, commanded, as far as I had any power over you, that you <U+017F>hould
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53526:179"/>
extingui<U+017F>h your affection to me? And have you not alwaies an<U+017F>wered me, that you would, if you could do it and live? And when you did continue on was it not for your own <U+017F>ake, and not mine? But, great Nymph, <U+017F>ee how that which, as I gather from his word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, he thinks to be his advantage, does deceive him. Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he thinks, that my affection unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> was the only cau<U+017F>e, which kept me from giving entertainment unto his. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he no <U+017F>ooner heard of the di<U+017F><U+017F>entions betwixt that <U+017F>hepheard and me, but pre<U+017F>ently he was blowne up with hopes to effectuate his de<U+017F>ires; and, to lo<U+017F>e no occa<U+017F>ions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting them, he hath ever <U+017F>ince that time <U+017F>o importunately pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, that I may, and with rea<U+017F>on, call him, rather my enemy then my friend. But he is much deceived in the<U+017F>e thoughts, and does not con<U+017F>ider, that if ever this affection of mine do cea<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall with it <U+017F>o cea<U+017F>e from ever any other love, as I <U+017F>hall never re<U+017F>ent any effects of it again.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Doris. Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>Leonida</hi> commanded <U+017F>ilence; and taking <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante, A<U+017F>trea, Diana, Phillis, Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Laonice</hi> a<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he asked them their opinions and advice. But being long in con<U+017F>ultation, and the <U+017F>hepheards, who were not called to coun<U+017F>ell, being impatient, and could not be idle, <hi>Hylas</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Doris:</hi> I do admire <U+017F>aid he unto her, that you <U+017F>hould be angry for being too rich. How do you mean, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he? I mean, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not only the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hepheards, who love you; but al<U+017F>o, as an evidence of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all tho<U+017F>e that would offer them<U+017F>elves unto you: For, it is a womans honour to be loved and courted by many, be<U+017F>ides the benefit <U+017F>he may get by it. I do believe, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Doris,</hi> very carele<U+017F>ly) that this would be a good way for tho<U+017F>e, who would be e<U+017F>teemed fair, and are not; or, for <U+017F>uch as prefer that vanity, before tranquillity and <U+017F>olid content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it be a Good to be loved, replyed he, the more that love you, the more good you have. And if it be ill, replyed <hi>Doris,</hi> the more I am loved, the more ill it is. True, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but how can it be ill, to be loved by many? They will hate us in the end, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he. Yes, replyed he, if you do not content and entertain them. How <U+017F>hould one <U+017F>atisfie and content many replyed <hi>Doris,</hi> when it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>atisfie and content one? But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is it not good to have many Servants? They will in the end become our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and in loving me, they will more trouble then benefit me. You mu<U+017F>t have a care, <U+017F>aid he, to keep them your friends. The paines, replyed the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, is above the plea<U+017F>ure. The gods, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, do never think them<U+017F>elves troubled, that many <U+017F>hould bring offerings unto their Altars. Mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but it is a peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the gods, to do good unto many, without any trouble to them. Me-thinks, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <U+017F>ince love depends upon the will, and <U+017F>ince the will does extend it <U+017F>elfe to all it plea<U+017F>eth, there <U+017F>hould be no great pains in loving <U+017F>everall per<U+017F>ons. The Lovers of this age, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, are not contented with matter of will, but they would enjoy it in the effects; an I therefore I think it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the will <U+017F>hould be divided among<U+017F>t <U+017F>everall per<U+017F>ons at one time. Every one of them, replyed he, mu<U+017F>t but have a part. This, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I do think to be mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible: But, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it might, <U+017F>ince the love of one is <U+017F>o painfull, what would a great multitude be? Then it <U+017F>eemes, <U+017F>aid he, that you will love but one. One, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, is too many, and therefore I will love none at all. And you, <U+017F>hepheards, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi> unto <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes)</hi> what do you <U+017F>ay to this? We (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palemon)</hi> do make it appear, that we think one to be enough. How <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> mu<U+017F>t one love but one? Nay, fewer, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Palemon,</hi> <U+017F>ince we are two, and love but one. The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> had continued longer, if the Nymph had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all her company and <U+017F>topped him: She therefore, and every of them, taking their places again, <U+017F>he <U+017F>pake thus.</p>

                              <hi>The Judgment of the Nymph</hi> Leonida.</head>
                           <p>ALthough we do ob<U+017F>erve in this difference before us, <U+017F>everall accidents which <U+017F>eem contrary to one another, yet none of them are contrary unto Love; for, it is not more naturall for Fire to flame and burn, then for Love to produce <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><U+017F>entions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t Lovers; and tho<U+017F>e who go about to take them away, do attempt a thing, no le<U+017F><U+017F>e impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, then to take away heat from fire, or keep it from flaming. On the other <U+017F>ide, con<U+017F>idering, that he does not love, who does not wholly and entirely dedicate him<U+017F>elfe unto her he loves, we conceive it, to be a kinde of trea<U+017F>on, to let any other have a <U+017F>hare in his affection. And though we do expre<U+017F><U+017F>e our <U+017F>elves only in the Ma<U+017F>culine per<U+017F>on, yet it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53526:180"/>
doth hold as well in the Feminine. Therefore, all things being long and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly debated and con<U+017F>idered, we do conclude, that it would be unju<U+017F>t, that love <U+017F>hould be extingui<U+017F>hed by a thing, that is <U+017F>o naturall unto it <U+017F>elfe; or to divide it among<U+017F>t many, upon any con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration what<U+017F>oever. And we do declare, that the<U+017F>e fallings out, and little quarrells, are only renewings of love, and that to divide or change affection, is a crime of the highe<U+017F>t nature that can be committed again<U+017F>t Love. Upon this ground, we do ordain, that <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>hall love <hi>Palemon,</hi> and that <hi>Palemon</hi> being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of her affection, <U+017F>hall for the future give her <U+017F>ome better te<U+017F>timonies of his love, then by tho<U+017F>e of jealou<U+017F>ie; though we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that jealou<U+017F>ie be a <U+017F>igne of love, but it is a <U+017F>igne of love, as <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e is a <U+017F>igne of life; for, as one cannot be <U+017F>ick, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he live, <U+017F>o one cannot be jealous, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he love; but, as <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e is a <U+017F>igne of an ill tempered life, <U+017F>o jealou<U+017F>ie is an argument of an ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered love. <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>hall pardon, and receive <hi>Palemon</hi> into her favour again, and forget all former di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures, con<U+017F>idering, that Love is a mo<U+017F>t violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and makes one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many things, which are not allowed of by him that committed them, nor ever would be, had he not been infected with that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And to avoid tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures which <U+017F>he hath re<U+017F>ented for the time pa<U+017F>t, we do ordain, that as <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>hall treat <hi>Palemon</hi> as the per<U+017F>on whom of all the world <U+017F>he loves be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e <hi>Palemon</hi> <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf unto the will of <hi>Doris;</hi> for, if he will be free, it will at la<U+017F>t fall into tyranny. And as for the patient and unfortunate <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> we do ordain, that it <U+017F>hall be in his choice, whether he will continue an example of a faithfull and unfruitfull affection, by loving <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>till, without any hopes of being loved again; or whether he will, by breaking the cords of his fir<U+017F>t love, by violence, by anger, or by de<U+017F>pair, <U+017F>atisfie the affection of her, who loves him, and is ready to die for him.</p>

               <p>This was the judgment of the Nymph, which produced three very different effects in the<U+017F>e three per<U+017F>ons; in <hi>Palemon,</hi> an extream contentment; in <hi>Doris,</hi> <U+017F>o great an a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>peechle<U+017F><U+017F>e; but in <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>uddain <U+017F>tupification of <U+017F>pirits, that he fell down as dead. So as whil<U+017F>t <hi>Palemon,</hi> in an exta<U+017F>ie of joy, and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and confu<U+017F>ed expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, endeavoured to thank his Judge, for <U+017F>o favourable a judgment; <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>aid not a word, but fixed her eyes upon the ground, as not knowing whether <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be glad or <U+017F>ad: and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> lying all along without any <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, did move all that <U+017F>aw him unto <U+017F>o much griefe, that <hi>Doris</hi> her <U+017F>elfe did pitty him. All the Company flocked about him, and lent him all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. When he came unto him<U+017F>elfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Leonida,</hi> accompanyed with <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and all her Companions, left them all three together, but they continued <U+017F>o, not long; for pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>Palemon</hi> taking <hi>Doris</hi> under the arme, went towards Mount <hi>Verdun;</hi> and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> following them with his eye, and lo<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ight of them among<U+017F>t the Trees: Farewell (<U+017F>aid he) you happy and mo<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Lovers; go and enjoy, both your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and mine, whil<U+017F>t I, by this mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>t Ordinance, do all my life lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of that felicity which you enjoy. The<U+017F>e were the la<U+017F>t words he uttered out of a <U+017F>ound judgment, for a long time; for ever <U+017F>ince, his <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were <U+017F>o troubled, that he lo<U+017F>t his wits, and committed <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>urd follies, that even <U+017F>uch as could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at him, could not chu<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o but pitty him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas,</hi> finding no ju<U+017F>tice in this Judgment which the Nymph had given, did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his opinion again<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e, who conceived, that this difference could not be better determined. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leonida</hi> &amp; <hi>Paris</hi> were not ignorant of his humour, they were very de<U+017F>irous to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the time in talking with him; and in order thereunto, <hi>Paris</hi> began thus: Me-thinks, Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) that you have done poor <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> abundance of wrong, and might have well given a milder <U+017F>entence for him. Are not you of that opinion, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las?</hi> For my part, (an<U+017F>wered he) I believe, the heavens had a minde to puni<U+017F>h the fool <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes;</hi> for otherwi<U+017F>e it was not likely, they would have <U+017F>uffered him to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; but I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that his fond and fooli<U+017F>h pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, does not de<U+017F>erve a le<U+017F><U+017F>e puni<U+017F>hment. You, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and I, (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) are of very different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for his love unto <hi>Doris,</hi> continued with <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>tancy and re<U+017F>olution, me-thinks, is <U+017F>o far from de<U+017F>erving any puni<U+017F>hment that I do much commend him for it; and therefore I gave him leave to continue it <U+017F>till, if he would. A very fine leave indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas:</hi> Why? you might as well give him leave to live all his life in mi<U+017F>ery; for my part, I think you were very rigorous in it; and I am <U+017F>ure, that were it my ca<U+017F>e, I would revoke your judgment. What judgment would you have given, (<U+017F>aid the Nymph, and <U+017F>miled) if you had been in my room? I <U+017F>hould have contented them all three, an<U+017F>wered he. I

am <U+017F>ure (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and interrupted them) that this Ordinance proceeds from a <U+017F>olid and well di<U+017F>ge<U+017F>ted judgment. I am <U+017F>ure, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> that <U+017F>uch as are of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly temper, are not fit to be Judges of Love; but if you will <U+017F>olidly and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider the rea<U+017F>ons why one <U+017F>hould love, you will <U+017F>ay, that I am in the right, and that <hi>Doris, Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> might have been all three contented and <U+017F>atisfied. How could that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be, <U+017F>aid the Numph? By ordaining (replyed <hi>Hylas)</hi> that <hi>Doris</hi> <U+017F>hould love them both, and that both of them <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve her; for by this means, they would have had what they de<U+017F>ired, which was, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould love them, and <U+017F>he would have been better <U+017F>erved.</p>
               <p>There was none in the Company that could refrain from laughing, when they heard this judgment, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Leonida.</hi> Which <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>eeing: It <U+017F>eemes, great Nymph, <U+017F>aid he, that I have made you all very merry, and that you mock me. Nay rather, (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) it <U+017F>eemes, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you mock us. Excu<U+017F>e him, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> for he <U+017F>peaks as he thinks. If your thoughts (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> almo<U+017F>t angry) be different from mine, you think but very ill; and I would gladly know what arguments you have, to blame my judgment in this. <hi>Silvander</hi> an<U+017F>wered very carele<U+017F>ly; Common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e tells us, that what many have a <U+017F>hare in is entirely po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by none: If many have <U+017F>hares in the love of <hi>Doris, Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> and <hi>Palemon</hi> can have but their parts; and he that has but a part in love has nothing of it at all. But why (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Silvander)</hi> do you <U+017F>peak thus unto <hi>Hylas?</hi> do you not know, how he does not under<U+017F>tand that language? Truly (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> you do very well to put in your vie al<U+017F>o; for perhaps <hi>Silvander</hi> alone is not <hi>Babell</hi> enough, to confound all the World. Then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Leonida:</hi> Did you ever Madam, hear <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>urd opinion, (<U+017F>aid he) as this of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s, that if one have but a part of a thing, he hath nothing at all: Will any one think, that there is no water in a River, becau<U+017F>e the Sea is not in it? I would gladly know what this Common Sen<U+017F>e is, which teacheth <U+017F>uch fal<U+017F>e Doctrines. <hi>Silvander</hi> an<U+017F>wered: If Love could be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <U+017F>till remain Love, as Water may, and <U+017F>till be Water, I <U+017F>hould yield unto you. Water is of <U+017F>uch a nature that the lea<U+017F>t drop is Water, as well as the whole Sea; but Love, on the contrary, is no longer Love, if the lea<U+017F>t part be wanting; and to prove this to be a truth, Love does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t principally in an extream affection, and perpetuall fidelity; if you take either of the<U+017F>e parts from it, it is love no longer, &amp; I believe, there is none in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except <hi>Hylas,</hi> but will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it; for, if the extream be wanting in the affection, or if fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity be wanting, it is trea<U+017F>on, and not love; if fidelity be in it, and not perpetuall, it is not fidelity but perfidie: So as, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t conclude, that who <U+017F>o hath only one part of Love, hath nothing of it at all. If it be <U+017F>o, that Love is a thing individuall, it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to enjoyne <hi>Doris,</hi> to divide her love, partly to <hi>Palemon,</hi> and partly to <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes.</hi> Upon this <hi>Paris</hi> began to <U+017F>peak: Me-thinks, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, that we have rea<U+017F>on of our <U+017F>ide, but <hi>Silvander</hi> has by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e gotten the favourable opinion of all the Company; and let me tell you, that if you do not an<U+017F>wer him, I <U+017F>hall acknowledge what he <U+017F>aith. Generous <hi>Paris,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> what<U+017F>oever <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aies, or what<U+017F>oever you think, yet truth will never change; and for my part, I am <U+017F>ure, experience is more certain then all manner of words, for there is no arguing again<U+017F>t it. Now <hi>Silvander</hi> has nothing, but a few <U+017F>mooth hand<U+017F>ome words, to prove what he <U+017F>aith; but I have found what I <U+017F>ay, by <U+017F>o many effects, and familiar experience, that I will never <U+017F>eek any further then my <U+017F>elfe for any arguments: For, I have loved many at once, and <U+017F>ay what he will or can, I am <U+017F>ure I did truly love them; and therefore may not <hi>Doris</hi> do the <U+017F>ame? Many (replyed <hi>Silvander)</hi> do think, they do things, when they do them not: All Artificers, but more e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e that do addict them<U+017F>elves unto the Arts and Sciences, which are not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall, have a very great opinion of what they do, and very few, but think their own works much better and more perfect then any others, when as it is apparent, they do but deceive them<U+017F>elves, and very often, great imperfections are <U+017F>een in them by others: Selfe-love is ever blinde, but alwaies open to the eyes of others. <hi>Hylas</hi> thinks he loves, and that he loves well, though he be but a very bad workman; and therefore, who<U+017F>oever would love aright, and not erre, mu<U+017F>t never take him for a pattern. Who, then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> my <U+017F>elfe? If any, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander)</hi> believe it, <hi>Silvander</hi> is he? See (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> one of the greate<U+017F>t pieces of pre<U+017F>umption that ever <U+017F>elfe-love produced: Do you think, none but your <U+017F>elfe can love well? I <U+017F>ay, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander)</hi> that my affection is pure and perfect, that you cannot tax it with any fault; nay more, that you cannot name me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that excells me. So, <U+017F>o, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> was ever any <U+017F>o over-weened and arrogant as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53526:181"/>
this <U+017F>hepheard? Is he the only one that knowes how to love? Came he from heaven? Is he the great pattern unto men, and gives them the Lawes of Love, and can mea<U+017F>ure the grandure and perfection of our wills? Fair Nymph, if it would not be too tedious unto you, I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to <U+017F>hew him his error. Then cocking his Beaver with one arme a kembow, and the other accompanying by its ge<U+017F>ture the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his <U+017F>peech, he <U+017F>poke thus: I ob<U+017F>erve two things, <hi>Silvander,</hi> in your <U+017F>peech; the one, that your affection is pure, and perfect, and unalterable; the other, that I cannot name another more accompli<U+017F>hed. Can any thing be added unto that which is perfect? I am confident, you will <U+017F>ay, No; for, if it would admit of any addition, then it wants <U+017F>omething, and cannot be perfect. That thing unto which nothing can be added, mu<U+017F>t be arrived at its extremity, and therefore it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that what<U+017F>oever is perfect is extream. Now, if your affection be perfect, then nothing can be added unto it, nor can it be made greater then it is, nor more accompli<U+017F>hed. Now tell me pre<U+017F>ently, What is Love? Is it not a de<U+017F>ire of beauty, and of a good which you want? But your love is a de<U+017F>ire of a good which you want: Therefore it mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>omething may be added unto your Love, which it hath not. Moreover, you <U+017F>ay, that your affection cannot be taxed with any crime: If I <U+017F>hould ask you, whom it is you do love, you would an<U+017F>wer, that it is <hi>Diana.</hi> If I <U+017F>hould aske further, who this <hi>Diana</hi> is, you would reply, that <U+017F>he is the mo<U+017F>t perfect <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world. Then an<U+017F>wer I, If this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e be <U+017F>o perfect as you e<U+017F>teem her, are you not very bold, in daring to love one that is <U+017F>o full of perfection? For, there mu<U+017F>t alwaies be <U+017F>ome proportion, betwixt the Lover and the Loved; and I cannot believe, that all your pre<U+017F>umption can per<U+017F>wade her, that you are <U+017F>o perfect as you think your <U+017F>elfe. Perhaps you will charge me with the <U+017F>ame fault, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Phillis,</hi> who, you will <U+017F>ay, hath much more perfection then I. But I am of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beliefe unto you; for I do not hold her for <U+017F>uch a one, as you do your <hi>Diana:</hi> I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he is owner both of beauty and merit; and am I without? She has wit, <U+017F>o have I: She is wi<U+017F>e, I am no fool: She is a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I am a <U+017F>hepheard: She is <hi>Phillis,</hi> and I am <hi>Hylas.</hi> Is there not an eeven conformity and equality betwixt us? So as in an<U+017F>wer unto all you can aske, I propo<U+017F>e it as a more perfect love then yours; <U+017F>o as if one de<U+017F>ire to love aright, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and not <hi>Silvander,</hi> mu<U+017F>t be the pattern. For, to what purpo<U+017F>e is it to love, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e to have contentment? But what contentment or plea<U+017F>ure can the<U+017F>e drooping me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Lovers have, who are perpetually mu<U+017F>ing and fretting at their hearts, again<U+017F>t this Bug-bear and Chimaera of Con<U+017F>tancy. <hi>Diana,</hi> does <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>ay, does not love me; alas, <U+017F>he loves another, and <U+017F>cornes me; but for all that, I will love, and <U+017F>erve, and adore her, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be taxed with incon<U+017F>tancy. <hi>Phillis,</hi> does <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>ay, does not love me, <U+017F>he loves another, and <U+017F>cornes me; why <U+017F>hould not I change this ungratefull woman for another, that will love me, and <U+017F>corn <U+017F>ome other for my <U+017F>ake? Shall this Bug-bear, of being taxed with incon<U+017F>tancy, hinder me? Ah friends, I pray tell me, what kinde of Bea<U+017F>t is this Incon<U+017F>tancy? Who did it ever devour? What di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e did it ever breed? Did any ever die of it? How many have you <U+017F>een in mourning by rea<U+017F>on of it? No, no, it is a meer imagination, a fancy, a chimaera, or rather an invention of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubtle Lover, who <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elfe growne ugly, or ready to be changed for <U+017F>ome other, that was fairer then her <U+017F>elfe, did broach this opinion, and made it to be thought a mortall <U+017F>in, to be Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant. Will any man, in his witts, be thus deluded? Can he be <U+017F>o <U+017F>illy, as to con<U+017F>ume all his life without any comfort? Do you call this Love, for<U+017F>ooth, and Con<U+017F>tancy? May it not with much more rea<U+017F>on be called madne<U+017F><U+017F>e and folly? What! langui<U+017F>h in the lap of an old, ugly, and ungratefull Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e! Fie, fie, it is an errour far unworthy of a man, that pretends unto any wit or courage. Let not <hi>Silvander</hi> therefore ask any more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I can taxe his Love, or where I can finde one that is more perfect; for I am confident, there is not one in the Company who will not <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Hylas</hi> loves, and <hi>Hylas</hi> alone loves, as a man of wit and courage ought to do.</p>
               <p>Thus ended this incon<U+017F>tant <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>o moved with his own arguments, that he was as hot as any fire. Every one <U+017F>miled, and looked upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> in expectation of what he would <U+017F>ay; and he, to give them <U+017F>atisfaction, very <U+017F>leightly an<U+017F>wered thus.</p>
               <p>I thought, Madam, I <U+017F>hould have encountred with a Shepheard, in the pre<U+017F>ence of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es; but for ought I <U+017F>ee, I <U+017F>hall finde him an <hi>Athenian</hi> Oratour, <U+017F>o much is <hi>Hylas</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with his eloquence: Yet, I wi<U+017F>h, (<U+017F>o confident I am in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my cau<U+017F>e) that he, of us two, who <U+017F>hall be condemned, may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>everely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ti<U+017F>ed, for <U+017F>peaking <U+017F>o boldly before <U+017F>uch <U+017F>acred Altars, as he <U+017F>hall either give his Oration

the lie, or el<U+017F>e be plunged in the River <hi>Re<U+017F>ne.</hi> That is not rea<U+017F>onable, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had been adverti<U+017F>ed of it, before I began to <U+017F>peak, or might have <U+017F>uch Judges, as I did not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect of partiality. Why, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, do you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pectus? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you believe all that <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aith, to be an Oracle; and becau<U+017F>e he has been a while at the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian</hi> Schooles, you admire all he <U+017F>aies, and think him to be alwaies in the right. No, no, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> never refu<U+017F>e to abide the judgment of this great Nymph, and the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante;</hi> never fear, <U+017F>hepheard, I <U+017F>ee they are not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto rigour: and the wor<U+017F>t will be, but an acknowledgment of your errour. And therefore I will begin.</p>
               <p>You <U+017F>ay, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is no perfect love, without an acqui<U+017F>ition of <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ired good becau<U+017F>e Love is only a de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>ome good which it wants. But, Madam, I humbly be<U+017F>eech you, before I an<U+017F>wer this <U+017F>hepheard, to pardon me, if, for the di<U+017F>covery of his <U+017F>ubtleties, I u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome termes, which are not frequently u<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t us. Therefore, an<U+017F>wer me, <U+017F>hepheard: Does any de<U+017F>ire that, which they do po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e? You will <U+017F>ay, No; becau<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ire is only of <U+017F>omething wanting: But if Love, as you <U+017F>ay, is only a de<U+017F>ire, do you not <U+017F>ee, that to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e what one de<U+017F>ires, is to quench Love, <U+017F>ince none does de<U+017F>ire that which they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e? Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> doth not one love that which they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e? If they do not, I had rather you <U+017F>hould love; and that I <U+017F>hould not love, to the end, you may de<U+017F>ire, and I may po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e. I do not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)</hi> but I <U+017F>ay, that Love is not only a de<U+017F>ire to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e, as you would per<U+017F>wade; but on the contrary, po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyment does rather make it die then live. If enjoyment do not make it live, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> yet it is enjoyment which gives it perfection. No, neither, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> for enjoyment is not at all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to make a perfect Love. A Diamond is as perfect a Diamond before it be wrought, as after the Arti<U+017F>t hath poli<U+017F>hed it. For, if the perfection of Love did depend upon this Enjoyment, it would not be in the power of him that loves to love perfectly, <U+017F>ince the enjoyment does not depend upon him, but upon the con<U+017F>ent of another: And yet, Love, being an act of the Will, which is guided as the Under<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thinks good, and the Will being free in all that it does, this act of his Will cannot depend upon any other then him<U+017F>elfe.</p>
               <p>But admit, that Love be nothing but a de<U+017F>ire, mu<U+017F>t it be concluded from thence, that Love may be encrea<U+017F>ed, by the enjoyment of that which one de<U+017F>ires? If you con<U+017F>ider it well, you will <U+017F>ay, that Love is rather le<U+017F><U+017F>e by it; for, our <U+017F>oules do in this re<U+017F>emble a Bow, the more the <U+017F>tring is <U+017F>tretched, with more violence doth it <U+017F>hoot its Arrowes. So our <U+017F>oules do <U+017F>hoot out more violent de<U+017F>ires, when the thing de<U+017F>ired is hard to be accompli<U+017F>hed, than when it is ea<U+017F>ie and in our power. If de<U+017F>ires do le<U+017F><U+017F>en at things ea<U+017F>ily accompli<U+017F>hed, much more when it is glutted: And if Love be only a de<U+017F>ire, how can you think, that de<U+017F>ires will be augmented by enjoyment, which do dimini<U+017F>h and glut them? Therefore, <hi>Hylas,</hi> do not <U+017F>ay, that my Love being a de<U+017F>ire, cannot be perfect without enjoyment: And do not accu<U+017F>e of arrogance, becau<U+017F>e there ought to be an equall proportion betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me; unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will deny, that men may love the gods, for then I <U+017F>hall yield unto you: But if you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that to love the gods be the greate<U+017F>t commandment upon us; then I ask you, <U+017F>hepheard, whether there be a greater di<U+017F>proportion betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me, then betwixt <hi>Thautates</hi> and <hi>Hylas.</hi> And to convince you of your errour, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite, I explain this <U+017F>ecret my<U+017F>tery of Love unto you. We cannot love, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e we do know the thing which we do love. Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how fal<U+017F>e is that po<U+017F>ition? For, I do love above a hundred Ladies and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and yet I never knew one of them well; for, as <U+017F>oon as I found them to be peevi<U+017F>h and di<U+017F>dainfull, I left them, and was angry with my <U+017F>elfe, for thinking otherwi<U+017F>e of them then I found them. This rea<U+017F>on, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> ought to make you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e what I do <U+017F>ay: For, you did love that which you knew not; that is, having an opinion, that they were full of perfections, you judged them ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, you loved them; but finding out the truth, you left loving them; and by this you <U+017F>ee, that the knowledge of the per<U+017F>ons, was the originall and <U+017F>ource of your love; and truly, if the will from whence love begins, be never moved unto any thing, but what the judgment thinks good, there being no likelyhood, that the under<U+017F>tanding can judge upon a thing, of which it hath no knowledge; I do wonder how you can imagine, one <U+017F>hould love that which he doth not know. I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that as the eye may <U+017F>ometimes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <U+017F>o may the under<U+017F>tanding, and may judge that amiable which is not: But yet, Love mu<U+017F>t come from knowledge, be it true or fal<U+017F>e. Now this being <U+017F>o, have you not learned in the <hi>Ma<U+017F>silian</hi> Schooles, that under<U+017F>tanding, and the thing under<U+017F>tood, are but one and the <U+017F>ame thing? What! <U+017F>till harping upon the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tring, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> are you
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53526:182"/>
                  <hi>Diana, Silvander,</hi> as you were the other day? Truly, <hi>Diana,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, and turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her) you are a very pretty Boy: And you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, and turned towards him) you are a very hand<U+017F>ome Wench. Believe me, <U+017F>hepheard, you are excellent good company, and will ere long be as plea<U+017F>ant a Fool, as ever was in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> Every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh at this, <hi>Silvander</hi> him<U+017F>elfe could not hold, hearing how he interpreted what he had <U+017F>aid, and his way of <U+017F>peaking; and therefore he continued thus: You may very well, <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid he, make your <U+017F>elfe merry with me, <U+017F>ince I had no more wit then to prophane the<U+017F>e my<U+017F>teries, by communicating them unto you; nor <U+017F>hould I have done it, had we been alone, but I was con<U+017F>trained unto it, becau<U+017F>e I would not leave tho<U+017F>e that hear us, in an errour. But, though you will not allow what I <U+017F>ay for Orth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dox, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will hearken unto what your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>aid, concerning <hi>Phillis:</hi> I mean, that you did alledge the good opinion which you had of your own merits, and the merits of <hi>Phillis,</hi> as a good argument, and that you did not e<U+017F>teem he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s <U+017F>uch, but that yours might equall them. Now if you had this beliefe of your <U+017F>elfe, why will you not allow me to take the <U+017F>ame advantage of <U+017F>elfe conceit; for I do think, that the <U+017F>ame proportion that is betwixt the fire, and the wood which the fire burnes, is betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me. Now if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this to me good friend, why do you take more priviledge to your <U+017F>elfe? But I dare with a<U+017F><U+017F>urance affirme, that <hi>Hylas</hi> does not love <hi>Phillis;</hi> I <U+017F>hall maintain it to be ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible: For the chiefe Ordinance of Love, is, <hi>That a Lover do think all things mo<U+017F>t perfect in the per<U+017F>on Loved.</hi> And truly, it is a Law mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, and grounded upon great rea<U+017F>on; for, if a Lover ought to love his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e above all things in the whole Univer<U+017F>e, ought he not to e<U+017F>teem her above all things, <U+017F>ince his will directs him alwaies unto that, which his under<U+017F>tanding tells him is be<U+017F>t? But it does plainly appear, that it is <hi>Hylas</hi> you love, and not <hi>Phillis,</hi> by <U+017F>aying, that none loves, but for their own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the pains which Lovers do voluntarily take, only in doing <U+017F>ervice unto tho<U+017F>e they love, does plainly make the contrary appear. And have you not heard <U+017F>ay that we live more where we love, then where we breathe? I <U+017F>hall never believe that, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> this is nothing but talk, that comes from <U+017F>uch idle imaginations as yours. Had you <U+017F>aid (replyed <hi>Silvander)</hi> that the talk came from <U+017F>uch a wounded imagination as mine, you had <U+017F>aid right for the imagination of a Lover is <U+017F>o: We <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome ready to die upon the wound of one little word, upon the ca<U+017F>t of an eye; nay, <U+017F>ometimes upon very <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition: Sometimes you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee a Lover deny unto him<U+017F>elfe all manner of re<U+017F>t and contentment, only to enjoy the <U+017F>ight of the party loved, for one minute. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> did you know what a felicity it is, to be a fool in <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, you would confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all the wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world is not comparable to this plea<U+017F>ing folly: Were you able to comprehend it, you would never aske, what plea<U+017F>ure and contentment tho<U+017F>e faithfull Lovers, whom you phra<U+017F>e melancholly and pen<U+017F>ive, do receive; for you then would know, that they are <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed in contemplation of the party whom they love and adore, as, <U+017F>corning all that is in the whole Univer<U+017F>e, they do not repent of any thing more, than the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of that time which they <U+017F>pend any where el<U+017F>e; and their <U+017F>oules not being well able to contain the grandure of their contentment, they <U+017F>tand a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at <U+017F>o much trea<U+017F>ure, and <U+017F>o many felicities, which tran<U+017F>cends their knowledge. Know, that the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which Love doth recompen<U+017F>e unto faithfull Lovers, is the <U+017F>ame that he may give unto the gods: And the<U+017F>e Lovers, rai<U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves above the nature of men, do almo<U+017F>t make them<U+017F>elves gods; for all other plea<U+017F>ures which you do <U+017F>o highly pri<U+017F>e, are <U+017F>uch only, as a ba<U+017F>tard-Love does afford, unto <U+017F>uch Animals as are without rea<U+017F>on; and <U+017F>uch men as are only taken with them, they do degenerate from the nature of Men, and become almo<U+017F>t Animals, deprived of all rea<U+017F>on. Into <U+017F>uch a Mon<U+017F>ter, <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you degenerate, when you do love other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e then as you ought; <U+017F>uch a Mon<U+017F>tro<U+017F>itie, I <U+017F>ay does appear in you, <U+017F>ince there is no proportion in it, and, like Mon<U+017F>ters, it cannot produce its like; and, to be briefe, like a Mon<U+017F>ter it cannot live long. On the contrary, my love is every way <U+017F>o perfect, as nothing can be added or dimini<U+017F>hed, without an offence to rea<U+017F>on; for, both in grandure and quality, I can, without any vanity, <U+017F>ay, that it is arrived at perfection. In <U+017F>aying, that my affection could not be blamed or taxed, I had great rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o; for <U+017F>he, from whence it doth proceed, did never produce any thing, but what was mo<U+017F>t perfect. And I know, that the gods would cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e me, if I <U+017F>hould dare to offer unto a <U+017F>oul <U+017F>o perfect as hers, an affection that could any waies be blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> would have continued, when <hi>Hylas,</hi> not being able to be patient any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, interrupted him in this manner: <hi>Silvander,</hi> how long do you intend to abu<U+017F>e the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53526:182"/>
patience of tho<U+017F>e who hear you? How long will you fill their ears with your vanities and fond imaginations? And how long, do you think, I can endure the impertinences of your language. All the Company were <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed to hear <hi>Hylas</hi> come out with his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions in <U+017F>o loud a voice, as every one began to laugh <U+017F>o loud, that he was forced to be <U+017F>ilent. And becau<U+017F>e the day was almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pent, and <hi>Leonida</hi> was to return unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto him all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; as <hi>Hylas</hi> was beginning to <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: No, no, you have di<U+017F>puted long enough, <hi>Hylas,</hi> for one time; the reverend <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ante</hi> is not accu<U+017F>tomed to be <U+017F>o long from the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e: Let it <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <U+017F>hepheard, that we know, you have very good arguments again<U+017F>t <hi>Silvander,</hi> but we entreat you to refer them untill another time; in the mean time, we will go away in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that if you had had time to expre<U+017F>s your <U+017F>elf, you would have gotten the better of him, as yet he hath got the better of you. See, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> halfe angry) how there will be <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome imperfections or other in our natures. What do you <U+017F>ay, replyed the Nymph? I <U+017F>ay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that though you be a Nymph, yet you make it appear, you are but a woman, and has not patience to hear out the truth, but is plea<U+017F>ed with the tickling flatteries of this <U+017F>hepheard, who does but deceive you. You do not at all offend me, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> &amp; <U+017F>miled) in calling me a woman; for truly I am <U+017F>o, and would be <U+017F>o, and would not change <U+017F>exes with the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed man in the Country: But I know not why you <U+017F>hould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e me with the fault that <hi>Silvander</hi> hath committed, in alledging very good rea<U+017F>ons; and with the fault which <hi>Hylas</hi> hath committed, in an<U+017F>wering him <U+017F>o very ill.</p>
               <p>Que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Hylas</hi> had replyed, if he had heard the Nymph; but he being gone away in a cha<U+017F>e, he did not hear the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words. And <hi>Leonida</hi> <U+017F>eeing it was very late, <U+017F>he went with <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> and the Druides Daughters, unto the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and afterwards went to <hi>Adamas, Paris</hi> not following her; for his affection unto <hi>Diana</hi> was <U+017F>uch, as he enjoyed no felicity but in her pre<U+017F>ence. Thus the Nymph went unto her Uncles, and <hi>Paris</hi> taking the contrary way, went unto the fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>tayed with them a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> de<U+017F>ired very much to relate unto her Uncle, all that had been done for <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and by fortune <U+017F>he met him, walking upon a Tarra<U+017F><U+017F>e, which was <U+017F>hadowed with Sicamours, before the hou<U+017F>e. He wondred to <U+017F>ee her return <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, and <U+017F>he telling him the cau<U+017F>e, he could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, that every one <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o deceived. I think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that it will be a good inducement unto him, to leave this kinde of life which he lives; for, if he <U+017F>hould be acquainted, that his <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e loves him, and laments his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he would take a re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>ee her; but I do not conceive it <U+017F>o fit for me to tell him, as for you, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elfe, that the amity and re<U+017F>pect he bears unto you, will have better operation upon him, then all the Rhetorick I can u<U+017F>e, for your words have more weight and <U+017F>olidity in them, then mine have. I <U+017F>hall tell <hi>Celadon,</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Druide) but I know not what effects my <U+017F>peaking will produce; for I know he loves me, and bears much re<U+017F>pect unto me in all things, but concerning his affection: And I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I had long <U+017F>ince acquainted the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> where he was, knowing that <U+017F>he loved him, had I not feared it would have been a means, to make him go unto <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>alvage and retired place, where I could not finde him again; but my fears of lo<U+017F>ing him did re<U+017F>train me. It is now two daies <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>aw him, and therefore it will not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e, if tomorrow we give him a vi<U+017F>it, and do the be<U+017F>t we can to prevail with him.</p>
               <p>In this re<U+017F>olution therefore, they went to bed, and in the morning, day did no <U+017F>ooner appear, but <hi>Leonida</hi> got up, and <hi>Adamas</hi> al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>o that as <U+017F>oon as they were dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, they <U+017F>et forward. That morning, the <U+017F>hepheard was not gone out of his Cave, but was beyond mea<U+017F>ure pen<U+017F>ive at the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the preceeding day; yet very glad, and wel plea<U+017F>ed with his fortune, that had given him leave to <U+017F>ee the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> once more before he dyed: And con<U+017F>idering, that he had never received <U+017F>uch a favour from her, as at that encounter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when he was a young Child, when he <U+017F>aw her in the Temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> he cryed out: Oh mo<U+017F>t happy misfortune, that hath been more favourable unto me, then my be<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune! Oh the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of Love, which in his greate<U+017F>t torments gives the greate<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments! Who would ever retire him<U+017F>elfe from thy obedience, <U+017F>ince thou ha<U+017F>te <U+017F>o great a care of all that are thine? Whil<U+017F>t this <U+017F>hepheard was thus entertaining him<U+017F>elfe, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> came to him. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Celadon</hi>'s face did te<U+017F>tifie the contentment which he received, the Druide and the Nymph, after common <U+017F>alutations, told him, that they much rejoyced to <U+017F>ee him look better then he did, and hoped, that he had received <U+017F>ome
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53526:183"/>
kinde of comfortable courage. The comforts which you do finde in my countenance, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon,</hi> are like unto Suns in Winter, which ri<U+017F>e late and <U+017F>et early, and which indeed do give <U+017F>ome light; but it is through <U+017F>o many muddy clouds, that neither the light nor the heat do much warm. Then he related to them his encounter with <hi>Silvander;</hi> how he had put a Letter into his hand; how he <U+017F>aw <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with all the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and had put a Letter into her brea<U+017F>t. But alas, Father, (<U+017F>aid he) this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e was too great for me, and I am afraid, that it was only to make me more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of my <U+017F>orrowes; and that heaven, to make me more <U+017F>ad in my mi<U+017F>erable condition, did only let me <U+017F>ee her, who<U+017F>e I ought to be, if there were any ju<U+017F>tice in Love.</p>
               <p>No, Childe, an<U+017F>wered the Druide, Love having care of you, and intending to make you more happy then you are, hath given you this <U+017F>mall contentment, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould be driven out of one extremity into another knowing very well, that <U+017F>uch <U+017F>udden changes are very dangerous. And in confirmation of what I <U+017F>ay, <hi>Leonida</hi> will tell you what <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>een, and what declarations of amity <U+017F>he has <U+017F>een the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> make. Then the Nymph acquainted him with the empty Tombe, that was erected for him, with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the tears, and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of every one, and particularly of <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and that you may give credit unto what I <U+017F>ay, (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) let us go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Tombe, for it is <U+017F>o neer this place, that perhaps you heard the voices of the Druides Daughters, and the Prie<U+017F>t. You tell me <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tories, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that I <U+017F>hould hardly believe them, had they come from the mouth of any other. I would not have you, replyed the Nymph, give more credit unto me, then to the verye<U+017F>t <U+017F>tranger in the world; but come, and believe your own eyes. Upon this, the Druide and <hi>Leonida</hi> got him out of his Cave, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into the Wood, where his empty Tombe was erected: Oh! how a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed he was, and how pre<U+017F>ently he began to read that In<U+017F>cription which <hi>Silvander</hi> had <U+017F>et upon it? and having read it three or foure times over: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he) that you told me truth. But having received <U+017F>o great a contentment, would it not be want of love, if I <U+017F>hould have any de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>ee her? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas)</hi> if you <U+017F>hould live a Reclu<U+017F>e, and never <U+017F>ee her, it would argue want of courage and love in you. Want of Love! (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard pre<U+017F>ently) Ah no: I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, it might argue want of courage, which upon this occa<U+017F>ion might fail me, becau<U+017F>e I have <U+017F>uch abundance of Love. I <U+017F>hould believe, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas)</hi> that you do not love <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> if knowing that <U+017F>he loves you, and you may <U+017F>ee her, you ab<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elfe from her pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
               <p>Love, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard commands me to obey her, and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me not to <U+017F>ee her, do you call it want of love, if I ob<U+017F>erve her commandment? When <U+017F>he laid that command upon you, (<U+017F>aid the Druide) <U+017F>he did hate you; but now <U+017F>he loves you, and grieves for you, not only as ab<U+017F>ent, but as dead<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Be it as it will, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> <U+017F>he Commanded me; and be it as it will, I will Obey her. Yet, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> as perfect an ob<U+017F>erver as you are of her commands, you have already di<U+017F>obeyed, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>een her, and were pre<U+017F>ent before her eyes. She did not forbid me (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> from <U+017F>eeing her, but only not to come in her <U+017F>ight; and how could <U+017F>he <U+017F>ee me, when <U+017F>he was a<U+017F>leep? Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid the Druide, I will finde out a way, that you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee her every day, if you plea<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ee you. I conceive that, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon)</hi> to be very difficult, for <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t either be a<U+017F>leep, or el<U+017F>e I mu<U+017F>t be clo<U+017F>e hid in <U+017F>ome place. No, replyed the Druide; for more then that, you may <U+017F>peak to her al<U+017F>o if you plea<U+017F>e. This cannot be, (replyed the <U+017F>hepheard) unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I be in a very dark place. You <U+017F>hall (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas)</hi> be in the open light, and <U+017F>ee her, if you have but courage, or if Love have the power to make you attempt it. Do not think, Father, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celadon)</hi> that there <U+017F>hall be either want of love or courage in me, provided I do not di<U+017F>obey her commands. Now <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid the Druide) how I do intend to contrive it. It is the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> to give me a Daughter, whom I deerly love above my own life: This Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the rigour of our Lawes, is educated among<U+017F>t the Druides Daughters, in the Mono<U+017F>teries of <hi>Carnutes;</hi> it will be above the expiration of eight long years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can have any hopes of her comming out. Perhaps you may remember, how I told you, how there is a great re<U+017F>emblance betwixt you and her, both in age and face. Now I do intend to give it out, that <U+017F>he has been <U+017F>ick, and upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion, the antient Druides will allow her to retire, untill <U+017F>uch time as <U+017F>he be able to officiate in the nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exerci<U+017F>es: A few daies after, you <U+017F>hall a<U+017F><U+017F>ume her habit, and I will receive you into my hou<U+017F>e, under the notion and name of my Daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> And it is very requi<U+017F>ite
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53526:183"/>
to give out that <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ick; for, your way of living the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t two Months, hath <U+017F>o altered your face, and taken away that fre<U+017F>h colour which was wont to be in your cheeks, as any that <U+017F>ees you would be deceived. And though the re<U+017F>emblance which is betwixt you be not <U+017F>o great, but that when you are both together, a great difference may be found, it is no matter; for it is <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince any in this Country <U+017F>aw her, that though the re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance were le<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet when they hear me call you Daughter, they will certainly take you for her. I <U+017F>ee nothing in all this, but one inconvenience, which is, that every year we all u<U+017F>e to a<U+017F><U+017F>emble our <U+017F>elves at <hi>Dreux,</hi> a place <U+017F>o neer the Carnutan-Mona<U+017F>tery, that the Druides and Prie<U+017F>ts may come to di<U+017F>cover, that my Daughter is not gone from thence: But this <U+017F>hall be no <U+017F>top; for it will be two months before the<U+017F>e Druides do a<U+017F><U+017F>emble, and they mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay there two months more, and god knowes, whether before that time you may not have changed your habit and life. Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> con<U+017F>ider, whether all this be not very fea<U+017F>able. Ah! Father, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> after he had a while thought upon it) do you think, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by this means will not <U+017F>ee me? Do you think, and<U+017F>wered the Druide, that <U+017F>he can <U+017F>ee you, when <U+017F>he does not know you: How can <U+017F>he know you, when you are in <U+017F>uch a habit? But, Father, (replyed <hi>Celadon)</hi> let me be habited as you will, I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>till <hi>Celadon</hi> in reality; <U+017F>o as I <U+017F>hall thereby di<U+017F>obey her. That you are <U+017F>till <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas</hi> but <U+017F>till you do not by this di<U+017F>obey her command: For, <U+017F>he has not forbidden you to be <hi>Celadon,</hi> but only, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ee this <hi>Celadon.</hi> Now when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees you, <U+017F>he does not <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon,</hi> but <hi>Alexis.</hi> And, for a conclu<U+017F>ion of all, if <U+017F>he do not know you, you do not offend her; and though <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know you, and be angry, and command you to die; yet, were not <U+017F>uch an end better, then to langui<U+017F>h to death in this manner? This, Father, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepheard, is a good rea<U+017F>on, and I will ground upon it; therefore, Father, I will put my <U+017F>elfe, my life, and my contentment, all into your hands; di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me therefore as you plea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Adamas</hi> work upon the ob<U+017F>tinacy of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and to the end he <U+017F>hould not change his minde, he returned that very houre to take order for what was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and e<U+017F>pecially to <U+017F>pread abroad a report, that his Daughter was <U+017F>ick, and was to return home. For it was the cu<U+017F>tome of Druides Daughters, when they were <U+017F>ick, to come out of their Mona<U+017F>teries; and if their Parents were negligent, the Ancients of the Mona<U+017F>tery would <U+017F>end unto them, for they held it as a great misfortune, if any dyed there. Therefore he gave out, that the Antients had <U+017F>ent unto him, that his Daughter was to come home, and that he expected her every day. <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> were very bu<U+017F>ie, in providing all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for <hi>Celadon,</hi> who, in the mean time, had lea<U+017F>ure to bid adieu unto <hi>Lignon,</hi> and to take his leave of his Woods, and of his Cell, but e<U+017F>pecially of the Temple of the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> And when he was tricked up in the habit of a Nymph, (for <U+017F>o the Druides Daughters of that Country were dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, when they returned from their Mona<U+017F>teries) and was ready to depart, they thought it expedient to <U+017F>tay till night, to the end, none might <U+017F>ee him come alone; and in the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> iu<U+017F>tructed him, what to an<U+017F>wer unto each, who enquired how the Druides Daughters lived, or of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Sacrifices, Schooles, or Sciences; but, <U+017F>aid he, the be<U+017F>t way is, to <U+017F>peak as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, e<U+017F>pecially before <U+017F>uch, as are knowing in the affairs of the world; as for others, it matters not, for they will believe any thing you tell them. Now the day being almo<U+017F>t done, they went from that place at the entrance, into which <hi>Celadon</hi> had engraved the<U+017F>e Lines with the point of his knife upon a Rock, with much paines and time, having begun them that very day, he re<U+017F>olved fir<U+017F>t to leave the place, for an eternall memory of his being there. The Lines were the<U+017F>e.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Within this hollow, dark, and rocky Cell.</l>
                  <l>Di<U+017F>dain and Love a long time both did dwell.</l>
                  <l>Before you enter, if their wounds you fear,</l>
                  <l>Turn back and flie, there's no abiding here.</l>
                  <l>For, as a Coal is hot, though it <U+017F>eem dead,</l>
                  <l>After the flame is quite extingui<U+017F>hed:</l>
                  <l>Even <U+017F>o, Di<U+017F>dain and Love, though ab<U+017F>ent be,</l>
                  <l>Yet relicks of their fire may leave for thee.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e was carried on by <hi>Adamas</hi> with <U+017F>o much prudence, that <hi>Paris</hi> him<U+017F>elfe could not di<U+017F>cover any thing, re<U+017F>olving to deceive him if he could, <U+017F>ooner then any other,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53526:184"/>
to the end, that he might the better deceive others: He therefore took this <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Alexis</hi> for his Si<U+017F>ter, whom afterwards we will no longer call <hi>Celadon.</hi> As good luck was, when <hi>Adamas</hi> came home, <hi>Paris</hi> was not there, and therefore he could not <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he came alone. As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he came there, <hi>Adamas</hi> got her to bed, giving out, that <U+017F>he was weary, by rea<U+017F>on of travell and her <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>aw her not untill the next morning; and <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer her to come out of her Chamber, who<U+017F>e windowes were <U+017F>o <U+017F>hut; that the little light hindred him from di<U+017F>covery, what they de<U+017F>ired to keep clo<U+017F>e, and they continued thus <U+017F>everall daies: Though this Artifice was <U+017F>uperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew <U+017F>o well how to carry her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>o that none could <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her; yet, this did give her better confidence, becau<U+017F>e in this condition, <U+017F>he received the vi<U+017F>its of neighbours, who went all away in a full beliefe of her being <hi>Alexis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some daies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, in this manner; at the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he began to walk up and down the hou<U+017F>e, and to go abroad, pretending, that the fre<U+017F>h aire would conduce to her health. the <U+017F>eituation of the place was very plea<U+017F>ing and delectable, having a view both of the Mountaines and Plaines, and the plea<U+017F>ant River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> from <hi>Boen</hi> as far as <hi>Feures.</hi> This was the rea<U+017F>on, why <hi>Pelion,</hi> the Father of <hi>Adamas,</hi> did chu<U+017F>e that place to build in. And <U+017F>ince that, <hi>Adamas</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed a very <U+017F>umptuous Tombe to be built, in memory of his Brother <hi>Belizar,</hi> and planted a plea<U+017F>ant Grove, which almo<U+017F>t joyned to the hou<U+017F>e, and extended it <U+017F>elfe towards the Mountaines. In this place, <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went often to walk, becau<U+017F>e of the plea<U+017F>ant walks and pro<U+017F>pect; and becau<U+017F>e they were to walk up a ri<U+017F>ing Hill in the Woods, <hi>Alexis</hi> would <U+017F>ometimes take <hi>Leonida</hi> under the arme, when they were not <U+017F>een. And one time among<U+017F>t others, when they were up betimes in the morning, and <hi>Alexis</hi> did offer her that <U+017F>ervice: This (<U+017F>aid the Nymph, and <U+017F>miled) is a piece of <U+017F>ervice, which you had rather do unto another, who perhaps wi<U+017F>hes you not <U+017F>o well as I do. Oh Nymph, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>ighed) I be<U+017F>eech you for gods-<U+017F>ake, not to renew the remembrance of my mi<U+017F>eries; do you think I can forget them, having <U+017F>uch a deep re<U+017F>entment of them as I have? Thus they di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed till they were in the Grove, which being higher then the Hou<U+017F>e, did better di<U+017F>cover all the plain, <U+017F>o as there was not a turn of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> from <hi>Boen,</hi> where it fell from the Mountains, unto <hi>Fcurs</hi> where it fell into <hi>Loire,</hi> which they did not ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cover. This pro<U+017F>pect had <U+017F>uch an operation upon the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Alexis,</hi> that <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay aloud: Oh my <U+017F>ad eyes! how can you live, and endure the <U+017F>ight of this happy River, where you have left all your contentment. <hi>Leonida</hi> de<U+017F>iring to interrupt her I believe, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, of all that ever loved, you are the only one, who does not delight to <U+017F>ee the place, where you have had <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure: The memory of pa<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>eries is plea<U+017F>ing to the thoughts, much more <U+017F>hould the memory of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e received. The <U+017F>ad <hi>Alexis</hi> an<U+017F>wered; That which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the memory of mi<U+017F>eries pa<U+017F>t, to be plea<U+017F>ing, is it, which makes the memory of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to be full of intolerable wormwood; for the con<U+017F>ideration of having pa<U+017F>t the mi<U+017F>eries, doth rejoyce; and the con<U+017F>ideration of having no more happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, doth make one <U+017F>ad. But my greate<U+017F>t grief is, that I do not know the occa<U+017F>ion of my mi<U+017F>ery; this con<U+017F>ideration, I <U+017F>wear unto you, <hi>Leonida,</hi> does wound me to my very <U+017F>oul: I have made a mo<U+017F>t exact examination of all my life, but I cannot finde one act which I can condemn. To think, that a light humour, or any de<U+017F>igne of changing her affection, were in her, is too great an offence, and would give the lie unto tho<U+017F>e convincing te<U+017F>timonies which I have to the contrary. To believe, that <U+017F>he treats me thus without any rea<U+017F>on, that would argue in me too little knowledge of her, of who<U+017F>e lea<U+017F>t actions I have had full experience. What then can be the cau<U+017F>e of my mi<U+017F>ery? Oh ye gods! I think, that the tongue not being able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the mi<U+017F>ery, nor the thoughts able to comprehend the grandure of it, you will not let the under<U+017F>tanding have a knowledge of it. Then continuing in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad thoughts: Do you <U+017F>ee, great Nymph, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, a little I<U+017F>le which <hi>Lignon</hi> makes, clo<U+017F>e by yonder Town, which is beyond the River, a little neerer Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> and a little di<U+017F>tant from <hi>Julicu?</hi> There it was we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over, by throwing great <U+017F>tones into the water, to <U+017F>tep upon, becau<U+017F>e at that time we <U+017F>ought out for the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret places, to avoid the <U+017F>ight of our Parents, e<U+017F>pecially my Father; who finding no remedy again<U+017F>t this affection, which he <U+017F>aw encrea<U+017F>e before his face, he intended to <U+017F>end me out of <hi>Gaul</hi> over the <hi>Alps,</hi> to <U+017F>ee the great Cities, thinking, that di<U+017F>tance and ab<U+017F>ence would have that operation upon me, which all his forbiddings and charges to the contrary could not effect: And becau<U+017F>e we were adverti<U+017F>ed of it, we <U+017F>ought out for the mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>cure and unfrequented places that we could finde, there to <U+017F>pend that <U+017F>hort time we had to be together, in free di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53526:184"/>
becau<U+017F>e of the conveniency of the place, we went into yonder Rock which you may <U+017F>ee is <U+017F>omething neerer us, which is hollow, and left <hi>Lycidas</hi> or <hi>Phillis</hi> as Centinells, to adverti<U+017F>e us when any pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers came by becau<U+017F>e being neere a high way, we might be heard. At one time above the re<U+017F>t, we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over by great <U+017F>tones into this little I<U+017F>le of <hi>Lignon:</hi> And though we had already taken leave of one another <U+017F>everall times, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed (for my Father concealed from me the day of my departure) yet <U+017F>till we were taking leaves and bidding adieus to the la<U+017F>t. When we were there, and could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no body, <U+017F>he <U+017F>at downe upon the ground under a Tree: I kneeling before her, tooke her hand; ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, wa<U+017F>hed it with my teares; and as <U+017F>oone as I could <U+017F>peake, I <U+017F>ayd thus unto her.</p>
               <p>Now my faire<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t be at a fatall di<U+017F>tance from you, and will not die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e you bid me live: but how <U+017F>hall I be able to do it <U+017F>ince the very thought of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance is <U+017F>o intolerable, that it is ready to take away my life, as oft as I thinke upon you: To this <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered nothing, but pulled me by the arme and made me <U+017F>it be<U+017F>ides her, purpo<U+017F>ely becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e teares which <U+017F>tood in her eyes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gu<U+017F>hed out. And becau<U+017F>e I expected <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething, I was a while mute: <U+017F>he in the meane time wiped her eyes, and me thought I heard <U+017F>ome impri<U+017F>oned <U+017F>ighes which <U+017F>he re<U+017F>trained and would not let have a vent, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould heare them.

Alas, my <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> will you not, will you not pitty a poore <U+017F>hepheard, who<U+017F>e cruell Father and fate will bani<U+017F>h him from you? She an<U+017F>wered me with a deepe <U+017F>igh: Can you have any memorie, Sonne, of my pa<U+017F>t life, and make any doubt, but that I <U+017F>hall mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ent any thing that <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you? Beleeve it <hi>Celadon,</hi> I will make it apparent that I do love you, and <U+017F>hall give cleerer te<U+017F>timonies of it. I rai<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe up, to <U+017F>ee what te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this would be that <U+017F>he would give me of her affection; but <U+017F>he turned her head the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and with her fair hand pu<U+017F>hed me into the place where I <U+017F>at before, to the end I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ee her teares, of which <U+017F>he was in point of honour, a<U+017F>hamed. Perhaps, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> it was her lofty <U+017F>pirit, which would not let any know, that Love could conquer her.</p>
               <p>What<U+017F>oever it was, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>he made it evident unto me, that <U+017F>he did love me. But why, my Faire<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto her) do you not command me to <U+017F>tay with you, if my ab<U+017F>ence be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto you? Can you think that the Command of a Father, or any thing upon earth can make me di<U+017F>obey what you ordaine? Sonne, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he then unto me; I had rather die, then divert you from your voyage; It would be too great an offence both again<U+017F>t your duty and my owne honour. Do not think I make any doubt of that ab<U+017F>olute power which I have over you: I judge of you by my <U+017F>elfe whom I am <U+017F>ure, neither the power of Father, authority of Mother, de<U+017F>ire of Kindred, or <U+017F>alutation of Friends, <U+017F>hall ever make me do any thing again<U+017F>t that affection which my heart has unto you. And to the end you may depart from me with <U+017F>ome contentment, carry this a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with you, I do vow and promi<U+017F>e in the pre<U+017F>ence of all the gods whom I call to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and by this <U+017F>oul which you love <U+017F>o well (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and layd her hand upon her Bre<U+017F>t) that neither heaven nor earth <U+017F>hall ever make me love any but <hi>Celadon,</hi> nor keep me from loving him eternally. Oh mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange Language?

Ah <hi>Olimbres,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, this reque<U+017F>t is incompatible with our friend<U+017F>hip: Can you think, my hand has any power to hurt <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi>'s friend?

In the mean time, I knowing that his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeded from lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood, I took a little mo<U+017F><U+017F>e, for want of a better remedy, and applying it to the wound, I tyed it up with my handkerchiefe, and had not done, when <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> returned, who <U+017F>prinkling the face of his friend with told water, and calling upon him with a loud voice by his name, he brought him to him<U+017F>elfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. When he opened his eyes: Alas friend, (<U+017F>aid he) why did you call me? Let my <U+017F>oule go contentedly out of the world, and let it attend you where<U+017F>oever you go: Have this beliefe, I be<U+017F>eech you, that <U+017F>he cannot clo<U+017F>e up her daies more happily, then by your hand, and in doing you <U+017F>ervice. <hi>Olimbres,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> if you do depart to follow me, I mu<U+017F>t go before you; and therefore never think, that my hand <U+017F>hall make any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for your <U+017F>oul, untill it hath with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>word <U+017F>ent mine out of this mi<U+017F>erable habitation. Upon this, he looked about for the <U+017F>word which I had taken away; Which I perceiving: Do not think, <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) to execute your cruell determination with this <U+017F>word; heaven hath <U+017F>ent me hither to tell you, that there is nothing in this world <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate, which it cannot remit unto its former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it plea<U+017F>eth; and hath al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ent me to hinder you, from making any attempts upon the life, either of your <U+017F>elfe or your friend, for your life is his, not yours: But if you do attempt any thing again<U+017F>t your life, I tell you from the great god, that in lieu of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> which you do <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire, he will lead your <U+017F>oul into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall ob<U+017F>curity, and quite take away your very memory.

It was very <U+017F>trange, to <U+017F>ee what effects this conceit did produce in this man; for, thinking that I was <U+017F>ent from heaven, and thinking, that the hot Water which I gave him, was

<U+017F>omething that was divine, he took <U+017F>uch heart and <U+017F>trength, that he followed me almo<U+017F>t as well, as if he had received no hurt; yet I fearing le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould faint again, I turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto him: Although the heavens are able to give <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trength to your friend as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, yet it would not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e, that you took him by the arme, and holped him to walk; for god is plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee men help one another, through the effects of his goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Upon this, <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> went to his friend, and de<U+017F>ired him to lean upon him; <U+017F>o as we came to the next Town, where by fortune we found a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and appointed him to keep his bed for a certain time.</p>
               <p>As for me, I retired my <U+017F>elfe into another Lodging, very glad that I had done this good office, although it was a hinderance unto my de<U+017F>igne; for the day was <U+017F>o far <U+017F>pent, that I had not time enough to go and <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e burning Mountains. <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> was very <U+017F>orry when he <U+017F>aw me depart, for he had a great de<U+017F>ire to accompany me; but the Lawes of friend<U+017F>hip would not let him leave his friend in that condition. I did plainly perceive his de<U+017F>ire, and to take him off it, I told him; That he mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>tay with his friend, and not to <U+017F>tand upon the circum<U+017F>tance of complement; for, as for me, the gods would reward me, for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I had brought them. If I would have <U+017F>uffered it, I think he would have throwne him<U+017F>elfe at my feet, by way of thanks; but I forbad him, and pre<U+017F>ently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired my <U+017F>elfe into another Lodging. But <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> following me, he ob<U+017F>erved the place where I entred, and hearing me ask for Lodging, he returned to his friend, to tell him, that though I was gone out of their Lodging, yet I was not gone out of the Town, therefore hoped I would <U+017F>ee them again: For, great Nymph, they had <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F><U+017F>ured confidence in me and my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as they a<U+017F><U+017F>ured them<U+017F>elves, that by my help, they <U+017F>hould ere long <U+017F>ee <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> But <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> finding his friend a<U+017F>leep, he pre<U+017F>ently returned to the place where I was; and <U+017F>eeing me at my repa<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tood a little amazed; but when the cloth was taken away, and we two alone together, I bad him <U+017F>hut the Chamber dore: Afterwards, though with much ado, I cau<U+017F>ed him to <U+017F>it down, and to put him out of his errour, I <U+017F>aid thus unto him: I perceive, noble Cavalier; that the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which you have received from me, has made you think me <U+017F>omething above a man; and I am not <U+017F>orry that you have this opinion, to the end I might divert you from your horrid intention. But now, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee you reduced unto former rea<U+017F>on again, I will no longer keep you in your errour. Know therefore, that I am a <hi>Celt,</hi> whom you do call a <hi>Gaul,</hi> born in a Country, the Inhabitants whereof are called <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians</hi> and <hi>Forre<U+017F>tians:</hi> Certain occa<U+017F>ions, which would be too long, and u<U+017F>ele<U+017F><U+017F>e to you, to relate, have brought me out of my native-Country, and invited me to remain here in <hi>Italy</hi> for a certain time. Yet, I do take it for a particular providence from heaven, that I was <U+017F>o happily conducted to the place where you were, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch good effects en<U+017F>ue upon it: I give heaven mo<U+017F>t humble and hearty thanks for it, and you are obliged to the like; for, you may be mo<U+017F>t certainly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that god would not have re<U+017F>cued you <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely from the very brink of death, if he had not re<U+017F>erved you for <U+017F>omething, either to his glory, or your own honour &amp; contentment. I <U+017F>aw, that <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> grew pale at the<U+017F>e words, and changed colour two or three times, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe mi<U+017F>taken in his hopes, that it had been <U+017F>ome divine a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he unto me, that I was deceived; for, <U+017F>eeing you in a habit different from ours, your face <U+017F>o fair, hearing your voice <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet, and your <U+017F>peech <U+017F>o grave; moreover, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming invi<U+017F>ibly upon us, and in <U+017F>uch a nick of time, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I took you for <U+017F>ome me<U+017F><U+017F>enger from the great god: But, <U+017F>ince I under<U+017F>tand from your own mouth, that you are but a man, mortall as we are, I do believe it; yet believe withall, that you were <U+017F>ent by that great god, only to pre<U+017F>erve the life of two mo<U+017F>t faithful friends. And though in my fir<U+017F>t opinion, I hoped for <U+017F>ome extraordinary a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from heaven; yet now, in this opinion wherein I am, I will not be quite out of hopes in you, <U+017F>ince it cannot be denyed, but that there was <U+017F>ome extraordinary and particular care of us and our lives, which comes from <U+017F>ome great god, or great angell, who has made you the In<U+017F>trument of it. Do not doubt, <U+017F>aid I unto him, but that you are re<U+017F>erved for <U+017F>ome better fortune, <U+017F>ince you are in <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a manner pre<U+017F>erved from eminent danger; for, the gods never do any thing, but for our good. And becau<U+017F>e I am a <U+017F>tranger to you, and altogether ignorant of that fortune, which you did <U+017F>o much condole, I <U+017F>hould be very glad to hear it from your own mouth, that I may know who it is whom the gods have <U+017F>ent me to pre<U+017F>erve. Then with a a deep <U+017F>igh, he an<U+017F>wered me thus: The heavens had rea<U+017F>on to puni<U+017F>h me, as the mo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull per<U+017F>on that ever breathed, if I <U+017F>hould deny the relation of my whole life unto
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53526:186"/>
him that hath pre<U+017F>erved it. I <U+017F>hall therefore mo<U+017F>t willingly <U+017F>atisfie your curio<U+017F>ity, upon a promi<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>ie; for being di<U+017F>covered, it may co<U+017F>t the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of that life, which you have pre<U+017F>erved. And upon a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>ie, he continued thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexis</hi> would have continued her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and related all that <hi>Vr<U+017F>aces</hi> told her, but the comming of <hi>Adamas</hi> gave a <U+017F>top unto her; for both <hi>Leonida</hi> and <U+017F>he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to ri<U+017F>e, and render that honour unto him which was due. The <U+017F>age Druide, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one in one hand, and the other in another, he began to walk in a Laund, which though <U+017F>haded from the Sun, yet had a mo<U+017F>t delicious pro<U+017F>pect towards the Wood of <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>oures:</hi> And whil<U+017F>t they were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing upon <U+017F>everall <U+017F>ubjects, one came to acquaint them that <hi>Silvia</hi> was arrived, and already entred into the hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Alexis</hi> was very <U+017F>hie, and would not be <U+017F>een, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be known; but con<U+017F>idering, how willing that Nymph was to help her out of the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>oures,</hi> <U+017F>he hoped <U+017F>he was not changed: Yet <hi>Adamas</hi> had no minde that <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her, fearing, le<U+017F>t the young years of that Nymph, and the favours which <U+017F>he lately received from <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>hould make her <U+017F>peak more then <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould; he would have kept the matter <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that if he could, he would have kept it from his very <U+017F>elfe. Therefore he commanded <hi>Leonida</hi> to go unto her Companion, but be <U+017F>ure, that if <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis,</hi> to tell her, that they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie together concerning their Offices, and that <U+017F>he being to return very <U+017F>hortly unto <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> and fini<U+017F>h out her terme, <U+017F>he would not be <U+017F>een, but as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could. So <hi>Leonida</hi> thus in<U+017F>tructed, went to <hi>Silvia,</hi> who when they met, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed and embraced each other, as if they had not met of <U+017F>even years before. After the<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t complements, <hi>Silvia</hi> told her Companion, that the Country had not a jot bla<U+017F>ted the fre<U+017F>h comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of her cheek. And <hi>Leonida,</hi> in requitall, told her, The Court Beauties were alwaies above the Country Complexions, as plainly appeared, by comparing theirs together. Afterwards, <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>aid thus unto her.</p>

He, thinking he had don well, without concealing any thing, an<U+017F>wered her, that he came from <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>hewed her <U+017F>ome Letters which he had.

And, refu<U+017F>ing the Letters, <U+017F>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to give them unto me, to <U+017F>end unto you. Afterwards <U+017F>he went into her Chamber, and commanded me to follow her. This was the rea<U+017F>on, that I could not <U+017F>ay any thing unto <hi>Fluriall,</hi> but only taking his Letters, I bad him <U+017F>tay there, till I had done talking with the Nymph. What do you think of your Companion, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me? is <U+017F>he not fully re<U+017F>olved to do me all the mi<U+017F>chiefe <U+017F>he can?

               <p>See, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto me, (continued <hi>Silvia)</hi> what I alwaies mo<U+017F>t feared: The imprudence of <hi>Leonida,</hi> or rather, her malice, is <U+017F>o great, that <U+017F>he has told <hi>Lindamor</hi> of my affection unto <hi>Celadon;</hi> and this report is the cau<U+017F>e, that he will come and kill him. I had rather die, then that <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>hould receive the lea<U+017F>t harm for my <U+017F>ake. Alas, how ea<U+017F>ily may hee do it, <U+017F>ince the poor <U+017F>hepheard never thinks upon it, nor has any Armes, but his <U+017F>heephook? Can there be a more pernicious malice then hers, in procuring his death, who never di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed her? I believe rather, it is rage; for <U+017F>he loves him, and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>leights her, <U+017F>he will be revenged. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, I cannot believe, that my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has committed this fault, though perhaps <U+017F>he may as great; for, upon reading of <hi>Lindamor</hi>'s Letter, I cannot think he <U+017F>peaks of <hi>Celadon,</hi> but <hi>Polemas;</hi> for why <U+017F>hould he phra<U+017F>e <hi>Celadon</hi> perfidious? And why not <hi>Celadon,</hi> (replyed <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently) as well as <hi>Polemas?</hi> Becau<U+017F>e, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, <U+017F>he has acquainted <hi>Lindamor</hi> with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, which <hi>Polemas</hi> practi<U+017F>ed with the fal<U+017F>e and counterfeit Druide. And why, <hi>Silvia,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) do you yet believe, that <hi>Leonida</hi> told you or <hi>Lindamor</hi> truly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Druide? Do you not know, that it was meerly a device of her own pernicious invention, to make me ca<U+017F>t off <hi>Celadon,</hi> that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe might <U+017F>olely enjoy him? Now let me tell you, if you do not know it already, that <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o extreamly in love with him, that <U+017F>he cannot endure I <U+017F>hould look upon him: And had <U+017F>he as much power over me, as I have over her, <U+017F>he would never have <U+017F>uffered me to come into the place where <U+017F>he was. Did you never ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Silvia,</hi> how <U+017F>he feeds upon him with her eyes, if I may <U+017F>o expre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe, and to look off him, is a death unto her? To <U+017F>ee me neer him, <U+017F>truck her to the heart, and <U+017F>welled every vein with jealou<U+017F>ie. I have many a time ob<U+017F>erved, the variety of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions that are in her; I have <U+017F>een her <U+017F>ometimes, no fire hotter, and immediately upon a <U+017F>udden, as pale as death; <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he would be all talk, and afterwards as mute as if <U+017F>he had not tongue. I have often <U+017F>een her <U+017F>o fix her eyes upon him, as if <U+017F>he would have look'd him through, and I have laughed at her in tho<U+017F>e exta<U+017F>ies and ravi<U+017F>hments. And <U+017F>he, de<U+017F>iring to engro<U+017F><U+017F>e him wholly to her <U+017F>elfe, and take me off, has invented this tale <U+017F>he hath told you, which is as fal<U+017F>e, as the gods are ju<U+017F>t and true. Upon this, <U+017F>he took another of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi>'s Letters, which was directed to her <U+017F>elfe, which you may read, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia):</hi> Which <hi>Leonida</hi> took, and found in it the<U+017F>e words.</p>

To be brief, Si<U+017F>ter, I <U+017F>weare by all thats Sacred that this is true: And though I do not care for returning unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> as long as <U+017F>he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in this humour, yet I <U+017F>hall be very glad you would take all occa<U+017F>ions and u<U+017F>e your be<U+017F>t endeavours to let her <U+017F>ee her errour. Not for any other end, but becau<U+017F>e I would vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my honour, and live within the compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of my owne quality without reproach. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> you need not u<U+017F>e <U+017F>o many othes to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of the <U+017F>ubtility of <hi>Polemas,</hi> For I did ever beleeve it, both from what you told me, and from my owne ob<U+017F>ervation of his actions. And you may beleeve, I will take all occa<U+017F>ions, u<U+017F>e my be<U+017F>t Arguments, and not leave one <U+017F>tone unturned to per<U+017F>wade the Nymph of the truth. But I mu<U+017F>t not flatter you in this; For I cannot hope either any words or per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions will work with her, untill her minde be better <U+017F>ettled, which perhaps will be too late, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e God <U+017F>end <U+017F>ome unlookt for meanes: For I <U+017F>ee that <hi>Polemas</hi> hath a bad de<U+017F>igne, which he would not hide, but for his feares that he hath of <hi>Clideman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whom he knowes to be armed, and <U+017F>o much in favour with King <hi>Childerick</hi> who is <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>or unto the great <hi>Meroveus</hi> and who has a very great particular love unto <hi>Clideman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially unto <hi>Guyemant,</hi> <U+017F>o as he cannot be without them. <hi>Polemas</hi> being <U+017F>ubtile and crafty, does feare that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould attempt any novelty in the State, the<U+017F>e <hi>Frankes</hi> would by force ruine all his de<U+017F>ignes. But to let Matters of State alone which <U+017F>hould be medled with by more able per<U+017F>ons then we are: Let me tell you, Si<U+017F>ter, that when <hi>Galathea</hi> read <hi>Lindamors</hi> Letter, <U+017F>he plainly found that <hi>Celadon</hi> was not in danger: therefore halfe of her anger was over. Did I not tell you Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) That <hi>Lindamor</hi> did meane <hi>Polemas?</hi> Tis very true, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) and I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I accu<U+017F>ed <hi>Leonida</hi> wrongfully: but it was my compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion unto that poore <U+017F>hepheard which moved me unto that language. Madam <U+017F>ayd I, I be<U+017F>eech you beleeve, that <hi>Leonide</hi> would willingly never do you that di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; but <U+017F>he knowing very well that you did not love <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>he had good rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire that <hi>Lindamor</hi> might obtaine the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your favour; becau<U+017F>e there is a neere relation of Kindered betwixt her and him. For be plea<U+017F>ed to know Madam, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> is of the illu<U+017F>trious blood of <hi>Lavieu,</hi> and <U+017F>he of <hi>Fieur,</hi> which have bin <U+017F>o long linked together by alliances that tho<U+017F>e two families <U+017F>eeme but one. On the contrary, there was ever emnity betwixt the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Surieu</hi> and that, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he may well be excu<U+017F>ed, if <U+017F>he did de<U+017F>ire and endeavour to defeat <hi>Polemas</hi> from the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e which he pretended unto. I do know (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea)</hi> that there hath beene great emnity betweene the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Lavieu</hi> and <hi>Surieu:</hi> and <U+017F>ince the combate betwixt <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> there hath been no amity betwixt them: And I mu<U+017F>t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Leonida</hi> has rea<U+017F>on for what <U+017F>he did, for it is Naturall to de<U+017F>ire that the Family from whence any do derive them<U+017F>elves, may flouri<U+017F>h and be advanced. And had I knowne it <U+017F>ooner, I <U+017F>hould not have taken her protection of <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>o ill, whether it was again<U+017F>t <hi>Polemas</hi> or again<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon:</hi> Al<U+017F>o when I con<U+017F>ider upon what you tell me, I am apt to beleve that it was <hi>Adamas</hi> who helped <hi>Celadon</hi> to e<U+017F>cape, to the end that <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> being as you <U+017F>ay his co<U+017F>en might arrive at his de<U+017F>ire, and I do think <hi>Leonida</hi> to be innocent in the matter. Therefore in that con<U+017F>ideration, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>end unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> any of our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages in the Pallace of <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>oures,</hi> I will pardon her: yet, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, we mu<U+017F>t make further u<U+017F>e of her in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which by her meanes may be effected. Here <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>topt; and leaving her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon that <U+017F>ubject, <U+017F>aid thus unto <hi>Leonide:</hi> You <U+017F>ee Si<U+017F>ter, that I do hide nothing from you, becau<U+017F>e our friend<U+017F>hip bids me be open unto you, but if you <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover me, I am utterly ruin'd: And therefore I be<U+017F>eech you be as <U+017F>ecret in it as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you can: I had rather I were eternally dumb, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> then I <U+017F>hould commit <U+017F>uch a fault. Know then (continued <hi>Silvia)</hi> that <hi>Galathea</hi> after <U+017F>he had well bethought her<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid thus unto me; you <U+017F>ee, <hi>Silvia,</hi> how extreamly I am troubled with the<U+017F>e two men, I meane <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Polemas;</hi> and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that who<U+017F>oever would rid me of them, would infinitly oblige me. For I am <U+017F>ure they will never let me be in any quietne<U+017F>s, nor <U+017F>uffer <hi>Celadon</hi> to be neere me: And therefore I would try if I could be <U+017F>hut of one by meanes of the other, which may be effected by the mediation of <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom I would have you coun<U+017F>ell, to acquaint <hi>Lindamour</hi> with all that <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> <U+017F>aid concerning him: but to take e<U+017F>peciall care that <U+017F>he do not thinke I have any thoughts of <hi>Celadon.</hi> And to the end <U+017F>he may thinke, if I have not quite forgotten that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53526:188"/>
<U+017F>hepherd you may tell her that the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Lindamor</hi> who is a man of <U+017F>o much Merit will make me forget him: by this meanes <hi>Lindamor</hi> will either de<U+017F>troy <hi>Polemas,</hi> or <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> him. So <U+017F>hall I be rid of one, at the lea<U+017F>t, and both if good fortune's favour be <U+017F>o much, as that one kill theother. I do not de<U+017F>ire this <U+017F>hould be by death, but rather be rid of them <U+017F>ome other way. But I am <U+017F>o extreamly pe<U+017F>tered with them, and do love <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>o well, that if there be none other remedy, I con<U+017F>ent unto it, <U+017F>o it be not by my hand, or knowne that it proceeds from me.</p>
               <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Si<U+017F>ter, that when I heard the<U+017F>e words, I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, and re<U+017F>olved to acquaint you, not to incite you unto what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires, but rather to divert you. I an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Nymph, that it was fir<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>ite to know of <hi>Flurial</hi> what time <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>aid he would come; which <U+017F>he thought to be expedient, and therefore commanded me to call him: which I did: but before he <U+017F>poke unto her, I charged him not to tell <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> the time of his comming nor the place where he would be: and that if <U+017F>he asked him, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, that he would come much latter then the time he told him. Though the fellow had no great matter of wit, yet he had <U+017F>ome apprehen<U+017F>ions which made him <U+017F>tagger at my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions; yet at la<U+017F>t he harkened unto them: then I brought him to her, and he lyed <U+017F>o confidently, that <U+017F>he beleeved him. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought it expedient that I <U+017F>hould come unto you, to get you to write unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t to let him know what <hi>Polemas</hi> had done again<U+017F>t him; I thought good to bring <hi>Flurial</hi> with me, that he might tell you more then perhaps he would me but he feares that you are angry with him for <U+017F>o <U+017F>imply giving your Letters unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he dare not come in your <U+017F>ight. Now me thinks that though he did very <U+017F>imply in it, yet he ought not to be <U+017F>o chid for it as to lo<U+017F>e him. True (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide)</hi> and perhaps he hath not done <U+017F>o much hurt as he thinkes, <U+017F>ince by his meanes <hi>Galathea</hi> hath read <hi>Lindamors</hi> Letter which I <U+017F>hould not have dared to pre<U+017F>ent unto her, lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have bani<U+017F>hed me as <U+017F>he hath already. A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure him therefore, that I am not at all angry with him but rather plea<U+017F>ed, <hi>Silvia</hi> upon this, went out and called for <hi>Flurial</hi> whom <U+017F>he told what <U+017F>he had done; and afterwards brought him unto <hi>Leonida</hi> who looked upon him very kindly, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him that <U+017F>he was nothing di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with him: Then asking him every particular of his voyage, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to an<U+017F>were thus.</p>
               <p>I was afraid, Madam, that I had committed a fault, and therefore be<U+017F>eeched <hi>Silvia</hi> to make my excu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ince, thankes be to Cod, it proves otherwi<U+017F>e, I am mo<U+017F>t heartily glad of it, and thinke it to be the greate<U+017F>t happine<U+017F><U+017F>e that could come unto me: For I have vowed my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o much unto the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Lindamor</hi> that though he may perhaps find me failing in my wit and di<U+017F>cretion, yet never in my fidelity and affection. Therefore as <U+017F>oon as I had your commands upon me to go unto him, I went with as much ha<U+017F>te as po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I could and came unto a City called <hi>Paris,</hi> where <hi>Meroveus</hi> then was, being returned from the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trian</hi> Country: This City is <U+017F>eated in an I<U+017F>le, <U+017F>o as the walls about it are wa<U+017F>hed with a River which runs round on all <U+017F>ides of it: And <U+017F>o as there is no comming to it but by bridges. As <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw me, I ob<U+017F>erved a great alteration in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but he being in bed then, and having many per<U+017F>ons about him, he could not <U+017F>peak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, nor aske me the occa<U+017F>ion of my voyage: But when he was alone, he called for me: and asking what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e brought me thither, I told him, that he would be be<U+017F>t informed by your Letter. Is there none (<U+017F>aith he pre<U+017F>ently) from my Lady? You will know all (an<U+017F>wered I) by that Letter. He changed colour when I <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o unto him: thinking that certainly there was <U+017F>ome great alteration or other in the wind, but when he had read your Letter I never <U+017F>aw a man <U+017F>o amaz'd I cannot tell what was in that paper, but it was like to have co<U+017F>t him his life. I do remember, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leomda,</hi> the very words: they were but <U+017F>hort, and therefore Si<U+017F>ter, I would have you heare them, that you may acquaint <hi>Galathea</hi> with them, if you think it requi<U+017F>ite.</p>

Then I enquired, what was the cau<U+017F>e of keeping his bed, and I under<U+017F>tood, that it was by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome wounds he had received in a skirmi<U+017F>h, wherein the <hi>Neu<U+017F>trians</hi> were defeated by the valour of <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e I was very inqui<U+017F>itive after newes, and de<U+017F>ired to know all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, the young man made this relation to me.</p>

The very <U+017F>ame, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Fluriall,</hi> and clapped his hands together) but I <U+017F>hall never remember their names, and therefore I <U+017F>hall fini<U+017F>h my relation, upon condition, that you will help me out. Now, this Lady (continued he) was the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Calice</hi> being taken by the <hi>Francks,</hi> and <hi>Lypandas</hi> (I cannot tell whether I name him right) was made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oner. As for <hi>Melander,</hi> who was in Pri<U+017F>on, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he was relea<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he would go unto <hi>Lydias,</hi> thinking that <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who was in the hands of his enemies, had been <hi>Lydias,</hi> as every one reported him to be. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lydias</hi> heard of this Ladies depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he followed after her, not fearing any <U+017F>everity of enemies, nor rigour of ju<U+017F>tice. But <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who was in Pri<U+017F>on, knowing that he had kept a Woman Pri<U+017F>oner, and that he had fought with her, he fell <U+017F>o in love with her, that he never left <U+017F>oliciting, till he obtained his liberty, and then went as fa<U+017F>t as he could to the Town whither <U+017F>he was gone; I have quite forgot the name of it, for it was a very hard word. Was it not <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomages,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida?</hi> The very <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aid <hi>Flurial.</hi> Oh god, what fine <U+017F>tories could I tell you, if I had a good memory. But <U+017F>o it was, that the King's Son fell upon <U+017F>ome of the Enemies, and defeated them, after a long Combat, in which <hi>Lindamor</hi> was <U+017F>o woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he was forced to keep his bed. Truly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> you are an excellent <U+017F>tory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller, and therefore I pray proceed. My memory, <U+017F>aid he, is not <U+017F>o as I wi<U+017F>h it; but I had rather not tell many things, then lie.</p>
               <p>Now whil<U+017F>t this young man told me the<U+017F>e things, <hi>Lindamor</hi> <U+017F>ighed, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>poke; but I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hear what he <U+017F>aid, becau<U+017F>e the dore was <U+017F>hut: At the la<U+017F>t, I heard him call me, and not drawing the Curtains, he <U+017F>aid unto me: <hi>Fluriall,</hi> I would have thee return to morrow, and I would be before thee, if I could endure a Hor<U+017F>e-back, but I will pre<U+017F>ently follow thee; tell <hi>Leonida,</hi> that I will come to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and it <U+017F>hall be within this twenty nights at the lea<U+017F>t, if my wounds will give me leave. Upon this, he commanded me to take my re<U+017F>t. But I was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, when they told me that very <U+017F>ame night, that they thought him dead two or three times, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53526:189"/>
that his wounds were <U+017F>o much changed upon a <U+017F>udden, that he was in great danger of his life. I do believe, that the Letter which you writ, was the cau<U+017F>e: He continued long in this condition, <U+017F>o as I could not be di<U+017F>patched of a month after, within which time, he grew better, and not in <U+017F>o much danger. Be<U+017F>ides his wounds, he had <U+017F>uch a Feavour, as cau<U+017F>ed him very often to talk lightly, and ordinarily name <hi>Galathea, Leonida,</hi> and <hi>Polemas;</hi> Love, revenge death. At the la<U+017F>t he recovered, but not <U+017F>o well, as to go out of his bed; and the Phy<U+017F>icians told him, that he mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tir out of his Chamber, at the lea<U+017F>t of fifteen nights: And therefore he di<U+017F>patched me, <U+017F>aying, that before the <U+017F>ixteenth of the next Month, he would be here, and gave me the Letters which you have <U+017F>een; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to tell you many fine words, which did only <U+017F>ignifie thanks, and which, in good faith, Madam, I have quite forgotten.</p>
               <p>The Nymphs could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at <hi>Fluria</hi>'s di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and good memory: And becau<U+017F>e they would talk together, they commanded him to go out, and <U+017F>tay till <hi>Silvia</hi> returned, e<U+017F>pecially to have a great care he told none, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> would be back. Then being alone together, they re<U+017F>olved to tell <hi>Galathea</hi> plainly, the truth of that voyage, hoping, that perhaps the merits of <hi>Lindamor</hi> would make her more con<U+017F>iderate; but by all means to conceal from her the time of his comming, le<U+017F>t if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Polemas;</hi> not out of any good-will unto him, but only that he might <U+017F>tand upon his guard, and that <hi>Lindamor</hi> intending to kill him, they might be both in a po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of dying; or that <U+017F>o acquainting him with the de<U+017F>igne of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he might challenge him the field, and there die. This then being the de<U+017F>igne, <hi>Silvia</hi> thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to communicate the matter unto the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas;</hi> and to know his opinion: But <hi>Leonida</hi> told her, that <U+017F>he would acquaint him with it at lea<U+017F>ure; but now, he was very bu<U+017F>ie with his Daughter. And <U+017F>hall not I <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia?</hi> It will not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at this time, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida;</hi> for they are both exceedingly bu<U+017F>ie, becau<U+017F>e it is not much above a month, before the Druides a<U+017F><U+017F>emble at <hi>Dreux:</hi> And I do believe, that for this year, my Uncle will be exempted, becau<U+017F>e of his Daughter, whom he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to bring back, who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence he would enjoy as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he can: Yet, if you plea<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall acquaint them, for I know they will be extreamly glad to <U+017F>ee you. No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> I am very glad, that <hi>Adamas</hi> re<U+017F>olves to <U+017F>tay at home this year; for I believe, his pre<U+017F>ence will be more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto us then we imagine: I will not by any means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb them; it <U+017F>ufficeth me to know, that they are well. Then, after <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Silvia</hi> took her leave, and returned unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where <hi>Galathea</hi> was, in a longing expectation for her, de<U+017F>iring to know what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <hi>Leonida</hi> and <U+017F>he had; but, above all, to know what newes of <hi>Celadon,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her <U+017F>elfe, that <hi>Leonida</hi> could tell. But when <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood, that the <U+017F>hepheard was not in his Town, and that none knew where he was, <U+017F>he was not a little perplexed, but knew not how to accu<U+017F>e <hi>Leonida;</hi> for <U+017F>he imagined, that if this <U+017F>hepheard had e<U+017F>caped by her contrivance, <U+017F>he would never have <U+017F>uffered him to go out of the Country. After <U+017F>he had con<U+017F>idered with her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Leonida</hi> is not acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <hi>Celadon</hi>'s departure, becau<U+017F>e he went away out of the Country in that manner. Truly (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia)</hi> I believe, <U+017F>he never <U+017F>o much as thought of any <U+017F>uch thing, and I dare an<U+017F>wer for her, almo<U+017F>t as much as for my <U+017F>elfe. But, if <U+017F>he were not (replyed <hi>Galathea)</hi> why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he not come again, when you <U+017F>ent unto her from me? Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia)</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you, give me leave to tell you plainly, what an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>he gave unto me. I do not only give you leave, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, but I command you, to tell me. Be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> that after <U+017F>he had read my Letter, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered: That <U+017F>he knew very well what honour it was, to do you any <U+017F>ervice, e<U+017F>pecially to be about your per<U+017F>on, not being ignorant, that we are all obliged, both by nature and your merits, to devote both our <U+017F>ervices and lives unto you: But when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered the <U+017F>trange opinions you have entertained of her; and the bad treatment, tho<U+017F>e opinions have cau<U+017F>ed her to receive from you, <U+017F>he had rather lo<U+017F>e the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your pre<U+017F>ence, then to be in danger, of farther incurring your disfavour, and become the talk of all the Court: That a Maid has nothing more deer unto her, then her honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and your <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious of her, have cau<U+017F>ed many di<U+017F>advantagious reports to go of her: That <U+017F>he alwaies courts occa<U+017F>ions, to obtain the honour of your favour, by all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>ervices <U+017F>he is able to do; yet, mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eecheth you, not to take it ill, that <U+017F>he does not return again. At this time when I <U+017F>pake unto her, <U+017F>he gave me the <U+017F>ame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer; adding many vowes and prote<U+017F>tations, that what <U+017F>he had told you concerning <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes,</hi> was true; <U+017F>o as I mu<U+017F>t needs ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53526:189"/>
her. Do you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this can be? Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia,</hi> I <U+017F>ee no impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities in it; for it is mo<U+017F>t certain, <hi>Polemas</hi> does love you, and has <U+017F>ubtlety e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to invent this trick: Now I am the more apt to believe it, becau<U+017F>e the very <U+017F>ame day you found <hi>Celadon, Polemas</hi> was <U+017F>een alone in the <U+017F>ame place, walking there very long, manife<U+017F>ting thereby, that he had <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igne in it. How do you know this, <U+017F>aid the Nymph? I have learned it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi> from <U+017F>everall per<U+017F>ons, being very inqui<U+017F>itive to di<U+017F>cover the truth; <U+017F>o as enquiring where <hi>Polemas</hi> was that day, I under<U+017F>tood at the fir<U+017F>t, that he was not at <hi>Marcelles:</hi> Afterwards, <U+017F>earching more narrowly into the truth, I di<U+017F>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he went out of <hi>Fours,</hi> having only one man in his company, whom none did know, of whom he made very extraordinary much of. At la<U+017F>t, I under<U+017F>tood from many, that tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>earched for <hi>Celadon</hi> along the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> found him alone, walking in the <U+017F>ame place where you found the <U+017F>hepheard. Truly, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea)</hi> this tale does not a little trouble me; <U+017F>o as if it be true, I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, I have wronged <hi>Leonida,</hi> in treating her as I have; for, till now, I thought this to be a meer trick. Madam, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvia)</hi> I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that <hi>Polemas</hi> was long in that place at that time, as well as many daies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uing, without any company: Now, judge you, what could his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e be there. I mu<U+017F>t now confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <hi>Polemas</hi> is a knave; and could I di<U+017F>cover the truth, I would make him repent of his knavery. Mean time, I would have you get <hi>Leonida</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto me, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall have my love, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he will live with me and you, as <U+017F>he ought to do.</p>
               <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Leonida,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as her Companion was gone, returned to <hi>Adamas,</hi> relating part of the newes which <U+017F>he heard, and hand<U+017F>omely concealing what <U+017F>he thought he might take ill. Now, becau<U+017F>e it was dinner time, the Druide, <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>he, retired unto their Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Twelve or fifteen daies being pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince <hi>Alexis</hi> left her <U+017F>ad habitation and mo<U+017F>t of the Neighbours had payed all their civill vi<U+017F>its unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> a Servant came and told him, a certain number of <U+017F>hepheards came to <U+017F>peak with him, among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, one, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Lycidas.</hi> At the name of <hi>Lycidas, Alexis</hi> <U+017F>tarted: Which <hi>Adamas</hi> ob<U+017F>erving, le<U+017F>t <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>hould do the <U+017F>ame, he <U+017F>ent him to <U+017F>ee who they were. <hi>Paris</hi> undertook this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion with a very good heart, becau<U+017F>e he was in fear of his dear <hi>Diana</hi>'s welfare<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> In the interim, <hi>Adamas</hi> looked upon <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>aying: I am afraid Daughter, le<U+017F>t your hatred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Brother <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover, what we de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>o much to conceal. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <U+017F>he, but I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this unexpected newes; therefore, if you plea<U+017F>e, I will withdraw into the next Chamber, till the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards be gone. No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e they come hither to <U+017F>ee you: Be<U+017F>ides, it is not good to put <hi>Paris</hi> him<U+017F>elfe in any doubt. <hi>Alexis</hi> did not reply, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he heard the voice of <hi>Lycidas</hi> at the <U+017F>tairs foot. Pre<U+017F>ently after, all the Company came into the Hall, where the Druide received them with extraordinary demon<U+017F>trations of love. The mo<U+017F>t eminent among<U+017F>t them was <hi>Diamis, Diana</hi>'s Uncle; <hi>Phoceon,</hi> Uncle to <hi>A<U+017F>trea; Lycidas, Silvander, Coridus, Amidor:</hi> And though <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> were not of that Country; yet, having <U+017F>ojourned foure or five months in their Towne, they came with them for loves-<U+017F>ake, and good company. <hi>Phoceon,</hi> the mouth of all the re<U+017F>t, pre<U+017F>ented their good affections to the Druide, together with their cordiall de<U+017F>ires to do him <U+017F>ervice: Afterwards told him, that two occa<U+017F>ions had principally invited them thither: The one, to congratulate with him in his joyes, of <U+017F>eeing his Daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> The other, to acquaint him, that it had plea<U+017F>ed the great <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to <U+017F>end <U+017F>ome <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto</hi> into the Grove belonging to their Town; therefore they came to be<U+017F>eech him, he would be plea<U+017F>ed, according to their cu<U+017F>tome, to take <U+017F>o much paines, as to come and make a <U+017F>acrifice of thanks. Then the Prie<U+017F>t addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe: Sir, <U+017F>aid he, what I <U+017F>hall relate unto you, is very <U+017F>trange: As I was <U+017F>earching out <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto</hi> for the new year, I found things, that are no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then wonders, in the <U+017F>acred Grove of <hi>He<U+017F>ius, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis, Belinus,</hi> our great god <hi>Theutates.</hi> Fir<U+017F>t a Temple of Hazells and young Oakes, <U+017F>o twi<U+017F>ted and plaited to a great Oake in the mide<U+017F>t, as there is an arched Vault, <U+017F>o <U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to contain many people: In the mid<U+017F>t, is a bank of Gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, in form of an Altar, upon which <U+017F>tands a Picture, repre<U+017F>enting reciprocall Amity, together with the twelve Statutes of the Lawes of Love. Within this, we found another Temple, dedicated unto the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Oh Sir! I cannot chu<U+017F>e but admire the my<U+017F>tery. There are in this, two Altars, the chiefe of which is Triangular, under the mo<U+017F>t wonderfull Oake that ever was; for, having but one <U+017F>tock, it divides it <U+017F>elfe into three branches, then rejoynes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves into one bark again at the top, in <U+017F>uch an admirable manner, as that they make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53526:190"/>
but one Tree, and <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elfe above all the Trees in the Grove. There we found the falubrious <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto,</hi> <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h, and well growne, as by the report of all the Prie<U+017F>ts, none in all the Country is comparable unto it. There the <U+017F>acred name of the great <hi>Tautates</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, with the names of <hi>He<U+017F>ius, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> upon the three branches, which doth evidence unto us, that god loves the place, and would be there adored.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prie<U+017F>t related the<U+017F>e things unto the Druide, who knew them better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe, being the Inventor of them. It was a cu<U+017F>tome among<U+017F>t the <hi>Gaules,</hi> that a Month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <U+017F>ixteenth of <hi>July,</hi> they <U+017F>earched throughout all the Country for an Oake that had the fine<U+017F>t <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto;</hi> then to make a report of it unto the grand Druide, to the end it might be ceremoniou<U+017F>ly gathered: To that end, all the Prie<U+017F>ts a<U+017F><U+017F>embled, <U+017F>eeking for it in all the groves; then when they found it, they gave it a mark. Now thinking it to be a <U+017F>igne of gods love, that it <U+017F>hould be found in the Grove next their own Town, the People of it were wont to offer a particular <U+017F>acrifice of thanks, where the grand Druide u<U+017F>ed to officiate, if he was plea<U+017F>ed to favour them <U+017F>o much. Now, fora<U+017F>much as <hi>Adamas</hi> did very much love the<U+017F>e men, be<U+017F>ides his de<U+017F>igne upon <hi>Alexis,</hi> upon who<U+017F>e contentment, he thought, his own depended, according to the Oracle; therefore he promi<U+017F>ed to go with them, when<U+017F>oever the Prie<U+017F>t would adverti<U+017F>e him. The Shepheards returned their thanks in the be<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they could. Although (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) I have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>orry, that the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es of your Town are the only neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who have not favoured me with a vi<U+017F>it, in congratulation of my Daughters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; yet, I mu<U+017F>t needs let them know, that I do e<U+017F>teem them above any in the Country. <hi>Paris</hi> de<U+017F>iring to excu<U+017F>e his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e with the re<U+017F>t, did humbly make addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto him: Father (an<U+017F>wered he) I be<U+017F>eech you excu<U+017F>e them, for I have heard them re<U+017F>olve, to come and <U+017F>ee my Si<U+017F>ter; but <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> being <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick, as forced to keep her bed, hath a little deferred it, becau<U+017F>e they de<U+017F>ire to have her company. Since it is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> I am <U+017F>atisfied with the excu<U+017F>e; otherwi<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould take it a little unkindly. <hi>Phoceon</hi> then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe: It is mo<U+017F>t true <U+017F>aid he, that my Niece hath of late been very <U+017F>ickly; <U+017F>o as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her be<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>ick will be to marry. You may do very well (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas)</hi> to let it be your indulgent care, for <U+017F>he is now of a fit age for it.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Adamas</hi> was thus talking with the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards, <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained others. But as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Lycidas</hi> fixed his eye upon his Brother, it was long before he could draw it off; for, he thought he <U+017F>aw the very face of <hi>Celadon:</hi> then con<U+017F>idering it a little more preci<U+017F>ely, he admired, that two per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>emble one another <U+017F>o much; yet, the <U+017F>etled opinion of his death, the authority of the Druide, who <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he was his Daughter; the habit of a Nymph, together with a little alteration in the face of <hi>Alexis,</hi> did make <hi>Lycidas</hi> give the lie unto his own eyes. After a little longer looking upon her, he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay thus: Madam, If I did as much re<U+017F>emble him, whom you love mo<U+017F>t, as you do the per<U+017F>on whom I love and honour mo<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>hould hope ere long to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate my <U+017F>elfe into your favour. Kinde Shepheard, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis)</hi> I am glad I have any re<U+017F>emblance of the per<U+017F>on whom you love; for, knowing from my Father how he e<U+017F>teemes you, I <U+017F>hall take any occa<U+017F>ion to continue that amity you bear unto him. The obligations we do owe unto the Father, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas)</hi> together with the merits of the Daughter, commands us to do you all <U+017F>ervice; but me above all others, who does <U+017F>ee him live again in your face, who<U+017F>e life was deerer to me then my own. The<U+017F>e were the fir<U+017F>t complements which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between the two Brothers.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Leonida</hi> con<U+017F>trained her <U+017F>elfe as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, yet <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile, to <U+017F>ee how <hi>Lycidas</hi> was deceived; but fearing, le<U+017F>t <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hould not at the fir<U+017F>t, act a womans part very well, <U+017F>he interpo<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>eeming to be very zealous in enquiring, how all the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es her friends did: Therefore, good <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) leave off your fine complements, and tell me, how all my dear friends do. Some (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas)</hi> are merry, others <U+017F>ad, and <U+017F>ome neither merry nor <U+017F>ad, but do glide away time <U+017F>moothly, without extreams Who is it, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that is <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible either of mirth or <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ents neither?

I do believe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you do think as you <U+017F>peak; but every one is not of your opinion. Tho<U+017F>e that think otherwi<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) are like unto tho<U+017F>e Antients, who thought Water and Akehornes to be the fine<U+017F>t food, when they knew not what Wine and Wheat was; but now, we think that to be food only for Bea<U+017F>ts: So tho<U+017F>e who have tryed the <U+017F>weets and bitters of Love, will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all others are nothing in compari<U+017F>on.

In the meane time <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> went unto the window, there continued on their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: but <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>till eying <hi>Alexis,</hi> he fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid; I cannot chu<U+017F>e but looke upon the faire Daughter of <hi>Adamas;</hi> for <U+017F>he has <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>emblance of my poore Brother, both in her features and Aire, as I can finde no difference betweene them, but in habit. Is it long (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> <U+017F>ince he dyed? It is (an<U+017F>wered he) about four monthes <U+017F>ince. I have heard <U+017F>o many good reports of him (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that I am <U+017F>orry I never <U+017F>aw him. As for his Interiour parts, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribe him unto you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas).</hi> But as for his face and actions, looke upon <hi>Alexis</hi> who is the ju<U+017F>t picture of him: The very <U+017F>ame eyes, the <U+017F>ame mouth, the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ymmetrie of every part. <hi>Alexis</hi> all this while did <U+017F>uffer all that <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>aid, but it was with much adoe: Oh heavens?

Was there ever <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>emblance as this? <hi>Leonida</hi> fearing that his con<U+017F>ideration of her re<U+017F>emblance unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> might di<U+017F>cover that <U+017F>he was <hi>Celadon</hi> indeed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him. But <hi>Lycidas</hi> to returne unto our former di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; when <hi>Paris</hi> erected his Tombe I heard that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did infinitly love him, and could not chu<U+017F>e but breake out into many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of it: I would it had plea<U+017F>ed the gods (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Lycidas</hi> with a deep <U+017F>igh) that <U+017F>he had never loved him, for then my brother had bin now alive. Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> do you accu<U+017F>e her for his death? I have heard that <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o grieved his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe hath been in danger. The <U+017F>tory (<U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas</hi> very faintly) would be too long and tedious to relate now; but if <U+017F>he be unhappy in marrying <hi>Calydon,</hi> who loves her not, It is the ju<U+017F>t revenge of love upon her for the death of <hi>Celadon</hi> who adored her, of which <U+017F>he is too guilty: Is it long <U+017F>ince <hi>Celadon</hi> was lo<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida).</hi> It is about twelve or fifeene dayes <U+017F>ince, (an<U+017F>wered he).

He <U+017F>etting before his eyes his duty unto <hi>Thamire,</hi> the di<U+017F>daine of <hi>Celidea,</hi> and his oath to obey your doome, he rooted that domineering pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion out of his <U+017F>oul, and <U+017F>et his heart at re<U+017F>t.</p>

ever <U+017F>ince that doome was pronounced? For life is not to live, but to live well. Now ever <U+017F>ince that fatall moment, I have beene <U+017F>o far from living well, as I have not onely lo<U+017F>t my happyne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but all my hopes of it. If you call langui<U+017F>hing a life, I <U+017F>ay againe, let the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto</hi> be never Salubrious unto me. When no hopes are left, let life go whither it will, for nothing can do me good <U+017F>ince you are gone.

What advantage can you hope for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) in dying?

               <p>It was now late; <U+017F>o as the Ball being ended, <hi>Celidea</hi> according to Nuptiall cu<U+017F>tomes was conducted to bed, and afterwards <hi>Thamires</hi> unto her; <hi>Calidon</hi> he went both out of the chamber and the hou<U+017F>e; and by fortune did lye downe under <U+017F>ome great Elmes by the way <U+017F>ide neere unto the hou<U+017F>e. Where after he had a while con<U+017F>idered the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and then his owne <U+017F>ad fate, his heart <U+017F>o failed him, as he fell into a <U+017F>wound, and continued in it, till <hi>Cleontine</hi> and her company coming out of the hou<U+017F>e, found him lying all along as if he were a<U+017F>leep. But offering to wake him, and <U+017F>eeing he did not <U+017F>tirre, <hi>Cleontine</hi> her<U+017F>elfe tooke his hand; which finding to be very cold, becau<U+017F>e all the naturall heat of the outward parts was retired to the heart, <U+017F>he cryed out, Oh, <hi>Calidon</hi> is dead. Many that heard her voyce did run unto her: So as when they <U+017F>aw him in that condition, the cry was <U+017F>o loud as it cau<U+017F>ed all the neighborhood to re<U+017F>ort thither: many ran into the hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>till, crying out aloud <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead, <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead: In <U+017F>o much as <hi>Thamires</hi> heard the noi<U+017F>e; and hearing nothing named but <hi>Calidon</hi> and Death, he doubted <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>a<U+017F>trous accident: Therefore leaping out of bed, he run to the dore to call <U+017F>ome of the hou<U+017F>e, and at la<U+017F>t was told that <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead. <hi>Thamires</hi> loved him as dearely as if he had been his owne Sonne: So as at this <U+017F>ad newes he fell down the <U+017F>taires to the bottom: his <U+017F>ervants tooke him him up, and carryed him to his bed: his pul<U+017F>e failed and he by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees grew <U+017F>o cold, as if he had not been well looked unto he had been in as bad a condition as <hi>Calidon:</hi> but the application of good remedies together with <hi>Celidea's</hi> care, did do him much good. Who<U+017F>oever had <U+017F>een this faire and young Bride thus all undre<U+017F>t wa<U+017F>hing the face of her brid-groome with her teares, and had not been mooved unto pitty, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e his heart was made of Marble. The loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e of her garments together with the negligent care of her<U+017F>elfe, added much unto her beauty: She having recovered him unto his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es did bathe her ki<U+017F><U+017F>es in a flood of teares. But the poor <U+017F>hepheard being un<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but <U+017F>orrow of his friends lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, did faintly receive her ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, and pu<U+017F>hed her away with his hand, as if he did not care for them: he would hardly look upon her, onely <U+017F>till asked what newes of <hi>Calidon:</hi> but hearing none that was good, I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid he, that as he dyed for the contentment which I have, <U+017F>o I mu<U+017F>t dye for the griefe which he had. Then ri<U+017F>ing up in a fury, halfe naked, he run to the place where poore <hi>Calidon</hi> lay along as if he were ab<U+017F>olut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead. Every one gave place unto him, as well out of re<U+017F>pect, as compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at his greife which doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e was very great, <U+017F>ince he had left <hi>Celedea,</hi> and di<U+017F>dained that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which he had <U+017F>o long and <U+017F>o zealou<U+017F>ly de<U+017F>ired. When he <U+017F>aw <hi>Calidon,</hi> thinking him to be dead, he fell upon him but <U+017F>o unfortunately, as he hit his forehead again<U+017F>t a <U+017F>harp <U+017F>tone, on which they had laid the head of <hi>Calidon;</hi> his face was immediately all blood and there he remained in a <U+017F>wound. Tho<U+017F>e that were about them, did heare the blow which <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> had, and had an opinion, that he was hurt. But did not think he was hurt <U+017F>o much as he was. Had they not ob<U+017F>erved him <U+017F>o long without either motion or <U+017F>peech, they had taken notice of it too late. Now, cryes began againe a fre<U+017F>h, and the clamours of all tho<U+017F>e who beheld this lamentable <U+017F>pectacle, grew very loud. Judge what horror this was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53526:192"/>
unto <hi>Colidea,</hi> when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her Husband and his Nephew lie together like dead men. By fortune, as they carried <hi>Calidon</hi> in a chair into his Chamber, he revived. Then <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many people about him, and all <U+017F>meered with the blood of <hi>Thamires</hi> he knew not what to think, but that he was in a dream. When he <U+017F>aw them carrying his Uncle, who was yet <U+017F>en<U+017F>le<U+017F><U+017F>e, with a great wound in his head, he imagined, that <U+017F>ome body had wounded him; therefore tran<U+017F>ported with rage, he ro<U+017F>e up and asked, who was the murderer: He took up a <U+017F>tone, and held up his arme, as ready to throw it at him, who had done the the homicide: But, when he heard how it was; How, <U+017F>aid he, am I my <U+017F>elfe the murderer? Is not revenge as well due to me as to another; nay, more, <U+017F>ince there was more obligations upon me. Upon this, he lifted up his arme, intending to knock him<U+017F>elfe in the head with the <U+017F>tone; but he was prevented by friends, who held his arme, took away the <U+017F>tone, and never let him go, till he was better <U+017F>etled in his rea<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Thamires,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the loud clamours, and the good remedies which were applyed unto him, he was no <U+017F>ooner dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and put into bed, but he came out of his <U+017F>wound: When his eyes were open, and he could <U+017F>peak, the fir<U+017F>t word was, the name of <hi>Calidon,</hi> asking where his body was. <hi>Calidon</hi> (an<U+017F>wered one) is much better then you are. How, <U+017F>aid he, is not <hi>Calidon</hi> dead? Oh my friends, I pray do not mock me. He is alive, <U+017F>aid another; and if you will not fall into a <U+017F>wound again when you <U+017F>ee him, we will bring him hither very well recovered. Oh god! <U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires,</hi> if this be <U+017F>o, u<U+017F>e all your be<U+017F>t remedies to cure me al<U+017F>o. Upon this, he offered to ri<U+017F>e, but the Chirurgions would not <U+017F>uffer him. Now becau<U+017F>e <hi>Calidon</hi> was as impatient to <U+017F>ee <hi>Thamires,</hi> it was thought requi<U+017F>ite for the <U+017F>etlement of their <U+017F>pirits, to let them <U+017F>ee each other, though they feared, it would cau<U+017F>e the wound of <hi>Thamires</hi> to bleed afre<U+017F>h; but conceiving, this inconveniency would be le<U+017F><U+017F>e, then that which might ari<U+017F>e by re<U+017F>training them, they brought <hi>Calidon</hi> to the Chamber, who <U+017F>eeing <hi>Thamires</hi> in that condition, and having heard all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, he kneeled down before him, and asked him pardon, for the griefe and pain which he had put him unto: Excu<U+017F>e, good Father, <U+017F>aid he unto him, the little power that I had to command my <U+017F>elfe; I come to aske you pardon upon my knees, and be<U+017F>eech you to believe, that I will never re<U+017F>t, till I have given <U+017F>atisfaction for my fault. Son, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires)</hi> ri<U+017F>e up, and let me embrace thee Had I thought, that <hi>Celidea</hi> would have ever been thine, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never have been mine: My greate<U+017F>t griefe is now, that heretofore there was one impediment unto thy de<U+017F>ires, and now there is two: The fir<U+017F>t is, her will, which was ever <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e unto thee, that <U+017F>he would never con<U+017F>ent to be thine: The other is, the Marriage of her and me. Could her will change as well, as I could remedy the la<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e impediments, believe it, <hi>Calidon,</hi> my death <U+017F>hould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, <U+017F>o I could thereby render thee contentment. <hi>Calidon</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered, but he could not, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed his <U+017F>peech unto <hi>Celidea;</hi> And you; <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, who <U+017F>ees how extreamly <hi>Calidon</hi> does love you; is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you <U+017F>hould not change your will, and affect him? Cannot his affection, his merits, and my prayers, obtain <U+017F>o much from you? Was <hi>Celidea</hi> born to kill both <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> both with love and <U+017F>orrow? <hi>Celidea,</hi> all in tears, would have an<U+017F>wered, but <hi>Calidon</hi> prevented her: Father, <U+017F>aid he, the ordinance of heaven, and the will of this fair One, mu<U+017F>t be as it is; <hi>Tautates</hi> knowes what is fit, better then we our <U+017F>elves: There is no rea<U+017F>on, that two per<U+017F>ons, who merit all manner of good fortune, as <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi> do, <U+017F>hould change their fortune for my mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable <U+017F>ake. For my part, I do vow, and cal heaven and earth to witne<U+017F>s, that I wil never whil<U+017F>t I breathe contradict the judgment, which the heavens have given by the mouth of the Nymph.

They are te<U+017F>timonies, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon,</hi> that I am but a man. As good Chirurgions will not take their hand from the wound, though the Patient complain and cry; <U+017F>o you ought not to cea<U+017F>e from that good work, which it hath plea<U+017F>ed <hi>Tautates</hi> to ordain.

Nay, nay, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Celidea,</hi> in a very violent and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate manner) let neither of you put your <U+017F>elves unto that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the great god <hi>Tharamis,</hi> will <U+017F>ecretly in<U+017F>pire me with a means, how to <U+017F>et both your hearts at re<U+017F>t: It is not rea<U+017F>onable, that all your prayers and demon<U+017F>trations, <U+017F>hould any longer be without producing <U+017F>ome effects; but withall, the will of <hi>Tautates</hi> mu<U+017F>t be done, nor mu<U+017F>t the good opinion I had of you from my very cradle, <U+017F>hew out no <U+017F>parks of will towards you.

it foure or five daies, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, how heaven will direct me unto means, to ea<U+017F>e you both of your <U+017F>orrowes. Upon this, <U+017F>he entreated <hi>Thamires,</hi> he would be plea<U+017F>ed to excu<U+017F>e her from lying with him for foure or five nights, to the end, <U+017F>he might the better contrive the way, how to accompli<U+017F>h her de<U+017F>igne. <hi>Thamires,</hi> who begun to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the <U+017F>mart which his wounds cau<U+017F>ed, who would have con<U+017F>ented unto his own death; to <U+017F>ave the life of <hi>Calidon,</hi> he did freely grant her reque<U+017F>t. Then after <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this <U+017F>ubject, the Chirurgions <U+017F>eeing, that the hopes which <hi>Celidea</hi> had put them into, would conduce unto their re<U+017F>t, and con<U+017F>equently unto their recovery, they advi<U+017F>ed all the company to withdraw. <hi>Calidon</hi> cau<U+017F>ed a bed to be brought into the Chamber of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would not leave him. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Thamires</hi> was <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed with the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his Nephew's affection to him, as he much de<U+017F>ired to have him alwaies with him.
<hi>Celidea</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t perplexed of any, for <U+017F>he would not impart her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto any one, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be prevented in her de<U+017F>igne, though <U+017F>he did not yet know how to effect it: Her de<U+017F>igne was much different from the humours of all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men what<U+017F>oever; for knowing, that it was the beauty of her face, which was the cau<U+017F>e of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate love, both in <hi>Thamires</hi> and his Nephew; al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>idering, that it only was the cau<U+017F>e of the divorce betwixt them, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to make it <U+017F>o ugly for the future, as that they <U+017F>hould hereafter grow as cold at her deformity, as heretofore they were enflamed at her beauty; hoping by this means, to bring <hi>Calidon</hi> to his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es again and to give <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto the world, that <U+017F>he never con<U+017F>ented unto the<U+017F>e follies. After <U+017F>he had long thought upon the way, and not liking the way of a knife, by rea<U+017F>on of the blood and cruelty, unto which her courage could not con<U+017F>ent; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto her Nur<U+017F>es Mother, whom taking a<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he let her under<U+017F>tand, that <U+017F>he had a mo<U+017F>t deadly hatred unto a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e her neighbour, who had infinitely wronged her; that <U+017F>he was fully re<U+017F>olved upon revenge; that her hatred went not <U+017F>o far as death, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired a revenge upon her face, as upon the thing which <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t valued. In order to this, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired her, to acquaint her with <U+017F>ome Plant or other Receipt, which would <U+017F>o mar the face of this Maid, as it <U+017F>hould never recover its beauty again. The good woman, who loved <hi>Celidea</hi> very well, did very di<U+017F>creetly an<U+017F>wer: That any <U+017F>uch cruell de<U+017F>ires of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was unhand<U+017F>ome, and did not become her: That if the other had wronged her, the be<U+017F>t way was, to refer revenge unto <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> who had power to do it: That if <U+017F>he did her <U+017F>elfe take revenge, it was to be feared, that <U+017F>he unto whom it was done, would pay her back double in her owne coyne. To be briefe, <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible arguments and per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, to divert her from this de<U+017F>igne. But <hi>Celidea,</hi> who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>igne was different from what <U+017F>he made appear, did <U+017F>till re<U+017F>olutely per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in her reque<U+017F>t, telling the woman, that <U+017F>he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom <U+017F>he would be revenged, was not a per<U+017F>on that could revenge again; be<U+017F>ides, it <U+017F>hould be carried <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never know from whence it proceeded; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjured her in all love, to <U+017F>atisfie her reque<U+017F>t; prote<U+017F>ting that if <U+017F>he did not, <U+017F>he would cau<U+017F>e her to attempt <U+017F>omething that was much wor<U+017F>e. The good woman an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry, to be a cau<U+017F>e of any wor<U+017F>e accident, therefore within two or three daies <U+017F>he would give her an an<U+017F>wer. Do not fail me then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celidea;</hi> for if you do, you will be the cau<U+017F>e of a far greater mi<U+017F>chiefe. The terme being expired which this good woman took, only to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e on time, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired a longer. But <hi>Celidea,</hi> who knew that this was only delay, yet <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to believe her, whil<U+017F>t in the interim, <U+017F>he would take the be<U+017F>t way <U+017F>he could to accompli<U+017F>h her de<U+017F>igne; <U+017F>etting a face of beliefe in the good old woman upon it, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover her intention unto <hi>Cleontine. Celidea</hi> then <U+017F>eeking out for any way to dis<U+017F>igure her <U+017F>elfe, as ill luck was, <U+017F>he came in the morning unto <hi>Cleontine</hi>'s Chamber, when <U+017F>he was in bed; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Cleontine</hi> was accu<U+017F>tomed to wear a pointed Diamond upon her finger, as a token, that <U+017F>he was dedicated unto <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> as you know, Madam, it is the cu<U+017F>tome of all our Druides, <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed every night, when <U+017F>he went into bed, to put it off, and to take it again in the morning. So it hapned, that <hi>Celidea</hi> taking up this Ring, <U+017F>he put it upon her finger, and from one to another, trying which it would be<U+017F>t fit, perhaps not thinking what <U+017F>he did; which <hi>Cleontine</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Daughter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, are you willing to wear that Ring, upon the <U+017F>ame conditions that I do? If I were able, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> there is nothing in the world I <U+017F>hould more de<U+017F>ire. How then can you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> to <U+017F>atisfie both <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon,</hi> as you have promi<U+017F>ed? That an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, would be the be<U+017F>t remedy of all others; for, they are <U+017F>o religiou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, as if I were once dedicated unto <hi>Theutates,</hi> neither of them would offer to have me out again. Love, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> is above either duty of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53526:193"/>
religion: But pray, Daughter, tell me, which way do you think to give them both <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for truly, I cannot under<U+017F>tand, which way you can do it? For in the fir<U+017F>t place, you are Wife unto <hi>Thamires;</hi> therefore if you would, you cannot dedicate your <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Theutates,</hi> without his leave: But, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you were a Druide, do you think that would content them both? No <U+017F>urely, but rather di<U+017F>content them both, <U+017F>ince, then, both are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of you. Mother, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea)</hi> the great gods will doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e in<U+017F>pire me with <U+017F>ome way or other, and by their aide, I do not doubt but I <U+017F>hall effect it; for in them I put my whole tru<U+017F>t. Daughter, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine)</hi> the gods do never fail tho<U+017F>e that tru<U+017F>t in them, and therefore <U+017F>ince you make them your confidence, I <U+017F>hall believe you may bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Cleontine</hi> would have continued on her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but <hi>Celidea</hi> by accident, did give her hand <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>cratch with the Diamond, that <U+017F>he cryed out; at which <hi>Cleontine</hi> <U+017F>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: What have you done, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, have you cut your <U+017F>elfe with the Diamond? A <U+017F>mall <U+017F>cratch, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> though the pain of it did make me cry out. You think it <U+017F>mall, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> but you are deceived; for the mark will never out, and the cut is very hard to be healed. Then looking into her hand, and <U+017F>eeing it much <U+017F>cratched: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you have a mark as long as you live, and had it been upon your face, it had been quite <U+017F>poiled. How, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celidea,</hi> is a Diamond <U+017F>o venomous? The mark of it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> will never out; and that's the rea<U+017F>on, why I leave it off every night, when I go to bed. Oh! how glad was this young <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, when <U+017F>he heard of this <U+017F>ecret? <U+017F>he thought that the gods had purpo<U+017F>ely taught it her, to accompli<U+017F>h her de<U+017F>igne. I <U+017F>hall now acquaint you Madam, with the <U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olution of this young woman. It was already five or <U+017F>ix daies <U+017F>ince <hi>Thamires</hi> received his hurt; and his wound not being dangerous, he recovered <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that he began to go out of his Chamber. <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> both did <U+017F>ummon <hi>Celidea</hi> to the performance of her promi<U+017F>e. She, with a <U+017F>miling brow, told them, That tomorrow <U+017F>he would give them both content. At night, when her Aunt was in bed <U+017F>he <U+017F>tole her Ring; and when <U+017F>he came into her Chamber, <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed all to go to bed, and <U+017F>hut the dore: Then <U+017F>he <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elfe down by a Table, upon which <U+017F>tood a Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, in which, again<U+017F>t all Fe<U+017F>tivalls, <U+017F>he was wont to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elfe: As <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her fair face in it; Oh Mirrour (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) with whom I was wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ult with <U+017F>o much care and circum<U+017F>pection, how to adorn this face? How different is the occa<U+017F>ion now, that makes me take thy coun<U+017F>ell? I was wont by thy advice, to make my <U+017F>elfe more fair; but now I come to know, how I <U+017F>hall bla<U+017F>t this beauty, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>o deer unto me. Upon this, opening the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>eeing her face all <U+017F>well'd with tears: Oh eyes! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you were not human, did you not lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of that beauty, which heretofore did <U+017F>well you with <U+017F>o much delight. Afterwards being <U+017F>ilent a while, and con<U+017F>idering particularly her beauty, her grace, the ju<U+017F>t proportion of her parts, the lively and <U+017F>weet lu<U+017F>tre of her eyes, the fre<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her ro<U+017F>ie complexion, the compo<U+017F>ure of her mouth, and briefly, all the plea<U+017F>ing parts of her face: I know very well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, Oh my mo<U+017F>t precious and dearly loved trea<U+017F>ures, how valuable you are; but alas, what are you worth unto me, if I cannot enjoy any contentment in pre<U+017F>erving you? I have formerly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teemed this beauty as my highe<U+017F>t and riche<U+017F>t jewell, I know how much I have been cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for your <U+017F>ake; but when I <U+017F>hall charge you before the Throne of Rea<U+017F>on, to have been the cau<U+017F>e of all the torments I have endured: when I blame you, for the di<U+017F><U+017F>ention that is betwixt the Uncle and the Nephew; nay, when I charge you, as guilty of their blood and ruine; nay more, perhaps of their death, what can you <U+017F>ay in your own defence? what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons can you alledge, why I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till retain and pre<U+017F>erve you? Perhaps you will <U+017F>ay, that it is a very <U+017F>weet thing to be fair; but tell me, how bitter are tho<U+017F>e effects, which that <U+017F>weet doth produce, and how I <U+017F>hould avoid them, by pre<U+017F>erving you? Perhaps you will reply, that love is the effect and con<U+017F>equent of beauty, and nothing in the world is more plea<U+017F>ing, then to be loved and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Perhaps again you will <U+017F>ay, that whil<U+017F>t I am fair, every one will adore me, and when I am foul, every one will di<U+017F>dain me. But for all that, let me tell thee by way of an<U+017F>wer, that in doing <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange an act, every one will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire me, and be apt to believe, that there is <U+017F>ome hidden perfection in me, which does tran<U+017F>cend this outward beauty. Al<U+017F>o in defacing thy lu<U+017F>ter, I <U+017F>hall but anticipate time of a few minutes: For, this beauty which we <U+017F>o much prize, for all our carefull pre<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will quickly fade, a few years more will ravi<U+017F>h it from me: Is it not therefore better to part from it voluntarily, having <U+017F>o good an occa<U+017F>ion, and to <U+017F>acrifice it unto the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who hath born me <U+017F>o much affection? What will the wor<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence be of it? Why, when I am ugly, fewer per<U+017F>ons will love me; I cannot hope to finde any
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53526:193"/>
affection, but from <hi>Thamires:</hi> Now if the affection of <hi>Thamires</hi> be grounded only upon my beauty, it will quickly fall off when my beauty decayes; but, if he have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> any other ba<U+017F>is for his love, certainly he will love me the more, becau<U+017F>e I have made my <U+017F>elfe wholly his, <U+017F>ince none el<U+017F>e will yet look upon me. To be briefe, it is this beauty, which hath cau<U+017F>ed all the mi<U+017F>eries, both of <hi>Calidon, Thamires,</hi> and my <U+017F>elfe. I will ea<U+017F>e them therefore and my <U+017F>elfe too, by parting from that, which would of it <U+017F>elfe ere long part from me: I will <U+017F>et them both at liberty, and my <U+017F>elfe at re<U+017F>t. Now, Madam, I <U+017F>hall relate unto you a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange and generous act: <hi>Celidea,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, took the Diamond, and with a re<U+017F>olute hand, did cut the skin of her fair face in <U+017F>everall places; though the pain of it was extream, yet <U+017F>he cut on, <U+017F>till gna<U+017F>hing her teeth, till <U+017F>he had made five or <U+017F>ix long and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ga<U+017F>hes in her cheeks and forehead, <U+017F>o as all her beauty was quite defaced. Imagine, Madam, how <U+017F>adly <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs re<U+017F>ent this act; but <U+017F>he did not at all <U+017F>eem to be <U+017F>orry for it, only put a cloth about her head, put out the Candle, went into her Aunts Chamber, laid the Ring in its place, and went to bed; you may ea<U+017F>ily imagine, <U+017F>he took no greatre<U+017F>t that night. But when morning was come, and every one awake and up, <hi>Cleontine</hi> wondered <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>ee her Niece; and fearing <U+017F>he had not been well, <U+017F>he went <U+017F>oftly to her bed-<U+017F>ide; but when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her all bloody, <U+017F>he cryed out, thinking <U+017F>he had been dead: All the hou<U+017F>e ran up to her, and found her ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing <hi>Celidea,</hi> though her face was nothing but wounds, and congealed blood: Oh heavens! Daughter, (<U+017F>aid the good old woman) who has thus inhumanly u<U+017F>ed you? What barbarous hand could finde a heart to <U+017F>poil this fair face? <hi>Celidea,</hi> in a low voice, be<U+017F>eeched her, to let her re<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know who had done it, as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon</hi> were come. Chirurgeons were immediately <U+017F>ent for, and <hi>Thamires,</hi> hearing in what condition <hi>Celidea</hi> was, he ran pre<U+017F>ently to her Chamber; but when he <U+017F>aw her, he <U+017F>tood immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and gave no <U+017F>ignes of life, but only by tears in his eyes. At the la<U+017F>t, after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting of him<U+017F>elfe: Is this <hi>Celidea,</hi> whom I <U+017F>ee in this <U+017F>ad plight, <U+017F>aid he? Could the gods ever permit <U+017F>uch a piece of cruelty? What Tiger, in the <U+017F>hape of a Man, could have a heart to do it? Was ever <U+017F>o much inhumanity executed? <hi>Celidea</hi> turning gently towards him: <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, though you have lo<U+017F>t the face of <hi>Celidea,</hi> yet <U+017F>he hath pre<U+017F>erved all the re<U+017F>t of her <U+017F>elfe; if you will permit me to take revenge, I will tell you who hath done this unto me. <hi>Calidon</hi> upon this came into the Chamber, which hindred <hi>Thamires</hi> from returning an<U+017F>wer; and <hi>Calidon</hi> hearing of this accident, he had run him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o out of breath, that he could not <U+017F>peak, yet one might hear him utter vowes, that the villain who had thus injured <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>hould not live till night. Oh <hi>Calidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do not <U+017F>wear, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould be perjured; perhaps it may be <U+017F>uch a one, as you had rather die then keep your oath. I do <U+017F>wear <U+017F>till by <hi>He<U+017F>ius,</hi> replyed <hi>Calidon,</hi> and by my own <U+017F>oul, who ere he be, except <hi>Thamires,</hi> he <U+017F>hall die. Upon this, he kneeled down by her bed <U+017F>ide, and offering to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand, <U+017F>he pu<U+017F>hed him back: <hi>Calidon;</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, why <U+017F>hould you offer to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e my hand? Look upon my face, and take notice, that I am not now the <U+017F>ame <hi>Celidea,</hi> who<U+017F>e beauty you <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed. The <U+017F>hepheard was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with fury, that he had not yet looked upon her; but when he fixed his eyes upon her, and <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>o ga<U+017F>tly transformed, he <U+017F>tood more a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed then <hi>Thamires:</hi> Then laying his hand upon his eyes, and turning his head the other way, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <U+017F>ight, and <U+017F>tared like a man that had been frighted. She all the while was not at all angry, but with incredible courage endured it. Then holding out her hand unto <hi>Thamires:</hi> Friend, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, I hope this will be contentment unto you, to <U+017F>ee, that I am all yours, and that none now can or will ever pretend unto me: This face thus disfigured, was only done, to make me only yours. I cannot believe, <hi>Thamires,</hi> but that your affection unto me was built upon a better foundation, then a fading face. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ee you de<U+017F>irous to know, who it was that made me thus; know, <hi>Thamires,</hi> that it was <hi>Calidon:</hi> And you, <hi>Calidon,</hi> know, that it was <hi>Thamires.</hi> Did you put her into this condition, cried they both out? Yes, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it is <hi>Calidon,</hi> and <hi>Thamires,</hi> that have thus wronged <hi>Celidea:</hi> But have a little patience, and you <U+017F>hall hear, how. Every one did wonder at the<U+017F>e words, but e<U+017F>pecially the two <U+017F>hepheards. And when <hi>Calidon</hi> offered to <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>he interrupted him thus: <hi>Calidon,</hi> do not go about to excu<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe; for, though <hi>Thamires</hi> and you both be the cau<U+017F>e, yet you are more to blame then he. There is none that knowes me is ignorant, how <hi>Thamires</hi> hath loved me from my infancy, and hath ever <U+017F>ince continued his affection to me; this affection became reciprocall, as <U+017F>oon as ever I was capable of Love; and as his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto me did invite me to love him, <U+017F>o the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53526:194"/>
good entertainment that he found from me, invited him to continue it: And indeed how happily had we lived unto this very day, if <hi>Calidon</hi> had not ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me; <U+017F>o as I may <U+017F>ay, and <hi>Thamires</hi> knowes it, that never two loved each other better, than <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea:</hi> But as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Calidon</hi> came, all our happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and contentment was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted; fir<U+017F>t, by his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e; afterwards, by the gift which <hi>Thamires</hi> made of me unto him, which I could never con<U+017F>ent unto. Truth is, after I had long endured the faintne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Thamires,</hi> I and the fiery affection of <hi>Calidon,</hi> I rejected them both, as in rea<U+017F>on I might, <U+017F>ince <hi>Calidon</hi> had made me lo<U+017F>e <hi>Thamires,</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> without cau<U+017F>e, had re<U+017F>igned me to <hi>Calidon.</hi> Afterwards, when I was wholly adjudged unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Nymph <hi>Leonida,</hi> yet <U+017F>till was I tormented by him; when he was in all rea<U+017F>on obliged to decline me, both out of duty of a friend, and the Nymphs command; yet <U+017F>till he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, and would needs die. On the other <U+017F>ide, the kinde nature of <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Nephew in that condition, did leave me in bed, and made it appear, that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto <hi>Calidon</hi> was greater, then his love to me, whom he had courted with <U+017F>o much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this accident, when I was told, that both my Husband and his Nephew were brought in chaires as dead. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that when I <U+017F>aw them, and heard how all was, I knew not what to re<U+017F>olve upon. But afterwards, con<U+017F>idering the whole <U+017F>tate of the matter, I lifted up my heart unto <hi>Thara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> be<U+017F>eeching him to advi<U+017F>e me what cour<U+017F>e to take, to compo<U+017F>e this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e he did in<U+017F>pire me with the means. This therefore, Oh <U+017F>hepheards, was the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration: Con<U+017F>ider (<U+017F>aid that god unto me) the violent affection of <hi>Calidon,</hi> and be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this, that he will never leave you, as long as you are fair; never think, that either religion to the gods, or any duty to men, will re<U+017F>train him: Nor can you imagine, that <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> though he be your Husband, and love you above his life, can ever enjoy any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as long as he <U+017F>ees his Nephew <U+017F>o tormented. As for your part, What kinde of life can you hope to live, as long as you are the cau<U+017F>e of both their mi<U+017F>eries? To give your <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> your own will cannot con<U+017F>ent unto it; be<U+017F>ides, you are already devoted unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> that nothing can <U+017F>eparate you, but death. The violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Calidon</hi> will not <U+017F>uffer you to be quiet with <hi>Thamires;</hi> nor can the kinde nature of <hi>Thamires,</hi> endure the continuall di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures of his Nephew. What then, <hi>Celidea,</hi> cau<U+017F>t thou do? Put on a generous re<U+017F>olution, and deprive thy <U+017F>elfe of that, which is the root of all this di<U+017F><U+017F>ention. Cau<U+017F>t thou think it any thing el<U+017F>e, but the beauty of thy face? 'Tis true, an<U+017F>wered I; but in lo<U+017F>ing that beauty, I <U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o lo<U+017F>e the love of <hi>Thamires</hi> as well as <hi>Calidon;</hi> and if <U+017F>o, I had better die. You are deceived, an<U+017F>wered he, the love of the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hepheards is different; <hi>Thamires</hi> loves <hi>Celidea,</hi> and <hi>Calidon</hi> adores the beauty of <hi>Celidea.</hi> If your fears <U+017F>hould prove true, you had better die pre<U+017F>ently, then live long; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that when age has made you unhand<U+017F>ome, <hi>Thamires</hi> will cea<U+017F>e to love you. But, let that be the lea<U+017F>t of your fears, <hi>Thamires</hi> loves <hi>Celidea,</hi> and let <hi>Celidea</hi> become what <U+017F>he will, <U+017F>till <hi>Thamires</hi> will love her.</p>
               <p>This, Shepheards was the <U+017F>acred coun<U+017F>ell, which the gods did in<U+017F>pire into me, unto which I dur<U+017F>t not be di<U+017F>obedient, and therefore <U+017F>ought out for means to put it in execution; <U+017F>o as having heard my Aunt <U+017F>ay, that the wounds which were made by a Diamond, would never heal, I intended to <U+017F>acrifice that beauty which was in my face, unto your tranquillity and union. But, Oh my <hi>Thamires!</hi> I hope you will not cea<U+017F>e loving <hi>Celidea,</hi> though <U+017F>he has not the <U+017F>ame face <U+017F>he had; for, what <U+017F>he has done, was only to <U+017F>atisfie the de<U+017F>ires of <hi>Calidon,</hi> that <U+017F>he might be entirely yours. Thus ended <hi>Celidea,</hi> leaving all that heard her full of admiration at her generous act. It would be too long and tedious to relate <hi>Calidon</hi>'s reproching her, the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Thamires,</hi> the <U+017F>orrowes of <hi>Cleontine</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi>'s Mother, with all tho<U+017F>e that con<U+017F>idered her condition. But <U+017F>o it was, that when the Chirurgions had dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her pittifull <U+017F>acrificed face, they all concluded, that <U+017F>he would never recover her beauty again; for the cuts were <U+017F>o deep, and in <U+017F>uch places, that they had for ever <U+017F>poiled all her delicate features and proportion. So it falls out, that <hi>Calidon</hi> <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o deformed, his fiery flaming pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did quite extingui<U+017F>h; and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> as <U+017F>he hoped, continues his love; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he has ever <U+017F>ince lived in abundance of <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed and honoured by every one, as <U+017F>he hath vowed, that <U+017F>he never in all her life received halfe that contentment from her beauty, as <U+017F>he has <U+017F>ince from her deformity.</p>
               <p>You have related (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> the mo<U+017F>t generous and commendable act, that ever was done by a woman; and I am extreamly glad to hear, that <U+017F>uch a vertuous re<U+017F>olution
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53526:194"/>
<U+017F>hould proceed from one, <U+017F>o neerly allyed unto me, as <hi>Celidea</hi> is; I be<U+017F>eech the gods, to make her as happy in <hi>Thamires,</hi> as <hi>Thamires</hi> has rea<U+017F>on to love her, and e<U+017F>teem her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Now (continued <hi>Lycidas) Thamires</hi> thinking he <U+017F>hall never have any Children, he would gladly make a match between <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and to invite <hi>Phocion</hi> unto it, he offers to give him all his Lands and Flocks. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who grieves <U+017F>o for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and re<U+017F>olves never to love any again, <U+017F>he will not upon any termes hear of it; and when her Uncle made the motion unto her, <U+017F>he did nothing but weep; in<U+017F>omuch as when he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her unto it, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, That <U+017F>he would <U+017F>pend all the re<U+017F>t of her daies among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>talls and Druides: <U+017F>o as in order unto that, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired me to <U+017F>peak unto the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> about it. Do you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, without the con<U+017F>ent of her Parents? I asked her the very <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>tion, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lycidas,</hi> but <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> having neither Father nor Mother living, <U+017F>he might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elfe; and that if <U+017F>he could not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elfe this way, <U+017F>he would then enter into her grave. I perceive, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that <U+017F>he is exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively afflicted: But I pray tell me, who is contented? Would I dur<U+017F>t tell you, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard. Why <U+017F>hould you make more difficuly in telling me that, replyed the Nymph, then in telling me the re<U+017F>t? There are many rea<U+017F>ons for it, replyed he, but, <U+017F>ince I have gone <U+017F>o far, I will venter to go a little farther, therefore, Madam, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that it is <hi>Phillis</hi> whom I mean: But, I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you, to ask me no farther. I cannot chu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but <U+017F>well with a <U+017F>trange curio<U+017F>ity at your reque<U+017F>t, and do wonder, why you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o conceal that, which I do <U+017F>o extreamly de<U+017F>ire to know: For, loving <hi>Phillis</hi> as I do, why would you not have me enquire of her contentment? But I perceive, you do <U+017F>trictly ob<U+017F>erve the Lawes of Love, the chiefe of which is, to <hi>Conceal and be <U+017F>ilent.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e he would needs <U+017F>eem, as if it did not concern him: Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never think to hide your <U+017F>elfe from me; for, <U+017F>hepheard, I do know more of you, then you imagine: Can you think, I could frequent the company of all your <U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and not hear, how you are a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> and how, after a long continued <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you are at the la<U+017F>t growne jealous of <hi>Silvander?</hi> Certainly I <U+017F>hould have been of a very dull compo<U+017F>ition, if <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o compleat a <U+017F>hepheard as <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and loving <hi>Phillis</hi> as I do, I had not enquired of your life. If I did <U+017F>eem, <U+017F>hepheard, as if I were ignorant, it was only out of di<U+017F>cretion, for I do know as much of your affaires, as you do almo<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elfe; and if you will, I will tell you <U+017F>uch particulars, as <U+017F>hall make you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it. <hi>Lycidas</hi> hearing her <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, he was extreamly confu<U+017F>ed, and thought, that all her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge came from <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis.</hi> I perceive, <U+017F>aid he, that you are acquainted with my follies, and that things are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly carried, as I wi<U+017F>h they were: But to make it appear, that I am as much your <U+017F>ervant, as your Informers can be, I will tell you more then they could, <U+017F>ince they are pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which hapned, <U+017F>ince they had the honour to <U+017F>ee you; <U+017F>till be<U+017F>eeching you to be <U+017F>ecret. I have <U+017F>o great an e<U+017F>teem, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, both of the ver<U+017F>ue of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and of your merits, as you may be mo<U+017F>t certain, I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ecret in any thing that concernes either of you: And you may <U+017F>ee, I can be <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>ince I was <U+017F>o long before I imparted unto you what I did know. But when you told me, that <hi>Phillis</hi> was contented, I wondred, becau<U+017F>e I knew her to be much troubled at your faintne<U+017F><U+017F>e and jealou<U+017F>ie. Oh great Nymph, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) great alterations have been, <U+017F>ince I had the honour to <U+017F>ee you: Oh how oft have I been upon my knees? Believe it, Madam, <hi>Phillis</hi> knowes how to bring me into my <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and can make me know my duty: Had I but time to tell you the whole <U+017F>eries of the <U+017F>tory, you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee what abundance of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is, betwixt a Lover and a Wi<U+017F>eman. I do not know any thing, replyed the Nymph, which I more de<U+017F>ire to know; and as for lea<U+017F>ure, you may have time enough, <U+017F>ince <hi>Adamas, Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Diamis</hi> are entred into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for old men will never have an end of their old <U+017F>tories. The Nymphs chiefe end in holding him thus in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, was, in con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Alexis,</hi> le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould take too much ob<U+017F>ervance of her; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the fir<U+017F>t time to be the mo<U+017F>t dangerous, becau<U+017F>e when the opinion was once fixed, it would better pa<U+017F><U+017F>e afterwards for currant, therefore <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired him to proceed. <hi>Lycidas</hi> thinking it would be plea<U+017F>ing unto the Nymph, began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hi<U+017F>tory of the jealous</hi> Lycidas.</head>
               <p>YOu know Madam that the familiar conver<U+017F>ation which was between <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>triving which <U+017F>hould make <hi>Diana</hi> love them be<U+017F>t, was the cau<U+017F>e of my jealou<U+017F>ie. A jealou<U+017F>y, which I may well <U+017F>ay, was within a <U+017F>mall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of madne<U+017F><U+017F>e. In<U+017F>omuch as I have often wondered, how it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould live in that torment: The paines of death could not be greater: Every houre, <U+017F>ome accident or other added fre<U+017F>h tortures: my eye could not turne it<U+017F>elf without findingout <U+017F>ome new aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mi<U+017F>ery: And wor<U+017F>t of all, when I had greate<U+017F>t curio<U+017F>ity to find out the cau<U+017F>es of my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures: Nay my imagination would fancy things <U+017F>o beyond all manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on; as I wonder how it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible my judgement <U+017F>hould be perverted. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke any thing freely unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> Oh how every accent pierced me to the heart. When <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ilent, and did not <U+017F>peake at all, I concluded <U+017F>he di<U+017F><U+017F>embled; when <U+017F>he carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, I thought <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>igne to deceive me; when <U+017F>he <U+017F>lighted me, I <U+017F>aid this was a <U+017F>igne of a change in her affection: when <U+017F>he <U+017F>hunned <hi>Silvander,</hi> I thought <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her; if <U+017F>he applyed her <U+017F>elfe unto him, then I thought <U+017F>he was de<U+017F>irous to vexe me, and <U+017F>hew how well <U+017F>he was contented in her new affection. If <U+017F>he was not at any time <U+017F>ad, then I <U+017F>aid there was <U+017F>ome amorous quarrell fallen out betwixt them. To be briefe, every thing <U+017F>he did offended me: And when there was nothing to ground my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure upon, I <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e my judgement for being <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, as not to <U+017F>ee their di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations. How oft have I wi<U+017F>ht my <U+017F>elfe no eyes, that I could not <U+017F>ee neither <hi>Silvander</hi> nor <hi>Phillis.</hi> But to what purpo<U+017F>e would that be (<U+017F>aid I pre<U+017F>ently after) for though I were blind, yet they would love? But, <U+017F>aid I, it were much better to lo<U+017F>e my love, <U+017F>ince the thought of it doth thus torment me, and ever will, till I be in my grave. See unto what extremity I was driven, <U+017F>ince in lieu of loving <hi>Phillis,</hi> I did hate her. I could have wi<U+017F>hed her ugly, and yet I <U+017F>hould have been very <U+017F>orry if <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t the lea<U+017F>t part of her beauty and hand<U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e. And this I found pre<U+017F>ently at the <U+017F>ame time: for <U+017F>he having had three or foure fits of an ague, which had cau<U+017F>ed a little alteration in her face, I was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at it, that <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elfe ob<U+017F>erved me. Living therefore, or rather langui<U+017F>hing in this manner, and almo<U+017F>t reduced unto an ab<U+017F>olute de<U+017F>paire, the gods had pitty upon me. One Night <hi>Silvander</hi> chanced to fall a<U+017F>leep in the wood, neere unto the Temple of the good godde<U+017F><U+017F>e: when he awaked he found a Letter in his hand; not knowing how it came. Upon his returne he <U+017F>hewed it unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> they thought it to be writ by the hand of <hi>Celadon:</hi> and they hoping to heare more of him in the place where this Letter was found, they entreated <hi>Silvander</hi> to conduct them thither. When they were there, night <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed them, that they were forced to <U+017F>tay there, untill it was day. During this <U+017F>hort time, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> fell a<U+017F>leep, and had <U+017F>uch dreames and vi<U+017F>ions as cau<U+017F>ed her to think that <hi>Celadon</hi> was in pain, and that his Gho<U+017F>t walked, becau<U+017F>e he had not received the la<U+017F>t office of a buriall: <U+017F>he therefore re<U+017F>olved to erect an empty Tombe for him, but thought it more expedient to be done in the name of <hi>Paris</hi> then her owne; the<U+017F>e cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were <U+017F>o long and the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>o weary, that at their return they went into their owne cabins to re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves. For my part I left them betimes, and after I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned retired my <U+017F>elfe into a thick covert neere the way which conducts to our Towne: It is <U+017F>o thick with underwood, as, though it joyne upon the high way, yet it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een. And yet I could plainy <U+017F>ee all pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers going or comming. After a long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of my owne thoughts, <U+017F>leepe did <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e me, that I did not waken untill the Sun was almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>et. And intending to retire, I would fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee whether any were in the medow, that I might avoyd meeting with <hi>Philis.</hi> By fortune I e<U+017F>pyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and her, who having re<U+017F>ted them<U+017F>elves in their Cabins, came to walk in the fre<U+017F>h Aire of that place. On the other <U+017F>ide, I <U+017F>aw <hi>Silvander</hi> following them, thinking, (as I beleeve) that <hi>Diana</hi> would come unto them, I hid my <U+017F>elfe againe in the covert, de<U+017F>ireous to <U+017F>ee what they did, and beleeving they would give me <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h knowledge of their affection. But it happened, that <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>eeing them <U+017F>it downe under the covert where I was, he came to <U+017F>it among<U+017F>t them. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>he quitted her place and went <U+017F>ome twenty paces from them. Then I heard <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> call her, and <hi>Silvander</hi> be<U+017F>eech her to come unto them. Oh what <U+017F>marting wounds did the<U+017F>e words make in my heart? Yet <hi>Phillis</hi> came not: but <U+017F>hewed her<U+017F>elfe to be very much di<U+017F>contented at the Shepheard. But whereas this might well have

contented me, it did the more offend me, conceiving that there are alwayes <U+017F>uch pretty quarrells among<U+017F>t lovers, as do but renew love. <hi>Phillis</hi> was <U+017F>ome twenty paces from them, as I told you, and would not come neere them, but <U+017F>till walked alone by her<U+017F>elfe: At which <hi>Silvander</hi> began to <U+017F>mile, and at la<U+017F>t he could not hold but laugh very loud. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> hearing him and being much enflamed with anger again<U+017F>t him; <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) your behaviour towards me, does make me hate you even to death: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, if ever any occa<U+017F>ion of revenge offer it <U+017F>elfe unto me, I will lay hold upon it. The <U+017F>hepheard hearing her utter the<U+017F>e words with <U+017F>o much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he bur<U+017F>t out into <U+017F>uch a violent fit of laughter, that he could not give any an<U+017F>were. Well well (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> laugh on, uncivill <U+017F>hepheard, do your wor<U+017F>t to offend me, perhaps I <U+017F>hall one day finde an opportunity of revenge, and if I do not take it, never tru<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis</hi> againe. When <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aw this, <U+017F>he took part with <hi>Phillis:</hi> I did not think (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that <hi>Silvander</hi> whom I ever found di<U+017F>cret and full of civility, would offer to offend <hi>Phillis</hi> without any cau<U+017F>e. <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he was more animated again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>hepheard: He cares not a <U+017F>traw (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for offending me; but he has good rea<U+017F>on for it, for he knowes I never cared for him, nor can he well incen<U+017F>e me more again<U+017F>t him, then I was before. Oh how this di<U+017F><U+017F>ention did plea<U+017F>e me? and yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but be angry he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>light her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> he adre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Are you, faire <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) <U+017F>o angry again<U+017F>t me? I thought that you would have taken my part. I can never take part again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> but me thinkes you might do much better then to give my companion <U+017F>o much occa<U+017F>ion to hate you. Truly (<U+017F>aid he in <U+017F>erious earne<U+017F>t) although you are partially bia<U+017F><U+017F>ed on <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>ide, yet I am contented you <U+017F>hould be the judge of our difference. Provided <U+017F>he wil before you, declare the occa<U+017F>ion of her anger again<U+017F>t me; and when you have heard us both, I will pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ubmit unto what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>entence: Who I, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>hould I rea<U+017F>on any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e with you? No no, I had rather I were dumb as long as I lived then to have any thing to do with h you. For all this, replyed he, I would tell you <U+017F>omthing which perhaps would make it appeare that <hi>Silvander</hi> is more your <U+017F>ervant then you imagine. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he be<U+017F>eeched her to intreat <hi>Phillis</hi> to <U+017F>it downe, which <U+017F>he did: not, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I have any de<U+017F>ire to heare you, but only becau<U+017F>e I will do what<U+017F>oever <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> commands me. <hi>Silvander</hi> without any reply unto her, began thus. I beleeve <hi>Phillis</hi> you do not think me <U+017F>o ignorant in the affaires of the world, as that I <U+017F>hould never hear of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is betwixt you and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Nay perhaps you will wonder I <U+017F>hould know <U+017F>o much and <U+017F>eeme <U+017F>o ignorant. So as you will not judge this <hi>Silvander</hi> whom you wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>o ill, was <U+017F>o little your <U+017F>ervant as you think him. But <U+017F>o it is <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e that I did know all particulars, from <U+017F>uch as are inqui<U+017F>itive into the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es of others, and afterwards I knew both from your <U+017F>elf and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Do you not remember how one day when you retired your <U+017F>elfe from much company, you commanded <hi>Hylas</hi> to relate the <U+017F>tory of his life and the adventures of his <U+017F>everall Loves? Do you remember when you went away, you de<U+017F>ired <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to go along with you? Have you forgotten how you went into the wood to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Lycidas</hi> who waited there for you? and how <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> told you that you <U+017F>hould take heed le<U+017F>t he tooke it not ill? al<U+017F>o how you an<U+017F>wered her, that he was <U+017F>o importunate that you could not deny him, but therefore you tooke <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with you? Now, <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, think well upon the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which you had with him: you need not tell it unto me, for I know it all as well as if I had heard it.</p>
               <p>At this, they both blu<U+017F>hed, and <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o amazed that they could not <U+017F>peak but looked upon each other. Nay, never be troubled (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)</hi> that I do know all the<U+017F>e things, for I am di<U+017F>creet enough to conceale any thing: but if you plea<U+017F>e, faire <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I will tell you how angry <hi>Lycidas</hi> was again<U+017F>t you, and what paines you tooke to qualfie him; you may <U+017F>ee, I do almo<U+017F>t know as much of your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es as you your <U+017F>elves do: Know <hi>Phillis</hi> that I was not ignorant either of the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> or the cau<U+017F>e of his jealou<U+017F>ie. I am <U+017F>ure (replyed my <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e and looking him in the face) that you have <U+017F>o behaved your <U+017F>elfe towards me, as hath extreamly troubled both <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and me, and your <U+017F>elfe al<U+017F>o. Oh, <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered he) you are more obliged unto me, then you imagine; for what would you have me to do? Since you knew (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> was jealous of you, you <U+017F>hould have ab<U+017F>ented your <U+017F>elfe from me. You bid me do things impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, (replyed he) and <U+017F>uch as had been infinitly prejudicall unto you, if I had done them Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, becau<U+017F>e I having undertaken to <U+017F>erve <hi>Diana</hi> and you being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with her, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to be ab<U+017F>ent from you unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had been ab<U+017F>ent,

from both. Had you been <U+017F>o good a friend to me as you might (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> you would rather have ab<U+017F>ented your <U+017F>elfe from <hi>Diana,</hi> and hazard the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your wager, then have made <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>o jealous, and me <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad: for that <U+017F>hepheard was much your friend, and I had never given you any occa<U+017F>ion to be mine enemy. I perceive <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Silvander)</hi> that you never con<U+017F>idered the hurt which you would have done me: nor how impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible it was for me to do it. If I did do you any hurt, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was out of ignorance, for I did not intend it: However, replyed he, you did do me hurt, and I was very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it. I be<U+017F>eech you which way (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> are not you the cau<U+017F>e of my undertaking to <U+017F>erve <hi>Diana?</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) What then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis)</hi> why do you accu<U+017F>e me? I do accu<U+017F>e you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander)</hi> of all the mi<U+017F>eries that ever I re<U+017F>ented. For in lieu of counterfeiting love, I do love in good earne<U+017F>t. Upon this, the <U+017F>hepheard made a <U+017F>top, as if he were <U+017F>orry he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o much: which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> perceiving. Never vexe, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, nor blu<U+017F>h at the confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a truth; perhaps the<U+017F>e words are not the fir<U+017F>t that gave us knowledge of it. I am not a<U+017F>hamed, an<U+017F>wered he, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, I am <hi>Diana's</hi> <U+017F>ervant, but much a<U+017F>hamed of mine owne immerits of that honour. If <hi>Diana</hi> (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>A<U+017F>trea)</hi> were to be wone by merits, I know none that may better pretend unto her then <hi>Silvander.</hi>

               <p>I wi<U+017F>h with all my <U+017F>oul, Faire <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, replyed he, that every one were of the <U+017F>ame opinion. Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> how plea<U+017F>ing were the<U+017F>e words unto my <U+017F>oul? How, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida,</hi> is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>hould love <hi>Diana</hi> in earne<U+017F>t? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he doth, <U+017F>aid he, and I <U+017F>hall tell you more another time; but for the pre<U+017F>ent, I <U+017F>hall onely tell you how I was delivered from my tormenting jealou<U+017F>ie. I heard therefore how <hi>Silvander</hi> continued his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e thus: Now not being able to be ab<U+017F>ent from you, becau<U+017F>e of your continuall pre<U+017F>ence with <hi>Diana,</hi> what would you have had me done? be you your <U+017F>elfe the Judge. You ought not, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> to have given <hi>Lycidas</hi> any occa<U+017F>ion of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>y, at the fir<U+017F>t: and afterwards, when you <U+017F>aw how jealous he was, though you could not be ab<U+017F>ent from me by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Diana,</hi> yet you might very well have behaved your <U+017F>elfe more mode<U+017F>tly and coldly to me, when <hi>Lycidas</hi> was pre<U+017F>ent: Oh what a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>t in love you are, <U+017F>aid he, did you take notice of the minute when <hi>Lycidas</hi> grew fir<U+017F>t jealous? No <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and do you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I <U+017F>hould perceive it better then you? Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es in love, do beginne like other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, and none can have knowledge of them: So as I could not give a <U+017F>top unto the originall of his jealou<U+017F>y no more then you could: As for the progre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I think that I have infinitely obliged you by it: becau<U+017F>e had I then declined you, or <U+017F>poke le<U+017F><U+017F>e affectionately to you, what might he have thought? only that the cau<U+017F>e of my declining you and behaving my <U+017F>elfe otherwi<U+017F>e then u<U+017F>ually, I did intend to delude him, and held a private core<U+017F>pondency with you? would he not have bin more enflamed with jealou<U+017F>ie. Believe it <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was very requi<U+017F>ite I <U+017F>hould continue my carriage towards you as I begun it; otherwi<U+017F>e, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected it di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and concluded Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation to be a co-incident unto Love.</p>
               <p>I being now put out of all my long and tormenting doubts, and plainly finding that there was no love betwixt them, I cryed out, Oh <hi>Phillis, Silvander</hi> is in the right: Then I ran and fell downe upon my knees before them, at which they were both <U+017F>o a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed as they looked upon one another and could not <U+017F>peak. For my part I was <U+017F>o over joyed at my fortune, as I knew not what words to chu<U+017F>e whereby I might thank love for the favor. At the la<U+017F>t I addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf unto her in this manner, my faire<U+017F>t Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my fault de<U+017F>erves puni<U+017F>hment no pardon: I am here upon my knees at your mercy: Doome me to what puni<U+017F>hment you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o you will but forget my crime. Such expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions as the<U+017F>e I u<U+017F>ed unto her. At which without any returne of an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and looked upon the ground. Both <U+017F>he and I <U+017F>tanding mute, <hi>Silvander</hi> would needs be a cau<U+017F>e of my contentment as he had been of my <U+017F>orrowes. Therefore, <U+017F>hephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) as I have been a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath been jealous without cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o <U+017F>hall I witne<U+017F><U+017F>e that you are fuller of revenge then love, if you do not accept of this <U+017F>atisfaction which he offers. Never <U+017F>tudy any longer what you have to do, pardon him as you ought; His affection de<U+017F>erves it, and yours commands it. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Silvander</hi> <U+017F>ayes very truly: and you may be certain of this, that it was rather exce<U+017F><U+017F>e then any defect of love which hath cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Lycidas</hi> to commit this errour: and if it be a fault, he repents and hath done <U+017F>ufficient pennance. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> looking upon me: <hi>Lycidas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you have <U+017F>o extreamly offended me, that it is very hard to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e it over: but
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53526:196"/>
<U+017F>ince <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will have it <U+017F>o, I pardon you, but with a vow, that if ever you relap<U+017F>e into the like fault, you <U+017F>hall lo<U+017F>e all hopes of ever recovering my affection again. Fie, fie, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> continued <U+017F>he, could you be <U+017F>o weak, and think me <U+017F>o light, as to love every one I looked upon: Were the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances which I had given you of my affection, <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, as that you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily doubt them? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had continued on, (for I was not able to <U+017F>peak) if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had not interrupted her: Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, you have <U+017F>aid enough, <hi>Lycidas</hi> is all penitence and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and you will <U+017F>in again<U+017F>t the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your own nature, if you in<U+017F>ult too much upon him. <hi>Phillis,</hi> after a little con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto her Companion, in this language: Si<U+017F>ter, I will not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the offence, but al<U+017F>o forget it, provided, that for the future, he never give me any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion to remember it. Thus, Madam, was I cured, thus was my crime pardoned; and <hi>Silvander</hi> and I, have lived <U+017F>ince in <U+017F>o kinde a familiarity, that, next my poor Brother, I never loved any man better. And are you not afraid, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being <U+017F>o much together, <U+017F>hould make you jealous again? For, he that loves is naturally <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition. No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas;</hi> for fir<U+017F>t, I have full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in the affection of <hi>Phillis;</hi> and <U+017F>econdly, <hi>Silvander</hi>'s love of <hi>Diana,</hi> who I know cannot admit of a Companion.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Hylas</hi> entertaining <hi>Alexis,</hi> began by little and little to be in love with her. And <U+017F>he having an opinion, that this would be a meanes to make it more believed, that <U+017F>he was a woman, <U+017F>he endeavoured to kindle his flame as much as <U+017F>he could; and though <U+017F>he had never <U+017F>een him before, yet <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> had acquainted her with his plea<U+017F>ant humour. <hi>Hylas,</hi> according to his free hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, cryed out upon a <U+017F>udden: <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have thought upon it, I mu<U+017F>t now fairly bid you Adieu; all that I can do, is, to give you the <U+017F>ame liberty, that I take my <U+017F>elfe. <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Corilas</hi> hearing this <U+017F>uddain re<U+017F>olution, and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Alexis</hi> could not <U+017F>peak for laughing, they could not chu<U+017F>e but take the part of <hi>Phillis,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to begin occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Why, <U+017F>hepheard, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,)</hi> do you ca<U+017F>t off the fair <hi>Phillis</hi> in this manner? She has rea<U+017F>on to ob<U+017F>erve this, as one of her black and fatall daies. What can I help it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas?</hi> Why is <U+017F>hee not as fair as <hi>Alexis?</hi> Oh heavens, (replyed <hi>Corilas)</hi> who can hereafter have any a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in your affection? That may this mo<U+017F>t lovely Nymph, an<U+017F>wered he, who is fairer then <hi>Phillis.</hi> But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> is not this a mo<U+017F>t manife<U+017F>t <U+017F>igne of your levity and ficklene<U+017F><U+017F>e? Not at all, an<U+017F>wered he, but rather an argument of the great beauty in <hi>Alexis.</hi> If beauty be the matter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas, Phillis</hi> is not defective in it. She hath le<U+017F><U+017F>e then <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> for <U+017F>he is not able to hold me, now I have <U+017F>een the other; and therefore I mu<U+017F>t fairly take my leave of her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who had been long <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Corilas</hi> did not reply, he undertook the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e for him: It is not any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the beauty of <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, which moveth this <U+017F>hepheard to make his retreat, but it is his owne naturall incon<U+017F>tancy. Very well, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas)</hi> do you call it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy, when one goes on <U+017F>tep by <U+017F>tep, unto the place where they intend to arrive? No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander.</hi> And yet, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>uch a one does <U+017F>et his foot, <U+017F>ometimes upon the ground, <U+017F>ometimes in the air, <U+017F>ometimes before, <U+017F>ometimes behinde: And is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tancy as well as that which you lay in my di<U+017F>h? For, intending to arrive at a perfect beauty, I do <U+017F>et one foot before another, and never leave changing, till I arrive at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended place. Even <U+017F>o have I done, by all I have hitherto loved, untill I found <hi>Alexis,</hi> who I finde to be the mo<U+017F>t perfect beauty of all. This might hold good, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> if you could demon<U+017F>trate to us, that you do merit to love <hi>Alexis:</hi> For, as you have gotten the name of Incon<U+017F>tant, by loving <U+017F>o many; <U+017F>o now, you will get the name Pre<U+017F>umptuous, in loving <hi>Alexis. Alexis</hi> was long <U+017F>ilent, taking great delight in the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards; but when <U+017F>he heard her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o highly commended, <U+017F>he thought it fit to <U+017F>peak: Did I as much merit the affection of <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, as I am willing to entertain it, certainly he <U+017F>hould have no <U+017F>mall rea<U+017F>on to love me. Then tuming her <U+017F>elfe in a <U+017F>miling manner towards <hi>Hylas:</hi> Servant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, take heed, le<U+017F>t the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this <U+017F>hepheard <U+017F>hould divert you; for, you would wrong both your <U+017F>elfe and me, if it <U+017F>hould: It would be a <U+017F>hame for you, to attempt an enterpri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon give it over; and it would be too evident an argument of my little merit, if you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon quit me. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> do you not dread the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Teupates,</hi> in addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing your <U+017F>elfe unto one, who is con<U+017F>ecrated unto him? Ignorant <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> the gods do command us to love them<U+017F>elves; and how can they be angry with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53526:197"/>
us, for loving that which is theirs? You <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that this <U+017F>hepheard hath <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igne upon us, he would cunningly turn you from me by artifice; for he knowes well enough, that if I will, I can leave off that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which I have taken upon me.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards were thus talking, <hi>Adamas</hi> was entertaining <hi>Phocion, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> and <hi>Tircis;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e he e<U+017F>teemed them very much, both for their age, their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and for his de<U+017F>igne, in making a Match between <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to bid them welcome: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Tircis</hi> was a <U+017F>tranger, and had never <U+017F>een the raritles of his Hou<U+017F>e, he asked him, if he would take <U+017F>o much paines as to walk, and <U+017F>ee it: And hearing him an<U+017F>wer, that he did infinitly de<U+017F>ire it, he took him by the hand, and willed <hi>Paris</hi> to do the like unto <hi>Hylas</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepheards, if they had a minde. <hi>Alexis,</hi> with the help of <hi>Hylas,</hi> who led her by the arme, followed <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> with the re<U+017F>t of the Company. The Hou<U+017F>e was very fine, and furni<U+017F>hed with many excellent <U+017F>ingularities; but becau<U+017F>e the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of it would be too long, we will <U+017F>peak no more of it, then what is pertinent to our purpo<U+017F>e. They entred then into a large Gallery, which had a pro<U+017F>pect of Plaines on the one <U+017F>ide, and Mountains on the other, which made it very delectable and plea<U+017F>ant. The <U+017F>ides was Wan<U+017F>cot fretted, and, betwixt the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, hung with Maps of the <U+017F>everall Provinces of <hi>Gaul:</hi> At the higher end, hung Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of <U+017F>everall Countries, Kings, and Emperours, and among<U+017F>t them, the Portractures of <U+017F>everall very beautifull Women. The top was adorned with Gold and Azure, very richly imbo<U+017F><U+017F>ed, with many <U+017F>everall devices. Every one fixed their eyes upon that, which was mo<U+017F>t agreeable unto their fancies: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> who<U+017F>e heart was all for beauty, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon a Picture which contained two Ladies: See, (<U+017F>aid he) two very delicate faces; Which of the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hould one judge to be the fairer? <hi>Adamas,</hi> who heard him: That (<U+017F>aid he) on the right hand, is the Picture of the Mother in Law; and the other on the left, the Daughter in Law: Both of them were two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, as fair and as wi<U+017F>e as ever any, and as much to<U+017F><U+017F>ed and turmoiled by the <U+017F>tormes of Fortune, as any in our Times. This, which <U+017F>eemes the more aged, is the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> Daughter unto the great <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<U+017F>ius,</hi> Si<U+017F>ter unto <hi>Arcudius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> Wife unto <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius,</hi> and Mother unto <hi>Valentiniaen,</hi> all five Emperours, who<U+017F>e Pictures are a little farther off. The other is the Picture of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> the Second, and Wife unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whom <hi>Gen<U+017F>erio</hi> carried into <hi>Affrica.</hi> They were two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis)</hi> of great beauties, and as great extractions: But wherein was their Fortunes <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e?

                  <hi>THEODOSIUS,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t of that name, Emperour of the Ea<U+017F>t, one of the greate<U+017F>t Princes the World had, <U+017F>ince <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus;</hi> he had three Children: One, <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who after him, was Emperour of the Ea<U+017F>t: Another, was <hi>Honorius,</hi> who was Emperour of the We<U+017F>t: And the third, was the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> who<U+017F>e fortune was <U+017F>o various, that we <U+017F>ee in her, how Vertue is ordinarily cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed: For, <U+017F>he being at the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her Brother <hi>Honorius,</hi> and he under the government of <hi>Stilicon,</hi> unto who<U+017F>e Guardian<U+017F>hip the great <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> had committed him, during his nonage, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o variou<U+017F>ly to<U+017F><U+017F>ed and tormented by <U+017F>everall accidents, as if Fortune had made choice of her, to <U+017F>hew the power it hath in all human things, of which <hi>Stilicon</hi> was the greate<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e, who having great power over the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Honorius</hi> and the whole Empire, his ambition a<U+017F>pired at more ab<U+017F>olute authority, and aimed to make him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>ole Emperour, as when his de<U+017F>ignes were di<U+017F>covered it did plainly appear. He being a man of a deep reach, and managing his matters <U+017F>o, as might mo<U+017F>t condure to his de<U+017F>ired end and grandure, he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him to make u<U+017F>e of policy and <U+017F>ubtlety, where it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e it by force. His way was therefore at the fir<U+017F>t, to <U+017F>tretch his authority to the highe<U+017F>t pitch before he made his intentions known, and afterwards, to fortifie him<U+017F>elfe, by marrying his Daughter unto young <hi>Honorius;</hi> for the very name of Father in Law to an Emperour looked big, and procured him a great honour and fear. Afterwards, he held <U+017F>ecret intelligence and corre<U+017F>pondency with all <U+017F>uch, as he thought fit in<U+017F>truments for the advancement of his de<U+017F>igne: And la<U+017F>tly, re<U+017F>olved to weaken the Forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, that when opportunity <U+017F>erved, he might the more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eize upon him.</p>

At that time, all the world looked at <hi>Rome</hi> with an envious eye, and made it the butt of their Armes: The <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Fruncks,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> in <hi>Gaul;</hi> the <hi>Vandats</hi> and <hi>Almaines</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Anglois</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>Britany;</hi> the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> in <hi>Pannonia;</hi> To be briefe, every part of the whole Empire was <U+017F>o divided, as no part was entire but <hi>Italy.</hi> It fortuned, that <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer it to enjoy more tranquillity, then Its neighbours of the We<U+017F>t; and therefore fell into it with <U+017F>uch a va<U+017F>t number of People, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for <hi>Honorius</hi> to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him; in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to get him out again, he was advi<U+017F>ed to make a Peace with him, upon what termes <U+017F>oever he could get; unto which, he being of ho Warlick di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, but above all things loving tranquillity, he lent a willing ear. Peace then being propounded, it was <U+017F>o prudently managed, that <hi>Alarick</hi> con<U+017F>ented to retire beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> into <U+017F>ome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which were a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him by the Emperour. At which, <hi>Stilicon,</hi> being malecontent, as thinking this agreement prejudiciall to his de<U+017F>ignes, he <U+017F>o tampered with an Officer, then in pay under the Emperour, that he procured him to charge <U+017F>ome of <hi>Alarick</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they were marching away without any mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t: At which, <hi>Alarick</hi> was <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Honorius,</hi> that he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> be<U+017F>ieged it, and, at the end of two years, took it, and entirely <U+017F>acked it: Although <hi>Honorius,</hi> to make it appear, that he never con<U+017F>ented unto this perfidie, did put the Traitor <hi>Stilicon</hi> to death, as <U+017F>oon as ever he heard, that he was the author of it. Thus this ambitious man came to a mi<U+017F>erable end, but not before he had put all <hi>Italy</hi> into a mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable flame: For <hi>Alarick,</hi> after he had plundered and burned this great City, and not yet loadned with <U+017F>pil, he pillaged all the Country about it, and laid it <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly wa<U+017F>te, as would have moved any Barbarian unto pitty. But that which was mo<U+017F>t deplorable, be<U+017F>ides the ruine of <U+017F>o many Temples, and the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>o many rarities, with which the Emperours had erected and adorned this City, was the mi<U+017F>erable fortune which befell this wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, who through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e of a Brother, was de<U+017F>titute of all <U+017F>uccour. She, who by extraction was Daughter unto the <hi>Ce<U+017F>ars,</hi> and Si<U+017F>ter unto two Emperours, was, through the fault of another, a Captive in the hands of the<U+017F>e Barbarians, her Country burned, the Temples prophaned, and <U+017F>he in danger to lo<U+017F>e her life, or, that which was more deer unto her; had not <hi>Ataul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Alarick</hi>'s blood, been taken with her beauty and vertue, and thought her worthy to be his Wife. But this Prince, <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o fair and <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e, and knowing her to be Daughter to the great <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> he fell <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with her, that he courted her in Marriage; and pre<U+017F>ently after, by <hi>Alaricks</hi> con<U+017F>ent, did marry her. You may imagine, what force this wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e did u<U+017F>e upon her <U+017F>elfe, before <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented unto this Marriage and Alliance, and how prudent <U+017F>he had need to be, in behaving her <U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a rude and barbarous people, <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>ely as <U+017F>he did; god did in this make it appear, that he had pitty upon mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Rome;</hi> for, had it not been for this Alliance, it had been utterly ruined for ever. For it <U+017F>o fel out, that <hi>Alarick</hi> dyed at <hi>Cor<U+017F>ien<U+017F>es,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Ataulfus</hi> was by the common voice of the Army cho<U+017F>en King. If you look upon that Piece next unto <hi>Placidias,</hi> you will imagine him to be a <U+017F>terne and <U+017F>alvage per<U+017F>on, more delighted in blood and war, then peace; and he had no <U+017F>ooner gotten the ab<U+017F>olute power, but he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> with a de<U+017F>igne to burne and utterly demoli<U+017F>h it, thinking, that as long as the Walls of this Town <U+017F>tood, there would be <U+017F>till a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; which name was <U+017F>o odious unto him, that he would ab<U+017F>olutely de<U+017F>troy the very memory of it. When this prudent Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e under<U+017F>tood his intention, <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olved to do all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could to prevent him, the utter ruine of her Country wounding her to the very <U+017F>oul. At the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>welled with abundance of griefe and <U+017F>orrow, tears did abundantly flow from her fair eyes, <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed her re<U+017F>t and meat, and never cea<U+017F>ed tormenting her <U+017F>elfe, but when <hi>Ataulfus</hi> was by her, and then <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained her <U+017F>elfe to put as good a face upon it as <U+017F>he could. This Prince, who loved her <U+017F>o well as to marry her, could not long endure to <U+017F>ee her live thus, but he mu<U+017F>t needs aske her the cau<U+017F>e of her di<U+017F>contents; unto which <U+017F>he made this an<U+017F>wer; I have done all that I po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could O great King, to hide my exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive <U+017F>orrowes from you, fearing I <U+017F>hould but the more vex and trouble you with them: but, <U+017F>ince nature will not permit me to conceal the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my <U+017F>oul any longer, and <U+017F>ince the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Ataulfus</hi> unto the wretched <hi>Placidia</hi> is <U+017F>uch, as to ask me; I do mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you, take it not ill, if I <U+017F>hed my tears in lieu of my blood, for my Country's <U+017F>ad de<U+017F>olation; and if, to <U+017F>top the ruine of it, I could effect it, I would much more willingly <U+017F>hed my blood then my tears. My Country, Oh great Sir, my native Country that gave me breath, it bleeds, and it is ready to bleed

to death; and can you think, I would not mo<U+017F>t willingly part with my life to <U+017F>top the wounds' Alas, it would be better imployed that way, then in your <U+017F>ervice. Since you are plea<U+017F>ed to do me <U+017F>o great a favour, as to aske me the cau<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>orrowes, I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave in all humility to aske you, What advantage will the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> be unto you? Does the riches and the trea<U+017F>ures of it, invite you to it? Surely tho<U+017F>e are things too low, and unworthy of your high courage; be<U+017F>ides, tho<U+017F>e are things that cannot be expected out of an already ruined and plundered Country, or a demoli<U+017F>hed and halfe burned Towne, which hath been already ravaged by a va<U+017F>t Army: Is it any glory that you expect to get by it? I cannot believe it; for, what glory can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto that, which you have already; or, what hopes is there to get, in ruining tho<U+017F>e Walls, which are already demoli<U+017F>hed; in ma<U+017F><U+017F>acring a naked and di<U+017F>armed people, who cannot be brought into greater <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion then they are? If it be a <U+017F>hame to wound a dying man, what honour can you expect, in giving fre<U+017F>h wounds unto a dying people? If you think to <U+017F>trengthen your Dominion by it, be plea<U+017F>ed, Oh great Sir, to let me tell you, that it would be mo<U+017F>t horrid cruelty to do it, by exterminating all the people of <hi>Italy.</hi> Should you put them all to the <U+017F>word, you would be in le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ecurity then you are; for, you would thereby incen<U+017F>e and rai<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t you, the Armes of all <hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> of all <hi>Affrica,</hi> and of all the re<U+017F>t of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof <hi>Italy</hi> is but a poor pittance. Judge, great King, what likelyhood there is, that you, or any human upon earth, <U+017F>hould with<U+017F>tand <U+017F>o many Provinces, conquer <U+017F>o many Kings, and get to him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o many Worlds, for <U+017F>o may the Kingdomes and va<U+017F>t extent of the Roman Empire be called; <U+017F>o as the ruine of <hi>Italy</hi> will bring upon you the hatred of god and man: Men will revenge the wrong, done unto the capitall City upon earth; the gods will be offended at the ruine of that Towne, which is the miracle of the world, and which they have rai<U+017F>ed to that height, to plea<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h men.</p>
               <p>If you will but be plea<U+017F>ed, to take all the<U+017F>e things into your wi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you will finde it much better, to make your <U+017F>elfe friends, and to oblige my two Brothers and their Empires, confirming, by a good corre<U+017F>pondency with them, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance which is already betwixt you. Why, Sir, did you honour me, to make me your Wife? Was it, to make my two Brothers your enemies? was it, to ruine my Country? was it, to <U+017F>ee my friends and kindred carried away Captive into a <U+017F>trange Country? Oh! What a <U+017F>ad and fatall marriage was this unto me? Had it not been much better for me, that the fir<U+017F>t day the Towne was taken, had been the la<U+017F>t of my life? Upon this, that wi<U+017F>e and prudent Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e fell down all tears at the feet of <hi>Ataulfus,</hi> and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed them, with <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighes and groanes, as the Kings pitty did <U+017F>urmount the cruelty of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <U+017F>o as he took her up, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, and <U+017F>aid unto her: Cea<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>e, all your tears and <U+017F>ighes, my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Placidia,</hi> I do freely give unto you, your City and Country; and to make it appear, how much I do de<U+017F>ire your contentment, I do vow and <U+017F>wear by the <U+017F>oul of my dead Father, that I will never turne my armes again<U+017F>t any of your Brothers, who<U+017F>e friend<U+017F>hip and amity, for your <U+017F>ake, I will by all waies court.</p>
               <p>The King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> thus mollified and vanqui<U+017F>hed, he concluded a Peace with <hi>Honorius,</hi> and went out of <hi>Italy</hi> into tho<U+017F>e Provinces, which were agreed by <hi>Alarick</hi> his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or, he <U+017F>hould have. But his people, who were of a martiall temper, and had lived many years in Armes, they could not endure to hear upon any tearmes of Peace; and therefore by a publick <U+017F>edition, did put him to death.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Placidia</hi> in no le<U+017F><U+017F>e danger, then at the taking of <hi>Rome;</hi> for a popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult is like a torrent, that carries away all that will <U+017F>top its fury; Yet, this wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, who fore<U+017F>aw <U+017F>uch a danger long beforehand, <U+017F>he obliged the prime Officers in the Army, by all the good offices that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could imagine; and indeed, as long as <U+017F>he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t them, <U+017F>he was honoured and loved more then ever any Queen was.</p>
               <p>This generous <U+017F>pirit did not <U+017F>hrink from her zeal and love unto her Country and her Brothers, in the lea<U+017F>t manner, by the death of her Husband; but, after <U+017F>he had a while la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her <U+017F>ad mi<U+017F>hap, <U+017F>he tran<U+017F>acted the matter <U+017F>o, that a Grandee Prince among<U+017F>t the <hi>Gothes,</hi> of who<U+017F>e amity <U+017F>he was well affored, was cho<U+017F>en King, his name was <hi>Segerick.</hi> This new King acknowledging his obligations unto <hi>Placidia,</hi> and thinking the amity of the Roman Emperours very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, for the e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hment of his Crowne, he <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o affectionate unto it and her, as he procured unto him<U+017F>elfe the odium of the Army, who pre<U+017F>ently after did murder him, as they had done before <hi>Ataulfus.</hi> But this generous Queen, who could never be daunted by any misfortue, nor weary with any

paines for the good and <U+017F>ecurity of the Empire, <U+017F>he brought it <U+017F>o to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that <hi>Vulius</hi> was cho<U+017F>en King. This <hi>Vulius</hi> was a great and a wi<U+017F>e Commander, who having before his eyes the example of two Kings his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, he re<U+017F>olved by prudence to avoyd the like end<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> At his fir<U+017F>t comming to his Crowne, therefore, he made a <U+017F>hew as if he were a profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed enemy unto the Empire, made great preparations again<U+017F>t it, and faining to be farre out with the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> he <U+017F>ent to denounce warre again<U+017F>t her Brother. Who being adverti<U+017F>ed underhand by his Si<U+017F>ter, he <U+017F>pread abroad reports of a pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Army, which he would rai<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <U+017F>o frighted the<U+017F>e Barbarians by the aide of <hi>Vulius,</hi> that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion the people demanded peace; which was concluded to the great contentment of <hi>Placidia.</hi> Who now <U+017F>eeing the Empire <U+017F>etled, and <U+017F>ecured on that <U+017F>ide, de<U+017F>ired to be out of their hands, and went into <hi>Italy.</hi> Where <U+017F>he was received by her Brother, and the people, as if <U+017F>he had been a great Generall, unto whom the tryumph belonged. It <U+017F>eemes now fortune was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of tormenting this wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F>s: And <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o beloved and honoured by every one e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Honorius</hi> him<U+017F>elfe, as remembring the cares and paines <U+017F>he had taken in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire from the Tyrannique Arms of the <hi>Goths;</hi> and how much both he and all <hi>Europe</hi> was beholding to her: They re<U+017F>olved <U+017F>eeing he had no Children, to marry her unto one whom he would allie unto the Empire, to the end <U+017F>he might after him, be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e Dominions, which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o long and <U+017F>o prudently pre<U+017F>erved.</p>
               <p>In order unto this de<U+017F>igne he look't upon one of the greate<U+017F>t Captaines in all the Armie, who<U+017F>e valour, and wi<U+017F>e conduct did render him mo<U+017F>t worthy of a great command: his name was <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius;</hi> a man of a very antlent Familiy, and high vertue: His Picture is next unto that of <hi>Placidia,</hi> in who<U+017F>e a<U+017F>pect you may ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch a grandure of <U+017F>pirit and corrage as is not commone. And indeed he was one of the greate<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>onages, that the Empire had a long time before. This was he, unto whom <hi>Honorius</hi> gave his Si<U+017F>ter: And at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>ent him into <hi>Spaine</hi> with a great Armie again<U+017F>t the <hi>Almaines,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>Vandals.</hi> The good King <hi>Vulius,</hi> hearing that <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius</hi> was hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> he a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him with all his forces, and followed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe in per<U+017F>on. This was the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius</hi> at his returne gave <hi>Aquitaine</hi> unto the <U+017F>aid <hi>Vulius,</hi> where he lived quietly and in good core<U+017F>pondency with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius</hi> got the better of the <hi>Almanes,</hi> killed their King called <hi>Acatius</hi> and afterwards vanqui<U+017F>hed the <hi>Swedes.</hi> And doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e the <hi>Vandals</hi> had been driven out but for the revolt which <hi>Attalus</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed in <hi>Rome,</hi> intending to declare him<U+017F>elfe Emperor, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Honorius</hi> had no Children, nor had named any <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>or For <hi>Con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> leaving his Enterpri<U+017F>e in <hi>Spaine</hi> unperfect, he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <U+017F>eizing upon the rebell he confined him<U+017F>elfe unto the <hi>Hippodrome:</hi> At which <hi>Honorius</hi> was <U+017F>o well plea<U+017F>ed that he made him his a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate, and declared him <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> Fortune who commonly <U+017F>econds one favour with another; did <U+017F>o by <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius:</hi> So as now behold him a conquerer in <hi>Spaine,</hi> Tryumphant at <hi>Rome,</hi> and an A<U+017F><U+017F>ociate in the <hi>Empire.</hi> One great favour more <U+017F>he added unto all the<U+017F>e which was not inferiour to any of the precedent: And gave him two children by his deare<U+017F>t and <U+017F>o highly beloved <hi>Placidia,</hi> the one called <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> and the other <hi>Honoriques</hi> of whom I have been very curious in getting their pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures.

               </p>
               <p>Now behold <hi>Placidia</hi> and <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius</hi> at the highe<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep of their felicity. But it <U+017F>eems fortune had onely made truce with this wi<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, not a la<U+017F>ting peace. For when her husband had prepared a formidable army, to reduce <hi>Spaine</hi> entirely unto the Empire, he fell <U+017F>ick of a violent di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and a few dayes after dyed. All the comforts that this wi<U+017F>e Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e now had, was in the lamentations and love of the whole Empire: And al<U+017F>o in the two Children, which her husband had left her, whom <U+017F>he educated with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care.</p>
               <p>There was at that time a very wi<U+017F>e and valiant Captaine in the army who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Aetius,</hi> Sonne unto the great <hi>Gaudentius</hi> who was <U+017F>laine in <hi>Gaule.</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I am very partiall towards him: for having made long warre in the neighbor Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we never received any harme by him, or his Army. But on the contrary, I have known him, <U+017F>o careful for our pre<U+017F>ervation, that indeed all the <hi>Gaules</hi> are obliged unto him I was therefore very carefull in getting his Picture which I have placed next that of <hi>Attilia,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it was he who held this <U+017F>courge of god from the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Ob<U+017F>erve in his Aquiline

no<U+017F>e his Genero<U+017F>ity: in his large forehead full of wrinkles, his Prudence: and his quick and <U+017F>parkling eyes, his Vigilance and Celerity. Indeed he was one of the mo<U+017F>t prudent, and mo<U+017F>t valiant men of his time: he could fore<U+017F>ee things, before there was any <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of appearance unto others; he was infinitly courteous: and <U+017F>o liberall, as in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Alexander</hi> he re<U+017F>erved nothing to him<U+017F>elfe but Hope. This was he who was made choice of, by <hi>Honorius</hi> to pro<U+017F>ecute the Enterpri<U+017F>e in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in whom the advice of <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> had a great <U+017F>troake. But how mi<U+017F>erable is the man that lives by the opinion of others! for if he have no reputation, he is <U+017F>corned: and if he have reputation, and do not pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an<U+017F>were that opinion which men have of him, he is <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected too light in the ballance. And the wor<U+017F>t is when he meets with <U+017F>uch as have no experience. It was the misfortune of this great per<U+017F>on, who thinking to go into <hi>Spaine</hi> without any <U+017F>tay in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he was much deceived: For finding the <hi>Burgundians</hi> ready to <U+017F>eize upon the Country of the <hi>Heduois</hi> and <hi>Seguanois:</hi> and that the <hi>Frankes</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Pharamond</hi> their King had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the <hi>Rhine</hi> and would quarter in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he was forced by this at home, to make head again<U+017F>t them, before he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed any further; which he did, <U+017F>o happily, that he <U+017F>ent back the <hi>Burgundians</hi> to the place from whence they came; and forced back the <hi>Franks</hi> over the <hi>Rhine</hi> where they <U+017F>tayed: yet not without many dangerous skirmi<U+017F>hes, as you may imagine. For the <hi>rankes,</hi> of all the Northerne people are the mo<U+017F>t hardy and warlick, and have a great conformitie with the <hi>Gaules,</hi> both in their Lawes, Policies, and Religion: which argues that formerly theywere all but one people and that the <hi>Franks</hi> originally were <hi>Gaules.</hi> But however, <hi>Pharamond</hi> went back over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by the prudence and valour of <hi>Aetius</hi> was forced to <U+017F>tay there: Now though <hi>Aetius</hi> was victorious, yet was he <U+017F>o much weakned that when he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed into <hi>Spain,</hi> he found him<U+017F>elfe weaker then tho<U+017F>e he was to undertake, for the <hi>Vandals</hi> fortifying in the <hi>Betique,</hi> under the the conduct of <hi>Gen<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> were growne very pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant. The <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Almaines</hi> entered into <hi>Meridea,</hi> and there quartered: And the <hi>Gothes</hi> after the Death of <hi>Vualius</hi> having lo<U+017F>t all good will unto the Romane Empire, and not contented nor contianing them<U+017F>elves within their limits in <hi>Aquitaine;</hi> they enlarged them in <hi>Spain,</hi> <U+017F>o as what the <hi>Romans</hi> had, was the lea<U+017F>t part: Which con<U+017F>trained this great Captaine, <U+017F>eeing his enemies <U+017F>tronger then him<U+017F>elfe, to u<U+017F>e prudence more then the <U+017F>word, and to make them enemies among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves: <U+017F>o as he thought it mo<U+017F>t expedient to temporize with them till he e<U+017F>pied his advantage, and to run no hazards in the meane time.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aetius</hi> having already cha<U+017F>ed the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> away, <hi>Honorius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that as <U+017F>oon as he was arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently heare newes of the defeat of the <hi>Vandals, Swedes, Almaines;</hi> and <hi>Goths:</hi> And <U+017F>eeing the newes was long in comming, he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected him, and had an opinion that he was <U+017F>lack in his enterpri<U+017F>es. This Prince was timerous and having never been in armes, he was ignorant in matters of warre: So as he knew nothing by <U+017F>ight, but mea<U+017F>ured every thing by the happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of the great <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> and <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius:</hi> In <U+017F>o much as mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting <hi>Aetius,</hi> he called him back, and <U+017F>ent <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> in his roome.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> was a great freind of <hi>Aetius:</hi> And therefore the affaires of the Empire went the better, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Aetius</hi> gave him the be<U+017F>t in<U+017F>tructions that he could, opening unto him all their de<U+017F>ignes and the meanes to put them in execution. In the mean time he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he gave an account of his actions unto <hi>Honorius.</hi> But finding that the Emperour had <U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>ie of him, he retired unto his owne hou<U+017F>e, and lived a private per<U+017F>on afterwards: <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e jealou<U+017F>ies did daily increa<U+017F>e, and that they would que<U+017F>tion him for his life, he was forced to <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elfe in <hi>Pannonia</hi> among<U+017F>t the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> And it it was a very prudent con<U+017F>ideration which moved him to fly unto them rather then any other: For had he gone to the <hi>Franks, Burgundians, Gothes, Vi<U+017F><U+017F>igots</hi> or <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> It might have been <U+017F>aid that the Emperor had ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect him, and that he had held a compliancy with them. But this could not be <U+017F>aid of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they were <U+017F>carcely knowne unto the Romane people. <hi>Placidia</hi> being extreamly angry with her Brother, as well for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Aetius,</hi> as for the bad carriage of every thing el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to retire unto <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople</hi> to her Nephew <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> whither <U+017F>he had gone long before, had not <hi>Arcadius</hi> her Brother, lying upon his death bed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Sonne <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> unto the Protector<U+017F>hip of <hi>I<U+017F>digerdes</hi> King of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians:</hi> &amp; <hi>Parthians.</hi> For though he was his friend and confederate, yet the people had beene long ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Empire, and therefore <U+017F>he did not like that any <U+017F>trangers <U+017F>hould have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Nephew.

This people, who de<U+017F>ired nothing more then changing their cold habitation, hearing of the fertility and riches in <hi>Italy,</hi> they burned with de<U+017F>ire to enter into it. When they had rai<U+017F>ed a va<U+017F>t number of men, and were ready to enter, it <U+017F>eemes, god had <U+017F>ome pitty upon the Empire, and allaid this <U+017F>torme by the death of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius. Aetius,</hi> wi<U+017F>hing no ill unto <hi>Italy,</hi> but only unto <hi>Honorius,</hi> hearing newes of his death, did pre<U+017F>ently change de<U+017F>igne; and told the Barbarians, that it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he <U+017F>hould go fir<U+017F>t unto <hi>Rome,</hi> to <U+017F>ee how things <U+017F>tood, and what Forces they had. They pre<U+017F>ently approved of what he <U+017F>aid, and promi<U+017F>ed him all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible reliefe and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. He returned therefore in confidence of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> his friend<U+017F>hip, with a de<U+017F>igne to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe Emperour; but finding the faction of <hi>Honorius</hi> to be very great, and <U+017F>tanding in fear of a great Captain, called <hi>Boniface,</hi> who had the command of the <hi>Affrican</hi> Forces, but much more of the young Emperour <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> he thought it better to put it upon one <hi>John,</hi> who was the principall Secretary unto <hi>Honorius,</hi> with whom he ever had good corre<U+017F>pondency; therefore he made him to take the title of Emperor upon him, and under his name ordered and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of all things: and certainly, he <U+017F>hewed a great deal of prudence in it; for, <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> not approving of this <hi>John,</hi> declared <hi>Valentinian,</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en-german, the Emperour of the We<U+017F>t: And knowing, that the Sword was the be<U+017F>t prop of the Scepter, he rai<U+017F>ed a very great Army, and <U+017F>ent it into <hi>Italy,</hi> under the conduct of a very experienced Souldier, called <hi>Artabures;</hi> and this Souldier made his knowledge in martiall matters, very well appear unto <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus:</hi> Yet, the Sea was <U+017F>o contrary to his de<U+017F>ignes, that a <U+017F>torme ca<U+017F>t him upon the coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the re<U+017F>t of his Fleet was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>ed into <U+017F>everall places: But <hi>A<U+017F>par,</hi> the Son of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who accompanied his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this expedition, being by fortune not in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hip: when the <U+017F>torm was over and heard of his Fathers fortune, he rallied together all the Fleet that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, and landing in the night, entred <hi>Ravenna</hi> with all his Forces, through the negligence of the Guardes; and when day was come, he took <hi>John,</hi> cut off his head immediately, and delivered his Father.</p>
               <p>The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia</hi> came to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> with the young Emperour her Son, almo<U+017F>t at

               </p>
               <p>In this occa<U+017F>ion, this great Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hewed her <U+017F>elfe, to be of a mo<U+017F>t generous and prudent <U+017F>pirit; for, in lieu of taking revenge upon the<U+017F>e two great per<U+017F>ons, by putting them to death, <U+017F>he thought, it would be a greater advantage unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> if <U+017F>he could make them his faithfull Servants. As for <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus,</hi> <U+017F>he did not much care for him, <U+017F>o as perhaps <U+017F>he would have handled him more roughly, had it not been in con<U+017F>ideration of his friend <hi>Aetius,</hi> who<U+017F>e judgment, experience, and valour, <U+017F>he knew, and thought would be very u<U+017F>efull unto her Son, by rea<U+017F>on of the great reputation he had with the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> who, at his in<U+017F>tigation, had made great preparations to enter into <hi>Italy,</hi> and were already upon their March. Moreover, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered that <hi>Honorius,</hi> by his <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions of him, had given him ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to leave his <U+017F>ervic<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> and therefore, to <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elfe, he went among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e Barbarians, who<U+017F>e Forces, <U+017F>he feared, might infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely impede the event of her Son's Empire.</p>
               <p>All the<U+017F>e things therefore well con<U+017F>idered, <U+017F>he thought that if <U+017F>he did puni<U+017F>h <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould extreamly offend <hi>Aetius,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the amity betwixt them; and therefore, in keeping <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> in <U+017F>afetie, <U+017F>he conceived it would keep the other the more unto his duty, almo<U+017F>t forcing him unto it, to <U+017F>ave the life of his friend. In this re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he put <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> a Pri<U+017F>oner into the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> from whence a few daies after <U+017F>he relea<U+017F>ed him, purpo<U+017F>ely to oblige <hi>Aetius</hi> the more, unto whom, in the mean time, <U+017F>he gave liberty, and in lieu of puni<U+017F>hment, conferred favours upon him, excu<U+017F>ing all he had done upon the ill grounded jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Honorius</hi> She procured <hi>Valentinian</hi> to <U+017F>end him generall into <hi>Gaul,</hi> again<U+017F>t <U+017F>everall Nations that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed it. Before he went, in proof of his fidelity, he tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted <U+017F>o with the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> that when they had <U+017F>et foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> they returned back, and went into <hi>Pannonia.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as he came into <hi>Gaul,</hi> he rai<U+017F>ed the Siege of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilla,</hi> which <hi>Thierry,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vualius,</hi> the good friend unto the Empire, had <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and relieved the place, when it was reduced unto great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. Afterwards, making head again<U+017F>t the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> he driv them back unto the limits, unto which the Emperour had confined them. As for the <hi>Francks,</hi> though he could not at that time keep them from making <U+017F>ome progre<U+017F><U+017F>e under their King <hi>Clodion,</hi> yet, he kept them out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> <U+017F>o as they got nothing on that <U+017F>ide the <hi>Rheine.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Britaines</hi> were not able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the <hi>Picts,</hi> though the <hi>Romans</hi> had made there a <U+017F>trong Rampart, in form of a Wall to defend the <hi>Brittaines</hi> from the incur<U+017F>ions of their neighbour-people and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he <U+017F>ent <hi>Galucon</hi> thither, with a Legion which was then in <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>Hitherto all things went according to the wi<U+017F>h of the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> and the Emperour her Son: But <hi>Boniface</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t, who ruining him<U+017F>elfe, made them be of the lo<U+017F>ing hand, both in <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> This <hi>Boniface</hi> was Governour in <hi>Affrica,</hi> who was an inveterate hater of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus,</hi> and by con<U+017F>equence of <hi>Aetius:</hi> He hearing how <hi>Placidia</hi> treated them, and of the great power <U+017F>he had conferred upon <hi>Aetius,</hi> in making him a Patriarch, and in giving him the charge of all <hi>Gaul,</hi> he re<U+017F>olved to withdraw him<U+017F>elfe from under his obedience; and therefore not following his commands, he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order return to <hi>Rome.</hi> At which <hi>Placidia</hi> being offended, <U+017F>he procured <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortius</hi> to be <U+017F>ent thither with a great Army. Some had a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, that this was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of <hi>Aetius,</hi> to ruine him in the opinion of <hi>Placidia</hi> and the Emperour. However it was, <hi>Mahortius</hi> being defeated by <hi>Boniface, Valentinian</hi> <U+017F>ent <hi>Si<U+017F>ulphus</hi> thither, who<U+017F>e Picture you may <U+017F>ee next that of <hi>Valentinian</hi> I was very de<U+017F>irous to have it, as well for his valour and prudence, as for his con<U+017F>tant fidelity unto his Ma<U+017F>ter, conceiving that his excellent qualities, rendred him worthy to be placed among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many illu<U+017F>trious per<U+017F>ons. This <hi>Si<U+017F>ulphus,</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eized upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> and forced <hi>Boniface</hi> to fly into <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,</hi> where finding no <U+017F>afety for him<U+017F>elfe, he called in <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> who then was in the <hi>Betique.</hi> This <hi>Vandal</hi> was very glad to come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Goths,</hi> under <hi>Thierry</hi> their King, having not room enough for them<U+017F>elves, did <U+017F>o

pre<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and tormented them, that they were not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. When <hi>Boniface</hi> offered <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> to <U+017F>hare <hi>Affrica</hi> with him, he was reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as he knew not which way to turn him<U+017F>elfe; but he took that part which <hi>Boniface</hi> pre<U+017F>ented unto him. He left the <hi>Betique,</hi> which was ever <U+017F>ince called <hi>Vandalu<U+017F>ia,</hi> and went into <hi>Affrica</hi> with his Wife and Children; but he learned from <hi>Boniface,</hi> what it was to tru<U+017F>t unto <hi>Barbarians;</hi> for, as <U+017F>oon as he came unto <hi>Affrica,</hi> he <U+017F>eized upon <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and confined poor <hi>Boniface</hi> unto the inacce<U+017F><U+017F>able Mountains; afterwards, he made his peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon condition, he might keep what he had gotten from <hi>Boniface. Valentinian</hi> willingly con<U+017F>ented unto it; and thinking, that all the re<U+017F>t of <hi>Affrica</hi> was <U+017F>ecured unto him, by this new Peace made with this <hi>Vandal,</hi> he called the valiant <hi>Si<U+017F>ulphus</hi> from <hi>Carthage,</hi> to employ him in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gaul.</hi> But <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> kept his word no better with him, then he had done with <hi>Boniface;</hi> for, <hi>Si<U+017F>ulphus</hi> was no <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Italy</hi> with all his Forces, but the <hi>Vandal</hi> <U+017F>eized upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> and drove the <hi>Romans</hi> quite out of <hi>Affrica;</hi> <U+017F>o as this great City was <U+017F>eparated from the Empire, untill the valiant <hi>Scipio</hi> reduced it unto the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>At that time, there lived in an Affrican Towne called <hi>Iponne,</hi> a great and vertuous per<U+017F>on named <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine,</hi> a very friend unto <hi>Boniface</hi> and one that adored only one god; and though he did differ from the Religion that we profe<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet was he much neerer it, then the antient <hi>Romans;</hi> for, he offered <U+017F>acrifices of Bread and Wine as we do, and would not upon any termes admit of any plurality of gods; but above all, he reverenced the Virgin who was to have a Child, unto whom we have for many ages dedicated an Altar in the Carnutan Mono<U+017F>tarie. But to return unto our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. It <U+017F>eemes, that at that time it plea<U+017F>ed the great god to change the people of one Country into another, and to make great revolutions, e<U+017F>pecially in <hi>Europe:</hi> For, the raigne of the <hi>Vandals</hi> begun to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in <hi>Affrica,</hi> the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> for as <U+017F>oon as the <hi>Vandals</hi> were gone, they planted them<U+017F>elves there. The <hi>Anglois</hi> <U+017F>eated them<U+017F>elves in <hi>Brittain,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Galicia</hi> being called away by the Emperour, to be <U+017F>ent into <hi>Affrica,</hi> the <hi>Picts</hi> did <U+017F>o torment that Kingdome, that the <hi>Brittaines</hi> were forced to call the <hi>Anglois</hi> to their aid, who ever <U+017F>ince rendred them<U+017F>elves Ma<U+017F>ters of it. The <hi>Francks,</hi> under <hi>Clodion</hi> and afterwards <hi>Merovius,</hi> did plant them<U+017F>elves where now they are. Thus, wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards, do the heavens when they plea<U+017F>e, make revolutions, changes, and alterations in Kingdomes and Dominions.</p>
               <p>Now the wi<U+017F>e and prudent <hi>Placidia,</hi> being grown into great years, and having had great experience of fortune's variety, <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elfe unable to <U+017F>upport that great weight of affairs which <U+017F>he fore<U+017F>aw would fall upon <hi>Valentinian,</hi> <U+017F>he did extreamly de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him married, as it had been long before re<U+017F>olved upon, unto the Daughter of her Nephew <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> who ever had the <U+017F>ame intention. And things were <U+017F>o managed, that <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> went unto <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople,</hi> where the Marriage was <U+017F>olemnized, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment both of <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> and <hi>Placidia;</hi> of <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> becau<U+017F>e his Daughter was to be an Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, which he mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ired; and of <hi>Placidia,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he conceived, this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would be a great <U+017F>trength unto her Son again<U+017F>t his enemies, and would oblige <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odo<U+017F>ius</hi> to help him upon all occa<U+017F>ions, as he did, before her Son returned from <hi>Con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> for, he <U+017F>ent with his Daughter <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> a great Army, to be employed which way <U+017F>oever <hi>Valentinian</hi> plea<U+017F>ed.</p>

However, we may conclude her happy, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he dyed at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Mother unto an Emperour, who loved and honoured her, and infinitely lamented throughout all the Empire; for <U+017F>he dyed, pre<U+017F>ently after her Son was returned into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Wife.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Adamas</hi> ended his <hi>di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,</hi> which cau<U+017F>ed all the company to fix their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Picture of this great Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, con<U+017F>idering every lineament of her face, and admiring her vertue. But <hi>Alexis</hi> remembring what <hi>Silvander</hi> had <U+017F>aid, concerning the fair <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> and de<U+017F>irous to know, whether he had heard a relation of the <U+017F>tory, as <U+017F>he had, from the mouth of <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> which <U+017F>he had begun to relate unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> when <hi>Adamas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted them, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired that Nymph in a low voice, to put <hi>Silvander</hi> in minde of his promi<U+017F>e. But it was <U+017F>o late, that <hi>Adamas</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer the old <U+017F>hepheards to go away
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53526:201"/>
untill the next morning. <hi>Leonida</hi> de<U+017F>iring to plea<U+017F>e <hi>Alexis</hi> in all things po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and very de<U+017F>irous al<U+017F>o to hear the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>ummoned him to the performance of his promi<U+017F>e. He offering to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe, becau<U+017F>e it was late, <hi>Adamas</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that this <U+017F>hould be no excu<U+017F>e for him for he would not <U+017F>uffer them to go away that night. <hi>Diamis, Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Tircis,</hi> made <U+017F>ome dorre at it; but <hi>Hylas</hi> was very forward to accept of his invitation, <U+017F>aying, Let tho<U+017F>e that will go, go, and tho<U+017F>e that will <U+017F>tay, <U+017F>tay; for his part, he was all for the <U+017F>tayers, and would with all his heart <U+017F>tay, as long as <hi>Alexis</hi> was there.
<hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>miled at this and after thanks, he <U+017F>o intreated all the re<U+017F>t, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible they <U+017F>hould deny him, therefore all <U+017F>itting down, <hi>Silvander</hi> began thus</p>
               <p>Since it is your de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> and you, great Nymph, that I <U+017F>hould relate the fortune of the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> be plea<U+017F>ed to give leave, that I tell you, how I came to know it, and from whom I heard it, to the end, you may give the more credit unto the relation. Now, though you <U+017F>ee me in a <U+017F>hepheards habit, and though I have long had the charge of a little Flock, where the<U+017F>e <U+017F>age <U+017F>hepheards do dwell; yet for all that, I am not this Country-man, nor was I brought up a <U+017F>hepheard; but on the contrary, <U+017F>uch indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care was had of my education, that to render me the better accompli<U+017F>hed, I was brought up in the be<U+017F>t Exerci<U+017F>es and Arts, that Youth could be employed in; <U+017F>o as if I did not much benefit my <U+017F>elfe and my under<U+017F>tanding, it was long only of my dull capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. To this end therefore, I was <U+017F>ent unto the <hi>Phocen<U+017F>ian</hi> and <hi>Ma<U+017F>silian</hi> Schooles, where I <U+017F>pent much time in <U+017F>tudy; and there being much good company, we u<U+017F>ed many exerci<U+017F>es for recreations <U+017F>ake, in the intervalls of our <U+017F>tudies; <U+017F>ometimes we <U+017F>hould go upon the Sea, <U+017F>ometimes play upon the Lute, <U+017F>ometimes Run, Leap, and Pitch the Bar, or <U+017F>ome other recreation to keep us from idlene<U+017F><U+017F>e, which is the ru<U+017F>t of Life and Mother of all Vice.</p>
               <p>It hapned in Summer time, that five or <U+017F>ix of us in company, after we had wearied our <U+017F>elves with the Book, we went to bathe our <U+017F>elves; and to that end, went out of the Towne towards <hi>Liguria,</hi> unto the point of a Rock, which <U+017F>hot it <U+017F>elfe into the Sea, from whence we were accu<U+017F>tomed to leap with head formo<U+017F>t into the water, and <U+017F>hould oft times touch the bottome with our hands. At this time, being upon this Rock, and undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing our <U+017F>elves, we were prevented by a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>torm of Wind and Rain, which was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>econded with Lightning and Thunder; the heavens grew immediately of a dusky colour, and the waves began to ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>o high, that we were hardly <U+017F>afe upon the top of this high Rock, with <U+017F>uch fury and violence did the waves da<U+017F>h again<U+017F>t it. It was terrible to <U+017F>ee, how <U+017F>uddenly the day was turned into night, to hear the <U+017F>trange roaring of the Sea, and to con<U+017F>ider the Chaos and hideous confu<U+017F>ion of this raging Element; and certainly, this blu<U+017F>tering <U+017F>torme had forced us away, if <U+017F>ome good Genius had not <U+017F>tayed us: We did imagine, that many <U+017F>hips would <U+017F>uffer much dammage by it; and becau<U+017F>e the winde did blow towards us, we re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay till the <U+017F>torme was over, to <U+017F>ee, if by fortune we could be helpfull unto any Sea-beaten pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers, but, to <U+017F>helter us a little from the rain and winde, we crept into a little corner of the Rock, where we were wont to hide our clothes when we bathed our <U+017F>elves. The <U+017F>torme had la<U+017F>ted above two houres, when we begun all to be weary; and when we were upon the point of going away, the sky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cleer up, and it left raining. Then we came out of our Rock, and going up to the top of it, we began to look, whether we could di<U+017F>cover any thing upon the Sea. The winde wafted away all the cloudes, and the Sun began to <U+017F>hine; yet, the waves ceu<U+017F>ed not, becau<U+017F>e the winde continued <U+017F>till as great and high, as any time before. As we were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing among<U+017F>t our <U+017F>elves, upon the boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e of Marriners, e<U+017F>pecially of him that fir<U+017F>t adventured to Sea, how terrible the enraged Sea was, and that a wi<U+017F>e man would never tru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe with it, one of our company, who was more ob<U+017F>ervant of the Sea, then of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: Hold, (<U+017F>aid he) me-thinks I <U+017F>ee a <U+017F>hip. Upon this, we aro<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ee whether what he <U+017F>aid was true. At the fir<U+017F>t, none but him<U+017F>elfe could <U+017F>ee any thing; but pre<U+017F>ently after, <U+017F>omething might be di<U+017F>cerned: The winde was <U+017F>o high, that it wafted the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hips pre<U+017F>ently neerer us, and then every one plainly di<U+017F>cerned them. There was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sailes, nor Ma<U+017F>t nor Tackling to be <U+017F>een, the <U+017F>torm had con<U+017F>trained the Marriners to take them all downe, and nothing made u<U+017F>e of but the Rudder, which was <U+017F>carcely able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Tempe<U+017F>t. The <U+017F>ight was very pittifull, for the winde was <U+017F>o high, as they could not keep them<U+017F>elves from ju<U+017F>tling one again<U+017F>t the other. The cries of tho<U+017F>e that were within, which the winde wafted unto us, was lamentable to hear; they were all on the Deck, upon their knees, holding up their hands to heaven: Mo<U+017F>t of them, <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>hore,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53526:201"/>
were undre<U+017F>t, hoping, if the <U+017F>hip came any neerer, to <U+017F>ave them<U+017F>elves by <U+017F>wimming. As for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, a boy<U+017F>terous wave da<U+017F>hed them again<U+017F>t our Rock; the great ru<U+017F>h which the fir<U+017F>t gave again<U+017F>t it, made it recoil back with <U+017F>uch a violence, as meeting with another which followed it, it broke a great part of the Poop and Prow of the other; and when the Sea was ready to <U+017F>wallow them up, another wave came, which da<U+017F>hed them with <U+017F>o great a force again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame Rock, as the <U+017F>hips were quite overwhelmed: Oh god, what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable <U+017F>pectacle was this! Some laid hold upon the points of the Rock, and <U+017F>trove to get footing, till <U+017F>ome help came; others <U+017F>eized upon the roots, which grew in the Rock, and <U+017F>o hung by the armes; and <U+017F>ome, who had laid hold of <U+017F>uch roots, they breaking both fell into the Sea, till the waves brought them back; <U+017F>ome got upon boards and poles, and <U+017F>uch like, but mo<U+017F>t were drowned. That which moved mo<U+017F>t compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, was to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome women, who had no other help for them<U+017F>elves, but their cries. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, this moved me <U+017F>o much, as being halfe undre<U+017F>t, I ha<U+017F>ted to <U+017F>trip my <U+017F>elfe naked; and though the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was great, by rea<U+017F>on of the windes and waves, I would do that to relieve them, which I had often done for my plea<U+017F>ure, I leaped from the Rock into the Sea; and being in the water, I <U+017F>aw two women embracing each other, ready to <U+017F>inke; I took one by the hair, and <U+017F>wimming with my other hand, I drew them both a<U+017F>hore, where leaving them halfe dead, I went again into the water, to help two men, who<U+017F>e amity moved me to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for one of them, who could <U+017F>wim, had got the other upon his back to <U+017F>ave him; but his load was <U+017F>o heavy, or el<U+017F>e he that was upmo<U+017F>t, who was younger then the other, did hang <U+017F>o about the neck of his friend, for fear of drowning, as he having neither <U+017F>trength nor breath left, had already <U+017F>unk two or three times into the water: I took him that could not <U+017F>wim by one hand, <U+017F>o as ea<U+017F>ing the other, he took heart, <U+017F>o as we got to <U+017F>hore. All my Companions, after my example, did the like, <U+017F>o as we <U+017F>aved many of them. And becau<U+017F>e I thought the gods commanded me to have a particular care of tho<U+017F>e, whom I had <U+017F>aved from <U+017F>hipwrack, after I had put on my clothes, I went unto them, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted them all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could; after I had gotten <U+017F>ome of the water which they had <U+017F>wallowed, from them, they began to be rea<U+017F>onable well, e<U+017F>pecially the women, who had been in mo<U+017F>t danger. They thought them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o obliged to us, that they de<U+017F>ired to know our names, and of what Country we were; and when they heard me <U+017F>ay, that I thought my <U+017F>elfe either a <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian</hi> or a <hi>Fore<U+017F>tian:</hi> Oh god, (<U+017F>aid one of them) the men of <U+017F>uch a Country, as one of them, are de<U+017F>tined to recall us from death. I asked them, why they <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <U+017F>eeing it was not a fit time for it, <U+017F>ince they were <U+017F>o amazed with the <U+017F>hipwrack, that they were <U+017F>carce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to breathe, nor do any thing, but hold up their hands, and lift up their eyes, in admiration of their miraculous e<U+017F>cape: And becau<U+017F>e they were almo<U+017F>t all naked, I thought it fit, before I carried them to the Town, to get them <U+017F>ome clothes to cover them, for it had not been decent to have carryed them otherwi<U+017F>e. I went unto the Town, and met with <U+017F>o many per<U+017F>ons, who being very compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, relieved me with cloths for them, as I had relieved them with life; and when I brought them to the Town, they were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in <U+017F>uch Bourghers hou<U+017F>es, as u<U+017F>ed to have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon men in the like ca<U+017F>e. For my part, I defired tho<U+017F>e two whom I had <U+017F>aved, to go with me, becau<U+017F>ed they <U+017F>eemed to be men of merit. We cannot part, <U+017F>aid they, from the<U+017F>e two women whom you have <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both becau<U+017F>e they are committed unto our charge, and becau<U+017F>e perhaps it would be inconvenient for you. Not at all, (<U+017F>aid I unto them) <U+017F>o you will be contented with the littlene<U+017F><U+017F>e of your lodgings; but it would rather be a great <U+017F>atisfaction unto me, if you would do me the favour. So they all foure followed me. And becau<U+017F>e I had a friend in the Town, who had better lodgings then my <U+017F>elfe, I carried them unto the hou<U+017F>e of a rich Town<U+017F>man with whom I had familiar intimacy, knowing his liberality and pitty to be <U+017F>uch, as he would bid <U+017F>uch men in <U+017F>uch a condition very civilly welcome; and <U+017F>o he did, for he did accommodate them with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. Now you mu<U+017F>t know, that the<U+017F>e men whom I had thus <U+017F>aved, were two principall men in <hi>Rome,</hi> the name of the one was <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> and of the other
<hi>Olimbres;</hi> <U+017F>o as they <U+017F>ent pre<U+017F>ently to their hou<U+017F>es, and furni<U+017F>hed them<U+017F>elves with mony and many <U+017F>ervants. But, in <U+017F>atisfaction of my promi<U+017F>e, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that whil<U+017F>t they expected a return from <hi>Rome,</hi> the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers would not be without me; <U+017F>o as quitting my <U+017F>tudy, I accompanyed them unto all <U+017F>uch places, unto which their curio<U+017F>ity invited them, in which I took much delight, for their conver<U+017F>ation was very <U+017F>weet and plea<U+017F>ing. At the la<U+017F>t, de<U+017F>iring much to know who they were, unto whom I had done <U+017F>o good an office, one night, when I was alone with them in their Chamber, (for the two women commonly retired, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>upper was done) I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53526:202"/>
them to tell me, why they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, when they heard I was a <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian,</hi> that tho<U+017F>e of that Country were de<U+017F>tined to <U+017F>ave them from death? Unto which, the elder of them thus replyed.</p>

               <p>The Emperour <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Uncle <hi>Honorius</hi> had no Children, he re<U+017F>olved to be<U+017F>tow his Daughter upon <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and to make him Emperour of the We<U+017F>t, after the death of <hi>Honorius.</hi> The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> who <U+017F>aw this Match would be advantagious to her Son, <U+017F>he commanded him to apply him<U+017F>elfe as much as he could unto this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e. But <U+017F>ee what con<U+017F>traint in love produceth! <hi>Valentinian</hi> could never love her, though <U+017F>he was the faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world: yet, becau<U+017F>e he would not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> nor his Co<U+017F>en-german, upon whom all his fortunes depended, he di<U+017F><U+017F>embled the matter <U+017F>o, that every one thought him really in love with her.</p>
               <p>I being brought up with this young Prince<U+017F>s, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I did very incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ca<U+017F>t my eye upon her, and fell <U+017F>o fatally in love, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to make a retreat. Should I <U+017F>ay the <U+017F>ight of her was a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me, that hath co<U+017F>t me <U+017F>o much <U+017F>orrow and pain? But why <U+017F>hould I make any doubt in the que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>ince not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding all my paines and <U+017F>orrowes, never was man more happy in <U+017F>uch a generous de<U+017F>igne, then my <U+017F>elfe? So then, I became a <U+017F>ervant unto this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e. And there being then Tournements held in the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> at which <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was pre<U+017F>ent as <hi>Valentinian</hi> entred the Li<U+017F>ts, under the notion &amp; name of the fair <hi>Eudoxe's</hi> Cavalier, it may wel be<U+017F>aid, I did the <U+017F>ame, being <U+017F>o captivated with her beauty and vertue, that never man was more. At the <U+017F>ame time there was a young Lady, of the be<U+017F>t Families in all <hi>Greece,</hi> preferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the young <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> to be brought up with her, her name was <hi>I<U+017F>edore,</hi> and it mu<U+017F>t needs be confe<U+017F>t, that there was none in all the Court (alwaies excepting <hi>Eudoxe)</hi> which was comparable unto her. <hi>Valentinian</hi> no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eye upon her, but he fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently in love with her: But, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o charie of her honour and reputation, as knowing, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> could not marry her, <U+017F>he would not allow of his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e, but at the fir<U+017F>t, did refu<U+017F>e it in as milde a manner as <U+017F>he could; but afterwards, did reject it in a more har<U+017F>h manner, then perhaps the quality of <hi>Valentinian</hi> de<U+017F>erved: And though he was very hot in pur<U+017F>uance of his affection, yet did <U+017F>he behave her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o, as <U+017F>he forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in appearance, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he vowed, that if he continued, <U+017F>he would acquaint <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odo<U+017F>ius</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:53526:202"/>
and <hi>Placidia</hi> with it. This young Prince fearing to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e the Emperour and his Mother, did <U+017F>o conceal his de<U+017F>ires, as none could <U+017F>ee them, except <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and my <U+017F>elfe. In the mean time, my affection <U+017F>till encrea<U+017F>ed, though this young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. The priviledge of my youth permitted me to <U+017F>ee her when I plea<U+017F>ed, without <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, and I was <U+017F>o perpetually a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous and diligent about her per<U+017F>on, as <U+017F>he employed me ofter, then any other of my Companions. And though at that time I hardly knew what Love was, yet I took <U+017F>uch infinite delight in being neer her, in receiving her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <U+017F>erving her, and <U+017F>ometimes ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing the thing which <U+017F>he gave unto me, as <U+017F>he did attribute it unto my civility. I remember, one day as <U+017F>he was walking in a Gallerie, where there was abundance of rare Pictures, there was among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, that of <hi>Icarus,</hi> who<U+017F>e wings failing, fell into the Sea <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) what does the<U+017F>e <U+017F>cattered feathers, and this man falling into the Sea, <U+017F>ignifie? Madam, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) he was a young man, who being inflamed with a generous courage, would not he contented to flie <U+017F>o low as his Father, whom you <U+017F>ee by him; and becau<U+017F>e his wings were <U+017F>et on with wax, the heat of the Sun melted them, <U+017F>o as he was forced to fall, as you <U+017F>ee him. Truly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, he was very ra<U+017F>h and incon<U+017F>iderate. However, replyed I, he was of a mo<U+017F>t ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and noble <U+017F>pirit To what purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he <U+017F>ince it brought him to his death. Death, (an<U+017F>wered I) is very welcome, when it leaves a brave memory behinde it. What! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, do you commend his act? I do <U+017F>o much commend it, Madam, <U+017F>aid I, as I would not refu<U+017F>e to die, upon conditions of the like glory. This Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e was at this time about <U+017F>ome twelve years of age, and I about fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen; an age, yet hardly capable of Love's re<U+017F>entments, and yet I was not ab<U+017F>olutely free; however, I had not <U+017F>o much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to di<U+017F>cover any thing unto her. I perceive, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you do e<U+017F>teem your life but very little. Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) there are many things which I do e<U+017F>teem much more. What! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for when we are once dead, all that we leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us concernes us not. Honour and Love, an<U+017F>wered I. What is this honour, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me? It is an opinion, replyed I, which we do leave of our <U+017F>elves, and of our courage; and Love, is a de<U+017F>ire to enjoy <U+017F>omething, that is great and noble; and therefore, Madam, I <U+017F>hould not refu<U+017F>e to die in any generous acts or in doing you <U+017F>ervice; fir<U+017F>t, for the glory I <U+017F>hould have by it; and <U+017F>econdly, for my affection unto you. How, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, Unto me? like a very childe) have you any love to me? How do you know it? By the effects, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered I; for, when I am out of your <U+017F>ight I burn till I <U+017F>ee you again; and when I do <U+017F>ee you, I am vexed that I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ee you long enough. How did you come by this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) and what is the cau<U+017F>e of it? Your perfections, Madam, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) and your beauty, hath cau<U+017F>ed this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, by <U+017F>taying long with you. Were I as you (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) I would <U+017F>tay as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible could be: but, is there no remedy for the cure of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e? Yes, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) if you plea<U+017F>e to love me as well as I love you. How! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently) would you have me burn when I <U+017F>ee you not? Good <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> look for <U+017F>ome other Receipt, for, believe it you <U+017F>hall not have this. I remember, that when I have burned my finger, I was in <U+017F>o much pain, as I will hardly undergo <U+017F>o much again for your cure. I dur<U+017F>t not reply, becau<U+017F>e there were many Ladies and Knights talking together in the Gallery, and took no notice of us, though they were there to accompany the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e; but her childhood, and my youth, permitted me to be with her without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition.</p>
               <p>But afterwards, <U+017F>he grew more knowing, and I grew more in love then before: <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> who<U+017F>e whole de<U+017F>igne was upon the fair <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> did hold Tournements as oft as he could; for, having a good agility in that exerci<U+017F>e, he thought by that means, to in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate him<U+017F>elfe into the favour of that wi<U+017F>e Lady, <U+017F>till <U+017F>eeming, as if all he did was for <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> Now, becau<U+017F>e he commonly took <U+017F>uch as were of his own age, and there being not above two years difference betwixt him and me, I was alwaies of his party. Fortune it <U+017F>eemes had a minde to favour me, and conferred the Prize very often upon me, which <U+017F>eeming as if it were in behalfe of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> I alwaies carried unto <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and when <U+017F>he received it, <U+017F>he permitted me to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her hand Oh, how well did I think all my pains be<U+017F>towed? Yet, I carried the matter with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cretion, as <U+017F>he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be offended, although <U+017F>he did <U+017F>ometimes remember the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which I had formerly with her; for, conceiving them to be but imprudencies of Infancy, <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by them, thinking that age would better in<U+017F>truct me in my duty. The fir<U+017F>t time that <U+017F>he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was, one day when <U+017F>he was walking in the Emperours Garden; after <U+017F>he had weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her <U+017F>elfe with walking, <U+017F>he <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elfe down in the <U+017F>hade, and fell a<U+017F>leep in the lap of <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi> There was a great knot of young Cavaliers di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing together, not far off the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53526:203"/>
Arbor where <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept, when a Bee, did re<U+017F>t it <U+017F>elfe upon her faire lippe, and after it had <U+017F>uck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a while, it did <U+017F>ting it very much. The paine cau<U+017F>ed her to <U+017F>tart up, and laying her hand upon her paine, <U+017F>he complained again<U+017F>t <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> for the little care which <U+017F>he had off her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> who was walking in the Garden, hearing her cry, and when he was come, <U+017F>eeing her chide <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> he told her, that I had a receipt that would pre<U+017F>ently cure her, and that he had <U+017F>eene the experience of it upon many, and particularly upon my <U+017F>elfe within this two dayes. What will he do? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, he will <U+017F>peake <U+017F>ome certaine words (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Valentinian)</hi> upon the place which is pained, and the paine will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly cea<U+017F>e: Then <U+017F>he asked me, whether it was true, and I an<U+017F>wered, yes, and that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver u<U+017F>ed to faile me, nor did I think fortune would be le<U+017F><U+017F>e favourable to me in curing her, then <U+017F>he hath been in curing others: It vexed her extreamly that I <U+017F>hould bring my mouth <U+017F>o neere hers, and giving me her hand, <U+017F>he commanded me to try upon it. But I drew my mouth neerer her lippe, and touched it; <U+017F>he took away her hand and pulled back her head, telling me that this was a ki<U+017F><U+017F>e and not a receipt, and would not permit me to u<U+017F>e it; but the raine did <U+017F>o much increa<U+017F>e, as it forced her to bid me teach it unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e the charme upon her lip: This was much again<U+017F>t my will; for I did extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long to have the cele<U+017F>tiall happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her lip, though I was very <U+017F>orry for the paine <U+017F>he endured. Love did advi<U+017F>e me to teach other words unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> to the end that finding no ea<U+017F>e by them, <U+017F>he might have recour<U+017F>e unto me: My de<U+017F>igne did take according to my wi<U+017F>h; for <U+017F>he muttering a few gro<U+017F><U+017F>e idle words which I taught her and u<U+017F>ing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies, the paine cea<U+017F>ed not. At which <hi>Valentinian</hi> laughing, Do you think Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) that any one can admini<U+017F>ter this receit? For my part, I profe<U+017F><U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I have tryed it, and I found a pre<U+017F>ent ea<U+017F>e? Now if it do you no good it is becau<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> hath omitted <U+017F>omething: Upon this going out of the Arbor, he returned againe, and brought in with him all the young Cavaliers. Her pain did exceedingly encrea<U+017F>e, and her lip began to <U+017F>well, when <U+017F>he turning towards me, Will you <U+017F>ay upon your faith, <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that the receit is good? I do <U+017F>weare unto you Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) by that honour which I owe you, that I never knew it faile, and I am <U+017F>orry <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> knowes not how to do it aright: but I wi<U+017F>h I were for this once a woman, that I might do you this <U+017F>ervice. I know not, Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> why you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that if you did <U+017F>ee how your mouth is <U+017F>welled, you would u<U+017F>e any remedy to help it. But pray tell me, <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> replyed <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> will you be long in applying your receipt? As little a time as I can Madam, an<U+017F>wered I. Then going to her, <U+017F>he went into the mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>cure part of the Arbor as being a<U+017F>hamed to be <U+017F>eene, and the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive pain forced her to let me u<U+017F>e my Enchantment.</p>
               <p>Was ever any Sorcerer <U+017F>o happy as my <U+017F>elfe? I <U+017F>poke the words upon her lippe: but when I tooke hers, between mine, and as I <U+017F>ucked it did pre<U+017F><U+017F>e it a little; certainly if ever any did dye of delight it would have been <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces.</hi> She went away from me and blu<U+017F>hed for <U+017F>hame; This (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) is the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t receipt that ever was: But Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>I<U+017F>idore)</hi> Do you finde any amendment? Me thinkes, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that I do. Your paine Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) will pre<U+017F>ently be gone; but I <U+017F>hall have it all my <U+017F>elfe. How <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he), mu<U+017F>t you have it all your <U+017F>elfe? yes Madam (an<U+017F>wered I) the condition of this receipt is <U+017F>uch, that he who cures, mu<U+017F>t have the paine: <U+017F>he who did not under<U+017F>tand it, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o; Truly <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I am very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto you, for taking my pain upon you. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, could I as well take upon me all the paine that ever hereafter you <U+017F>hall endure, be confident, it <U+017F>hould never trouble you. <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> <U+017F>miled and <U+017F>aid, Madam if you have as much good will unto him, as he has unto you, you mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently cure him of his paine, as he hath yours. I had rather, in this be beholding unto him (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) than he unto me; and I am <U+017F>ure he is <U+017F>o civill and courteous, that he will not now give me that paine againe which he hath taken from me: Mo<U+017F>t true Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) but I mu<U+017F>t tell you my paine is not <U+017F>o much in my lippe as my heart. She under<U+017F>tood my meaning very well, though <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed not to heare me, and had not <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> beene pre<U+017F>ent, I had talked more unto her.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hould be too tedious <hi>(Silvander)</hi> <U+017F>hould I relate the whole Series of my affection, from the beginning; I <U+017F>hall therefore tell you onely what is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for you to know, and omit the re<U+017F>t.

                  <hi>Eudoxe</hi> u<U+017F>ed very often to frequent the Emperors Gardens: And I was alwayes very offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; ready to be imployed in her <U+017F>ervice; though it were but to gather her a flower in a day, I was well centented with it and having long <U+017F>ince learned that love does as often begin by trifles as by things of greater importance which very <U+017F>eldomfall out, &amp; that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which oblige much, doe rather produce emnity then love, but that nothing winnes more upon another then affection; therefore I was very a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous in <U+017F>erving her upon every triviall occa<U+017F>ion. Not one of her <U+017F>ervants was <U+017F>o officious as my <U+017F>elfe. It happened one day, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> followed her, for <hi>I<U+017F>idores</hi> <U+017F>ake, into the Garden; and <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> being a little weary, they <U+017F>eperated: <hi>Eudoxe</hi> continued walking, and <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> went into an Arbour, where <U+017F>he found <U+017F>eates of gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, covered over with boughes: <U+017F>he had not beene there long but <hi>Valentinian</hi> who was walking with <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> began to complaine of wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and made that his pretence for going to <U+017F>it downe in the <U+017F>ame Arbour: <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> offered to go out, but he held her by the gowne: <hi>Eudoxe</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, looked upon me and could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile: I thinking this to be a fit opportunitie to put my intended re<U+017F>olution into execution, I would not let it <U+017F>lippe. I <U+017F>miled therefore as well as <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>he asked me why I did <U+017F>o; to which I an<U+017F>wered very freely that it was becau<U+017F>e <hi>Valentinian</hi> had left her to go unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi> And why, <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) do not you the <U+017F>ame? I Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) do you think I have <U+017F>o little judgement? Me thinkes (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that you ought to do it, becau<U+017F>e it is fitter that you <U+017F>hould do her <U+017F>ervice then <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> I know very well Madam (<U+017F>aid I) that there is much more equality betwixt <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> and me, then betwixt <hi>Valentinian</hi> and her, but I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault contrary unto that of <hi>Valentinian.</hi> How do you meane? (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I meane Madam (<U+017F>aid I) that rather then <U+017F>erve one who is equall unto my <U+017F>elfe as <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> is, I would dye for the love of one who is above me as you are: How me? an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, do you <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> know what you <U+017F>ay? I <U+017F>ay Madam (an<U+017F>wered I) that I had rather dye adoring You, then live and love <hi>I<U+017F>idore:</hi> and that the va<U+017F>t inequality betwixt us could never put me out of this mind <U+017F>ince the fir<U+017F>t day I had the glory to <U+017F>ee you. Surely (<U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e) you are out of your wits, otherwi<U+017F>e you would never talke thus to Me. Do not thinke <U+017F>o Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) for I am <U+017F>ure I never <U+017F>poke more truly, nor with a <U+017F>ounder judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till and looked <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>tly upon me, and afterwards <U+017F>aid, Is this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> in earne<U+017F>t or in jea<U+017F>t? I do <U+017F>weare Madam (<U+017F>aid I unto her) by that <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which I owe you, that I did never in my life utter words more unfainedly, nor with a more re<U+017F>olved will then the<U+017F>e; and take them as you will, hate or treat me as you plea<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall never change.</p>

                  <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) I am very <U+017F>orry for your folly: I have e<U+017F>teemed you and your <U+017F>ervice above any that have been educated under the Emperor my Father: But <U+017F>ince you are growne <U+017F>o beyond all bounds of rea<U+017F>on impudent, and quite forgot your duty and di<U+017F>tance, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that if ever you u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame liberty of language againe to me, I will make you repent of your ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and acquaint both <hi>Valentinian</hi> and the Emperor with it. Madam (an<U+017F>wered I) did I not feare that tho<U+017F>e who are in the garden would ob<U+017F>erve me, I would aske pardon upon my knees for my pre<U+017F>umptuous crime: but I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to <U+017F>ay, that all your menaces cannot prevaile with my will: this affection is rivetted into it, heaven and earth cannot di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it: and therefore there is no hope that any feare of the Emperor, or any con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Valentinian</hi> can divert me. 'Tis true, I may be <U+017F>ilent, and langui<U+017F>h away for the love of the faire <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> and <U+017F>o I beleive I <U+017F>hall. Now for a proofe of this and not to offend you any longer with my impertinent talke, I do <U+017F>weare unto you by that eternall humble <U+017F>ervice which I owe you, that I will never <U+017F>peak to you of it againe. But remember this, that as oft as I do you any reverence, or bid you good morrow, my heart then <U+017F>ayes unto you Madam, that <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> is dying for the love of you, and tacitly tells you that you will never have a more faithfull <U+017F>ervant then he: And when I take my leave of you, or bid you good night, then do I <U+017F>ay, how long is it your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hall be mi<U+017F>erable? and how long will your rigour la<U+017F>t? And to begin (<U+017F>aid I <U+017F>adly to her) permit me to take my leave of you and bid you good night. Upon this I made a low reverence and retired, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould too much offend her with my words: but as I went, I ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>he turned the other way and <U+017F>miled; which gave my heart no little hope.

Thus, kind <U+017F>tranger, have I lived ever <U+017F>ince with her, never making any <U+017F>emblance of what was pa<U+017F>t except by my good morrowes and good nights; which when none could <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he would often an<U+017F>were with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Above <U+017F>ixe Months pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on this manner, and all the while <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed not the lea<U+017F>t kind of any reception of my affection. At the la<U+017F>t I vanqui<U+017F>hed: one morning when <hi>Valentinian</hi> was leading her to the Temple, I went to her, and making an humble reverence I <U+017F>aid, good morrow Madam. At which <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled, and turning towards me; <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) your good morrowes are very kindly accepted. Oh heavens? how can I expre<U+017F><U+017F>e my joyes? I prote<U+017F>t I never hoped for any happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was talked of but the mariage of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and her. Yet I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince, how that, which I believed would have ruined my hopes, was that which obliged her, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: For <U+017F>he perceiving how his affection to <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> encrea<U+017F>ed, and all his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions unto her, were onely to plea<U+017F>e the Emperor, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to entertaine my love, rather then to be the wife of an Emperour, and to accept of my <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>ince <hi>Valentinian</hi> was wholy devoted unto the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi> I knew her re<U+017F>olution pre<U+017F>ently after: for upon the fir<U+017F>t opportunity which pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he told me, that my con<U+017F>tancy, and <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> affection unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> had overcome her: And that if I did continue <U+017F>till in my di<U+017F>creet behaviour <U+017F>he would continue her affection to me: So as ever <U+017F>ince that day, <U+017F>he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to call her in private, my Prince<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>he called me her my Cavalier. Judge, <hi>Silvander,</hi> whether ever man was more happy then my <U+017F>elfe. For <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was ab<U+017F>olutely the faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F>s in the whole world; aged about <U+017F>caventeene or eighteen yeares, and never loved any one but I.</p>
               <p>Whil<U+017F>t we lived thus in this manner, <hi>Honorius</hi> who marryed the Daughter of <hi>Stilicon,</hi> dyed without I<U+017F><U+017F>ue: And becau<U+017F>e a Roman who<U+017F>e name was <hi>John,</hi> his Principall Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was elected Emperour by the meanes of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus</hi> and <hi>Aetius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ius</hi> intending to make his co<U+017F>en Germaine <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Emperour of the We<U+017F>t, he would <U+017F>end him thither with his Mother <hi>Placidia.</hi> I made a flori<U+017F>h as if I were de<U+017F>irous to make one in this voyage but indeed my de<U+017F>ires were to <U+017F>tay for the gaurd of <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> For though the de<U+017F>ire of glory did invite me into <hi>Italy,</hi> yet love kept me at <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople,</hi> by <U+017F>tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tyes: for this faire Prince<U+017F>s did <U+017F>o <U+017F>econd her promi<U+017F>e, as her affection was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e to me, then mine to her. At the fir<U+017F>t, I believed her intention was not to go <U+017F>o farre But love in this re<U+017F>embles death; for as one cannot dye, <U+017F>o one cannot love, by halves. Now as I was pumping for a good excu<U+017F>e to <U+017F>tay at home, the Emperour received inetlligence of a great Army which was marching towards <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople.</hi> This newes invited many to <U+017F>tay, who otherwi<U+017F>e in point of honour and duty would have gone under the conduct of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who carryed a very great Army by Sea; having with him, <hi>A<U+017F>par</hi> his Son; a very valiant and fortunate Commander, as afterwards he made it evidently appeare by taking <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and delivering his Father. Now though I was not jealous of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for all <hi>Eudoxe's</hi> favourable a<U+017F>pect upon him, becau<U+017F>e I knew it was onely to plea<U+017F>e <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> yet I <U+017F>eemed as if I were, and <U+017F>eemed to rejoyce very much at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hall not now relate unto you, the voyage of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for I believe you have heard it by many: But <U+017F>o it was, that after all things were <U+017F>et in good order in the We<U+017F>t, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople.</hi> Where he was received by <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> as if he were his Sonne: And by the <U+017F>olicitation of <hi>Phacidia</hi> who <U+017F>tayed in <hi>Italy,</hi> the marriage of the faire <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was concluded upon. It is impo<U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould expre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entments upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion: I could not believe it, and was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urcharged with feares and <U+017F>orrow, that, but for <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I had not been able to have <U+017F>upported them. But <U+017F>he who was wi<U+017F>e and prudent, though it grieved her to the very <U+017F>oul that <U+017F>he was to be his whom <U+017F>he did not love, yet <U+017F>he <U+017F>urmounted her <U+017F>orrow by re<U+017F>olution. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw in what paine I lived, <U+017F>he gave me the opportunity of <U+017F>peaking to her in her clo<U+017F><U+017F>et, when none was pre<U+017F>ent but <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> whom <U+017F>he did infinitly love Well my Cavalier (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) I <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>till doubt of my affection; and complaine again<U+017F>t me.</p>
               <p>My faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) had I not been accu<U+017F>tomed to receive more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from you than I can any way merit, you might have had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o now, when I do receive <U+017F>o high a one, as tran<U+017F>cends all degrees of gratitude, to acknowledge <U+017F>ufficiently. But why will you not give me leave to complaine of my fortune, who <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the good which <U+017F>he may give, me gives it unto another, who<U+017F>e merits in matter of love are inferiour unto mine? my Cavalier, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, live contentedly, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53526:204"/>
that <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> enjoyes all that a violent affection can obtaine: And what favour I <U+017F>hew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other is more out of duty then love, and <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, what rea<U+017F>on have you to complaine again<U+017F>t your fortune? My rea<U+017F>on for it, replyed I, is as great as my obligation unto you for this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance. Why (my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F>s) <U+017F>hould I not complain of her who in lieu of favouring my affection, does deprive me of that which onely can bring me unto the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I de<U+017F>ire? Oh Cavalier (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you do offend me. What? would you not have loved me, but onely to obtaine that of me which my duty de<U+017F>ires you? What did you think of me, and how little did you love me, if you have <U+017F>o bad an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of me? I was not able to an<U+017F>wer her, <U+017F>eeing how <U+017F>he took it; but kneeling down, with a deep <U+017F>igh, I <U+017F>topped my mouth by holding her hand upon it. At the la<U+017F>t, I ro<U+017F>e up again, and an<U+017F>wered her: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I do love you more then you would, and more then rea<U+017F>on would; but who can love you le<U+017F><U+017F>e? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that neither rea<U+017F>on nor duty, can mea<U+017F>ure the grandure of my affection; and if I do offend you in it, I be<U+017F>eech you pardon me, con<U+017F>idering, that to love you le<U+017F><U+017F>e, would be to prophane your beauty. Al<U+017F>o, I beg your pitty, who have <U+017F>o much courage, &amp; yet want <U+017F>o much merit. And yet you might well winke at the<U+017F>e faults, if love had a little more force in you. I do not under<U+017F>tand you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me. Alas! replyed I, how hard a matter it is to make you under<U+017F>tand it by my words, if love will not make you conceive it? But, I mean, my Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, that if love had a little more power over you, this duty which you <U+017F>peak of would have le<U+017F><U+017F>e; the too-happy <hi>Valentinian</hi> would enjoy what he is in que<U+017F>t of, and I, what I de<U+017F>ire. Oh Cavalier (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with a deep <U+017F>igh) did you but know the re<U+017F>entments of my <U+017F>oul, and what re<U+017F>traint it is in, you would know, that Love hath as much power over me, as it can have over any heart: If I do deny you any te<U+017F>timony of this power, con<U+017F>ider my birth, and unto what Lawes it obliges me. Had I been the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Athenian <hi>Leontine,</hi> as my Mother was, I might have di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of my <U+017F>elfe and my affection; but being Daughter unto the Emperour <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> Grandchild unto the Emperour <hi>Arcadins,</hi> and having <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi> the great unto my great Grandfather, do you not <U+017F>ee, I am not my owne but theirs, who gave me my beeing? It is the Tribute of humanity, and the Law of divinity, to <U+017F>ubmit unto Emperours and Grandure; Rea<U+017F>on of State, as well as Love, is to be con<U+017F>idered. This is no newes either to you or me, we both fore<U+017F>aw this long <U+017F>ince; and when I fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>et my eyes and affection upon you, it was <U+017F>till with a re<U+017F>olution to marry <hi>Valentinian;</hi> I am confident you had the <U+017F>ame thoughts, the fir<U+017F>t day you began to love me. What is it then which now troubleth you? What acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have hapned, which <U+017F>hould divert us from our fir<U+017F>t principles? The<U+017F>e words touched me <U+017F>o to the quick, that I could not permit her to go on without interruption: Can you think, Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, that the<U+017F>e are con<U+017F>iderations of Love? Can love be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any Lawes of duty? Oh heavens! how infinitely are you and I mi<U+017F>taken? You, in thinking that you love; and I, in thinking that you loved me. Then, <U+017F>topping a little, I began again, when I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he offered to <U+017F>peak: The Lawes of Love, Madam, are far different from tho<U+017F>e you mention, and if you would know what they are, read them in me, and you will finde, that as the great inequality which is betwixt us, could not keep me from lifting up my eyes <U+017F>o high as my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o it <U+017F>hould not divert you from looking <U+017F>o low, as your poor Cavalier; for, there is no more difference betwixt you and me, then betwixt me and you. And as to what you alledge concerning your birth, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o high, that it is in the <U+017F>uperlative degree, and can admit of no higher then you are, why <U+017F>hould you not in lieu of looking at Grandure, which can receive no addition in you, ca<U+017F>t your eyes upon your own contentment, to the end, that as you are by birth the greate<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world, <U+017F>o you may be, by your choice, the mo<U+017F>t contented Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e that ever was? You <U+017F>ay, that I began to <U+017F>erve you, in the opinion, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> <U+017F>hould be your Husband: Oh, Madam, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that when I fir<U+017F>t devoted my <U+017F>elfe unto your <U+017F>ervice, I thought my <U+017F>elfe able to <U+017F>upport that opinion; but, <U+017F>ince my affection is <U+017F>o encrea<U+017F>ed, that it is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to endure it, what can you an<U+017F>wer me, but that your affection is weak, <U+017F>ince it is not augmented more then it was at fir<U+017F>t? I wonder, my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, how you can deny your favours unto me, who adores you, and confer them upon one, who does not love you. Can you ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent, that your beauty, which without all di<U+017F>pute, may be the recompence and perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of any true Lover, <U+017F>hould be enjoyed by one that di<U+017F>daines it, and does not value it? How can you endure his carra<U+017F><U+017F>es, and not pitty the pain of your poor Cavalier? <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> who heard our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and was very de<U+017F>irous to favour us, not out of any ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53526:205"/>
<U+017F>he bare unto me, or any de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>he had to have any hand in <U+017F>uch bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es, but out of a hope, that this affection might pa<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o far, that perhaps it might break off the Marriage of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and to give us more opportunity of talking together, <U+017F>he withdrew her <U+017F>elfe into a little Clo<U+017F>et, in which at the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he fell a<U+017F>leep. I pre<U+017F>ently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, though I had my back towards her, becau<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing betwixt the candle, I <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>hadow again<U+017F>t the wall, which made me ob<U+017F>erve her when <U+017F>he went away. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e, who was leaning upon her arme in the Couch, and was very attentive upon what I <U+017F>aid unto her, never ob<U+017F>erved her, though <U+017F>he went clo<U+017F>e by her. And becau<U+017F>e my la<U+017F>t words touched her to the quick, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed a long while before <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, and <U+017F>till loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon the ground: At the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe up, and with a deep <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>aid thus: Oh my Cavalier, how cruelly do your words wound my <U+017F>oul? But what can I do? What will become of me? If I do not marry <hi>Valentinian,</hi> what will be thought of me? And if I do marry him, unto what a torment am I de<U+017F>tined? At the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, I <U+017F>aw tears trickle down her cheeks, and <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>peak more, le<U+017F>t her words <U+017F>hould too much betray her own weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e tears moved me to much pitty, giving me no <U+017F>mall a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, and much augmenting my courage. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, (kinde <hi>Silvander)</hi> that I never hoped to bring this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e unto this; but finding more love in her then I did imagine, I took upon me more boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e then ever I intended. I approached therefore a little neerer unto her then before, and <U+017F>eeming, as if I would only <U+017F>upport her drooping head in my brea<U+017F>t, my mouth was ju<U+017F>t betwixt her eyes; I dur<U+017F>t not at the fir<U+017F>t ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her, only <U+017F>eemed, as if what I did, was not done intentionally; but <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid nothing, I de<U+017F>cended by little and little, untill my mouth met hers; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he gave me no check, I put my hand into her brea<U+017F>t, but with <U+017F>o much ravi<U+017F>hment, that I trembled like a leafe <U+017F>haken with the winde. Since that time, I have been in many dangers, and <U+017F>everall deep-fought Battles, but I was never <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of fear, as upon this occa<U+017F>ion. Thus <U+017F>he permitted me this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but when I grew to be a little bolder, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto me: Fie, fie, my Cavalier, what do you mean? <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> will <U+017F>ee you. It is long <U+017F>ince, my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) <U+017F>he left us alone. How, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>tarted up) is not <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> here? <U+017F>he is very much to blame in leaving us alone. Why, Madam, <U+017F>aid I, we have no bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e for her. Perhaps not you, replyed <U+017F>he, but I have; and if you do love me, as you <U+017F>ay you do, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the<U+017F>e favours which I have permitted, and pre<U+017F><U+017F>e me not to confer more upon you, then I ought or can. I thought, that the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> would have re<U+017F>trained you from offering any thing, but what decency allowed; and could have wi<U+017F>hed, it might have been <U+017F>he, and not I, that <U+017F>hould have given you the check, to the end, you may <U+017F>ee how willing I am, to give you full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my affection; but <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is gone, and <U+017F>ince you cannot keep within the limits of what you ought, I am con<U+017F>trained to tell you, that if you make any attempts again<U+017F>t my honour, I will permit you, but upon condition, that I have, a naked Dagger in my hand, to pierce my heart pre<U+017F>ently, for the fault which you <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>train me to commit: If you would have me live, then con<U+017F>train me not, I be<U+017F>eech you to permit that, which I ought not to do, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I die. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e words did put me into <U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion, that ri<U+017F>ing from the place where I was, and falling down upon my knees, I prote<U+017F>ted unto her, that I would never <U+017F>eek for any further te<U+017F>timonies of her affection, nor <U+017F>atisfaction to my de<U+017F>ires greater, then tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he hath been plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>hew unto me. If you do <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, I will as long as I live allow you the <U+017F>ame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy you have received; and this proof of that affection which you bear unto me, <U+017F>hall be plea<U+017F>ing unto me, knowing, that right love can keep within the limits of decency. Upon this, <U+017F>he took my head in both her hands, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, as an earne<U+017F>t of her promi<U+017F>e, and we <U+017F>pake <U+017F>o loud, that we awaked <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi> Now becau<U+017F>e the night was far <U+017F>pent, and the candles almo<U+017F>t out, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> called her, and asked what a clock it was. 'Tis time, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that we go to bed, for every one is a<U+017F>leep except you. Do you think, <hi>I<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> is not now awake for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? I know not what he does, <U+017F>aid <hi>I<U+017F>idore;</hi> but I am <U+017F>ure, if I were in bed, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>leep <U+017F>oundly.

The Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e laughed, and <U+017F>aid unto her: What do you think on, <hi>I<U+017F>idore?</hi> I believe you are yet a<U+017F>leep. What would you have me do, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and rubbed her eyes)? <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> makes a fool of me.</p>
               <p>Now becau<U+017F>e it was late, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> ro<U+017F>e up, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, and commanded me to retire, which I did, but not without u<U+017F>ing the priviledge of ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her, which <U+017F>he had given unto me: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, that <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> ob<U+017F>erved her, and <U+017F>aid nothing, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> <U+017F>aid thus

unto her: What do you look at, <hi>I<U+017F>idore?</hi> I look, Madam (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) whether the Bee have much <U+017F>trng you. What Bee, <U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e? The Bee in the Garden, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, again<U+017F>t which this Cavalier hath <U+017F>o often given you a Receipt. Upon this, taking the Candle which was upon the Table, <U+017F>he lighted me down the <U+017F>tairs into the Court; but not before <hi>Eudoxe</hi> <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid unto her: Take heed, le<U+017F>t being alone with him, he do apply the <U+017F>ame Receipt unto you. Neverfear, Madam, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that Receipt will not do any effect upon me, becau<U+017F>e I do not believe in his words.</p>
               <p>See upon what termes I was, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> married this fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, whom pre<U+017F>ently after he carried into <hi>Italy.</hi> I <U+017F>hall pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over my <U+017F>orrowes and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures I had, e<U+017F>pecially the marriage night. But tho<U+017F>e of the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> were no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, as afterwards <U+017F>he told me; and <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> whom <U+017F>he carried with her, when <U+017F>he left <hi>Greece,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of the great confidence <U+017F>he had in her. You may imagine, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> did not contrary her in it. But as this fir<U+017F>t night was almo<U+017F>t intollerable to me, <U+017F>o I needed not to <U+017F>eek out for an excu<U+017F>e, in not following this fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e; for, I was fallen extreamly <U+017F>ick, upon the great di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure which I conceived, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> departed. After I had recovered my health, I begged leave of the Emperour to follow <hi>Ariobindes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>ilas,</hi> two great Commanders, which he preferred unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> with an Army, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him again<U+017F>t the innundation of the barbarous people, who threatned from all <U+017F>ides to fall upon the Empire. My age and my ju<U+017F>t reque<U+017F>t, ea<U+017F>ily obtained what I asked. But, as ill luck was, this Army was countermanded back, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Attilas,</hi> with the <hi>Hunnes, Almaines,</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> and an infinite world of people, were upon their March towards <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople.</hi> This countermand was no <U+017F>ooner brought unto <hi>Ariobindes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>ilas,</hi> but they heard of the death of <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> who being infected with the Plague, dyed <U+017F>uddenly, without I<U+017F><U+017F>ue-male. I had no di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to carry this <U+017F>ad newes unto the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ought <hi>Ariobindes,</hi> that I might accompany the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger whom he <U+017F>ent, <U+017F>eeming very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee <hi>Italy,</hi> before I returned; which reque<U+017F>t he ea<U+017F>ily granted unto me. In our way, we came to <hi>Naples,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I was welcomed with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irable cara<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Eudoxe</hi> did <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ent the death of her Father, as nature required of her; and during the dayes of mourning, <hi>Valentinian</hi> received intelligence, that <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> the Si<U+017F>ter of <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> who had married an old Generall, called <hi>Marcianus,</hi> had gotten him to be elected Emperour. This <hi>Marcianus</hi> was he, whom <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> King of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,</hi> having him Pri<U+017F>oner in <hi>Affrica,</hi> did <U+017F>ee the Eagle flie, and with whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards contracted a great league of friend<U+017F>hip. And becau<U+017F>e he was a very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and of high reputation, he quickly forced <hi>Attilas</hi> to retreat into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where envying his Brother <hi>Bledas,</hi> he traiterou<U+017F>ly murdered him, that he might remain <U+017F>ole King over all tho<U+017F>e barbarous People. When I had intelligence of the election of this new Emperour, and that <hi>Attilas</hi> was repul<U+017F>ed, I conceived, that then there was nothing which could invite me out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but that, War being on all <U+017F>ides, it was better to <U+017F>tay where my Love invited me. As I was in the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, the Emperour was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed, that this <hi>Attilas,</hi> who may well be phra<U+017F>ed, the <U+017F>courge of god, had taken <hi>Gaul</hi> for his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igne: and having by his Armes <U+017F>ubjected <hi>Valamer</hi> and <hi>Ardarick,</hi> Kings of the <hi>O<U+017F>trogots</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> he con<U+017F>trained them to joyne with his Forces, which were compo<U+017F>ed of <hi>Erulians, Almains, Turingians, Marcomances,</hi> and of <U+017F>ome <hi>Francks,</hi> who remained in their old habitations beyond the <hi>Rhein,</hi> when under the great <hi>Pharamond,</hi> this warlick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forced their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves of that Country, which now they hold in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and which began then, from the name of <hi>Francks,</hi> to be called <hi>France.</hi> As <U+017F>oon as this newes was made certain, the Emperour re-inforced the Army of the Patriarch <hi>Aetius,</hi> who was one of the be<U+017F>t and greate<U+017F>t of all the Roman Captains, and who had the charge of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Now though it went much again<U+017F>t my minde to leave the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> yet, go I mu<U+017F>t: and when I asked leave of her: Why, my Cavalier, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) will you be <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from me? What cau<U+017F>e have I given unto you? Have you <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to leave me thus? My faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I unto her, if I <U+017F>hould not go in this expedition, wherein all the Gallantry of the Court are employed, what will the world think of my courage? What will they think, if I <U+017F>tay at home? Nay, what would your <U+017F>elfe think of me? Unto which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, with a <U+017F>mile: I remember, that before my Marriage, none of the<U+017F>e excu<U+017F>es were urged. What! do you love me le<U+017F><U+017F>e now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Believe it, though I will keep within compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of my duty, yet I do love you as well now as then, and <U+017F>hall be very <U+017F>orry to part from you. Then <U+017F>he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed me: Remember
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53526:206"/>
(continued <U+017F>he) that you return quickly, and be <U+017F>till faithfull. Thus I left her, and went unto <hi>Aetius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was infinitely in love with the wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <U+017F>till his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, but with abundance of warine<U+017F><U+017F>e and di<U+017F>cretion; and thinking, that her denyall proceeded only from <U+017F>ome fears, as commonly young women have, that it would <U+017F>poil her Marriage, if it <U+017F>hould be known, that <U+017F>he was loved: Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to marry her; and thinking with him<U+017F>elfe, who in all the Court was mo<U+017F>t fit for her, he pitched upon <hi>Maximus,</hi> a Roman Knight; of great authority; he was thought the fitte<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as well, becau<U+017F>e he was often in <hi>Rome,</hi> <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee her; as becau<U+017F>e he was very ambitious, and by doing him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, he might the more ea<U+017F>ily deceive and abu<U+017F>e him. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and who expected his advancement from the Emperour, received this offer as a very great honour; for, the Lady was very fair, and of an illu<U+017F>trious Family; al<U+017F>o, had as good a reputation as any in the Court. <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, was not again<U+017F>t it; for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> was as rich as any in <hi>Rome,</hi> and had been twice Con<U+017F>ul. Al<U+017F>o the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, who infinitely loved this Lady, was very glad that <U+017F>he was to be married in <hi>Rome</hi> <U+017F>o advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageou<U+017F>ly. There being therefore no ob<U+017F>truction in this Match, Marriage was pre<U+017F>ently con<U+017F>ummated, to the contentment of them both. But when the Emperour, <U+017F>ome few daies after, offered <U+017F>ome addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto the wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> he found her more <U+017F>lack and cool in her affection, then before; at which the Emperour was <U+017F>o vexed, as he re<U+017F>olved to have no longer any recour<U+017F>e unto <U+017F>upplications. It hapned then, that he and <hi>Maximus</hi> being at play, as they often u<U+017F>ed, fortune was <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e to <hi>Maximus,</hi> that he lo<U+017F>t all his mony; and having nothing about him to make <U+017F>take, but a Ring which he u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>ealed withall, he pulled it off from his finger, put it to the <U+017F>take, and lo<U+017F>t it. The Emperour conceiving, he had met with a good occa<U+017F>ion to accompli<U+017F>h his de<U+017F>igne, he pretended <U+017F>ome important bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and leaving one in his room, he bad him play on upon credit, till <hi>Maximus</hi> had quitted all he had won; which he did, only upon de<U+017F>igne to amuze him the more. In the mean time, he <U+017F>ent to the wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> in her Husbands name, commanding her to come and vi<U+017F>it the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and as a token of his de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>hewed unto her the Ring of her Husband. She giving credit to the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting nothing, went, and was conducted into the Garden being told that the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e was there: Being brought into the mo<U+017F>t retired place of all the Garden, you may imagine how a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed <U+017F>he was, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>elfe in the hands of <hi>Valentinian:</hi> She began pre<U+017F>ently to look very pale upon it, and to tremble. The Emperour <U+017F>eeing it, took her by the hand, and would have carried her to <U+017F>it downe in an Arbour, which was in the mid<U+017F>t of the Garden; but <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elfe alone with him, <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed to enter; yet, he taking her by the arme forced her in, and <U+017F>hut the dore after them. Oh heavens! <hi>Silvander,</hi> in what a terrible affright was poor <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw this violent beginning; it was as great, as if <U+017F>he had been brought to the place of execution. But the Emperour, thinking to vanqui<U+017F>h her by fair words, and thinking, that no woman would deny him, he <U+017F>at down by her, and <U+017F>poke in this manner: I make no doubt, fair <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> but you think this <U+017F>tratagem which I have u<U+017F>ed, very <U+017F>trange, and, perhaps, are angry with me for it; but I hope, when you con<U+017F>ider the violence of my affection, how long it hath continued, and how neither my owne rea<U+017F>ons, nor your rigour, can quench it, I hope, I <U+017F>ay, that you will pardon my boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that you will not think this action <U+017F>trange, but will render my affection <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, before you depart from hence: Every thing does invite us to it; fir<U+017F>t, my unequal'd affection; next, the quality of him who loves you, who being Emperour, you may a<U+017F>pire unto the Empire, if you will render me as much <U+017F>atisfaction, as my love de<U+017F>erves; and la<U+017F>tly, the con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Maximus</hi> may move you unto it, <U+017F>ince you may <U+017F>ee by his Ring, that he does not only con<U+017F>ent unto it, but de<U+017F>ire it. What then, my fair <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> <U+017F>hould hinder you, from giving <U+017F>atisfaction to my longing de<U+017F>ires? Then offering to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e her, <U+017F>he turned her head the other way, and would not permit him, but be<U+017F>eeched him, to <U+017F>it down and hear her, de<U+017F>iring if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to overcome him by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Sir, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) that I am infinitely amazed, to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elfe alone with you, in this dark and <U+017F>olitary place, and <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t my minde, <U+017F>ince upon it, depends the ruine of my honour and my life; but, I have a great confidence, that you will do nothing again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on, or my will, e<U+017F>pecially when I do con<U+017F>ider, who you are, and who I am. Con<U+017F>idering you as your <U+017F>elfe, why <U+017F>hould I fear, being in the hands of the

great <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Son to the generous Emperour <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed of any that ever wore the name of <hi>Ce<U+017F>ar? Valentinian,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, who<U+017F>e Mother was the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> the honour and patterne of all Ladies. Can you think, great Sir, that I am affraid of you, who<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>dome is known throughout all the world, and who<U+017F>e prudence every one admires; al<U+017F>o one, from whom Ju<U+017F>tice is generally expected. I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elfe too ignorant of my Emperour's excellencies, did I doubt his goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, or fear any harm from him in this <U+017F>olitary place, where I am alone with him: No, no, I dare tru<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elfe any where, in the hands of my honoured Emperour: but I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I think it <U+017F>trange that I <U+017F>hould be brought hither by the con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Maximus:</hi> It vexeth me to the <U+017F>oul that he <U+017F>hould thinke me <U+017F>o unworthy, and that I <U+017F>hould have one to my hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who is the very <U+017F>hame, and <U+017F>corne of men.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I will not aske what it is you would have of me, nor what occa<U+017F>ion brought you to this place. That Traytor who is the owner of this Ring, and your owne di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e does but too plainly tell it. But I do mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you, great and good Sir, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider that I have no more honour when this is gone, and if you love me, let me live worthy of great <hi>Ce<U+017F>ars</hi> love: Con<U+017F>ider Sir, that you trample under your feet, the honour and the life of her you love, and will <U+017F>o much injure your owne honour and reputation, as well as mine, as I know it will be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for you, to repaire it againe. You tell me that in rendering you this <U+017F>atisfaction, I may pretend unto the Empire: Oh heavens? can you think me worthy <U+017F>o much as to live after <U+017F>o great a crime, and <U+017F>taine unto mine honour? If you do beare any good will unto me, pre<U+017F>erve me un<U+017F>tained untill you can make me <U+017F>uch as you <U+017F>ay, and <U+017F>tay till it <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e the gods to bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. If there be any truth in your words, that you do love me. And if you do love me, never offer that which will make me exteamly hate you. Can you imagine, I <U+017F>hall ever love him that ravi<U+017F>heth away my honour, which is much dearerto me, then my life? No, no, Sir; I never can. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech you, think upon <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius</hi> your Father, think upon <hi>Placidia</hi> your Mother, and think upon God, who hath miraculou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>eated you in the Throne: he hath given you power to vanqui<U+017F>h <hi>John,</hi> by the hand of young <hi>A<U+017F>par: John</hi> I <U+017F>ay, who otherwi<U+017F>e had po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Empire: he hath overcome for you, the valiant <hi>Ca<U+017F>tinus,</hi> by the valour of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who a little before was a pri<U+017F>oner in <hi>Ravenna:</hi> he hath <U+017F>ubjected unto you, the Prudent <hi>Aetius,</hi> by the meanes of tho<U+017F>e who hardly knew you: He hath defeated <hi>Boniface</hi> the U<U+017F>urper of <hi>Affrica;</hi> he hath made the Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> King of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> your friend: To be briefe, what has not this great God done for you? And how thankfull ought you to be unto him? Now Sir, the very <U+017F>ame god who has done all the<U+017F>e for you, does at this very in<U+017F>tant <U+017F>ee you, and ob<U+017F>erves what cau<U+017F>e you will give him either to continue his favours, or to <U+017F>end you puni<U+017F>hments: Con<U+017F>ider what mi<U+017F>erable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and fatall tragedies, have heretofore be<U+017F>alne this Empire, upon the like occa<U+017F>ions as this.</p>
               <p>Oh mo<U+017F>t omnipotent Diety, rather <U+017F>howre downe all thy thunderbolts upon me, and hide me in the profundity of the earth, then <U+017F>uffer me to be any cau<U+017F>e of moving thy wrath again<U+017F>t this Emperour. Upon this, <U+017F>he kneeled downe, and continued; And you, great Sir, I be<U+017F>eech you rather put me to death, then ravi<U+017F>h from me, that which makes me worthy of your love, or before you make me in<U+017F>trumentall to bring the odium both of god and men upon you. Now Sir, <U+017F>hew, that you are truly <hi>Ce<U+017F>ar,</hi> and be as well a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander over your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as you are victorious over your enemyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> <U+017F>eeing her upon her knees, he tooke her up, and was <U+017F>o moved with her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions as he was a<U+017F>hamed of what he had done, and wi<U+017F>hed that he had never attempted it. Her words did <U+017F>o flow with rea<U+017F>on as fa<U+017F>t as her eyes with teares: <U+017F>o as working upon her good nature, they forced him into a re<U+017F>olution of overcoming him<U+017F>elfe, and promi<U+017F>ed her with an oath, that he would never u<U+017F>e any force again<U+017F>t her. But he be<U+017F>eeched her to take his affection into her con<U+017F>ideration, to forget what he would have attempted, and that when <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxe</hi> dyed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould marry him. The wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> hearing the<U+017F>e words, began to take: heart; to promi<U+017F>e him all that he de<U+017F>ired, and to be<U+017F>eech him, he would permit her to depart. Upon this <hi>Valentinian</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand, and with a deep <U+017F>igh, called unto him <hi>Heracles</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> whom he tru<U+017F>ted mo<U+017F>t of any in the Court and who<U+017F>e coun<U+017F>ell he mo<U+017F>t followed: This <hi>Eunuch,</hi> was a very wicked man, nothing plea<U+017F>ing, only faithful. But he was the mo<U+017F>t coveteous wretch, and the greate<U+017F>t flatterer that ever breathed. This was he who carried the Ring of <hi>Maximus</hi> unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53526:207"/>
her into the Garden: Now becau<U+017F>e the Emperor de<U+017F>ired that this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e might be carried with all <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, he tooke none with him but this man, whom he commanded to <U+017F>tay behind the Arbor, and to come unto him when he called. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> hearing the Emperors voyce, ran pre<U+017F>ently unto him, thinking that becau<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> would not con<U+017F>ent unto the Emperours will, he called him to helpe: but when he heard, that he was commanded to conduct her back: Is it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible Sir, (<U+017F>aid he) that words <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o farre prevaile, as to let <U+017F>o faire an opportunity to <U+017F>lippe? and to let her go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one touch? Shall a little feare make you lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>o faire an opportunity? Do you think <U+017F>he would have given you <U+017F>uch <U+017F>weet language, but onely to get out of your hands? Do you in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon what will be <U+017F>aid concerning your <U+017F>elfe, or her? The wor<U+017F>t report that can be, will be only this, that you were infinitly in love with a faire Lady. What hurt is there in all that? the wor<U+017F>t will be but nine dayes wonder. What<U+017F>oever you do, will be done in <U+017F>ecret betwixt you two, and what wound will that be to any reputation. As for any matter of con<U+017F>cience alas Sir god knowes, that though you be <hi>Ce<U+017F>ar</hi> yet you are but a man and will excu<U+017F>e it as a humane <U+017F>lip as well in you as in others. If he <U+017F>hould pardon none that are guilty of <U+017F>uch a crime he would be alone in heaven; few mortalls would ever come there: lo<U+017F>e not therefore <U+017F>uch an opportunity, which you will repent, if you let it <U+017F>lip and make no u<U+017F>e of it.</p>
               <p>The wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> <U+017F>eeing the Emperor lend an eare unto the wicked per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> offered to an<U+017F>were unto what he had urged, but the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being afraid, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her thus: Sir, (<U+017F>aid he) do not hearken unto the voyce of this Syren who <U+017F>peakes onely again<U+017F>t her owne con<U+017F>cience, and would be glad to be forced unto that which <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes: beleeve it, if you let this opportunity <U+017F>lip, <U+017F>he will di<U+017F>e<U+017F>teeme you, and mock you: and if you will give me leave to hold her, <U+017F>he will thank me: and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee whether or no, I <U+017F>ay true: Then offering to lay hands upon her, <U+017F>he gave him <U+017F>uch a blow upon the face, as blood immediately gu<U+017F>hed out of his no<U+017F>e: but the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being accu<U+017F>tomed unto <U+017F>uch encounters, and <U+017F>eeing the Emperour <U+017F>aid nothing, did get behind her, and foulded her armes within his, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>tirre. Then <U+017F>he began to cry out, and make the be<U+017F>t defence <U+017F>he could; but all to no purpo<U+017F>e: for the Emperour, by the helpe of <hi>Heracles</hi> had what he de<U+017F>ired of her. Ah <hi>Valentinian</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) thou ha<U+017F>t done an act unworthy of thy <U+017F>elfe; and I will dye, but I will be revenged; Then <U+017F>he fell upon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> and with her nailes and teeth, hurt him in a hundred places, and not being able to do him any more hurt, <U+017F>he ran out of the Arbor to <U+017F>eeke for <U+017F>omething wherewith <U+017F>he might kill both <hi>Valentinian</hi> and her<U+017F>elfe: but as fortune was <U+017F>he found nothing, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till thinking upon this injury, would gladly have killed her<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he <U+017F>truck her <U+017F>elfe upon the face, tore her haire, and u<U+017F>ed all the actions of one tran<U+017F>ported. When <hi>Valentinian</hi> <U+017F>aw her in this condition; he began to per<U+017F>wade her, to aske her pardon, to accu<U+017F>e the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and promi<U+017F>ing to do for her what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he would aske. She being hardly able to <U+017F>tand, for wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>orrow, <U+017F>at downe upon a <U+017F>eat, <U+017F>o much out of her <U+017F>elfe as <U+017F>he was hardly able to <U+017F>peake. <hi>Valentinian</hi> came to her, did <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elfe downe by her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his <U+017F>upplications, and told her that her husband knew nothing of it; and then related to her how he came by the Ring.</p>
               <p>The Emperour told her this, to the end <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not tell <hi>Maximus</hi> and to give her <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>olation in knowing that her husband was ignorant of it: for her greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ure was, to think that her husband <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>ent unto it. But when <U+017F>he heard that he was innocent, <U+017F>he was much better <U+017F>atisfyed, hoping now, that he would revenge her wrong. After <U+017F>he had <U+017F>at <U+017F>adly a long while and <U+017F>poke not a word, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> thought her a little better <U+017F>atisfied: for <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that <hi>Maximus</hi> knew nothing of it, and conjured him to keep it <U+017F>ecret both from him and all the world, to the end <U+017F>he might live <U+017F>till in the good opinion of every one. The Emperour, who did mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionatly love her, &amp; who but for the <hi>Eunuch</hi> had never u<U+017F>ed any force, he promi<U+017F>ed her with a thou<U+017F>and oathes that he would do what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired: and charged the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>peake the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllable of it to any in the world. After <U+017F>he had tyed up her haire, and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her<U+017F>elfe as well as <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>he went home, where <U+017F>he expected the comming home of her husband, whom <hi>Valentinian</hi> found <U+017F>till at play, and had recovered <U+017F>ome part of his lo<U+017F><U+017F>es: Night being come, he went home, where he was no <U+017F>ooner come, but according to his cu<U+017F>tome he went to <U+017F>ee his wi<U+017F>e and deare <hi>I<U+017F>idore:</hi> <U+017F>he was in her clo<U+017F>et all alone, <U+017F>o <U+017F>wel'd with teares, as when he <U+017F>aw
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53526:207"/>
her he was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed and entreating him to <U+017F>it downe by her, husband (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) do not wonder to <U+017F>ee me in this condition: I have <U+017F>o much occa<U+017F>ion for it, that I will live no longer: but, before I die, <U+017F>atisfie me <U+017F>o farre as to <U+017F>weare, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my death. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who did extreamly love this Lady, both for her wi<U+017F>edome and beauty, he came to her as his cu<U+017F>tome was, to ki<U+017F>s her and to know what it was which <U+017F>o much troubled her. But <U+017F>he recoyled, and <U+017F>aid unto him: It is not rea<U+017F>onable, <hi>Maximus,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould come any neerer unto this defiled body; I am not now the <U+017F>ame <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> whom you have <U+017F>o much loved, and who never loved any but you. I am another woman, who dares not call you Husband. The mo<U+017F>t wicked and cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that ever was, hath defiled me, and I will not live any longer, <U+017F>ince I am not worthy to be your Wife. Upon this, <U+017F>he related the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age unto him, and <U+017F>hewed him the blood of <hi>Heracles,</hi> which dropt upon her, as he held her. I <U+017F>hould be too long and tedious, if I did relate all the complaints which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt <hi>Maximus</hi> and her.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>o it was, that Revenge was re<U+017F>olved upon; but he de<U+017F>ired her, upon any termes, not to <U+017F>horten her daies, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould incen<U+017F>e the gods again<U+017F>t her, telling her, that he would carve her <U+017F>o much revenge, as <U+017F>hould give her <U+017F>atisfaction: He told her, that <U+017F>ince there was not an act of her will con<U+017F>enting, he <U+017F>hould not think her the le<U+017F><U+017F>e cha<U+017F>te, nor le<U+017F><U+017F>e worthy of being his Wife then before: And that in order to his de<U+017F>igne, he would have her a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that <U+017F>he had never acquainted any with it, to the end, he might think him<U+017F>elfe the more <U+017F>ecure. She carried the matter <U+017F>o, that the Emperour never made que<U+017F>tion of it, and <U+017F>he gave him back her Husbands Ring, the better to per<U+017F>wade him. About this time, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was brought to bed of a Daughter which was called <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> after her own name; and about a year after, was delivered of another, who bore the name of her Grandmother, <hi>Placidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time we were in <hi>Gaul,</hi> expecting <hi>Attilas,</hi> where <hi>Aetius</hi> was making all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary preparations. This Barbarian, having gathered together a very va<U+017F>t Army, as I told you, he intended to fall upon <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople;</hi> but being prevented in that by the wi<U+017F>e conduct of <hi>Marcianus,</hi> and not being able to maintain that world of People which followed him, either in <hi>Pannonia</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> which was growne almo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>art, by the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of <U+017F>o many Nations through it, he determined to fall upon the We<U+017F>tern Empire, which was already well <U+017F>haked, and begun to totter. The a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> promi<U+017F>ed unto him, was no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>pur unto his de<U+017F>igne. This <hi>Vandal</hi> having gotten the Daughter of <hi>Thierres</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> in marriage unto <hi>Honorius</hi> his Son, he had a conceit, that <U+017F>he would poy<U+017F>on him, and under this pretence, he cut off her no<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ent her back into <hi>Gaul</hi> unto her Father; and <U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in fear of his anger, he thought it mo<U+017F>t expedient for him to fortifie him<U+017F>elfe, with the friend<U+017F>hip of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> by promi<U+017F>ing them all manner of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. <hi>Attilas</hi> who promi<U+017F>ed unto his ambition no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then all the We<U+017F>tern Empire, having recruited and put his Army into good equipage, he marched towards <hi>Gaul;</hi> but fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>patched an Envoy unto <hi>Thierres,</hi> then the mo<U+017F>t pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant King of all tho<U+017F>e that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed it; for, he held almo<U+017F>t all <hi>Spain,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, from the <hi>Piren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Mountains unto the <hi>Loyre.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Attilas</hi> feared the grandure of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F><U+017F>ant Barbarian, he let him under<U+017F>tand, that his comming into <hi>Gaul</hi> was only again<U+017F>t the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that they two would divide the Empire betwixt them, as <U+017F>oon as it was overthrowne. He <U+017F>ent the <U+017F>ame me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto <hi>Gondioch,</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and unto the valiant <hi>Merovius,</hi> King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>our unto <hi>Clodion,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pharamond.</hi> He treated and tran<U+017F>acted <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly with <hi>Singiban</hi> King of the <hi>Almaines,</hi> as he promi<U+017F>ed to take his part. But <hi>Aetius,</hi> who was as wi<U+017F>e a Captain, as was in the whole world, knowing his <U+017F>ubtlety, did di<U+017F>cover it unto the<U+017F>e Kings, giving them to under<U+017F>tand, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> were defeated, <hi>Attilas</hi> would turn all his forces again<U+017F>t them, and make them Tributaries to him<U+017F>elfe, as he had already done <hi>Valamer</hi> and <hi>Ardarick,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of his Neighbours; and that the amity of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> was more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and honourable for them: Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, in re<U+017F>pect that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was <U+017F>o great, and <U+017F>urely e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them, having <U+017F>o pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant a Neighbour to their enemy, to <U+017F>leep quietly in their hou<U+017F>es. As for <hi>Attilas,</hi> he was but a <U+017F>torme, which looked foul, but would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be blowne over. That the Amity of the Emperour was more honourable unto them,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53526:208"/>
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a great Prince, and a good, and that they were already linked in amity with him. That he had given the <hi>Burgundians</hi> their habitations where they dwelt; and that the amity of <hi>Vualius,</hi> with <hi>Con<U+017F>tantius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> had gotten the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> all that they held in <hi>Gaul.</hi> Briefly, That they had experience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which might put them out of all doubt: Whereas it would be a mad <U+017F>olly in them, to tru<U+017F>t <hi>Attilas,</hi> who<U+017F>e ambition was <U+017F>uch, as that again<U+017F>t all rights, both divine and human, he would not <U+017F>uffer his Brother <hi>Bleda</hi> to be his partner, but mi<U+017F>erably put him to death. The<U+017F>e Remon<U+017F>trances cau<U+017F>ed the <hi>Francks,</hi> the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and the <hi>Almaines,</hi> to confederate them<U+017F>elves with <hi>Aetius</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Attilas,</hi> who, after <U+017F>ome years, fell into <hi>Gaul,</hi> with five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and fighting men: The fir<U+017F>t he fell upon was the <hi>Francks,</hi> plundering and firing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t all their Townes; but it was only of <U+017F>uch, as had not the courage to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over the <hi>Rheine</hi> with the fir<U+017F>t, who took up their habitations in <hi>Gaul.</hi> At the la<U+017F>t, he came to a Citty of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> called <hi>Orleans,</hi> which he be<U+017F>ieged, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had taken it, if the <hi>Francks</hi> and <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> had not appeared with <U+017F>uch an Army, as con<U+017F>trained him to ri<U+017F>e and go away.

The next morning therefore, Battle was given. I could give you a particular relation of all the Fight, for I was in it, and fought next <hi>Aetius</hi> that day; but it would be too long, and not pertinent to our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: But <U+017F>o it was, that <hi>Attilas</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and forced into his Camp, which he had fenced about with his Carriages: And becau<U+017F>e he had an opinion, the Enemy would fall upon him there, he cau<U+017F>ed a great heap to be made, of all the Saddles and Baggage of the Army, intending to <U+017F>et it on fire, and to burne there, rather then to fall into the hands of his enemies. I <U+017F>aw him that day, and the next morning al<U+017F>o; and one might plainly <U+017F>ee, by his minde and garb, the vanity which was in the <U+017F>oul of that man. But <hi>Pri<U+017F>eus,</hi> Secretary unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was <U+017F>ent into <hi>Syria,</hi> before he came into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> he told me, that he never in all his life <U+017F>aw a more imperious or haughty minded man, aiming at no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, then the Monarchy of the whole world; and then gave him<U+017F>elfe the title of King of the <hi>Hunnes, Medes, Goths, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Gepides.</hi> He al<U+017F>o took upon him the title of, The terrour of the world and, the <U+017F>courge of god. And becau<U+017F>e I asked him, whether his <U+017F>tature was equall to his courage: he an<U+017F>wered me, That he was rather low then tall; that he had a large brea<U+017F>t, a great head, little eyes, but quick and <U+017F>parkling; his no<U+017F>e flat, his hair browne; his <U+017F>trutting pace <U+017F>hewed the pride of his minde, and the whole Symmetry of his face, <U+017F>poke him to be a lover of War.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he was <U+017F>ubtle; and though he was couragious, yet <U+017F>eldome u<U+017F>ed to fight in per<U+017F>on, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e in great extremity, re<U+017F>erving him<U+017F>elfe alwaies for a great nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As he was very cruell and inhumain to his enemies, <U+017F>o was he very <U+017F>weet and courteous to <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ubmitted, or having offended, asked pardon; unto whom he would alwaies keep promi<U+017F>e inviolable, and defend them again<U+017F>t all whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever.</p>
               <p>This character which <hi>Pri<U+017F>eus</hi> gave of <hi>Attilas,</hi> at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> did cau<U+017F>e <hi>Honorica,</hi> Si<U+017F>ter unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to de<U+017F>ire a Marriage with him, as afterwards I <U+017F>hall tell you. But in the mean time, to return unto <hi>Aetius,</hi> be plea<U+017F>ed to know, kinde <hi>Silvander,</hi> that this great Captain being out of <hi>Attilas</hi>'s danger, yet he knew, that he was entring into a greater; for, <U+017F>hould the <hi>Francks, Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> come to know their own <U+017F>trength, they might much offend the Empire. To keep them therefore in <U+017F>ome fear, he thought it expedient to <U+017F>ave <hi>Attilas,</hi> thinking, that the fear
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53526:208"/>
they would have of <U+017F>o great an enemy, would keep them alwaies united to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Thierres.</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> was <U+017F>lain in this Battle, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>mond</hi> and <hi>Thierres,</hi> his Children, in revenge of their Father, would needs force <hi>Attilas</hi> in his Camp, he <U+017F>eemed to love them much more, then he hated <hi>Attilas,</hi> and advi<U+017F>ed them to return in all ha<U+017F>te unto <hi>Tholou<U+017F>e,</hi> with the re<U+017F>t of their Army, le<U+017F>t their Brothers who were left there, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eize upon the King dome in their ab<U+017F>ence. <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi> who was of a di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tfull nature, and knowing that he had three other Brothers in the Country, called <hi>Frederick, Rotomer,</hi> and <hi>Honorick,</hi> al<U+017F>o taking <hi>Aetius</hi> for his friend, without more delay, he took the Body of his Father, and went in all ha<U+017F>te into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> where he was very well received, his Brothers having no <U+017F>uch intention, as <hi>Aetius</hi> per<U+017F>waded him. The<U+017F>e Forces being thus <U+017F>eparated from our Army, it remained <U+017F>o weak, that every one was of opinion, that it was be<U+017F>t to let <hi>Attilas</hi> go away; and that a prudent Captain will make a Bridge of gold <U+017F>ometimes for his enemy to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over. Thus therefore this enemy of the Empire e<U+017F>caped the hands of <hi>Aetius;</hi> and though this great Souldier had a good intention in it, yet afterwards, the Emperour took it very ill.</p>
               <p>I alwaies followed <hi>Aetius</hi> in all this la<U+017F>t expedition, and dur<U+017F>t not leave the Army, as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>everall occa<U+017F>ions of fighting pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves, as becau<U+017F>e the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> commanded me <U+017F>o to do, being de<U+017F>irous I <U+017F>hould be ab<U+017F>ent from her, le<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould take notice of my familiarity with her: god only knowes how much it was again<U+017F>t my will, and how often I re<U+017F>olved to depart, <U+017F>etting all con<U+017F>iderations of duty and di<U+017F>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yet I <U+017F>tayed therefore in the Army about twelve years, at the end of which time, this Battle which I have told you of was fought. 'Tis true that in this long exile, I received many Letters from <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> by which <U+017F>he did <U+017F>till continue unto me a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of her favour.

The wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> who had not <U+017F>poke a long time, by rea<U+017F>on of her tears, did reply before the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e: Madam, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and fell upon her knees) I prote<U+017F>t unto you, I conceive, that this is the mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t revenge and be<U+017F>t, that I can any way receive; nor is it rea<U+017F>onable, that he who does <U+017F>o ill requite a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which the heavens have given him, <U+017F>hould enjoy it without the <U+017F>ame mea<U+017F>ure that he u<U+017F>eth unto others. Madam, he is unworthy of you, and you are unju<U+017F>t, if you continue any longer his: The injury which he hath done unto you, his ingratitude unto the Emperour your Father, the di<U+017F>honour he hath done unto your Hou<U+017F>e, and the affront put upon the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> whom you have heretofore loved, does invite you to grant the reque<U+017F>t, which <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> makes unto you: What harm can come unto you by it? You do love this Cavalier, he is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, none can ever know it, and you may this way <U+017F>weetly revenge an injury, which is any other way irreparable. The Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>miled, and an<U+017F>wered us: Per<U+017F>ons that are interre<U+017F>ted, are not compleat judges; you do both of you advi<U+017F>e me to a revenge, which will offend me much more then before: If the Emperour have committed a fault, 'tis true, I do receive an injury by it; but <U+017F>ince I have not the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his actions, I am not culpable of his crime. Now <U+017F>hould I commit the <U+017F>ame fault, I <U+017F>hould be culpable as well as he. Faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid I, and interrupted her) there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the ca<U+017F>es; for, you <U+017F>hall never hear me complain of any force, which you have u<U+017F>ed upon me. I do believe, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that it would be an act of your free will; yet, let me tell you, that if you will be truly my Cavalier, you mu<U+017F>t make it an act again<U+017F>t your will; for, that title does oblige you, to pre<U+017F>erve my honour as deerly as my life. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, I know not why you may not take this revenge, nor can I <U+017F>ee which way it <U+017F>hould concern your honour, <U+017F>ince none <U+017F>hall ever know it. If none do know it, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, then where is the revenge, for that which is never known, nor re<U+017F>ented, is as if it never were? But, my Cavalier, I <U+017F>hould be glad of revenge, <U+017F>o it could be without any injury unto my <U+017F>elfe; and <U+017F>ince this way cannot be, but upon that <U+017F>core, let us talk no more of it, and turn our thoughts upon <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e. The wi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this great Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, did <U+017F>top both our mouths; All we were able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer her, was, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erved a better Husband then <hi>Valentinian,</hi> or el<U+017F>e, <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> a wor<U+017F>e Wife then <hi>Eudoxe.</hi>

               <p>However, the refu<U+017F>all of this way of revenge, which perhaps had contented the minde of this offended Lady, was a cau<U+017F>e, that <hi>I<U+017F>idore,</hi> never letting her Husband re<U+017F>t, did continually <U+017F>olicite him to revenge the injury, which both he and <U+017F>he had received. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who had not forgot it, but only <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o, that he might the more home-ly execute his De<U+017F>igne, he <U+017F>tudied night and day which way he <U+017F>hould bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: At la<U+017F>t, aiming at no le<U+017F><U+017F>e revenge then the life of the Offender, he thought, that if he did attempt any thing again<U+017F>t the Emperour, his Forces that were in the hands of <hi>Aetius,</hi> and the authority and prudence of that great Captain, might be his own ruine; therefore he thought it much conducible unto his de<U+017F>igne, to take <hi>Aetius</hi> out of the world, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> being weak on that <U+017F>ide, might be the more ea<U+017F>ily ruined: But when this cour<U+017F>e was re<U+017F>olved upon, all the difficulty was, to execute it; for, the great

power of this valiant Commander was <U+017F>uch, as it was a very hard matter to hurt him by force; and his prudence and circum<U+017F>pection was <U+017F>o great, that any policy could not deceive him.

                  <hi>Italy,</hi> being thus <U+017F>ettled in peace <hi>Petronius Maximus</hi> the husband of wi<U+017F>e <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi> began to think upon his revenge, all things <U+017F>eeming to <U+017F>econd his de<U+017F>igne. He was a man of great Authority in the Empire; For he was Patriarch, and having a de<U+017F>igne of revenge, and happily to make him<U+017F>elfe Emperour, he had long beforehand gotten the love of the people and the Souldier; of the one by his liberality for he was very rich; and of the other by his popularity in <U+017F>econding all reque<U+017F>ts which was made for the ea<U+017F>e and freedome of the people. And to render <hi>Valentinian</hi> odious unto every one, he advi<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>ecretly not to recompence the Souldiers either with honours or benefits, and to lay <U+017F>uch a load of taxes upon the people, as <U+017F>hould alwayes keepe them poore, and unable to attempt any novelty; and the better to accompli<U+017F>h his de<U+017F>igne, he exa<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all the friends of the great <hi>Aetius,</hi> as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he could, and courted him<U+017F>elfe into intimat familiarity with them.

Had I been neere his per<U+017F>on at that time, doubtle<U+017F>s I had dyed in defence of him: For though the act which he had committed again<U+017F>t <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> was wicked; yet there can be no cau<U+017F>e what<U+017F>oever, for lifting up a hand again<U+017F>t a Soveraine.

I was then at the <U+017F>acrifice with the faire <hi>Eudixe,</hi> where the tumult was <U+017F>o great, that for <U+017F>afety of her<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>he was forced to go out of <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Maximus</hi> having committed this homicide he knew that wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t never be done by halves; and therefore finding the power in his hands, by the meanes of <hi>Thra<U+017F>iles,</hi> and <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e friend<U+017F>hip he had gotten, and al<U+017F>o being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of the peoples con<U+017F>ent, he pre<U+017F>ently cau<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe to be elected and proclaimed Emperour: and all this without the lea<U+017F>t oppo<U+017F>ition though the Towne was full of tumult. <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> was pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>ed of it, both by her husband, &amp; by the common report of <hi>Valentinians</hi> death. And <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uch an inveterate hatred of him, that <U+017F>he could not believe unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him dead. Therfore <U+017F>he left her hou<U+017F>e &amp; went to the Palace, and <U+017F>eeing his corps without a head, <U+017F>he wa<U+017F>ht her hands in his blood, &amp; received <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange contentment in his death, that for very exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of joy, <U+017F>he fell downe dead. I was then, as I told you, with the faire <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and would not leave her in <U+017F>uch a dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>trous fortune; but waited upon her whither <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed, in te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my affection and fidelity. The ha<U+017F>te we made was <U+017F>uch, that we hardly tooke any with us. And lo<U+017F>ing our way in the night we were forced to take up lodging in a wood: She had none with her but her two Daughters, <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and two young men who u<U+017F>ually followed us, and who were much troubled in looking to our hor<U+017F>es: So as there was none with her all the night but the<U+017F>e two young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es; <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and my <U+017F>elfe. I did lye downe upon the ground, and <U+017F>he laid her head upon my brea<U+017F>t, her two Daughters lay at her feet; and thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away the night as well as we could. Our intention was to get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to go unto <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople</hi> to <hi>Marcianus:</hi> For <U+017F>ince <hi>Maximus</hi> had killed the Emperor, and had taken upon him the title of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tus,</hi> we feared he would be revenged upon her for the injury done unto <hi>I<U+017F>idore.</hi>
Though the night was very dark, and <U+017F>ad to the faire <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> yet I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it was the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t night unto me, that ever I had in my life: for I had my hand conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in her bo<U+017F>ome, and her lips clo<U+017F>e unto mine. Love knowes how I was thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ported, and how oft I was ready to ca<U+017F>t off all re<U+017F>pect. Which <U+017F>he perceiving, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Daughters to be both a<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>pered me in my eare, and <U+017F>aid thus unto me: Fie, fie, my Cavalier, do you think the gods are not enough incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me, but you mu<U+017F>t needs provoke them more by mooving me to commit fre<U+017F>h offences? After this <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ilent, and giving me a ki<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he laid her head where it was before: this was a <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timony that <U+017F>he loved me, and after this favour I laid my mouth unto her eare, and <U+017F>aid thus unto her. But, my faire<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, what offence would it be, <U+017F>ince now you are nobodies but your owne? Would you have me <U+017F>tay untill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>hall enjoy you before my face?

               <p>What attempts would I not have dared, if my power had been equall to my will? or if my wounds had permitted me? But alas I was in a condition farre unfit to do any thing to another, when I was not able to run my <U+017F>elfe through with my <U+017F>word, when I heard <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was to be enjoyed by a Tyrant: and but for <hi>Olimbres,</hi> perhaps I had <U+017F>erved my owne turne, for he was <U+017F>o carefull of me that I could not do any thing to my <U+017F>elfe; but gave me <U+017F>o many diverting rea<U+017F>ons to the contrary, that he kept me alive nine or tenne dayes till I was <U+017F>o happy as to <U+017F>ee the wi<U+017F>e and faire <hi>Eudoxe</hi> enter into my chamber. She had obtained this leave of <hi>Maximus,</hi> telling him it was but rea<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to <U+017F>ee him who had been wounded in her defence: <hi>Maximus</hi> who de<U+017F>ired to gaine me by faire meanes if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and having no <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of me, <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omely did we carry the matter, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet and faithfull was <hi>I<U+017F>idore</hi> unto her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Maximus</hi> permitted her. So <U+017F>he came to <U+017F>ee me, and leaving all her followers at the dore, <U+017F>he brought with her none but the little Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Placidia,</hi> knowing that <hi>Olimbres</hi> would <U+017F>o entertaine her in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he would not mind what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid. She came to my beds <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>itting downe offered to <U+017F>peake, but could not: At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeing teares flowe from mine eyes, and that I was not able to utter one word, <U+017F>he turned her<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>o that none <U+017F>hould ob<U+017F>erve our griefe. Thus <U+017F>ilently we <U+017F>at along while; and <U+017F>poke not one word. At la<U+017F>t having tooke a little courage I <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words. For ought I <U+017F>ee Madam, there is none lo<U+017F>ers by the bargain but <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces:</hi> He in lo<U+017F>ing his life his Empire and his wife: and I the favour of the faire <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> But alas his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e is nothing unto mine, for being dead he has lo<U+017F>t all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility of

mi<U+017F>ery, and I that am alive can onely be called mi<U+017F>erable becau<U+017F>e I do re<U+017F>ent my mi<U+017F>ery. She an<U+017F>wered me, fir<U+017F>t with her teares which <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>traine, and then by her words: Will you, my Cavalier, help to augment my griefe, and in lieu of giving me <U+017F>ome comfort and pitty, will you by your reproaches make me more mi<U+017F>erable? But it is well done; I am contented to be killed, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> does not love me. Oh heavens, cryed I, as loud as I could, being offended at her words, and <U+017F>orry I had cryed <U+017F>o loud, for two or three came running to me to know what I ayled, to whom I an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that my wounds pained, (but the paine was gone) and when they were gone al<U+017F>o I began to <U+017F>peake againe. How Madam? Does not <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> love you? Can you <U+017F>ay it, and not blu<U+017F>h? are you not afraid the heavens will puni<U+017F>h you for the wrong you do me? <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> not love you Madam? how long have you knowne him changed? was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Valentinian</hi> dyed? No, you have writ the contrary. Was it <U+017F>ince his death? No <U+017F>urely, you cannot chu<U+017F>e but remember my vowes and promi<U+017F>e. But perhaps it is <U+017F>ince the wrong you have done me in giving your <U+017F>elfe unto this cruell Tyrant. If <U+017F>o, tis time indeed to change my mi<U+017F>erable life for a happy death: but you may thank <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> that I live, for he onely has hindred me from dying. But <U+017F>ince I live, you may be certaine, that you <U+017F>hall live no longer then till I recover <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as to take a life away: though you do not love me yet you might well have rendred me <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of pitty. But what pitty or compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion can I expect from the wife of a Tyrant? how can I ever think you any thing but a peece of ingratitude? if you would live and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy your tyranicall husband: do you your <U+017F>elfe reach me my <U+017F>word, that you may <U+017F>ave your own life and his, and <U+017F>ee that it is not want of will but <U+017F>trength that keeps me alive. She not being able to endure I <U+017F>hould continue any longer, coming neerer an<U+017F>wered me thus In <U+017F>aying that <hi>Valentinian</hi> and you are the only lo<U+017F>ers, you might very wel have put me into the number, for <U+017F>ince you do not love me, my lo<U+017F>s is the greate<U+017F>t of all: Did I not feare our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would be ob<U+017F>erved, I would <U+017F>ay more, and <U+017F>weare that I love none but you, and be<U+017F>eech you to beleeve that as you are kept alive by force, <U+017F>o revenge keeps me, for I do not take this <hi>Maximus</hi> either for husband or Emperour; but for the mo<U+017F>t cruell Tyrant that ever was in <hi>Rome:</hi> Were it not in de<U+017F>ire and hopes of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, I would not live a minute, and <U+017F>ee you thus wounded. But heaven which is ju<U+017F>t does promi<U+017F>e me revenge for the blood of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and for the wrong which is done unto <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> and the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> In the meane time (my Cavalier) take corrage and recover of your wounds as <U+017F>oone as you can, for there is no other meanes to come unto our de<U+017F>ired ends, but that. This declaration was comfort enough to my <U+017F>oul, in <U+017F>o much as I recovered of my wounds very <U+017F>uddainly: For this time, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ay no more, but went away, to prevent all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of our de<U+017F>igne. But about three or four dayes after, <U+017F>he came to <U+017F>ee me againe, told me the manner how <hi>Maximus</hi> had killed <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and how he intended to marry her, as he <U+017F>aid him<U+017F>elfe, at which <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o extreamly offended as <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to di<U+017F>patch him <U+017F>ome way or other, out of the world. Oh my Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid I unto her) you mu<U+017F>t do nothing imprudently, for if you once failn your enterpri<U+017F>e, you can never after hope to attempt it without abundance of danger to your <U+017F>elfe; be<U+017F>ides, you would do me very great wrong, if you employ any other hand but mine in the blood of him who is the Parricide of my Soveraine, and the ravi<U+017F>her of you. This is the cour<U+017F>e which I conceive be<U+017F>t to be taken: <hi>Valentinian,</hi> long before <hi>Attilas</hi> turned his armes again<U+017F>t <hi>Italy,</hi> had concluded a peace with <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and left all that he had in <hi>Affrica</hi> unto him, upon condition he <U+017F>hould be his friend and confederate. This Barbarian hath ever <U+017F>ince made great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trations of love unto the Emperour, and would never take part with any that were his enemyes: Make knowne unto him the wicked machinations of <hi>Maximus;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the murder of <hi>Valentinian;</hi> <U+017F>hew him how he hath u<U+017F>urped the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: complaine unto him of the force he offereth unto you, and <U+017F>ummon him unto the promi<U+017F>e upon which <hi>Affrica</hi> is his: Feare not but he will relieve you: for though he be a Barbarian, yet he is generous, and it is their Nationall vertue to keep promi<U+017F>e unto death, and more unto the dead then unto their loving friends: Now, to make <U+017F>ure work, becau<U+017F>e all the<U+017F>e Barbarians are naturally greedy and covetous, offer him the Empire, that he may be more eager upon it: tell him what friends and meanes you can make for him in <hi>Italy.</hi> And that you are able to make his way ea<U+017F>y unto him, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of tho<U+017F>e who are adherents unto you again<U+017F>t the murderer of the Emperor: now though I

mu<U+017F>t need <U+017F>ay, it is hard to endure, that any Barbarian <U+017F>hould ever Lord it in <hi>Italy;</hi> yet better <U+017F>o, then to be without revenge. <hi>Eudixe</hi> con<U+017F>idering a while upon what I <U+017F>aid, did an<U+017F>wer me, that all the difficulty in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e would be, how to treat <U+017F>o <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and <U+017F>peedily with this Barbarian, that he might be in <hi>Italy</hi> before it was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and con<U+017F>idering my pre<U+017F>ent condition, <U+017F>he knew not whom to employ, that would be quick enough in the expedition; that <U+017F>he had rather die a hundred deaths, then ever Bed with this Tyrant; that <U+017F>he could put it off a while, by counterfeiting <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but that could not be long. I advi<U+017F>ed her to continue her counterfeiting and the better to delude the eyes of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould every morning u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ome of Brim<U+017F>tone to her face and hands, which would make her look <U+017F>o pale, that every one would believe her really <U+017F>ick. As for di<U+017F>patching into <hi>Affrica,</hi> it was my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, that I could not; and be<U+017F>ides, I had made a vow never to go out of <hi>Italy,</hi> untill I had killed the Tyrant: But that <U+017F>he might very well tru<U+017F>t my dear friend <hi>Olimbres,</hi> who, I was <U+017F>ure, would be both faithfull and diligent in her commands, and that I would an<U+017F>wer for his fidelity and capacity. She, who de<U+017F>ired nothing more then revenge, and to be out of this Tyrants power, referred the whole management unto me, and de<U+017F>ired me to di<U+017F>patch him with in<U+017F>tructions, which I did; and <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e and diligent, that within fifteen daies he arrived at <hi>Carthage,</hi> negotiated <U+017F>o with <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> as he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed him unto Revenge, unto U<U+017F>urpation, and to the Plunder of <hi>Rome;</hi> in<U+017F>omuch as within two months after, he <U+017F>et foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> with three hundred thou<U+017F>and fighting men, compo<U+017F>ed of <hi>Affricans, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> which put <U+017F>uch a terrour into the City and all the Province, that every one fled to the Mountains, Woods, and Rocks. And becau<U+017F>e we did <U+017F>olicite him to come <U+017F>traight to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might take the Tyrant, he made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he could, without any halt, or <U+017F>tay in any Townes by the way.</p>
               <p>This put <hi>Maximus</hi> into <U+017F>uch a fright, as without <U+017F>eeking to make any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, he permitted every one to <U+017F>hift for them<U+017F>elves as well as they could, and for his part, he fled into the Mountains with the re<U+017F>t. I was by this time well recovered of my wounds; and had not the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> charged me to the contrary, I had executed my de<U+017F>igne; but <U+017F>he <U+017F>till re<U+017F>trained me, untill for more <U+017F>afety, the <hi>Vandal</hi> was neerer the Town. But now, <U+017F>eeing that in lieu of defending his u<U+017F>urped E<U+017F>tate, he left it as a prey unto the Barbarians, I was affraid le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elfe, and that when <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> had left <hi>Italy,</hi> he would then returne againe unto his Tyranny. This was the rea<U+017F>on why I followed after him, with <U+017F>ome of my friends, and overtook him upon the banks of <hi>Tiber;</hi> and though mo<U+017F>t of my Company was tired out, yet I re<U+017F>olved to charge him, and let him go no farther. I challenged him therefore, and charged him with his wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, in the death of the Emperour, in the u<U+017F>urpation of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the force u<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and being guilty of all, he refu<U+017F>ed to fight with me, but <U+017F>purred away as fa<U+017F>t as he could: At which his own men were <U+017F>o a<U+017F>hamed and animated, that all joyning with my friends, they rid after him, and by chance, my Hor<U+017F>e having better heeles then the re<U+017F>t, I fir<U+017F>t overtook him, and gave him <U+017F>uch a blow upon the head, that he fell to the ground, where tho<U+017F>e that came after me, di<U+017F>patched him out-right, <U+017F>o much was every one incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t him, for his perfidie and cowardi<U+017F>e. Thus ended this Tyrant, <U+017F>o hated by his own men, as when he was dead, they cut him in pieces, and threw him into the River, as if they would wa<U+017F>h away his crimes in that manner; but all the water in the River <hi>Tiber</hi> could not wa<U+017F>h away halfe of tho<U+017F>e which he had committed, again<U+017F>t the Emperour, again<U+017F>t the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and again<U+017F>t the State.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto related the mi<U+017F>erable accidents which befell <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and me but the<U+017F>e which I have now to relate, are much more dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>trous; for alas; they have brought me into this mi<U+017F>erable condition in which you <U+017F>ee me. Now did <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> enter the City and he found no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, not <U+017F>o much as a dore <U+017F>hut again<U+017F>t him. <hi>Eudoxe</hi> received him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the title of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and telling him, that the Empire owed their liberty unto him; and, briefly, did him all the honour, and gave him all the thanks, that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. But this Barbarian, in lieu of being more gentle and affable by the<U+017F>e fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, they made him more haughty and intolerable; In lieu of friend<U+017F>hip, he proved an enemy, and carried him<U+017F>elfe, not as a Prince who came to relieve a di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53526:213"/>
but as a Conquerour, who by force of Armes, after a long War, had conquered an enemies Country. He gave up the Towne for plunder, and making no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <U+017F>acred and prophane things, he pillaged the Temples of all their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells and Trea<U+017F>ures, and of all tho<U+017F>e Rarities, which the people and Roman Emperours for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages, had, out of their devotion, pre<U+017F>ented unto them. And after this <U+017F>ad confu<U+017F>ion had la<U+017F>ted fifteen daies, he ran over mo<U+017F>t part of <hi>Italy,</hi> till he came to <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> where he did nothing but wa<U+017F>te and <U+017F>poile the Country; and when he was even glutted with <U+017F>poile and rapine, he returned into <hi>Affrica,</hi> having loadned his Ships with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and rarities that he found in the City. But alas, not being contented with the<U+017F>e inanimate things, he ravi<U+017F>hed away with him <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, as he thought might be u<U+017F>efull to him, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, Oh heavens! he carried away the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and her two Daughters, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and <hi>Placidia:</hi> I was then clo<U+017F>e by this de<U+017F>olate Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, when he <U+017F>ent her word, that <U+017F>he was to prepare for her departure within three daies after: She fell into a <U+017F>wound at the me<U+017F><U+017F>age, and was very neer death; but I wi<U+017F>h to heaven, that <U+017F>he and I had both dyed, rather then carried captives into <hi>Affrica.</hi> Oh heavens, how can I remember this accident and live? I went out of <hi>Rome</hi> with <U+017F>ome of my friends, not acquainting any with my de<U+017F>igne, not <U+017F>o much as my deer friend <hi>Olimbres,</hi> with whom I could not <U+017F>peak when I went, becau<U+017F>e he was with <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick,</hi> who had taken him into his friend<U+017F>hip, <U+017F>ince his <hi>Affrican</hi> voyage, and who by <hi>Eudoxe</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand never <U+017F>tirred from him that he might <U+017F>ave the Town as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; <U+017F>o as at his reque<U+017F>t, he did many favours unto <U+017F>everall per<U+017F>ons. I <U+017F>ent afterwards to him, to the end he <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> that I would either get her out of the<U+017F>e barbarous hande or die. She, who had a very <U+017F>olid and <U+017F>ound judgment, did know very well, that my enterpri<U+017F>e was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible by rea<U+017F>on of that numerous body of men that <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> brought with him, which exceeded the number of three hundred thou<U+017F>and men: Had <U+017F>he known where I was, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had kept me from executing my de<U+017F>igne; but, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> I never <U+017F>tayed a whole night in a place I had rallied together about a thou<U+017F>and Hor<U+017F>e, and if I had had a little more time perhaps I had got up <U+017F>uch an Army, as <U+017F>hould have ea<U+017F>ed the<U+017F>e Barbarians of our <U+017F>poils, which they were carrying into <hi>Affrica,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould have felt the weight of a Roman Arme; but I had only eight daies time. And not being able to endure they <U+017F>hould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I re<U+017F>olved to fight this great and terrible Army, with this little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men, thinking my life could not end upon a more noble account, nor in a better cau<U+017F>e.

But when I had recovered my <U+017F>elfe of the<U+017F>e wounds, and was able to get upon a Hor<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>tole away as <U+017F>ecretly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could from him; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way towards <hi>Tu<U+017F>cany,</hi> I hid my <U+017F>elf in the <hi>Appennine</hi> Mountaines, intending to die with hunger or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch hard<U+017F>hip, not being willing to <U+017F>hed my blood, for fear of offending the great god, who puni<U+017F>heth Homicides.

I do hint this unto you, Sir, that if you be oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with any <U+017F>ad dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, you may rid your <U+017F>elfe from the tyranny of it, by the judgment of <U+017F>o many, worthy, wi<U+017F>e, and prudent per<U+017F>ons.

               </p>
               <p>This good old man u<U+017F>ed this language unto me, which had no <U+017F>mall operation upon my thoughts; for, as <U+017F>oon as I came to <hi>Olimbres,</hi> I made this relation unto him: and the re<U+017F>ult was, that we would all three for company go unto this place, and put an end unto our daies. But heaven would not have it <U+017F>o, for he dyed when you relieved us. The<U+017F>e two Women which you <U+017F>aved, were his two Daughters, who came along with him, to clo<U+017F>e his eyes, if the Councell of Six Hundred had granted him the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. We thought our <U+017F>elves obliged to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them, and not to for<U+017F>ake them, till they had found the Corps of their dead Father, and given their la<U+017F>t duty unto him, who never had any misfortune in his life; and to the end, that after his death he might be happy al<U+017F>o, in being interred by the hands of his own Children.</p>
               <p>But to return unto that which concernes us. We were fully re<U+017F>olved to pro<U+017F>ecute our de<U+017F>igne, and to make it appear, that it was not the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of E<U+017F>tate, or <U+017F>hipwrack, or any <U+017F>uch, did move our wills unto it, being very rich, and owners of great po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, we <U+017F>ent unto our hou<U+017F>es for our <U+017F>ervants to come unto us, with a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>umme of many.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> ended, moving me infinitely to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate his fortune and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe</hi>'s.

               <p>Oh heavens? (cryed out <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> having heard this doome) how <U+017F>hall I pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away my <U+017F>ad dayes and nights? Then making an humble reverence to the Lords, he went from the Councell, but <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad that he could not obtaine his demand, as every one did admire the con<U+017F>tancy and firme de<U+017F>ire of death. <hi>Olimbres</hi> was not <U+017F>o eager of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e his de<U+017F>ire of death was onely to accompany his friend: and therefore was very glad of the denyal. Then they retyred to their lodgings, much lamenting their mi<U+017F>erable fortunes. And the noy<U+017F>e was <U+017F>pread not onely all over the Towne but al<U+017F>o through the Country, that two great Roman Per<U+017F>ons were come purpo<U+017F>ely to demand the poi<U+017F>on. Upon this, a great A<U+017F>trologer, who was de<U+017F>irous to know who they were, came to vi<U+017F>it them. This man was very old, and had wholly addicted him<U+017F>elfe unto that <U+017F>cience, <U+017F>o as he was growne very admirable in predictions. This man being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed of their de<U+017F>igne, fearing that their corrages di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing them <U+017F>o eager of death, and the poi<U+017F>on being denyed them, that they would have recour<U+017F>e unto the <U+017F>word, he de<U+017F>ired he might advi<U+017F>e them according to the rules of his Art. With this intention he went unto them one morning when they were alone in their chamber. He de<U+017F>ired me to be his conducter becau<U+017F>e we had <U+017F>ome acquaintance, when I was a <U+017F>tudent there. I <U+017F>hall not make any relation of the particular di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which they had, for they were very long. But <U+017F>o it was that punctually knowing the time of their Nativities: having long contemplated upon their Phy<U+017F>iognomies and hands, and having drawne <U+017F>ome lines in paper which he parted, and then joyned together; he <U+017F>aid thus unto them. Sirs, live, and pre<U+017F>erve your <U+017F>elves for a better <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, which the heavens do promi<U+017F>e unto you. As for you (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces)</hi> you <U+017F>hall recover her whom you have lo<U+017F>t, by the meanes of a man whom of all the world you love be<U+017F>t: you <U+017F>hall enjoy full contentment and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e her many yeares, in the <U+017F>ame Towne where your love fir<U+017F>t begun. And you (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Olimbres)</hi> you <U+017F>hall marry her whom you love: you <U+017F>hall bring her back unto her Country with her Mother; you <U+017F>hall not dye till an Emperour of the We<U+017F>t be made. The<U+017F>e things which I tell you are infallible, and nothing can divert them.</p>
               <p>The reputation of this man, had <U+017F>uch an influence upon <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> that he re<U+017F>olved to believe him, and follow his coun<U+017F>ell; and conjured him by the great God whom he adored, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him with his be<U+017F>t advi<U+017F>e.

Thus did this wi<U+017F>e man advi<U+017F>e him, and after he had committed him to heavens cu<U+017F>tody, he went home to his hou<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi> having con<U+017F>ulted long with him<U+017F>elfe what to do, at the la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve him punctually in every thing; and therefore one evening, having gotten a bladder full of blood clo<U+017F>e to his <U+017F>ide, under his clothes, he went to walk by the Sea-<U+017F>ide, with mo<U+017F>t of his dome<U+017F>ticks following him, and many others of the Towne, where after he had made a long and <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of his mi<U+017F>eries, and complained extreamly again<U+017F>t his refu<U+017F>all of poy<U+017F>on, faigning that he would not live any longer, he thru<U+017F>t a knife into his <U+017F>ide, and made the blood in the bladder run out in great abundance, <U+017F>o as every one thought him dead. Then getting from among<U+017F>t them, he threw him<U+017F>elfe into the Sea, leaving us his Cloak in our hands, <hi>Olimbres</hi> and I <U+017F>eeming, as if we endeavoured to hold him. It was now twilight, and he could <U+017F>wim very well, <U+017F>o as plunging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe over head, and <U+017F>wimming under water, we pre<U+017F>ently lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of him. Every one was <U+017F>tricken with wonder, <hi>Olimbres</hi> lamented extreamly, purpo<U+017F>ely to make it be believed, that his friend was dead: Then telling what his name was, the newes of his death was divulged far and neer. In the mean time, I went unto the place where I knew he would retire him<U+017F>elfe, and bringing him the habit of a Slave, and lodging him in a poor hou<U+017F>e, I accommodated him with all things requi<U+017F>ite.</p>
               <p>It hapned the next morning, <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>eeming to <U+017F>earch for the body of his friend, found the Corps of the good old Chirurgion, and bringing it unto his two Daughters, they rendred him the la<U+017F>t office of a Sepulcher, as if heaven would not let this happy old man want any dues that belonged unto men, after his death: His Daughters ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him a Tombe, and I, at their reque<U+017F>t, did write his Epitaph, which was fixed upon it. A few daies after, <hi>Olimbres</hi> <U+017F>ent all his Dome<U+017F>ticks, together with tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ur<U+017F>aces</hi>'s, and the two Daughters of the old Chirurgion, into <hi>Italy;</hi> and taking others, he went with his friend, di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed like a Slave, into <hi>Affrica,</hi> much de<U+017F>iring my company: But, <U+017F>ince my de<U+017F>tiny was, to obey him who brought me up, I would not di<U+017F>obey his will.</p>

Upon this word, every one going out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, they <U+017F>at down to <U+017F>upper, which being ended, and a good part of the night <U+017F>pent in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, they were all conducted to their Chambers, where having re<U+017F>ted them<U+017F>elves, they went the next morning to their own Homes, <U+017F>o <U+017F>atisfied with the courteous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and with the beauty and good behaviour of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that every one did highly commend them; but e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Hylas,</hi> who not being able to hold from extolling the perfections of his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, by fortune they met with <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> in the great Meadow, with <hi>Madonthe, Laonice, Pallinice, Cyrcinea,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> which expected their return, to hear a report of the beauty of <hi>Alexis,</hi> which they had already heard of. And <hi>Phillis</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Lycidas:</hi> Well, <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, how do you like this <U+017F>o much cryed up Beauty? I will not an<U+017F>wer you, <U+017F>aid he, untill you have asked <hi>Hylas.</hi> Well, Servant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> what reports will you afford us? And becau<U+017F>e he an<U+017F>wered not: What, Servant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he not <U+017F>peak unto your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? You my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, and I your Servant! No, no, if you think it, believe me, you are mi<U+017F>taken; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing le<U+017F><U+017F>e. How! Servant, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <U+017F>eemed to be troubled) will you not have me to be your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? Good <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, do not u<U+017F>e the word, Servant, and the word, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o familiarly, for they are not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable among<U+017F>t us. At what Game (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) have I lo<U+017F>t you, <hi>Hylas?</hi> At the Game of the <hi>Faire<U+017F>t,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he. Do you not know, that it was alwaies my cu<U+017F>tome, to leave tho<U+017F>e I loved, as <U+017F>oon as I found one that was fairer: Aske <hi>Florice, Cyrcenea, Palliuice, Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> if I did not <U+017F>o by them: If none of the<U+017F>e will tell you, then ask <hi>Phillis,</hi> your very good friend; for if <U+017F>he will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the truth, <U+017F>he will tell you, how I have left her for <hi>Alexis,</hi> who indeed is the faire<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t lovely, that ever I <U+017F>aw. Every one did laugh heartily at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, who <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Why, <U+017F>hepheard, are you then fully re<U+017F>olved to love me no longer? It is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you <U+017F>hould quit me for a Druide? But my comfort is, it will be long, before you can have any fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of your love; for <hi>Alexis</hi> cannot marry, untill her time with the <hi>Carnutans</hi> be expired. <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>miling and <U+017F>haking his head at this: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, you tell me a thing, that would make me in love with <hi>Alexis,</hi> if I were not <U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for ever <U+017F>ince I began to look upon women, I never loved any yet <U+017F>o, but I began to hate her, as <U+017F>oon as ever I thought of marriage: So as if <hi>Alexis</hi> be not content with her time, I will give her as much more, and yet love her. Now let me tell you, there is an odd kinde of ambition in my love, which I mu<U+017F>t by all means <U+017F>trive to <U+017F>atisfie. I have already loved Maides, Wives, and Widowes: I have courted my Inferiours, my Equalls, and my Superiours: I have <U+017F>erved fooles, crafty ones, and good ones: I have met with <U+017F>everity, courte<U+017F>y, and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, to either love or hatred: I have tried old ones, middle aged, and very children: I have liked the fair, the black, and the browne, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: I have made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto <U+017F>ome, that did love me; unto others, that did not love me: I have tryed all conditions, and all humours, that can be in women. But I mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53526:216"/>
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I never courted a Druide or a Ve<U+017F>tall before, I have been hitherto a Novi<U+017F>t in that holy Tribe; and I think, the gods have <U+017F>ent me this fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> to the end, I may make it my boa<U+017F>t, that I am the mo<U+017F>t perfect and experienced Lover that ever was None in the Company could forbear laughing. <hi>Florice,</hi> <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto him: <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, are you not afeard, that <hi>Tharamis</hi> will bla<U+017F>t you with lightning from heaven, for offering to court one that is dedicated unto him? Oh! <hi>Florice,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you that are <U+017F>o religiou<U+017F>ly devoted unto the gods, have not you dedicated your <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and yet you have had <hi>Theombres</hi> in your armes a thou<U+017F>and times, and never feared any bla<U+017F>ting with lightning from heaven? 'Tis true, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice,</hi> very faintly) but things that are ab<U+017F>olutely forbidden, do more offend the gods, then tho<U+017F>e which are indifferent. A very fine excu<U+017F>e indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and well found out; pray tell me, where do you finde, that the gods did ever forbid it? If you had ever <U+017F>een a Druide or a Ve<U+017F>tall received into their Orders, by their Antients, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you would not have asked me this que<U+017F>tion. Oh, Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do now under<U+017F>tand you very well; it is the old drie Druides that does forbid them, but yet they are no gods: It is a Law made only by men, men that are old, and not able to enjoy the plea<U+017F>ures of youth, and therefore are envious, and deny unto youth what their age is deprived of. Fie, <U+017F>hepheard, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis)</hi> mingle not things prophane with things <U+017F>acred, and con<U+017F>ider, that the gold of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple, which co<U+017F>t us <hi>Gaulians</hi> <U+017F>o dear, was dedicated unto him by men. Oh my good friend <hi>Tircis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how long is it <U+017F>ince you became <U+017F>o amorous? You, I <U+017F>ay, who were not wont to be contented with the Living, but would rake the Tombes and Monuments for one, whom it plea<U+017F>ed the gods to take unto them<U+017F>elves from among<U+017F>t men; you, that were not wont to be conver<U+017F>ant among<U+017F>t the living, but the dead, do you now come to talk of the gods, and of things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to living men? Oh, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> and <U+017F>ighed) how infinitely you wrong me; I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I do love <hi>Cleon,</hi> and I <U+017F>hall rather lo<U+017F>e the memory of my <U+017F>elfe, then of her and her perfections. But wherein do I offend the gods, or in my duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men? Would it not be infinite ingratitude to the gods, not to honour their mo<U+017F>t perfect work? And he were not a man, that would not love or forget that thing, which above any in the world is mo<U+017F>t worthy of love and memory.</p>
               <p>Thus the<U+017F>e Shepheards di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas</hi> related unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what he had <U+017F>een in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and how fair <hi>Alexis</hi> was. Truly, <U+017F>aid he, I hope, that I may without offence tell you, that <U+017F>he is the very perfect re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of my dear and dead Brother, when he was in his greate<U+017F>t beauty; for, I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in all my life <U+017F>ee two faces, no, nor any Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, repre<U+017F>ent a more exact re<U+017F>emblance. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> So true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that I know no difference between them, but in their habit; and to tell you truly, me thought <hi>Alexis</hi> to be a little fairer of the two. Oh heavens! <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> can you favour me <U+017F>o far, as to help my eyes unto this long'd for <U+017F>ight? Then turning to <hi>Diana,</hi> and whi<U+017F>pering her in the ear: I promi<U+017F>e you, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that if I can obtain the favour, I will go with her, and turn Druide. Oh god, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> never think of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation, or el<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olve, to take <hi>Phillis</hi> and me with you. Oh, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that is too unrea<U+017F>onable, for it would be too great a wrong unto <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas. Diana</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> made a <U+017F>igne unto her to be <U+017F>ilent, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be heard. After this, all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny retired to their own homes, re<U+017F>olving to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Adamas</hi> and the fair <hi>Alexis</hi> within three daies after: A terme, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> thought to be an age, <U+017F>o extreamly did <U+017F>he long for a <U+017F>ight of this <U+017F>o much beloved re<U+017F>emblance.
