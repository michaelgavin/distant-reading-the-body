         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Tran<U+017F>lation of this Book may
perhaps <U+017F>tand in as much need of
an Apology as another, to make <U+017F>ome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
for a great many Errors; but the
Tran<U+017F>lator profe<U+017F><U+017F>es, he has that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for it, that he had rather own
'em all, and leave it to the Readers
Di<U+017F>cretion to damn or forgive 'em, as he
plea<U+017F>es, than trouble him<U+017F>elf any more
about it.</p>
            <p>For one Excu<U+017F>e, among<U+017F>t a thou<U+017F>and
others us'd upon the<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions, he might
<U+017F>ay that the Tran<U+017F>lation <U+017F>uffers extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for want of Lei<U+017F>ure, but he has not
the Face to pretend <U+017F>uch a thing, when
<pb facs="tcp:57806:3"/>
'tis but too apparent that it <U+017F>uffers indeed
for want of a little Application. This
Negligence is his <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nhappine<U+017F>s, but too
late to be helpt now: Nay, what's wor<U+017F>e,
if it was to be done again, 'tis to be
fear'd he could not be prevaild on to
take the pains to revi<U+017F>e it, for
the Reputation of Writing never <U+017F>o cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</p>
            <p>As for the Work it <U+017F>elf; the Tran<U+017F>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
when he read it, fancy'd he found
<U+017F>omething more plea<U+017F>ant and entertaining
in it than ordinary, and that engag'd
him to make it <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> which when he
had once undertaken, he was no longer
at liberty to reject <U+017F>ome other things that
to him appear'd trifling enough. To
make amends for which it mu<U+017F>t be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t,
that thro the whole Book there is a
great Variety of very <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages,
and that mo<U+017F>t of 'em are very diverting.
If any doubts the truth of them, he is
referr'd to the <hi>French Preface,</hi> which is
<pb facs="tcp:57806:3"/>
writ on purpo<U+017F>e to ju<U+017F>tify the Author's
Sincerity. Tho after all, the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age about
his Birth is reckon'd by <U+017F>ome not only a
doubtful Story, but an Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility:
But perhaps he might him<U+017F>elf be impos'd
on in that; for 'tis no New Practice to
call <U+017F>uch Births Miraculous, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a little too <U+017F>oon for the Credit of
the Family.</p>
            <p>As for the Stile, if after what has
been <U+017F>aid the Reader will be <U+017F>o unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable,
as to expect the Language in
the Tran<U+017F>lation to be very pure and ju<U+017F>t,
he mu<U+017F>t be inform'd, that the Original in
that re<U+017F>pect is none of the mo<U+017F>t fini<U+017F>ht
pieces in its own Tongue. For tho the
Author was a per<U+017F>on of Quality, and of
extraordinary Parts and Addre<U+017F>s, yet
'twas his Misfortune, that his Education
was not only far from that of a Man of
Learning, but much inferior to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57806:4"/>
His Subject, is the Particularities of
his own Life, which requir'd no more
than a free, ea<U+017F>y, and natural Style,
and that he has for the mo<U+017F>t part ob<U+017F>erv'd
well enough. 'Tis <U+017F>ufficient then if the
Tran<U+017F>lator has not mi<U+017F>taken his Sen<U+017F>e,
and that 'tis hop'd he has not done, nor
in the main done him any great Injury.</p>

            <head>THE
French Publi<U+017F>hers
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> was a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o well
known, and dy'd <U+017F>o lately, that it <U+017F>eems almo<U+017F>t need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
to offer to ju<U+017F>tify any thing that he has menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in his <hi>Memoirs.</hi> There is none of tho<U+017F>e Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who knew him either at Court, or in the Camp, but
know that in his Conver<U+017F>ation, he was <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e from di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ing
the Truth, or relating any thing fictitious, that it
can never be imagin'd he <U+017F>hould be guilty of writing a
Fal<U+017F>ity, with a De<U+017F>ign to impo<U+017F>e upon the World. There has
not liv'd for the<U+017F>e many Ages a Man of greater Honour than
he was, which I do not <U+017F>peak, becau<U+017F>e I have ever profe<U+017F>t a
Friend<U+017F>hip for him, but becau<U+017F>e I am oblig'd to do him that
Ju<U+017F>tice. If therefore in the beginning of the<U+017F>e <hi>Memoirs,</hi> he
relates <U+017F>omething of his Father, which is very <U+017F>urprizing, the
Reader is not immediately from thence to call his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in que<U+017F>tion, as if it were not true. We are <U+017F>o us'd
every day to extraordinary Adventures, that none but tho<U+017F>e
who are unacquainted with <hi>Paris,</hi> are any longer <U+017F>urpriz'd
at them. There is not a Year pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, but this great City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
Subject of Sorrow to <U+017F>ome, while others laugh at
<pb facs="tcp:57806:5"/>
their Expence. Yet is the Story of his Brother-in-law and
Si<U+017F>ter not <U+017F>o very uncommon. How many Husbands have
pur<U+017F>u'd their Wives, and courted them to a Reconcilement,
when the Separation has not been upon the account of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as in this ca<U+017F>e; but upon <U+017F>uch ju<U+017F>t and good
grounds, as extreme Weakne<U+017F>s only could forget. I know
<U+017F>ome, that have been at a great deal of Co<U+017F>t and Pains to
have them<U+017F>elves declar'd Cuckolds, and it has been done
very much to their Satisfaction; yet afterwards have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>t
as great Impatience to have the Dear Spou<U+017F>e home
again, (tho a little faulty) as ever they <U+017F>hew'd De<U+017F>ire
for a Divorce. This is no more than what I know my
<U+017F>elf to be true; or el<U+017F>e it would appear more incredible,
than that a Man <U+017F>hould take his Wife again, whom he
never had any other rea<U+017F>on but to e<U+017F>teem. But perhaps it
may be objected, that the per<U+017F>on who we are talking of,
was turn'd Prie<U+017F>t, and after that ought not to have
taken his Wife again. But why not? Since the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
judg'd it lawful, and a Man of Honour has affirm'd
it; who<U+017F>e Sincerity too appears the more in this, that he
recounts tho<U+017F>e things of his own Family, which a great
many others in his place would have indu<U+017F>triou<U+017F>ly conceal'd.
And I will add this further proof of the Truth on't; that
happening t'other day to be in the Company of Mon<U+017F>ieur,
the Pre<U+017F>ident <hi>Bailleul,</hi> and my Mind running upon the<U+017F>e
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> I askt him if he did not remember <U+017F>uch a
Proce<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ome other particulars which the Count <hi>de
Rochefort</hi> had mention'd of him, and he told me, that
he remember'd it as perfectly well, as if the thing had been
done but that moment. After this can it po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bailleul</hi> being a per<U+017F>on of that noted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
that his Te<U+017F>timony alone is enough to convince the
mo<U+017F>t incredulous? Yet I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I was an Infidel my
<U+017F>elf, with re<U+017F>pect to what Mon<U+017F>ieur the <hi>Count</hi> tells us
of the <hi>Swi<U+017F>s:</hi> For who could ever imagine, there were
<pb facs="tcp:57806:5"/>
any people in Nature <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, as to take Puppits for
young Devils? Yet is there nothing more certainly true
than this. For I was not content only with inquiring the
Truth of it from <hi>Biroche,</hi> but from Mon<U+017F>ieut <hi>Du Mont</hi>
too, with whom I was very well acquainted. They both
own'd it to me, but in a different manner; for <hi>Biroche</hi>
made his Brags of it, as if he has <U+017F>hewn a great piece of
Wit; whereas <hi>Du Mont</hi> could not think of it without
flying out into <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as was a <U+017F>ign he had not yet
forgot his Di<U+017F>grace.</p>
            <p>If then the Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t in a Story,
which has <U+017F>o much the Air of a Fiction, how <U+017F>incere mu<U+017F>t
we conclude him in his other Relations? In effect, where
lies the Difficulty of believing what he <U+017F>ays of Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu?</hi> Are not all Mini<U+017F>ters of State my<U+017F>terious, or
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o at lea<U+017F>t, and was not that a quality which the
Cardinal affected above all things, as the Count <hi>de Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
takes very good notice? Is there any thing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
than what that Mini<U+017F>ter made <hi>Sauve</hi> to do; or is
there any thing more <U+017F>urprizing, than the Ambition of
that Man, who was content to <U+017F>acrifice his Wife to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Fortune? All which may <U+017F>erve for in<U+017F>tructions
for our own Conduct, which is one of the greate<U+017F>t advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
we can gain from the reading of any Book. I am
per<U+017F>waded too, that the Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> was not <U+017F>o
much induced to write out of vanity, to <U+017F>hew he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the private Intrigues of State, as out of a de<U+017F>ire to
render other People wi<U+017F>er by his Example: And I am the
more confirm'd in this opinion, when I reflect how often
he reproaches him<U+017F>elf for making <U+017F>o ill u<U+017F>e of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Richlieu</hi>'s favour, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>everely reprehends his
own Follies. However, <U+017F>hould the<U+017F>e <hi>Memoirs</hi> not prove
<U+017F>o very profitable, I am confident they will be found to be
very curious, di<U+017F>covering a great many things which are
no where el<U+017F>e to be met with. I believe too they will be
<pb facs="tcp:57806:6"/>
found to be very diverting, and that none will ever think
them tedious. But Friend<U+017F>hip perhaps may be thought to
have a large <U+017F>hare in this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and indeed the Author
of the<U+017F>e <hi>Memoirs,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf, were <U+017F>uch dear Friends,
that I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I have a <U+017F>trange Indulgence for any
thing of his; yet as I have not been the only per<U+017F>on that
has read 'em, but others have been of my Ta<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>hall
venture to declare 'em once again, the mo<U+017F>t agreeable
of their kind.</p>
            <p>There is another thing too I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, but from that
I know not how I <U+017F>hall be ab<U+017F>olv'd; I publi<U+017F>h here the<U+017F>e
<hi>Memoirs</hi> again<U+017F>t the La<U+017F>t Will and Intention of the
Author, who upon his Death, which happen'd in a month
or two after his Retirement, order'd me to <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s 'em. I
cannot imagine for what rea<U+017F>on, except that being then
upon the point of leaving the World, he was willing to
<U+017F>pare <U+017F>ome People, whom he had formerly had <U+017F>ome differences
with, and whom he had no great cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak well of.
But this did not appear to me a <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on to deprive
the Publick of a Work <U+017F>o curious; therefore <U+017F>uch as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

OF
The Count de Rochefort, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEtween <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>E<U+017F>tampes,</hi> on the Right hand
of <hi>Cha<U+017F>tres,</hi> lies a Ca<U+017F>tle call'd <hi>Olinville,</hi> which
had formerly been one of the Kings Hou<U+017F>es,
but now belongs to the Family of <hi>Marillac.</hi>
My Father going once to pay a vi<U+017F>it there, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Marillac,</hi> took my Mother
along with him, who was big, and above four months
and an half gone with Child: As they went, they
call'd at one Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Grigni</hi>'s, a Gentleman of the
Neighbourhood, where their Coachman having got
drunk, made bold to overturn the Coach at the very
gate of <hi>Olinville,</hi> tho the way was the <U+017F>moothe<U+017F>t and
be<U+017F>t in the World. By this accident, my Father,
in<U+017F>tead of the diver<U+017F>ion he expected there, met with
an inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible affliction: For my Mother, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<U+017F>ome hurt, having brought me into the world
the next day, liv'd but two days after it; to the
grief of the whole family, who had a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
for her. My Father was in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57806:7"/>
had it not been for Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
kill'd the Coachman: It was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible tho
to per<U+017F>wade him, but that he was guilty of the death
of my Mother, (as ca<U+017F>ually indeed he was) <U+017F>o he had
his Proce<U+017F>s made, but after two or three months Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment
he was acquitted.</p>
            <p>No body imagining that I could live, they took
care to have me immediately Baptiz'd: Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>De Marillac.</hi> and one Madam <hi>D' Arboville,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to be in the hou<U+017F>e, perform'd the Offices for me
at the Font. I was call'd <hi>Charles Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> which was
my Fathers Name, and given me to oblige him. They
took a Nur<U+017F>e for me there, whom my Father <U+017F>ent
with me to his Ca<U+017F>tle, which was at the entrance
into the Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and having <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
at <hi>Paris,</hi> went him<U+017F>elf thither. My Father having no
more Children, and every body believing (as I <U+017F>aid)
that I could hardly live, they all advis'd him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and he who was <U+017F>till young, and no hater of the
Sex, was ea<U+017F>ily prevail'd on. Several young Ladies
were propos'd to him of the be<U+017F>t Families in <hi>Paris;</hi>
but being de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee before he engag'd with any,
he found none that he lik'd; whether it was that none
of them were really fine Women, or that his Fate
had re<U+017F>erv'd for him the accident I am now to relate;
and for me the wor<U+017F>t Mother-in-law that ever was
in the world. However it was that he <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o
difficult, a relation of his who was Curate of one of
the be<U+017F>t Churches in <hi>Paris,</hi> and had the Character
of a very holy man, as indeed he was; came ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly
to tell him, that he had done his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s for
him, in finding a young Lady, very well made, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome,
rich, vertuous, and of quality; in <U+017F>hort, a
Jewel for the age, that was <U+017F>o extremely corrupted.
Tho my Father knew 'twas a dangerous thing to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57806:7"/>
take a Woman on the word of a Prie<U+017F>t, yet the <U+017F>ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Curate <U+017F>atisfy'd him, as knowing, that there
was no general rule without exception; he made him
this an<U+017F>wer, That he knew better than him<U+017F>elf what
was fit for him; that he was extreamly oblig'd to
him for his kindne<U+017F>s; and for the Lady, he would
make no enquiries of her, after the character he had
given her: The Curate return'd, That this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his was the cau<U+017F>e that he had preferr'd him
to many of his other relations, who<U+017F>e fortunes
would have been made by <U+017F>uch a Match: That the
Lady would have an E<U+017F>tate of twenty thou<U+017F>and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
<hi>per annum:</hi> That <U+017F>he was of the Family <hi>De la
Force,</hi> one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable hou<U+017F>es among
tho<U+017F>e of the pretended Reform'd Religion; of
which <U+017F>he had lately made her abjuration to him;
that as <U+017F>oon as he had marry'd her, he might get the
E<U+017F>tate of the Family into his hands, of which the
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion was vacant; and for her Mother, he might
ea<U+017F>ily oblige her by his addre<U+017F>s; that his Wife's
changing her Religion <U+017F>hould be no prejudice to him.</p>
            <p>It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ay how this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e charm'd
my Father, he was impatient to <U+017F>ee the Lady; and
the Curate having <U+017F>how'd her to him at the Convent
where <U+017F>he was retreated, he return'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>mitten that
he could not re<U+017F>t till the affair was concluded: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as he was a Man not to be fool'd, or at lea<U+017F>t
thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>uch, he wrote to <U+017F>ome Friends of
his at <hi>Agen,</hi> where the Ladies E<U+017F>tate was <U+017F>aid to be;
and they giving him an account that <U+017F>he was a very
virtuous Lady, had a very good Fortune, and was
only retir'd to <hi>Paris</hi> to make her Abjuration; he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her, fancying him<U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t man in the
world: His happine<U+017F>s continued about three weeks,
in which time, no young Lover could have care<U+017F>t
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57806:8"/>
his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s with more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion than he did his new
Bride: He carried her to the Ball, to the Play, to
the publick Walks, and in <U+017F>hort, when ever he was
oblig'd to be ab<U+017F>ent from her but an hour or two, he
would return with <U+017F>uch eagerne<U+017F>s as was almo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
for a Husband; every body was <U+017F>urpriz'd
that enjoyment had not moderated his tran<U+017F>ports: but
he told all tho<U+017F>e who hinted any <U+017F>uch thing to him,
that if it us'd to be <U+017F>o with re<U+017F>pect to other Wives, it
was not <U+017F>o with him, <U+017F>ince his had nothing in her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ting the Appetite.</p>
            <p>In all this hurry I was ea<U+017F>ily forgotten, and if <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I was <U+017F>poken of, it was only to ask if I was not
yet dead; for my Father not doubting but he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>oon have Children by his new Wife, and retaining
no more the remembrance of my Mother, began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to advance the <U+017F>entiments of tenderne<U+017F>s that are
<U+017F>o common to tho<U+017F>e of a <U+017F>econd Bed.</p>
            <p>He believ'd him<U+017F>elf now at that pitch of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
as to be exempt from the attacks of Fortune, and
dreamt of nothing but how to pa<U+017F>s away the time
till the Spring <U+017F>hould come on, when they re<U+017F>olv'd
to make a <U+017F>hort Journey to view his Wives E<U+017F>tate;
in the mean time he pre<U+017F>ented her with a very rich
Coach, and all things agreeable. But all this could
not divert her, <U+017F>till there appear'd on her face an air
of Di<U+017F>content, and a melancholly <U+017F>o deeply rooted as
extreamly afflicted my Father; he was every moment
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her to tell him if <U+017F>he wanted any thing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that <U+017F>he needed but to <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>ince the man
who<U+017F>e heart <U+017F>he <U+017F>o entirely po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t could deny her
nothing; joyning to this obliging di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>t
Care<U+017F><U+017F>es in the world: But one day as he was
treating her in this <U+017F>ort, he perceiv'd <U+017F>omething more
than ordinary under her Shift upon her <U+017F>houlder, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57806:8"/>
demands of her what it was: But <U+017F>he in<U+017F>tead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wering
him <U+017F>trove to get from him, which increa<U+017F>ing
his <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, he took hold of her and would <U+017F>ee what
it was, then <U+017F>he us'd intreaties with him, told him it
was nothing, and tried again to get loo<U+017F>e from him,
but finding it in vain <U+017F>he <U+017F>truggl'd with him, nor was
it but with great difficulty that he pull'd down her
Shift, which di<U+017F>cover'd to him a thing, that had he
not been in Bed had <U+017F>trook him to the ground, he
<U+017F>aw (<U+017F>hall I dare to <U+017F>peak it) the fair
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a<note n="*" place="margin">The mark with which they brand Malefactors in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> Flower-de-luce,
which at once undeceiv'd him in the
good opinion he had had of her; <U+017F>he
who had <U+017F>o often prov'd the force of
her Care<U+017F><U+017F>es, attempted to calm him
by a ki<U+017F>s, and he who was become in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, <U+017F>uffer'd
her without the lea<U+017F>t notice; but in a moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
him<U+017F>elf, <hi>Go infamous Creature,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>if I
cannot have <U+017F>o much ju<U+017F>tice as to have you hang'd, you
<U+017F>hall certainly die by my own hand:</hi> He got up in all ha<U+017F>te
and immediately finds out the Curate, and treats him
with the wor<U+017F>t Language that rage and de<U+017F>pair could
in<U+017F>pire him with; but <U+017F>eeing that all this was to no
pnrpo<U+017F>e, he demands of him what remedy he would
pretend to apply to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e he had procur'd him.</p>
            <p>The poor Curate could not <U+017F>oon be per<U+017F>waded to
believe him, but being <U+017F>atisfi'd at la<U+017F>t that it was but
too true, he threw him<U+017F>elf at his feet begging his
pardon, and lifting up his eyes made a thou<U+017F>and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
upon the abominable wickedne<U+017F>s of the
woman, who had under covert of Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion made
him a party to her impo<U+017F>tures. But my Father <U+017F>till
continuing almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tracted, <U+017F>o that the people began
to croud about them, a Prie<U+017F>t that had formerly
been an Advocate <U+017F>tept to him and told him, 'twas
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57806:9"/>
indeed a <U+017F>ad Ca<U+017F>e but not altogether incurable, that
<U+017F>he had counterfeited her Name, and therefore the
Marriage was void; that he had no more to do but
immediately to enter his Action, and tho he might
meet with <U+017F>ome difficulty (the Parliament being
very nice in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es) yet he mu<U+017F>t follow it clo<U+017F>e,
and needed not to doubt the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. As in a general
Shipwrack men catch at any thing that's likely to <U+017F>ave
them, my Father embrac'd this advice as if it had
been <U+017F>ent from Heaven, and running directly to the
<note n="*" place="margin">The Palace is in <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>We<U+017F>tmin<U+017F>ter-Hall</hi> is here the place for the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice.</note> Palace, he con<U+017F>ults with three of the
mo<U+017F>t able Councel, who all of them
were of the <U+017F>ame opinion; but told him
withal that it would be needful for him
to make <U+017F>ome Friends, e<U+017F>pecially if he
found <U+017F>he had any body to <U+017F>tand by
her; this di<U+017F>turb'd my Father above all,
who was a<U+017F>ham'd to make u<U+017F>e of his Friends about
<U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s as this, and 'twas <U+017F>everal days before
he could be brought to it, till he found a con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
per<U+017F>on engage in the affair for her, which oblig'd
him to do that which otherwi<U+017F>e he would never have
done.</p>
            <p>But to his <U+017F>orrow he found that <U+017F>he had out-witted
him there too, that <U+017F>he had not chang'd her Name,
but was really call'd <hi>Madelain de Caumont,</hi> ju<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he
had <U+017F>ign'd the Contract, and had al<U+017F>o given the true
names of her Father and Mother; and all the fal<U+017F>ifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
they could fix upon her, was, that <U+017F>he had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
her Father with the Title of Knight, and Lord
of <U+017F>everal Mannors, and her Mother with that of a
very great Lady, in<U+017F>tead of what they really were, a
Miller and the Millers Wife. The ca<U+017F>e being <U+017F>o ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nice, they advis'd my Father to treat with the young
woman for a <U+017F>um of Money to con<U+017F>ent to a decree
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57806:9"/>
again<U+017F>t the Marriage; but her Friend owing my
Father an ill turn on the account of an old quarrel,
and glad of this opportunity to pay it him, would
hearken to no accommodation; upon which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was advis'd to engage the Judge Advocate on
his <U+017F>ide, and to pro<U+017F>ecute her for an abu<U+017F>e to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for indeed <U+017F>he had made a publick Abjuration,
whereas <U+017F>he was born a Catholick, and had always
been <U+017F>o; this trick of the Law put both her and her
friend to a <U+017F>tand: She ab<U+017F>conded immediately, and
<U+017F>et <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons to treat privately with my Father,
who by this means got clear of her for a thou<U+017F>and
Crowns, whereas before he had offer'd her two
thou<U+017F>and.</p>
            <p>My Relations, who <U+017F>aw plainly that this Match
would have ruin'd me, were not <U+017F>orry for his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
hoping that this would teach him <U+017F>ome
wit; but he was hardly out of one error before he
had like to have fallen into another. He Lodg'd at
a rich Merchants at the entrance into St. <hi>Dennis-<U+017F>treet,</hi>
for the convenience of being near the Palace, who
had in the hou<U+017F>e an only Daughter between Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and Twenty years of age, tollerably hand<U+017F>om,
but very well made; he had been extreamly pleas'd
with her Conver<U+017F>ation, which very much diverted
him when he had mo<U+017F>t need of it: Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ended his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he thought he could not do
better than to take up with her, who was a Woman
of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, brought up under the eye of her Mother,
no wanton Coquet, that had an E<U+017F>tate, and who
would think her <U+017F>elf honour'd in marrying a Per<U+017F>on
of Quality. Her Father and Mother had <U+017F>everal
times taken occa<U+017F>ion to let him under<U+017F>tand, that
having no more Children they <U+017F>hould be very
glad to <U+017F>ee her well <U+017F>ettled; and he believing that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57806:10"/>
this would be a per<U+017F>on very fit for his turn, he breaks

he was overjoyed to find her <U+017F>o favourably inclin'd,

and Mother, he mov'd it to them, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
their con<U+017F>ent.</p>
            <p>As he had before made more ha<U+017F>te than good

Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> being one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
of his Friends, he was fir<U+017F>t acquainted with

him to a Match that <U+017F>eem'd di<U+017F>honourable to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and to that end fail'd not to magnifie the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on

headlong upon <U+017F>uch an affair, in which he might
perhaps find <U+017F>omething to di<U+017F>like that he yet knew not

tho <U+017F>he had a good E<U+017F>tate, was <U+017F>o willing, becau<U+017F>e
young Girls are all willing enough to be married;
but that her Parents, who were Citizens, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
had a natural aver<U+017F>ion to a Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o very forward, <U+017F>eem'd to him to

you think you are marrying a Maid, what if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
chance to be a Widow? Had it been any body but
Mr. <hi>de Marillac,</hi> my Father would never have born
this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with any patience; but having been
born, as it were, with a re<U+017F>pect for him, he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57806:10"/>
that there was nothing to be fear'd of that
<U+017F>ort, and that he would venture it. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Marillac</hi> told him <U+017F>miling, That 'twas his own bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and if he had <U+017F>aid any thing in it, 'twas purely
for that he thought him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to it; not only
as he was his Relation, but al<U+017F>o from the Friend<U+017F>hip
which had always been between the two Families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The matter re<U+017F>ted there, and my Father re<U+017F>olved
to go through with it, notwith<U+017F>tanding all this good
coun<U+017F>el. There was in the Country a Cou<U+017F>in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his, a jolly old Fellow, a Batchelour, who
had never been <U+017F>o fond of marrying as he; and who
de<U+017F>ign'd to leave his E<U+017F>tate to our Family. My Father
<U+017F>ends for him, and the Old Gentleman, before he
would appear, would needs have <U+017F>ome fine Cloaths;
and talking to his Taylor about the occa<U+017F>ion of his
coming to Town, that it was to the Wedding of
his Cou<U+017F>in and Heir, who was to be married to the
Daughter of <U+017F>uch a Merchant.</hi> Ble<U+017F>s me Sir! <hi><U+017F>aid
the Taylor,</hi> What does he mean? Is there no other
Women in <hi>Paris? This <U+017F>tartled the Old Man, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him why he talkt at that rate?</hi> Why Sir, <hi><U+017F>ays he,</hi>
<U+017F>he has had a Child by one of her Fathers Prentices; but
I <U+017F>hould not have <U+017F>poke of it, Sir, for it was but One, and
I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is very hone<U+017F>t <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lo<U+017F>e her Reputation, I was re<U+017F>olv'd never to have <U+017F>poke of it;
but that 'tis a thou<U+017F>and pities, that an honest good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<U+017F>hould be cheated; for <U+017F>he not only continues her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
but 'tis come to that pa<U+017F>s, that there's hardly a
day comes over her head, but <U+017F>he is to be <U+017F>een at a certain
place, right again<U+017F>t my Hou<U+017F>e; <U+017F>he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, that
<U+017F>he fancies <U+017F>he is not to be known, but <U+017F>he forgets that I

have formerly dealt with her Father, and know her well
enough.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and the freedom and hone<U+017F>ty of
the Taylor, very much <U+017F>urpriz'd our Cou<U+017F>in; he <U+017F>ent
pre<U+017F>ently for my Father, and repeating this <U+017F>tory, askt
him what he meant, by medling with <U+017F>uch a creature.
My Father lookt upon it all as Malice and Lyes;
but the Old Man <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olute, told him
in a rage, that for his part, he would not come to the
Wedding, and be<U+017F>ides that, would di<U+017F>inherit him if
he proceeded any further in the matter. Yet my
Father <U+017F>lighting all his threatnings, comes the <U+017F>ame
day, and brings the Contract of Marriage for him to
<U+017F>ign; in<U+017F>tead of which, he <U+017F>natcht it out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarys
hands, and tore it in a thou<U+017F>and pieces; and
not content with that, goes immediately to Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Marillac,</hi> tells him the whole <U+017F>tory, and begs him
to interpo<U+017F>e his Authority to prevent <U+017F>o <U+017F>candalous a
thing. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> <U+017F>tepping with him into
his Coach, they came together to my Father, and
told him, That knowing how ob<U+017F>tinate he was, they
did not come to de<U+017F>ire him quite to break off the
match, but to per<U+017F>uade him to inform him<U+017F>elf of
the truth; that perhaps the<U+017F>e reports might be fal<U+017F>e,
but he mu<U+017F>t own that they ought not to be neglected;
that they only de<U+017F>ign'd to open his Eyes, and if
they could not make the thing plain to him, he was
at his Liberty; that they de<U+017F>ired but one thing of him,
which was, that he would pretend extraordinary bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
oblig'd him to go to his Hou<U+017F>e in the Country
for a few days, during which time, they offer'd to
di<U+017F>cover the truth for him, or if not, they were
content he <U+017F>hould proceed.</p>
            <p>This was too rea<U+017F>onable a reque<U+017F>t to be denied,
<U+017F>o my Father having taken leave of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57806:11"/>
eight days, upon his promi<U+017F>e to return then without
fail, he went and lodg'd privately at the Taylors,
where he plac'd him<U+017F>elf as Centinel, to watch for
what he hardly dar'd to <U+017F>ee; 'twas but the next day
that he very fairly <U+017F>aw his Lady, muffled up in her
Scarf, going into the Bawdyhou<U+017F>e; but not tru<U+017F>ting
his Eyes at that di<U+017F>tance, and through the Gla<U+017F>s, he
goes down, and throwing his Cloak over his Face,
he <U+017F>talks up and down in the <U+017F>treet, till <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
come out; he knew her again well enough, but as
if he would fain believe it was not <U+017F>he, he follow'd
her to her Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly there might be <U+017F>ome other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that hou<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>till ju<U+017F>tify'd her in his thoughts,
till he <U+017F>hould be inform'd how it was: But the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
having <U+017F>atisfy'd him of the contrary, as al<U+017F>o the
Taylor, he was re<U+017F>olv'd not to be convinc'd unle<U+017F>s he
could <U+017F>ee even what <U+017F>he did there with his own eyes:
To which purpo<U+017F>e he goes him<U+017F>elf to that hone<U+017F>t
place, where he <U+017F>oon got acquaintance, and for his
Money they brought him a Girl; he would not ask
for another, for fear of giving <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, but paid her
very generou<U+017F>ly, and <U+017F>o from that time pa<U+017F>t for one
of their be<U+017F>t Cu<U+017F>tomers. The next day he came
again, and having de<U+017F>ir'd them to <U+017F>how him <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was extraordinary, they brought him the
per<U+017F>on he wi<U+017F>ht for, or fear'd rather; for at the <U+017F>ight
of her he was <U+017F>o toucht, as made him cry like a Child;
and going out without <U+017F>peaking one word to her,
took Hor<U+017F>e and rode home to his own hou<U+017F>e, without

            <p>But it is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a thing to get out of the

<U+017F>aid to him, to <U+017F>ign the Contract, they fetcht him
back <U+017F>ore again<U+017F>t his will, to clear him<U+017F>elf of the

again<U+017F>t him for two thou<U+017F>and Franks, with
Damages and Intere<U+017F>t. He never paid any thing in

Appeal to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and con<U+017F>ulted with his
Lawyers, <U+017F>eeing he was like to be ca<U+017F>t, but all this
did but encrea<U+017F>e both his <U+017F>orrow and his debt; for
the <U+017F>ame trick that had helpt him before, undid him

he was forced to pay three thou<U+017F>and.</p>

But it being decreed (as I <U+017F>aid) that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

married a Per<U+017F>on of Quality in the Country, who <U+017F>o
ma<U+017F>ter'd his temper, that <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner come

too: I was carried back to <hi>Olinville,</hi> on purpo<U+017F>e, as I
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that as that place had been fatal to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it might be no better to me; I was kept there
a whole year before my Nur<U+017F>e ever heard a word
from my Father, tho <U+017F>he had writ <U+017F>everal Letters to
him, and her Husband had gone him<U+017F>elf to his
Hou<U+017F>e; but at la<U+017F>t one of his Carters pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing near
the Town, <U+017F>ent to tell my Nur<U+017F>e, that he had order
to leave with her about twelve Bu<U+017F>hels of Wheat:
As if that had been enough to <U+017F>atisfie her for my
keeping; and to avoid being askt for Money, they let
me lye there another whole year, without enquiring
whether I was alive or dead: The poor people with
whom I was, notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, us'd me like
their own Child, whether taken with the little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57806:12"/>
of my behaviour, or becau<U+017F>e they had no
Children them<U+017F>elves, I know not, for they could
have no other rea<U+017F>on for it.</p>
            <p>My Father in the mean time forgot me with le<U+017F>s
difficulty, for that he had one Son already by my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
and <U+017F>he was ready to lye down of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet he could not avoid being often askt by
the Neighbours what was become of me; my
Mother had her an<U+017F>wer readier than my Father,
(who was <U+017F>omething puzzl'd with the<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions)
and would reply briskly that I was well, but they
did not fetch me home becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould not bring the
memory of my Mother into his mind; none but
Sots could be wheedl'd with <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer, and
my Mothers Relations living above eighty Leagues
off, and having no body to regard me, I continu'd
three years longer with my Nur<U+017F>e, and I believe
<U+017F>hould have been there <U+017F>till had it not been for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Marillac;</hi> who <U+017F>eeing me at Ma<U+017F>s at <hi>Olinville,</hi>
asked notwith<U+017F>tanding the poor plight I was in, if I
was not his Cou<U+017F>in <hi>R</hi>'s Son? I had always a good
heart, and when I found my Nur<U+017F>e would not an<U+017F>wer

told him that I was indeed the Son of Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>L. C. De Rochefort,</hi> but that it had been my misfortune
never to have <U+017F>een him that I remembred: my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
pleas'd him, tho it was nothing but what I had
learnt by hearing my Nur<U+017F>e <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o; however being
a brisk Boy, and if I may <U+017F>ay it, genteel enough, he
made one of his Pages lead me to his Ca<U+017F>tle, where
he order'd me to be cloath'd <U+017F>uitable to my quality;
and having kept me there till he was oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

My Father receiv'd me becau<U+017F>e he could not help
it, but much again<U+017F>t his will I am <U+017F>ure, for he u<U+017F>ed
me <U+017F>o roughly the very day I came to him, that as
young as I was, I could plainly <U+017F>ee he did not much
care for me; if I had dar'd, I would have askt him
the rea<U+017F>on of it, and leave al<U+017F>o to return to my
Nur<U+017F>e, where I had received quite contrary u<U+017F>age;
but being afraid to open my mouth, I <U+017F>tood in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as if I had not belong'd to the Family, while
they care<U+017F>t and fondled one of her Children, tho he
was as mangy and <U+017F>cabby as a Hound; this madded
me intolerably, for being now almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix years old,
and beginning to have <U+017F>ome knowledge of matters,
I was ready to bur<U+017F>t with <U+017F>pleen. I liv'd thus how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
about a year and a half, eating with the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
having no countenance from any body but
from our Curate, who was a very good man; I
pray'd him to teach me to read, for they never
thought of putting me to School, and the Curate
was <U+017F>o pleas'd with my motion, coming from my
<U+017F>elf, that he took a great deal of pains with me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omuch
that in three or four months I could read
perfectly in any <U+017F>ort of Books.</p>
            <p>Every day my Mother-in-law plagu'd me with
one thing or another, and not only did me all the
mi<U+017F>chief <U+017F>he could, but told an hundred Lies of me
to my Father, to <U+017F>et him again<U+017F>t me; and my Father,
who did not much care for me, believ'd all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid,
and would often beat me without knowing for what,
which made me <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate that I re<U+017F>olved to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
my <U+017F>elf. There was a Weed in the Garden
which they had often told me was poi<U+017F>on, I took
<U+017F>ome of it; and after <U+017F>aying my Prayers I eat enough
to have kill'd me twice over, if I had not happily
wanted wit to know Hemlock from another Herb;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57806:13"/>
or, as I have often thought, that I was guided
even by a Miracle to mi<U+017F>take, for I was <U+017F>o far from
having any <U+017F>ymptoms of one that was poi<U+017F>on'd, that
it never <U+017F>o much as made me <U+017F>ick; I had newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to go to Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and therefore could not
conceal it from the Curate, who chid me <U+017F>everely,
laying before me the heinou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>in, and
charg'd me to ask God forgivene<U+017F>s, and made me
promi<U+017F>e him never to do <U+017F>o any more without fir<U+017F>t
telling him of it.</p>
            <p>The cruelty of my Mother-in-law and the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of my Father, not only continuing but encrea<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
truly I ev'n re<U+017F>olv'd to run away; and <U+017F>o wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for an opportunity, I told the Curate my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who told me I was fit for nothing at that age,
being but eight years old; and therefore per<U+017F>waded
me to bear a little longer, till I was fit to go into
the Army; but that being a long time, I told him
re<U+017F>olutely that I neither could nor would endure it:
He finding that unle<U+017F>s I was prevented I <U+017F>hould
quickly be gone, acquaints my Father with it, who
<U+017F>eeming not to believe it, told him he <U+017F>hould not
trouble him <U+017F>elf about me, but let me go if I would;
the Curate <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o unnatural could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
weeping, and taking me in his arms entreated
me once more to have a little patience; but finding
it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>hake my re<U+017F>olution, he pull'd out of
his Pocket two Crowns and gave them to me, telling
me that he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould want them, and was
<U+017F>orry he was not in a condition to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me better;
<U+017F>o praying God to ble<U+017F>s me, told me I was always to
remember that I was born a Gentleman, which
oblig'd me to <U+017F>uffer a thou<U+017F>and deaths rather than
to do a ba<U+017F>e action, or any thing unworthy of my
quality. My de<U+017F>ign was to find out Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57806:14"/>
               <hi>Marillac,</hi> from whom I had already receiv'd <U+017F>o much
kindne<U+017F>s; but there happening at that time to be a
Troop of Gyp<U+017F>ies in our Village I fell in with them,
and asking them if they would take me with
them, they told me with all their hearts, if I were
able to travel.</p>
            <p>This was enough to make me one of the Gang,
and having left our hou<U+017F>e without taking leave of
any body, and <U+017F>oon forgetting the good advice of the
Curate, I began that very day, like a true Gyp<U+017F>ie, to
<U+017F>teal all the Cocks and Hens I could lay my hands
on, not regarding that it was but at my Fathers door,
and that all the Farmers thereabouts were his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:
Thus I went on without giving my <U+017F>elf leave
to think what I was doing; and every one having
got his booty they were to bring it to the Captain,
who <U+017F>eeing me have <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even Fowls for my <U+017F>hare,
gave me a dram of the Bottle and told the re<U+017F>t what
a hopeful beginning I had made, and that in time I
<U+017F>hould make a brave fellow: we fea<U+017F>ted that Night
at the expence of the Country, and as liberty is
<U+017F>weete<U+017F>t to tho<U+017F>e who have been under con<U+017F>traint,
I thought my <U+017F>elf in Heaven in compari<U+017F>on of the
life I liv'd before.</p>
            <p>I led this wretched <U+017F>ort of Life almo<U+017F>t five years,
in which time we traver<U+017F>t not only all over <hi>France</hi>
but many other Countries; at la<U+017F>t a <U+017F>mall misfortune
befalling us (only that <U+017F>ome of our Society chanc'd
to be hang'd) we were forc'd to take refuge in our
Native Country; <U+017F>o we return'd into <hi>France</hi> through
the Province of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and taking the Road to
<hi>Dijon</hi> we came into the Country of <hi>Lyonne,</hi> and from
thence into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and <U+017F>o into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> till at
la<U+017F>t we came to the County of <hi>Foix:</hi> Here we thought
our <U+017F>elves <U+017F>ecure, for the Country being Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57806:14"/>
would the better <U+017F>helter us we fancy'd from
the Pea<U+017F>ants, if we found them <U+017F>o uncivil as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
our Thieveries: but we had taken wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures,
and they were too cunning for us, for the very
fir<U+017F>t Night, while we were all <U+017F>catter'd here and
there, after our Game, they came upon us and
plundred our Baggage: this happen'd to us by the
neglect of tho<U+017F>e we had left to look after it, who
fooli<U+017F>hly running after <U+017F>ome Fowls left on purpo<U+017F>e
by the Pea<U+017F>ants to draw them from their charge,
they who had plac'd them<U+017F>elves in Ambu<U+017F>cade <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
our Camp and ruin'd our whole Army; and
to add to our misfortune they had penn'd up all their
Fowls, <U+017F>o that tho we came back very much fatigu'd,
we were forc'd to take up our Lodging on the hard
ground, and without our Supper.</p>
            <p>This Life began to grow irk<U+017F>om to me at la<U+017F>t,
tho I was pleas'd with it a while when I knew no
better; for as my under<U+017F>tanding encrea<U+017F>t I began to
be a<U+017F>ham'd of my <U+017F>elf, remembring my Birth and
what that requir'd of me; I cry'd often by my <U+017F>elf,
and finding no body to con<U+017F>ult with, I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of the want of good advice; at la<U+017F>t calling to mind
what the Curate had <U+017F>aid to me at my coming away,
I <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly askt my <U+017F>elf, <hi>Is this the Life of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thought, which had not <U+017F>o much as once
came into my head before, made <U+017F>uch an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
upon me that I re<U+017F>olv'd to de<U+017F>ert, and being <U+017F>ent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
as u<U+017F>ual, I took that opportunity to get away;
<U+017F>o making to the Mountains of <hi>Cap<U+017F>i,</hi> I entred <hi>Rou<U+017F>illon</hi>
by <hi>Ville Franche;</hi> as I went I <U+017F>aw on my right hand
<hi>Canigout,</hi> one of the highe<U+017F>t of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> on the top
of which is a Lake, with abundance of very good
Fi<U+017F>h; but that which is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange is, that if one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57806:15"/>
throw a <U+017F>tone into it, it pre<U+017F>ently falls a raining: I
askt the people thereabouts the rea<U+017F>on, but they
could not tell me.</p>
            <p>I had hitherto kept the Curates two Crowns in
my Pocket, and they did me <U+017F>pecial <U+017F>ervice at this
juncture. My de<U+017F>ign was to li<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf in the fir<U+017F>t
Company of Souldiers I could meet with, and did
not que<U+017F>tion but I <U+017F>hould be entertain'd, for they did
not mea<U+017F>ure Souldiers by inches in tho<U+017F>e days. My
Gyp<U+017F>ies complexion made me pa<U+017F>s among the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
for a Native of the Country; and tho we had
War with <hi>Spain</hi> at that time, yet they neither
<U+017F>topt me at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> nor at <hi>Sal<U+017F>es;</hi> at la<U+017F>t I got to
<hi>Locates,</hi> which was our Frontier on that <U+017F>ide, and
li<U+017F>ted in the Governours Company, who was Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>De St. Aunais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was not a Party made out again<U+017F>t the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on
of <hi>Sal<U+017F>es</hi> but I would be one, and having learnt
a little <hi>Spani<U+017F>h,</hi> I fancy'd that looking <U+017F>o like a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
I might have an advantage one time or other to
do <U+017F>omething that might di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf: for I
mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay I began to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e the life of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldier, and Ambition was <U+017F>o got into my
Crown, tho but 15 years old, that I could not <U+017F>leep
quietly for dreaming of great things: I askt leave
however of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De St. Aunais,</hi> and he gave it
me, but <U+017F>eeing me come home always and nothing
done, <hi>Souldier,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>you don't do well, a Man <U+017F>hould
rather lo<U+017F>e his Ears than do as you do; we may <U+017F>ee our
Enemies when we will, but he that asks leave to <U+017F>ee them
mu<U+017F>t go near them. I have been near enough, Sir,</hi> return'd I,
<hi>but we were too many of us, and I don't intend to <U+017F>hare the
honour I <U+017F>hall get with a whole Company. Why, how many
were you?</hi> <U+017F>aid he: <hi>We were eleven, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>and that
was too many by nine; but if you plea<U+017F>e to let me go again</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57806:15"/>
               <hi>to morrow with only my Comrade, you <U+017F>hall have no cau<U+017F>e
to reproach me. Won't you run away then?</hi> <U+017F>aid the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:
<hi>If I had a mind to run away, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>I
would never come to ask leave: I have been twice up to the
Enemies Palli<U+017F>ades, and if I had intended to have gone
over, no body could have hindred me.</hi> This boldne<U+017F>s
pleas'd him, and he ask'd me who I was? I told
him if I <U+017F>ucceeded in my de<U+017F>ign I would give him
an account, but if not I would wait for a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opportunity: This an<U+017F>wer pleas'd him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>till, and concluding by my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e that I was
<U+017F>ome body more than ordinary, he lov'd me from
that moment, and 'twas not long before he gave me
proofs of it.</p>
            <p>Having leave to go out the next day, and being
come within two Mu<U+017F>quet <U+017F>hot of <hi>Sal<U+017F>es,</hi> I made my
Comrade lie down in a Ditch while I advanc'd a
little nearer, and having ob<U+017F>erv'd when I was out
before that an Officer of the Garri<U+017F>on, who had an
intrigue with a Wench, us'd to meet her in the
Ruines of an old hou<U+017F>e, I thought to have hid my
<U+017F>elf in the <U+017F>ame hou<U+017F>e, but I had ob<U+017F>erv'd too that he
always <U+017F>ent a Souldier a little before him to <U+017F>ee if the
Coa<U+017F>t was clear, and I was loth to run the hazard
of failing in my Enterprize; but having pitcht upon
a place for my Ambu<U+017F>cade, I made as if I was
wa<U+017F>hing of Clothes; <U+017F>till keeping an Eye upon the
place; at la<U+017F>t out comes the Souldier, and having <U+017F>cout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in every corner, he had no <U+017F>ooner made his report,
but I perceiv'd <hi>Madamoi<U+017F>elle</hi> coming one way, and
<hi>Mr. Officer</hi> another; but while they were warm at it, I
ru<U+017F>ht in with a Pi<U+017F>tol in each hand, and in this <U+017F>urprize
he <U+017F>uffer'd me to di<U+017F>arm him as tamely as a Lamb:
after which <hi>I</hi> bid him walk before me, and told him,
if he offer'd to <U+017F>peak a word, I would <U+017F>hoot him into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57806:16"/>
the Guts: He did not think fit to try if I was a
man of my word, and I thinking it proper to bring
his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s along with me, if 'twere only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her giving the Alarm, I brought them to the
place where I had po<U+017F>ted my Comrade, who
having joyn'd me, and thereby taken from them all
hopes of e<U+017F>cape, they were very di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate; but
for my part I was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported, that I hardly knew
what I did: we marcht in this figure a long hour,
till my Comrade, who took a fancy to the Girl, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were out of danger of the Enemy, would
go no further, till he had had a touch with her; I
askt him if he was mad, but he only laughing at
me, was very fairly going to work with her. This put
me into a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but finding he was re<U+017F>olv'd upon
his de<U+017F>ign, I threatned to <U+017F>hoot him. He told me he
was ready for me, and pre<U+017F>ented his Pi<U+017F>tol at me, I
was not <U+017F>tartled at all, but coming boldly up to him
with my Pri<U+017F>oner in one hand, and my Pi<U+017F>tol in the
other, the Brute fir'd at me, but mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing me, and
expecting my return, made all the ha<U+017F>te he could to
get away: I did not much care to follow him, but
made the be<U+017F>t of my way, for all my fear was he
would run over to the Garri<U+017F>on of <hi>Sal<U+017F>es,</hi> and give
an account of the matter; and my <U+017F>afety was wholly
owing to this <U+017F>peed, for ju<U+017F>t as I imagin'd it fell out;
I was hardly got under the Walls of the Town,
when appear'd three Officers well mounted who had
pur<U+017F>u'd me; but <U+017F>eeing me ju<U+017F>t at the Gates they
thought not fit to advance any further. I entred
<hi>Locates</hi> in triumph, every one running out into the
<U+017F>treet to <U+017F>ee a Boy of <U+017F>ixteen years old bring in two
Pri<U+017F>oners, and I was well guarded to the Governours
Hou<U+017F>e. As <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>aw him, <hi>Now, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>you
<U+017F>ee I have been near enough to the Enemy, I told you a</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57806:16"/>
               <hi>great number would not do the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, for tho we were
but two, we were too many by one.</hi> He askt me what I
meant by that? whereupon I told him in <U+017F>hort the
Adventure with my Comrade. He was pleas'd to
<U+017F>peak very much in my prai<U+017F>e, and to magnify the
Action much more than it de<U+017F>erv'd, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
giving me a Colours in the Regiment of <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi>
which was wholly at his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, as well as
all the Vacancies of the Garri<U+017F>on; he very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
told me, he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>top there, but would
take particular care of my fortune.</p>
            <p>But that which made the mo<U+017F>t noi<U+017F>e was, that
the Pri<U+017F>oner I had taken happen'd to be a Lieutenant
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De St. Aunais</hi>
having <U+017F>ent word of it to Court, and the particulars
of the action, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> writ to him to <U+017F>end
me forthwith to <hi>Paris,</hi> and order'd me a hundred
Pi<U+017F>toles for the charges of my Journey. I leave you
to imagine the inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible Joy I was in; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De St. Aunais</hi> all imaginable
thanks, whom I acknowledg'd to be my Benefactor,
he de<U+017F>ired me before I went, to tell him who I
was: <U+017F>o I gave him a brief account of all my little
Adventures: He told me, that tho Virtue was to
be valu'd where ever it was found, yet he was glad
to hear I was a Gentleman, becau<U+017F>e it always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Lu<U+017F>tre from a Per<U+017F>on of Quality. <hi>Go,</hi> <U+017F>ays
he, <hi>and wait on the Cardinal, he loves a bold man, and is
very fond of engaging <U+017F>uch in his Service, and if I am not
mi<U+017F>taken, he intends to do <U+017F>omething con<U+017F>iderable for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left <hi>Locates</hi> with a great deal of <U+017F>atisfaction,
having bought a couple of Hor<U+017F>es, and got me a Man
to wait on me; and that Pride which is <U+017F>o natural
to youth, being gotten into my head, nothing would
<U+017F>erve me, but I mu<U+017F>t go <U+017F>how my <U+017F>elf in this figure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57806:17"/>
in my own Country; and never con<U+017F>idering the lo<U+017F>s
of my time, I turn'd out of the great Road at <hi>Briare,</hi>
and came that night to the Hou<U+017F>e of my old Friend
the Curate. He was <U+017F>urpriz'd, and overjoy'd to <U+017F>ee
me, and after I had told him my adventures, and
whether I was bound, I gave him a great many
thanks for his former kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and pre<U+017F>enting him
with ten Pi<U+017F>toles, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him, that if ever I made
my fortune, I would not be unmindful of him: He
told me I <U+017F>hould find my Fathers Family much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>t,
that he had <U+017F>even Children, not reckoning me
into the number; that his affairs al<U+017F>o were in no
very good condition, having lately met with a very
great lo<U+017F>s, which he believ'd was a judgment upon him
for his cruelty to me; whereupon he gave me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a very <U+017F>trange accident which befel him, as
you <U+017F>hall hear. There was one <hi>Courtilz,</hi> a Kin<U+017F>man of
ours, a Per<U+017F>on of Quality, and related to mo<U+017F>t of the
Gentry of that Province, but had the misfortune not to
have an E<U+017F>tate an<U+017F>werable to his Birth, and to the
figure he made, for he was one of the genteele<U+017F>t Men
in the Kingdom; as he was waiting for <U+017F>ome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s lay mo<U+017F>tly at <hi>Paris,</hi> and whether
he was <U+017F>upply'd by <U+017F>ome of the Sex, or had a lucky
hand at Play, he always liv'd high, and kept the be<U+017F>t
Company; he falling in Love with a young Widow,
that had a very good E<U+017F>tate, courted her in hopes to
carry her by his Gallantry, and that obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which was <U+017F>o peculiar to him<U+017F>elf; but the Lady,
who either had no inclination for him, or which was
mo<U+017F>t likely, had oblig'd her <U+017F>elf to a religious Life,
de<U+017F>ir'd him in <U+017F>hort to trouble her no further: The
difficulty encrea<U+017F>t his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he haunted her every
where, and tho <U+017F>he had forbid him her Hou<U+017F>e, he
contriv'd his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o well, that he <U+017F>aw her every
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57806:17"/>
day, either at Church, or at <U+017F>ome friends hou<U+017F>e or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but <U+017F>he, to be rid of him for good and all, retir'd
her <U+017F>elf into a Convent; this madded him <U+017F>o, that
he threatned to fire the hou<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>he, for fear he
<U+017F>hould be as good as his word, was fain to remove:
But finding that <U+017F>he continu'd re<U+017F>olute not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, he contriv'd to <U+017F>teal her; of which having
<U+017F>ome intimation, <U+017F>he prevented him by going pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
out of Town, and having told no body of
her going but one particular friend, nor taken any
of her <U+017F>ervants with her, her relations were in a
fright for her, and having not heard of her in <U+017F>everal
days, they concluded <hi>Courtilz</hi> had carry'd her away,
as he had been heard to <U+017F>ay he would do; <U+017F>o they
complain'd to the Court of Ju<U+017F>tice again<U+017F>t him, and
upon the hearing of their Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es they obtain'd an
Arre<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t him. Any man but <hi>Courtilz</hi> would
have prevented all this, for he being innocent had
nothing to fear; but whether he was otherwi<U+017F>e em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
or thought it not worth his while, he wholly
neglected it, till at la<U+017F>t he was fain to take Sanctuary at
my Fathers, and finding him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>cover'd there, was
forc'd to remove from thence too. It happen'd ju<U+017F>t
at that time my Father had receiv'd a con<U+017F>iderable
<U+017F>um of Money, about twenty thou<U+017F>and Crowns:
Some Rogues having notice of all this, they dre<U+017F>t
them<U+017F>elves up like Pour<U+017F>uivants, and pretending to
<U+017F>earch the hou<U+017F>e for <hi>Courtilz,</hi> they <U+017F>eiz'd upon my
Father, and clapping a Pi<U+017F>tol to his throat, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
where was his Money? which he, having no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
to dye, was oblig'd to di<U+017F>cover to them; with
which they loaded one of his own Hor<U+017F>es, and he
had the <U+017F>atisfaction of <U+017F>eeing them make their e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
over the Fore<U+017F>t, from one of the Turrets of
the Ca<U+017F>tle, where they had lockt up both him, and all
the Family.</p>

This was a great lo<U+017F>s for a Gentleman of but
twenty thou<U+017F>and Livres a year E<U+017F>tate, and eight Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<U+017F>o not doubting but he was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
I did not know whether I had be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee him
or not, for my company being never very agreeable
to him, I thought now it might encrea<U+017F>e his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but thinking al<U+017F>o he might reflect upon me if I
was wanting in my Duty, I went to wait on him,
and was received by him not a jot better than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
for my Mother-in-Law <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing I was
come to dwell with them again, and le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould
pretend to be one of the Family, forbid the Servants
giving my Hor<U+017F>es either Oats or Hay. My man
giving me an account of this, I <U+017F>ent hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for <U+017F>ome to
the Curate; and my Father happening to be in the
Stable, <U+017F>aw it all, without giving orders to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
Tho this did not at all agree with me, and I
was ready to bur<U+017F>t with anger, yet being re<U+017F>olv'd to
go away the next morning, I took no notice of it,
but went up to my Chamber earlier than ordinary;
and as I was ju<U+017F>t going into Bed, up comes my Father,
and my Mother-in-Law, and askt me in a <U+017F>ort of
rallying, if I was going to wait upon the Cardinal by
his order; as my Man it <U+017F>eems had <U+017F>aid among the
Servants. I plainly <U+017F>aw the bottom of the Que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that 'twas only to <U+017F>tand fair with me, in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould chance to meet with any thing, and
therefore an<U+017F>wer'd very coldly, that it was true;
my Father told me he was very glad I was like to
come to preferment; and with that word my Mother-in-Law
invited me to <U+017F>tay, and told me I <U+017F>hould be
welcome, and hop'd, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, that when I had made
my own Fortune, I would not be unmindful of my
Brothers: I an<U+017F>wer'd her in the <U+017F>ame tone of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that 'twas not yet a thing done; but if I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57806:18"/>
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o fortunate as perhaps I might, I <U+017F>hould
always return Good for Evil.</p>
            <p>This <U+017F>ort of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e gave me light into her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and I dare <U+017F>ay was the occa<U+017F>ion, that <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make excu<U+017F>es for her behaviour to me, and
particularly for refu<U+017F>ing Hay to my Hor<U+017F>es; <U+017F>he told
me 'twas becau<U+017F>e the Groom did not know me, and
they had charg'd him ever <U+017F>ince their late misfortune
to give none to Strangers; but <U+017F>he would take care
to prevent it for the future. I knew well enough
what I thought of this; but di<U+017F>cretion and re<U+017F>pect
obliging me to conceal my re<U+017F>entment, I told them
that it was but a <U+017F>mall matter, and not worth taking
notice of. My Father then began to enquire what
had become of me all this while, and gave me a
<U+017F>mall reprimand for never letting him hear from me,
and begun to talk to me a little like a Father.</p>
            <p>After a thou<U+017F>and other que<U+017F>tions, they left me to
go to Bed; and having told them I mu<U+017F>t go away
the next day, I found in the Morning a Breakfa<U+017F>t
prepar'd as if there had been a Wedding. They <U+017F>ent
two hours before day to all our Relations, that were
any thing near, with a <U+017F>ort of a circular Letter, to
acquaint them of the occa<U+017F>ion of my going to
Court, and to invite them all to come and take
their leave of me: Away they come, <U+017F>ome on Foot,
<U+017F>ome on Hor<U+017F>eback; and I was <U+017F>mother'd with
Compliments from a matter of ten or twelve Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
as if I had been already <U+017F>ome great Per<U+017F>on,
and in a condition to make all their fortunes. To
deliver my <U+017F>elf from this Farce, which was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>y
to me, I begg'd my Father to permit me to ha<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
for I had lo<U+017F>t too much time already; and the
Cardinal who expected People <U+017F>hould be punctual,
would perhaps think me long: That I had come two
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57806:19"/>
days Journey out of my way, on purpo<U+017F>e to pay my
duty to him, but I hop'd he would not de<U+017F>ire me to
prejudice my <U+017F>elf. My Mother-in-Law, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
at this Compliment, no <U+017F>ooner heard it, but
<U+017F>he goes her <U+017F>elf into the Kitchen, and never <U+017F>tirr'd
thence till Dinner was <U+017F>erv'd up.</p>
            <p>This which I <U+017F>aw at my Fathers, was but the
very <U+017F>ame which I afterwards found to be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
at Court. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I was arriv'd there, and it
was known that I was the Cadet of <hi>Locates,</hi> every
one made their Compliments to me; and I was
<U+017F>trangely <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e People, whom I
<U+017F>hould have thought it honour enough to have
<U+017F>poken to once a week, wait upon me to beg my
friend<U+017F>hip. The Captain of the Guard to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
to whom I had addre<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf, having told
him that I was in the Antichamber, I was order'd
to be call'd in: Who <U+017F>eeing that I was but a Beardle<U+017F>s

St. Aunais <hi><U+017F>urely has put a trick upon us: Why?
This is but a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid I, making a profound Reverence,</hi>
I know not what Mr. <hi>de St. Aunais</hi> may have inform'd
your Eminence, but if it was only that I took the King's
Lieutenant of <hi>Sal<U+017F>es,</hi> and his Mistri<U+017F>s, I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you
'tis nothing but the Truth. Ay, but he has told us more
than that, <hi>reply'd the Cardinal:</hi> We have a long Story
here, how you prevented the Souldier that wou'd have ki<U+017F>t
the Girl; and how you attackt him, and he fir'd his Pi<U+017F>tol
at you; notwith<U+017F>tanding which, you drove him away and
brought off your Pri<U+017F>oners. 'Tis all very true, my Lord,
<hi><U+017F>aid I,</hi> but the<U+017F>e are but <U+017F>mall matters: I hope if I may
be <U+017F>o happy as to find an opportunity, I <U+017F>hall perform much
greater, for the Service of the King and of your Eminence.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57806:19"/>
He is a bold Lad, <hi><U+017F>aid the Cardinal to the Lords again,</hi>
but he is but a Boy <U+017F>till; and 'tis pitty to expo<U+017F>e him <U+017F>o
young, and as it were to force nature. <hi>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
put me in great fear he would do nothing for me,
wherefore I return'd pre<U+017F>ently,</hi> I am more capable, my
Lord, than you may think me, and your Eminence may
find me <U+017F>o, if you plea<U+017F>e to command me any thing for
your Service. <hi>He made me no an<U+017F>wer, but <U+017F>peaking
<U+017F>oftly to the Captain of his Guards, bad him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me with the Gentlemen, and to inform him<U+017F>elf
who I was, and <U+017F>o retir'd into his Clo<U+017F>et<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> This both
<U+017F>urpriz'd and afflicted me; for I expected that I
<U+017F>hould no <U+017F>ooner have appear'd before him, but
I <U+017F>hould have had <U+017F>ome great matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain of the Guard not failing to do as he
was directed, and having given the Cardinal an
account that I was a Gentleman, after Dinner I was
call'd into the Clo<U+017F>et, where his Eminence told me
he had, as a mark of his favour, re<U+017F>olv'd to entertain
me in his Service; that I <U+017F>hould be wi<U+017F>e and faithful,
and I <U+017F>hould have no cau<U+017F>e to repent me. I made
him a low Reverence in token of my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<U+017F>till expecting <U+017F>ome very con<U+017F>iderable Bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
or Office to be be<U+017F>tow'd upon me; but I was
<U+017F>urpriz'd to find all my preferment <U+017F>um'd up in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and that at la<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould have come <U+017F>o far to
be the Cardinals Footboy. I was not <U+017F>o much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but that he perceiv'd it in my

            </p>
            <p>The obliging way with which he <U+017F>poke this, <U+017F>cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
all the di<U+017F>content that, as I <U+017F>aid, appear'd in my
face, and having made him again a mo<U+017F>t profound
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57806:20"/>
reverence, I expected pre<U+017F>ently to go and change my
figure, or at lea<U+017F>t that <U+017F>ome body <U+017F>hould be order'd
to take mea<U+017F>ure of me for my Cloaths. But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Pages told me, I mu<U+017F>t write to my
Father to <U+017F>end me four hundred Crowns for my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and Trimming, and Pre<U+017F>ents that I mu<U+017F>t make,
and that nothing would be done before. I was in a
great confu<U+017F>ion at this, I knew well enough to how
little purpo<U+017F>e 'twould be for me to write to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I was content to <U+017F>ell my Hor<U+017F>es, but that
would not rai<U+017F>e my Stock above fifty Pi<U+017F>toles, which
was not half the Sum he talkt of: To ask my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I thought very improper, <U+017F>ince they all thought
my fortune was made, and expected great things from
me. I <U+017F>lept not a wink that night for thinking what
method I <U+017F>hould take to get over this affair, I re<U+017F>olv'd

            <p>You may ea<U+017F>ily imagin I was very well pleas'd
with this errand, and knowing I was well backt, I
did not leave out a word of the me<U+017F><U+017F>age, but told it
with all the advantage I could, for his mortification;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57806:20"/>
however he ob<U+017F>erv'd the order punctually, and I laid
out only ten or twelve Pi<U+017F>toles to buy <U+017F>ome little
nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries which he gave me not: and this the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
not only paid me, but made them give me three
times that <U+017F>um for my reimbur<U+017F>ement.</p>
            <p>Tho I was to be but a Page, yet I fail'd not to be
the Favourite, for his Eminence had none <U+017F>o agreeable
to him as my <U+017F>elf; he would have me do every
thing, and I to <U+017F>how my <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of his favour, was
con<U+017F>tantly at his Elbow, ready to receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
at Table, 'twas I <U+017F>till that <U+017F>erv'd him the
Wine, not for want of others readine<U+017F>s, for they
envy'd me for it, but he would call me by my name,
as if there had been no body el<U+017F>e there, to prevent
their diligence. When he went to Madam <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillon</hi>
'twas the <U+017F>ame thing, there was no body but I
went with him, where he plac'd me in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
into which no body came, but if he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <U+017F>peak with any body, I was <U+017F>ent to them, and
brought them in, and let them out, by a private
Stair-ca<U+017F>e, that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any body to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them.</p>
            <p>I know 'twas reported he was in Love with that
Lady, who was his Niece, I do not <U+017F>ay it was not
<U+017F>o, <U+017F>he was hand<U+017F>ome enough to tempt as great a

<U+017F>hould have been tran<U+017F>ported to have had but the
e<U+017F>teem of <U+017F>o fine a creature, tho I had been a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

<U+017F>ay to undeceive po<U+017F>terity, that he went to <U+017F>ee her
many times upon other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s than his diver<U+017F>ion,
where he lockt him<U+017F>elf up with per<U+017F>ons that he could

It fell out once, that after one of the<U+017F>e confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
he order'd me to take a Bag, I know not
what was in it, but 'twas very heavy, and to go
along the road to <hi>Pontoi<U+017F>e,</hi> telling me at the entrance
into a Village called <hi>Sanois,</hi> I <U+017F>hould find a Capuchin
a<U+017F>leep, with his Coul or Hood hanging down behind
him; that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay ne're a word to him, but put
the Bag into the Coul, and come away: I found
every thing ju<U+017F>t as he had told me, and executed his
orders punctually.</p>
            <p>But before he employ'd me in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecret things
as the<U+017F>e, he made tryal of me by a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age that was
very particular. He had a Man call'd <hi>Sauvé,</hi> whom
he us'd to employ about <U+017F>uch matters, and had <U+017F>ent him
two or three times into <hi>Spain,</hi> to di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
that were carrying on there again<U+017F>t his intere<U+017F>t.
This man had a very hand<U+017F>ome Wife, and being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by the Cardinal to try my fidelity, he <U+017F>ets his
Wife to work, with whom he <U+017F>uffer'd me to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch
liberty, that one might <U+017F>wear for him he was not
jealous. His Wife was at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight very free with
me, and the de<U+017F>ign being to entrap me, by the mo<U+017F>t
infallible <U+017F>nare in the world, e<U+017F>pecially to a young
man, <U+017F>he began to be plea<U+017F>anter than ordinary. But
having, by I know not what means, oblig'd her,
<U+017F>he told me down-right the whole cheat, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
me to have a care; after this <U+017F>he gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to her Husband ju<U+017F>t as I directed her, and the
Cardinal being inform'd from him (who to gain his
favour, told him ingeniou<U+017F>ly he had <U+017F>acrific'd his
Wife, and would not <U+017F>tick to <U+017F>acrifice him<U+017F>elf for
his <U+017F>ervice) he had from that time <U+017F>uch confidence in
me, that I was always employ'd in affairs of the

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57806:21"/>
A few days after this he order'd me to put off my
Livery, and go into the Hor<U+017F>e Market, to a certain
hou<U+017F>e which he directed me to; that I <U+017F>hould go up
four pair of <U+017F>tairs, and if I found a Cro<U+017F>s made with
Chalk on a Chamber Door I <U+017F>hould come down, and
<U+017F>tay below till <hi>Sauvé</hi> came to me. I found ju<U+017F>t as he
had <U+017F>aid, and having plac'd my <U+017F>elf at the Street

had found that which his Eminence de<U+017F>ir'd; then he
askt me if I had not <U+017F>een two men go out, one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
like a Prie<U+017F>t, and the other with a <U+017F>hort Cloak
like an Abbot; I told him No: he bid me look out
<U+017F>harp, and if they <U+017F>hould appear, I <U+017F>hould walk along
before them, till I came to the Ho<U+017F>pital <hi>de la Pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and if not, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tand Centinel there till he came
again. It was an hour and half before he came again,
but 'twas in good company when he did come, for
he brought a Squadron of the Guards with him, of
whom a Party be<U+017F>et the hou<U+017F>e, and the re<U+017F>t went up
<U+017F>tairs, where they found in the Chamber, the two
men de<U+017F>crib'd to me, who they took and carry'd to
the <hi>Ba<U+017F>tile:</hi> But there was but one of them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the other was let go, and I carry'd him the next
day ten thou<U+017F>and Crowns in Gold, which was the
recompence they had promis'd him, for betraying
and <U+017F>elling his Companion.</p>
            <p>Finding my <U+017F>elf employ'd in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecret affairs, I
heartily wi<U+017F>ht my <U+017F>elf a year or two older; for I
fancy'd the Cardinal would find me other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
when I was a little too old for a Page, and I long'd to
be in the Wars, to which I had a particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the mean time my Father, and my Mother-in-law,
having inform'd them<U+017F>elves that all my hopes
were ended in a Livery, were <U+017F>orry for tho<U+017F>e little
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57806:22"/>
civilities they had done me; but this hindred me not
from thinking, if I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to do <U+017F>omething
for my younger Brothers, who had need enough;
and to give them a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my good will, I wrote
to them all to give me notice, if any Benefice <U+017F>hould
pre<U+017F>ent in their Country: but they <U+017F>ent me word, that
I needed not to <U+017F>how my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o vain, for they knew
well enough what intere<U+017F>t I had, and were content I
<U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of it for whom I pleas'd.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hould have taken this as a great affront from any
body el<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o I did from them too; and the
Cardinal being pleas'd a little after that, to enquire
of me about my Family, I told him not only this
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, but what u<U+017F>age I had receiv'd when I was
but a Child; he was extreamly taken with all my
freedom, and finding he delighted to hear me relate
the little adventures of my life, I took occa<U+017F>ion to
tell him of the kindne<U+017F>s I had receiv'd from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
magnifying the obligation I thought my <U+017F>elf
under to him as much as I could: He told me he
was glad to <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o grateful; but at the <U+017F>ame time,
as I happen'd to <U+017F>peak of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs <hi>de Marillac,</hi>
he askt me if they knew I was with him, and if I
had <U+017F>een any of them lately? I told him No, but I
intended to wait on them with the fir<U+017F>t conveniency:
to which he an<U+017F>wer'd, that I mu<U+017F>t not do <U+017F>o, if I
thought of continuing in his favour. I dur<U+017F>t not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               </gap> and he perceiving
that I was not only <U+017F>urpriz'd, but a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht; <hi>At lea<U+017F>t,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, <hi>if you <U+017F>hould meet with any of them, never open
your Lips of what I have <U+017F>aid to you; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd if
you ever <U+017F>hould, you have nothing more to hope for from
me.</hi> I told him, 'twas enough for me to know his
Plea<U+017F>ure, and that I <U+017F>hould know neither Friend nor
Relation, when his Eminence's Service was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57806:22"/>
He was very well <U+017F>atisfy'd with my an<U+017F>wer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
to employ me as freely as before; among the
re<U+017F>t he <U+017F>ent me one time with a great Bag full of Gold,
and order'd me to lay it under a broad Free<U+017F>tone, which
I <U+017F>hould find upon a heap of other Stones, a little
beyond <hi>Montfaucon,</hi> on the Road to <hi>St. Denis;</hi> and
withal I was not to come back the <U+017F>ame way, that I
might not <U+017F>ee, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, who <U+017F>hould come to fetch
it: Another time I carried <U+017F>uch a like Cargo to
<hi>No<U+017F>tre Dame,</hi> to a Man whom he told me I <U+017F>hould
find leaning again<U+017F>t a Tree, with his head on one
hand, and the other hand behind him, ju<U+017F>t for all the
world in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture, as <hi>Moliere</hi> acts the covetous
Phy<U+017F>ician; I was to put the Money into that hand
which he held behind him, but not to <U+017F>ee his face at
all, and <U+017F>o to come my way; I thought there was more
my<U+017F>tery in all this than there was occa<U+017F>ion for, and that
it was only to make proof of my Fidelity, or to render
his management of affairs more valuable for its <U+017F>ecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
However it was, I <U+017F>pent two years in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es, in which time there were many Plots at
Court to remove him from the Mini<U+017F>try, but all to
no purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time, having writ to the Curate as
well as to my Father, to inform me if any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in their Country that I might beg for him,
there came now an Expre<U+017F>s to me from him, to tell
me that a <U+017F>mall Abbey of about four thou<U+017F>and Franks</hi>
per annum <hi>was become vacant, I immediately begg'd it
of the Cardinal, and he granted it me at the fir<U+017F>t word,
but wou'd needs know who it was, I begg'd it for.</hi>
My Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid I,</hi> for our Curate, who taught me to read,
and to whom I told your Eminence I had <U+017F>o many obligations.
And why not for one of your Brothers, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> I think you
told me you had <U+017F>everal, and they needy enough? 'Tis true,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57806:23"/>
my Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid I,</hi> but as Providence has done by me, I am
oblig'd to prefer my Gratitude before even my natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thus your Eminence can judge, if after all the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have to you, I ought not to <U+017F>erve you above all the
world. We <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that, <hi>reply'd the Cardinal <U+017F>miling,</hi>
and may chance to put you to the tryal <U+017F>ooner than you
think of.</p>
            <p>I was ju<U+017F>t going to an<U+017F>wer him again, when the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> came into the room, which made me
<U+017F>poil my Compliment to help him to a Chair: He
made but a <U+017F>hort vi<U+017F>it, and the Cardinal waiting on
him to the Chamber-door, <U+017F>py'd Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>t,</hi>
who was but an incon<U+017F>iderable per<U+017F>on then,
but one who we have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ince Captain of the <hi>Guards
du Corps,</hi> Governour of <hi>Calais,</hi> Duke, and Peer of
<hi>France:</hi> The Cardinal had a mortal aver<U+017F>ion to him,
<U+017F>o that he was no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>tept back into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but he order'd me to call the Captain of his
Guard, whom he gave a <U+017F>trict charge, at any rate to
rid him of that piece of Impertinence, and that he
<U+017F>hould order the Guards to deny him entrance: The
Captain of the Guard askt him if he <U+017F>hould turn him
out of the Anti-chamber? <hi>I don't <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o,</hi> <U+017F>ays the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<hi>but that you <U+017F>hould keep him out for the future.</hi>
This Order being known all over the hou<U+017F>e in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
every body turn'd their backs upon the poor
Gentleman, and were as <U+017F>hye of him as if he had
had the Plague: I know not whether he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
any thing, but he took no notice of it, and
<U+017F>taid three long hours in the Antichamber. The
Cardinal, who had a mind to go out, <U+017F>ent me to <U+017F>ee
if he was there <U+017F>till, and having told him that he
was, he cho<U+017F>e rather to <U+017F>tay in his Chamber, than
expo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to his Compliment. The next day
<hi>Charro<U+017F>t</hi> came to the door again, and offering to come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57806:23"/>
in as u<U+017F>ual, the Guards thru<U+017F>t him away; and he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>peak with their Captain, the Captain order'd
them to tell him he was not within; he be<U+017F>ieg'd the
hou<U+017F>e thus two days, before he could <U+017F>ee the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but on the third day he put him<U+017F>elf ju<U+017F>t in his
way, as he went to Ma<U+017F>s: The Guards routed him
again, and would let him <U+017F>tand quietly no where;
whereupon he leapt up into a Nich, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd
to <U+017F>et a Statue in; and when the Cardinal
came by, <hi>My Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>your Guards have refus'd
me entrance at your Gate; but if you <U+017F>hut me out at your
Door, I'll come in at the Window.</hi> The Cardinal could
not forbear laughing to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o like an
Image; and finding him <U+017F>o very zealous to him, he
was ever after very kind to him. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>t</hi>
having thus gain'd admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, continu'd to make
his court to him very diligently, without asking any
thing, tho he had need enough; the Cardinal was
oblig'd the more at that, for he was always pleas'd if
he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf lov'd without a principle of Intere<U+017F>t;
and would do the more for any per<U+017F>on for not being
importun'd. In the mean while an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<U+017F>o happily for him, that now was his time to
make u<U+017F>e of the Cardinals favour: wherefore wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to find him in a good humour, he comes briskly
to him one day; <hi>If I dur<U+017F>t, my Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>I would
ask your Eminence to help me to 200000 Crowns, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one farthing charge, either to the King or your <U+017F>elf.
How then, Charro<U+017F>t?</hi> reply'd the Cardinal <U+017F>miling. <hi>To
Marry me, my Lord, with your own hand,</hi> return'd <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>t;
I have found out a Fortune, and if your Eminence will
but <U+017F>peak a word for me, my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is done. If it <U+017F>tops
only there,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Cardinal, <hi>you may reckon it done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
He threw him<U+017F>elf at his feet, and embrac'd
his knees, in token of thankfulne<U+017F>s; telling him, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57806:24"/>
all he de<U+017F>ir'd of him, was to <U+017F>end and demand <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoi<U+017F>elle
Le<U+017F>calopier</hi> for him. The Cardinal did it,
to the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of all people, who knew that he
never car'd to meddle in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of things. The
Relations of the Lady could not refu<U+017F>e a man of his
Authority; <U+017F>o <hi>Charro<U+017F>t</hi> having got <U+017F>uch a Fortune,
was in a condition to buy <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>iderable place,
and the Cardinal, who never <U+017F>uffer'd any body to be
near the King but <U+017F>uch as were his own Creatures,
and wholly at his <U+017F>ervice, treated for him to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Guards du Corps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I got my little Abbey, as I <U+017F>aid
before, and <U+017F>ent the Bulls all Perfum'd to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which wrought the<U+017F>e two different effects,
that he was like to dye with Joy, and my Father
and Mother-in-law with <U+017F>orrow: They came all to
<hi>Paris,</hi> the Curate to give me thanks, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my kindne<U+017F>s, and they to load me with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
reproaches: They askt me, If I was not a<U+017F>ham'd
to provide for <U+017F>trangers, when my own Brothers had
<U+017F>o much occa<U+017F>ion; but at la<U+017F>t, when they had vented
their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, they began to talk at another rate, and
<U+017F>ell to per<U+017F>wading me to beg another Abbey of the
Cardinal; I told them it was not my fault they had
not this; but this was not the way at Court, for 'twas
not always a fit time to ask, and the certain way to
get nothing was to be always begging: That if the
Cardinal had been <U+017F>o kind to me, being but his Page,
I hop'd to be more in his favour, when I was in a
better condition to <U+017F>erve him; that I was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
natural affections, tho I had no great rea<U+017F>on for it;
but that I <U+017F>hould always con<U+017F>ider what my honour
oblig'd me to, without calling to mind any of my ju<U+017F>t
re<U+017F>entments; and with the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of hopes I appeas'd
them. I had no <U+017F>ooner clear'd my hands of them,

but I had all our Province about me, thinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

could not but be very prodigal of my favours to
them all; <U+017F>ome of them came from the very further

me every hour with their Genealogy, making
it out very plainly, that they were my Cou<U+017F>ins in
the third degree, and therefore hop'd I would u<U+017F>e
my Intere<U+017F>t to procure them <U+017F>ome preferment. I made
<U+017F>hort with them, and told them, I had as good a
will to <U+017F>erve them as any man in the world, but it
was not in my power, which they might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee,
for that I had got nothing yet for my Brothers, who
being in the fir<U+017F>t degree, 'twas but rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>hould
be fir<U+017F>t regarded; and that then I had <U+017F>ome Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the <U+017F>econd Degree, who pretended to <U+017F>ome
priviledge before them; that when I had preferr'd
them all, then they might depend upon me, that I
<U+017F>hould do them all the <U+017F>ervice I could: They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
me well enough, and <U+017F>o getting rid of them
they left me in quiet.</p>
            <p>At la<U+017F>t the happy hour was come, which I had <U+017F>o
long wi<U+017F>ht for, when I <U+017F>hould lay down the office of
a Page, with which I was never very well pleas'd;
the Cardinal gave me two hundred Pi<U+017F>toles to buy
me Clothes, and told me I <U+017F>hould be one of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.
I had hopes now he would have done <U+017F>ome
great thing for me; however I did not continue long
idle, but went over into <hi>England,</hi> and into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with Letters written in Cyphers; and tho<U+017F>e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
being in Arms, I was <U+017F>eiz'd by a Party of the
King of <hi>England</hi>'s Army, whom I was as much afraid
of, as of tho<U+017F>e of the Parliaments: They immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<U+017F>earcht me, but found nothing about me, for I
had put my Letters into my Po<U+017F>t-hor<U+017F>es Saddle; the

Plates of which I had made on purpo<U+017F>e at <hi>Paris,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of double Iron, contriv'd to hold the Letters in
the in<U+017F>ide, and unle<U+017F>s they broke them, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
They ran<U+017F>ackt the very Pummels of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
but to no purpo<U+017F>e, for they could not find my
Packet: Then they askt me whence I came? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was going? and a thou<U+017F>and impertinent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions;
and I an<U+017F>wer'd them all as I found proper,
being prepar'd to meet with <U+017F>uch like interruptions;
telling them, I was a young Gentleman that was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling:
But this gave them the more <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Equipage did not agree with the Character I
gave my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o they <U+017F>topt me four or five days, at
which I was very unea<U+017F>ie, for I carry'd along with me
(if I am not very much mi<U+017F>taken) bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of no
<U+017F>mall con<U+017F>equence; <U+017F>uch as if I <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered
with, I knew my fate: but what comforted me was,
that my Letters were perfect Magick, and written in
<U+017F>uch a character, that the Devil could not have read
them. They had no regular Alphabet, as is cu<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, but the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>troke or da<U+017F>h would
<U+017F>ignify twenty different words, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
but for them that had the key, to make any thing of
it: as for example, you mu<U+017F>t know it was agreed,
that one <U+017F>troke <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ignify an entire word of a
Line in St. <hi>Au<U+017F>tin,</hi> and to know which it was, the
figure of the Page was put under the <U+017F>troke, and the
number of the line, and the number of the word in
the line, and to make it the plainer, the mark or
<U+017F>troke was to be the fir<U+017F>t letter of the word. As to
explain it; <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the word was <hi>Have,</hi> and that this
word was to be found in the 10th Page of St. <hi>Au<U+017F>tin,</hi>
the 10th line, the 5th word in the line, the cypher
would have been thus<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

out my Errand, and yet I trembled every joynt of
me; for I knew if they found out my Letters, the
more difficulty they had in di<U+017F>covering the Contents,
the wor<U+017F>e I might expect to be handled by them.
But it being my good fortune not only to <U+017F>ecure my
Packet, but al<U+017F>o that they believ'd me too young to
be capable of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of Negotiations, they let me
go, and I deliver'd my di<U+017F>patches, and return'd <U+017F>afe
with an an<U+017F>wer. I was very well paid for this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
for I had an order to the <hi>Financier</hi> for two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Crowns, and one of the Pay-ma<U+017F>ters demanding
a con<U+017F>ideration of me for prompt payment, was turn'd
out of his place upon my complaint to the Cardinal.
I know not whether the Genius of the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi>
Subject to take up Arms on every light occa<U+017F>ion, or
this Voyage of mine wrought the effects that follow'd,
but tho<U+017F>e three Kingdoms, who, as I <U+017F>aid, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb'd
before, immediately upon this broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
confu<U+017F>ion, in<U+017F>omuch that the King of <hi>England,</hi>
who had given us no great marks of his good will in
<U+017F>everal ca<U+017F>es, found his hands <U+017F>o full at home, that
there was no great fear of his being trouble<U+017F>om to
us.</p>
            <p>And what makes me think we had a deeper hand
in this affair than others, is <U+017F>omething that happen'd
to me three months after my return; being one
morning, as I <U+017F>eldom mi<U+017F>t, at the Cardinals <hi>Leve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he whi<U+017F>per'd me, and bid me go to the <hi>Fauxbourg St.
Marceau,</hi> over again<U+017F>t the Conduit, to the <U+017F>ign of a
<hi>Woman without a Head,</hi> and to go up two pair of
<U+017F>tairs, where I <U+017F>hould find a man lying on a Bed
with yellow Curtains, whom I <U+017F>hould order to be at
Madam <hi>D' Eguillons,</hi> at Eleven a Clock at night
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57806:26"/>
without fail. I deliver'd my me<U+017F><U+017F>age immediately,
and being not forbidden to <U+017F>ee this mans face, as in
other ca<U+017F>es, I call'd to mind that I had <U+017F>een him in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and I believe he knew me too, for I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
that he lookt earne<U+017F>tly at me, as if he would
have recollected who I was; we neither of us <U+017F>aid
any thing of what we thought, only that he told me
he would not fail the appointment. At the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid,
I was order'd to <U+017F>tay for him at the door, to
introduce him into the Cardinals Clo<U+017F>et; he came
di<U+017F>guis'd like one that crys Wafers in the Streets, and
I, hearing a man cry Wafers, was far enough from
imagining that 'twas he; but he knowing me, and
di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf, I brought him to the Cardinal,
with whom he was <U+017F>hut up till four a clock the next
morning; all the Cardinals men had orders to go
home, which gave further occa<U+017F>ion to the talk that
was made of him, and of his Neice Madam <hi>D. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillon;</hi>
no body imagining he had any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to keep him there all night, but to lye with her; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
they had taken out the Keys, that they might
go out when they pleas'd, and this made the Ladys
Servants be as forward as any in the report: I don't
<U+017F>ay this to affirm that there was no privacies between
them, but to <U+017F>hew, as I <U+017F>aid, that all the times he
<U+017F>taid there were not the effects of an Amour.</p>
            <p>The conference being over, my Wafer-merchant
comes out of the Clo<U+017F>et, at the door whereof I
had waited by the Cardinals order; his Eminence
made me lend him my Cloak, for 'twas no time of
night to cry Wafers, and order'd me at the <U+017F>ame
time to go with him two Streets on his way. Two
days after he call'd me to him again, and bid me go
to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bullion,</hi> Superintendant of the <hi>Finances,</hi>
to order him from him to deliver me that parcel
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57806:26"/>
which he had made up, and then to carry it into the
<hi>Rue de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mentioning, whom I <U+017F>hould find at his Lodgings, at
the Sign of the <hi>Sow and Pigs,</hi> at the further end of
the Court, up one pair of <U+017F>tairs; I found the parcel
ready, but it was <U+017F>o heavy that it had more need of
a Cart to carry it, which Mr. <hi>de Bullion</hi> knowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had provided one, and having put it into the
Cart, he gave me a Note that contain'd the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of what was in it; telling me I mu<U+017F>t take that,
and give it to the per<U+017F>on I was to go to. Being come
to the <hi>Sow and Pigs,</hi> I found my Gentleman walking
up and down the Chamber, and having given him
the Note, and told him the Goods were at the door,
he lookt upon the Bill and gave it me again, telling
me I was mi<U+017F>taken, that I was to go to <U+017F>ome
other per<U+017F>on, for it did not belong to him. I told
him that I was not mi<U+017F>taken, for he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
that I knew him, and that my order was for him;
but he throwing away with a <U+017F>ort of di<U+017F>content,
walks about the Chamber again, and at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid to
me, <hi>Sir, It is not for me, and you have no more to do but
to return with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had taken a great deal of pains to per<U+017F>wade
him to receive it, but found 'twas all to no purpo<U+017F>e,
I e'en took his coun<U+017F>el, and carry'd it back to M. <hi>de
Bullion,</hi> and <U+017F>o went to give an account to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
he askt me if I had the Note about me, I
told him I had, which he looking upon, it put him
into a violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at <hi>Bullion,</hi> <U+017F>aying, he would
teach him another time to ob<U+017F>erve his orders; and
<U+017F>ending for him at the <U+017F>ame time, askt him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
why he <U+017F>ent but five hundred thou<U+017F>and Franks,
when his order was for <U+017F>ix hundred thou<U+017F>and: <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>

told him, but two days ago, that they <U+017F>hould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
that affair to get it as cheap as they could; that
he did not que<U+017F>tion but the other would have been
content with what he <U+017F>ent him, but <U+017F>eeing he was
not, he would go and <U+017F>end him the re<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>By what I could under<U+017F>tand of this, for I was
pre<U+017F>ent at their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it <U+017F>eem'd to me, that Mr.
<hi>de Bullion</hi> had a mind to put a hundred thou<U+017F>and
Franks in his own Pocket, tho he pretended only
good husbandry for the public: in the mean time,
while the other hundred thou<U+017F>and Franks was telling,
his Eminence <U+017F>ent me to find out the man again, to
tell him he <U+017F>hould have content, and that 'twas only
the fault of the Superintendant; and order'd me to
acquaint him, that I had <U+017F>een him reprove <hi>de Bullion</hi>
for it. I found him making up his Baggage, as if he
was to be gone, and <U+017F>eeming <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee me, he
<U+017F>tept up to me, and askt me, if I had any thing to
<U+017F>ay to him; I told him my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, at which <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a <U+017F>urly <U+017F>ort of tone, <hi>and I cannot under<U+017F>tand it, that
after having <U+017F>o po<U+017F>itive a promi<U+017F>e, it <U+017F>hould be forgotten in
two days.</hi> I went back immediately to Mr. <hi>de Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and fetching the <U+017F>ix hundred thou<U+017F>and Franks, I
brought them all to him, and return'd to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
who was very unea<U+017F>ie till he knew what was
done in it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>Tho this <U+017F>ort of employment was not my ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I had much rather have been in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
yet having <U+017F>o much the favour of my Ma<U+017F>ter, it
was the plea<U+017F>anter to me. Having one time ask'd
me if I had yet <U+017F>een Mr. <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who<U+017F>e Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was now in great favour, for he was not only
made a Mare<U+017F>chal of <hi>France,</hi> but had marry'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Queen Mothers; I an<U+017F>wer'd, that I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57806:27"/>
remembred better than <U+017F>o, what his Eminence had
commanded me; and that I had already told him, I
<U+017F>hould know no Relations when his Service was the
que<U+017F>tion, and that my greate<U+017F>t grief was, that I could
give him no better proof of it yet. He told me with
a voice that <U+017F>eem'd as if he were pleas'd, that it was
well enough; and indeed if he had not been very
confident of my fidelity, he would certainly never
have tru<U+017F>ted me in a thing of <U+017F>uch a nature, as he
did about a month after. In which, to di<U+017F>cover
what temper he was of, 'twill be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to look
back a little to the beginning of the <U+017F>tory.</p>
            <p>The King was of a very mild and ea<U+017F>y di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition,
came to the Crown very young, and left the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all things to the Queen Mother, a Prince<U+017F>s
of a va<U+017F>t ambition, but not belov'd by the <hi>French;</hi>
not only from a natural aver<U+017F>ion as <U+017F>he was an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
but al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he made a Favourite of one of
that Nation, who<U+017F>e Merit was as mean as his Birth:
As Governments are <U+017F>upported by fear <U+017F>ometimes,
as well as by other methods, <U+017F>o this man had made
him<U+017F>elf a terror, even to the Princes of the Blood;
and his Wife (which was more intollerable than
t'other) was come to that degree of In<U+017F>olence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uming
on the Queens Favour, whom <U+017F>he entirely
manag'd, that <U+017F>he trampled all the world, as it were,
under her feet. It being however nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for her
to make <U+017F>ome Creatures of her own, to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o
many Enemies, the Queen Mother had gain'd <U+017F>ome
already, and among them the two Brothers <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi>
of whom one was a State<U+017F>man, the other a
Souldier, and both very hone<U+017F>t Gentlemen, and
worthy of the great Places they enjoy'd; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
all her foreca<U+017F>t, the number of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
party was <U+017F>o great, that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ave her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57806:28"/>
Favourite from their hands. <hi>De Luines,</hi> who<U+017F>e am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
could not bear the in<U+017F>olence of this <hi>Italian,</hi>
in<U+017F>inuated to the King, that his Mother rendred him
contemptible to the people, leaving the Government
to be manag'd by Strangers. It is not certainly
known, whether he accus'd her of Incontinence or
not, and of making away the King his Father, but
however it was, he knew well enough how to
work upon the King, into who<U+017F>e favour he had
wrought him<U+017F>elf, by gratifying him in his little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and diverting him in <U+017F>uch manner as he found
mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable to his inclination; he got a private
order, to find out <U+017F>ome body to kill this Favourite,
which was accordingly executed by <hi>Vitri,</hi> Captain of
the <hi>Guards du Corps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence forward <hi>de Luines</hi> endeavour'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all the advantages of his Authority with the
King to the prejudice of the Queen Mother; but as
his <U+017F>houlders were too weak for <U+017F>uch a burthen, and
on the other hand the Queens Party being jealous of
his Mini<U+017F>try, and united again<U+017F>t him, he was forc'd
to yield to the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t <U+017F>ide. Tho<U+017F>e who were in
her intere<U+017F>ts, and had ab<U+017F>conded for fear they <U+017F>hould
fall in the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>grace with her Favourite, were
immediately recall'd to Court, and as the Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs
<hi>de Marillac</hi> were the chief of the<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o they had the
greate<U+017F>t marks of her re<U+017F>pect; he of the long Robe
aim'd at no le<U+017F>s than the Mini<U+017F>try, and <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o well
qualify'd for it, that all people thought he de<U+017F>erv'd
it: but the Queen Mother having taken into her
<U+017F>ervice the Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> afterwards Cardinal <hi>de
Richelieu,</hi> this Genius did <U+017F>o in all things excel Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur

The greater <hi>Marillac</hi>'s ambition was, the more
impatience he <U+017F>hew'd at the advancement of <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>igns were at lea<U+017F>t as great as his; and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
being as <U+017F>ubject to jealou<U+017F>y as love, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a hatred <U+017F>o inveterate, that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
one another; and the death of <hi>Luines</hi> making
way for a more unlimited Mini<U+017F>try, very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>t
it: But <hi>Richelieu</hi> <U+017F>oon got above, not him
only, but even the Queen Mother her <U+017F>elf. This
Prince<U+017F>s re<U+017F>ented it extremely, and mu<U+017F>ter'd up all
her Friends to joyn with her in pulling down this
New Mini<U+017F>ter, before he was <U+017F>ettled too fa<U+017F>t. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur

not content to have forc'd the Queen Mother, who

your Eminence would be content with this proof of my fidelity,
that I know how to keep your <U+017F>ecrets, I <U+017F>hould have been

you de<U+017F>ire me.</p>
            <p>I had nothing left me but to obey after <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere
a command, tho I never got to Hor<U+017F>eback with <U+017F>o

Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who was at <hi>Paris,</hi> of the
misfortune that was coming upon the Mare<U+017F>chal his

was always <U+017F>o very <U+017F>ecret in his affairs, had put this
into my hands on purpo<U+017F>e to make me run away;
but at la<U+017F>t my duty carry'd it again<U+017F>t all the obligations
I had to others, and I made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te to <U+017F>how my
zeal for my Ma<U+017F>ter, that I deliver'd my Packet <U+017F>ix
hours before they imagin'd I could be there.</p>
            <p>The Impri<U+017F>onment of this great man made noi<U+017F>e
enough; every one accus'd the Cardinal of cruelty
and inju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>o that daring not yet to bring things to
the la<U+017F>t extremity, he <U+017F>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And I, after I had thus punctually obey'd
him, thought he would have been generous enough
to permit me to interceed for him, and the more too,
becau<U+017F>e what I <U+017F>hould ask of him would but <U+017F>how
him that I had a principle of honour, more than in
hopes to effect any thing, where there was <U+017F>o pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
an Accu<U+017F>er; but I had no <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>cover'd my
intention, but I plainly <U+017F>aw, that great men are not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57806:29"/>
without their failings. He told me, all in a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
that he was glad with all his heart, that one of his
own Dome<U+017F>ticks was again<U+017F>t him, and withal ca<U+017F>t
<U+017F>uch a look at me, as made me tremble from head
to foot; and I may <U+017F>ay I was as much afraid, as if I
had been in the Trenches, or in a <U+017F>et Battle.</p>
            <p>I dur<U+017F>t not come near him any more that day, but
attending next morning at his Levee, he made as if
he did not <U+017F>ee me, and <U+017F>o took no notice of me at all:
As I had enemies enough in the hou<U+017F>e, my di<U+017F>grace was
pre<U+017F>ently publi<U+017F>ht, e<U+017F>pecially becau<U+017F>e one or other of
them heard my Compliment, and the Cardinals an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.
The Count <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons,</hi> who was an enemy to
the Cardinal, and had a mind to <U+017F>erve him a trick,
made this an opportunity of offering to entertain me
in his <U+017F>ervice; but tho he was a Prince of the Blood,
and propos'd to me great advantages, I return'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
That I was too much oblig'd to the Cardinal,
to think of changing my Ma<U+017F>ter. Another perhaps
would have acquainted his Eminence of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al;
indeed he could not endure to have any thing
hid from him, e<U+017F>pecially where his <U+017F>ervice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
but con<U+017F>idering the terms I <U+017F>tood in with him,
he might think, I fancy'd, that I did it to ingratiate
my <U+017F>elf again, <U+017F>o I never troubled his head with it.</p>
            <p>La Ferté, <hi>the Father of him whom we have <U+017F>ince
<U+017F>een Mare<U+017F>chal of</hi> France, <hi>belong'd to this Count, but
was a very treacherous Servant to his Ma<U+017F>ter; for he
was a perfect Spy upon him for the Cardinal; and
having di<U+017F>cover'd, I know not how, that I had been
<U+017F>poken to, the Cardinal heard of it from him, and
from that time reckon'd me a Traytor; and looking
on me <U+017F>till with an evil eye, he askt me one day if I
had nothing to acquaint him of? and I an<U+017F>wer'd him
No, that he had lockt up my mouth by the an<U+017F>wer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57806:30"/>
he had given me.</hi> Have not I lockt up your heart too,

            <p>I <U+017F>aid to him all that an innocent man could <U+017F>ay;
but as he <U+017F>till doubted the truth of it, he continu'd

it was. <hi>La Ferté</hi> did all he could, but under<U+017F>tanding
'twas one <hi>Mezieres</hi> had <U+017F>poke to me, who was a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57806:30"/>
man very faithful to his Ma<U+017F>ter, and from whom he
had no hopes to learn the <U+017F>ecret; he try'd if he could
pump it out of the Prince him<U+017F>elf; he told him that
I was a gallant Fellow, and behav'd my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi>
and had been very faithful ever <U+017F>ince I belong'd
to the Cardinal, but that the Cardinal had us'd me
very ill, and I had rea<U+017F>on for <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>entment; that
this was the time for him to gain over <U+017F>uch a man
into his <U+017F>ervice, who was worth having, and if he
pleas'd he would attempt it. The Count <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons,</hi>
who was a man without artifice or di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, told him
'twould be in vain, that <hi>Mezieres</hi> had <U+017F>poke to me
already, but there was nothing to be done with me.</p>
            <p>This re<U+017F>tor'd me to the Cardinals good opinion,
but not to any capacity to relieve Mr. <hi>de Marillac;</hi>
on the other hand the Cardinal was re<U+017F>olv'd to cut
him off, the more to de<U+017F>pight the Queen Mother,
who was always forming Parties again<U+017F>t him; and
whereas the pretences on which he apprehended him
were too weak, he came upon him for fal<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>ters,
a fault that every Captain in the Army is more or
le<U+017F>s guilty of. And indeed what General can be <U+017F>afe,
if he is an<U+017F>werable for all the actions of his Subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns?
'Twas on <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>light matter as this, that the
Cardinal begun the ruine of <U+017F>o great a per<U+017F>on; and
having gotten a Court Martial of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they que<U+017F>tion'd him on a thou<U+017F>and trifling <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that as a very worthy Gentleman <U+017F>aid, if they
had been all true, were not crimes <U+017F>ufficient to have
whipt a Page, and he an<U+017F>wer'd them Article by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<U+017F>o readily, and <U+017F>o directly, as puzzled all his
Judges: But the Cardinal, who <U+017F>aw them wavering,
<U+017F>ending them word they <U+017F>hould take heed what they
did, the fear they had upon them of his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure,
made them pa<U+017F>s the <U+017F>entence he de<U+017F>ired, for they

condemn'd him to have his Head cut off; which was

Knowing the nicety of his humour, I askt his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
if he would give me leave to put my <U+017F>elf into
Mourning; he told me I might do what I would,
which I under<U+017F>tood too well to venture upon it.</p>
            <p>A month or two after this, a match was propos'd
to me, which <U+017F>eem'd to be much for my intere<U+017F>t;
the Cardinal al<U+017F>o was very much for it, but not for

Lady was Niece, and Heir, to the Baron <hi>de Coupet,</hi> a

who carry'd it very high, had <U+017F>ent the Captain of his

pretence that he had <U+017F>poken di<U+017F>honourably of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

a great deal of di<U+017F>turbance, all the Gentry who
thought them<U+017F>elves toucht in <U+017F>uch an affront to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of Quality, were got together, an account of it
being <U+017F>ent to them by the Baron <hi>de Coupet,</hi> and they
all agreed that his Dignity <U+017F>ecur'd him from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment;
but yet they re<U+017F>olv'd that from that time
forward they would univer<U+017F>ally <U+017F>light him, and not
one of them come into his company; and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was that <U+017F>hould break this agreement <U+017F>hould
not be lookt upon as a per<U+017F>on of honour. This re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was exactly ob<U+017F>erv'd, and the Prince, who had
<U+017F>ome friends, and <U+017F>ome creatures, found him<U+017F>elf at

offering Money to <U+017F>everal, and <U+017F>ending it to others,
whom he believ'd in want: By which means he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Friend<U+017F>hip of mo<U+017F>t of them. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends of the Baron <hi>de Coupet</hi> would never
forgive him, and as they breath'd out nothing but
revenge, or at lea<U+017F>t pretended it, they ca<U+017F>t their eyes
upon me, in the propo<U+017F>al of this Marriage, hoping
by that means to be protected by the Cardinal;
they obtain'd it at fir<U+017F>t word, and the Cardinal told
me I could not do better: I was <U+017F>urpriz'd at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I that had neither E<U+017F>tate nor Employment, at
lea<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable enough to expect a fortune, and at
the <U+017F>ame time mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting <U+017F>omething in the bottom;
the <U+017F>ad example of my Father made me re<U+017F>olve to go
fair and <U+017F>oftly: In the mean time I <U+017F>aw the young
Lady, who was really very agreeable, but a little too
free, for the very <U+017F>econd time I <U+017F>aw her, <U+017F>he was
pleas'd to tell me, that being already as it were Man
and Wife, if <U+017F>he did give me tho<U+017F>e little liberties I
might de<U+017F>ire, I <U+017F>hould not con<U+017F>true it to her prejudice:
This was enough for me, I could under<U+017F>tand the re<U+017F>t,
and the<U+017F>e words made me examine her more nearly,
and I fancy'd <U+017F>he lookt a little big, upon which I grew
cold in my Court<U+017F>hip all of a <U+017F>udden. It <U+017F>eems I
was not deceiv'd, for it was even <U+017F>o; and as her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were much in the right to get her a Husband
with all <U+017F>peed, they took it mighty ill that I <U+017F>hould
draw back, in<U+017F>omuch that the Baron <hi>de Coupet</hi>
thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much affronted, as to fight me;
and to ruine me effectually, they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that 'twas the Count <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons</hi> that had di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
me from this match, and that I had taken

his part <U+017F>o violently, that they believ'd I had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
with their Kin<U+017F>man upon that account, for
that neither of us were to be found. They might
well tell him this circum<U+017F>tance, for 'twas them<U+017F>elves
who <U+017F>et us together by the ears. Neverthele<U+017F>s the
Cardinal believing every word of the <U+017F>tory, had
privately re<U+017F>olv'd my ruine, which appear'd plainly
enough, for at my return he order'd me to be clapt up
in Pri<U+017F>on, without hearing me <U+017F>peak for my <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>I apply'd my <U+017F>elf to <hi>La Houdiniere,</hi> the Captain of
his Guards, who was my Friend, and having <U+017F>ent to
beg him to come and <U+017F>ee me, I told him I was a lo<U+017F>t

one who could never have <U+017F>o offended him, as to be
deny'd the liberty to vindicate him<U+017F>elf. I begg'd him
to ask the Cardinal what it was I <U+017F>tood charg'd
with, and if I was guilty, he <U+017F>hould need no Judges
to give <U+017F>entence upon me; that my own hand <U+017F>hould

not outlive the lo<U+017F>s of his pre<U+017F>ence and favour. <hi>La

very re<U+017F>pectfully, and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ively thankt him for
his goodne<U+017F>s to me, begging him to believe, that I
was wholly incapable of Trea<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t him.</p>
            <p>Being thus in favour again, the Cardinal bad me
a few days after go and liquor my Boots, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for a little Journey he had for me: the de<U+017F>ign was
to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> whether Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> was fled;
<U+017F>he had pretended to manage the Queen Regent, and
had made a thou<U+017F>and Plots in the State, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
had a <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>till corre<U+017F>ponded with
<U+017F>ome of the Grandees, and I was in<U+017F>tructed to di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it. In the mean time, that it might not be <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
I was dre<U+017F>t up like a <hi>Capuchin;</hi> and to make
a little Brother, that was to be my Companion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it was really <U+017F>o, I wore the habit <U+017F>everal
days before I went; and be<U+017F>ides, I was admitted to
lodge at the Convent of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> in the <hi>Rue St.

               </gap> if I had been of <U+017F>ome Convent in the
Country. The Superior receiv'd me as one of the
Religious, being before in<U+017F>tructed about it by Father
<hi>Jo<U+017F>eph,</hi> the Cardinals Favourite; and I receiv'd al<U+017F>o
my orders from the <U+017F>ame Father <hi>Jo<U+017F>eph,</hi> who was a
man that minded other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>ometimes than tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Beads. Thus I parted for <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> purely
from a principle of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive Obedience, but otherwi<U+017F>e
very unfit to take <U+017F>o long a Journey on foot; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'twas a ca<U+017F>e of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, for fear I <U+017F>hould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the young Monk how little I was of a <hi>Capuchin.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57806:33"/>
But being not able to bear <U+017F>uch fatigues, nor us'd to
beg my <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance for God's <U+017F>ake, I cur<U+017F>t this Voyage
a thou<U+017F>and times, and wi<U+017F>ht as often that I had not
been <U+017F>o far engag'd in the intrigue; I arriv'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
after fifteen days travel, and tho 'twas thought
an ill thing in the Convent, I lay a bed two whole
days after it, for I was all cut and gall'd with tho<U+017F>e
hard Beds upon the Road, having been always us'd
to other <U+017F>ort of Lodging; and to compleat my mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
I was call'd upon to officiate at the Church,
<U+017F>o that I thought the Cardinal had <U+017F>ent me into <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this time I <U+017F>crap'd acquaintance with <U+017F>ome
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> that us'd to come to our Convent, and
making as if I did not know a certain man I <U+017F>aw of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in the Cloi<U+017F>ter, I askt them who it was, they
told me it was the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>de Laicques,</hi> who was the
very man I wanted. He had been Madam <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reu<U+017F>e</hi>'s
humble Servant a great many years, but at la<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>he being re<U+017F>olv'd to take him upon honour, <U+017F>he had
now exchang'd the ceremony of a Gallant, for the
familiarity of a Husband, and treated him as the late
Mr. <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e.</hi> I was in<U+017F>tructed in all this at <hi>Paris,</hi>
and that this Gentleman was the Arch-Dukes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
but the Cardinals de<U+017F>ign was to draw him
off from the intere<U+017F>ts of the Archduke, or if that
fail'd, I was to order it <U+017F>o, that I might inform the
Archduke, and make him jealous that his Favourite
held corre<U+017F>pondence with the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Laicques,</hi> who I long'd to be talking with, gave
me a very fair opportunity, by coming directly up
to me, and asking me <U+017F>everal things concerning the
Convent; I fail'd not to lay hold of the occa<U+017F>ion, I
entertain'd him with di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and making as if I
<U+017F>poke broken <hi>French,</hi> I made my excu<U+017F>e that my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57806:34"/>
Mother was a <hi>Walloon,</hi> and that my Father had had
<U+017F>everal misfortunes, and receiv'd <U+017F>ome wrongs, and
the like; he was very much pleas'd with my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
and came very often into our Convent to
<U+017F>ee me; till now, I dur<U+017F>t not di<U+017F>cover my <U+017F>elf not to
be a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> but he prevented me of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
by asking me if I would venture to carry <U+017F>ome
Letters of con<U+017F>equence into <hi>France?</hi> I told him I
<U+017F>hould be very glad to <U+017F>erve him, but in this ca<U+017F>e the
danger was <U+017F>o great I dur<U+017F>t not; he did what he
could to encourage me, but I always excus'd my <U+017F>elf,
that he might be the more eager, and withal to avoid
all manner of <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion; he pre<U+017F>t me again, telling
me I <U+017F>hould do a <U+017F>ervice to my Country, for which
I had expre<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much inclination, that is to <U+017F>ay on
account of my Mother, who I had told them was a
<hi>Fleming.</hi> I <U+017F>till made excu<U+017F>es, and to colour them
the more, told him, that if I <U+017F>hould promi<U+017F>e him to
do it, it was not in my power, being under the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Governours, and be<U+017F>ides what preten<U+017F>ions
could I make for going into <hi>France;</hi> which they all
knew I hated. This was the very argument he
watcht for; he told me then, if that was all the
difficulty, they would remove it without giving me
any trouble, that I had nothing to do but to give
them my word, and he would take care of the re<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>It was a long time before I could be per<U+017F>waded,
and <U+017F>eeming then to be prevail'd with by his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
they <U+017F>poke to the Superior, who being al<U+017F>o
<U+017F>ollicited by the Archduke him<U+017F>elf, could not refu<U+017F>e
it; it was re<U+017F>olv'd then, that I <U+017F>hould pretend to go
and drink the Waters at <hi>Forges,</hi> and that I <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>end notice to the per<U+017F>ons they would write to, to
fetch their Letters there; in the mean time they
gave me a Brother of the Habit to go with me, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57806:34"/>
away we went to <hi>Forges,</hi> when we came about half
way thither, I met a Courier which I had writ to
the Cardinal to <U+017F>end me, to whom I deliver'd the
Pacquet I receiv'd from <hi>de Laicques.</hi> The Cardinal
after he had taken an account of the contents, <U+017F>eal'd
it up again very exactly, return'd it to me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to give notice to the per<U+017F>on for whom
it was directed, that I was come; this was one <hi>la
Pierre</hi> an Advocate, who liv'd in a blind Alley near
the <hi>Place Maubert.</hi> He left <hi>Paris</hi> al<U+017F>o at the <U+017F>ame
time to meet me there, but before I <U+017F>aw him, I had
a man ready to watch him, that we might know
whither he went. He mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting nothing, at his
return to <hi>Paris,</hi> went directly to the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
Grand Ma<U+017F>ter of the Wardrobe, which was
<U+017F>ufficient to make us conclude, that the Pacquet was
for him; and what was more, it was al<U+017F>o di<U+017F>cover'd,
that this <hi>la Pierre,</hi> had been one of his Dome<U+017F>ticks;
but we needed none of the<U+017F>e remote circum<U+017F>tances,
for the Count <hi>de Chalais</hi> wrote an an<U+017F>wer him<U+017F>elf,
which I having <U+017F>ent to the Cardinal, his Eminence
knew it immediately to be his own hand; he was
very much <U+017F>urpriz'd at the contents, where they talkt
of taking off the King, marrying the Queen to the
Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and for him<U+017F>elf, his death <U+017F>hould
fini<U+017F>h the Tragedy, to make way for the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of
the Con<U+017F>piracy. This was but too much to bring
<hi>Chalais</hi> to the Block, and the King would have had
him apprehended immediately, but the Cardinal
being willing to di<U+017F>cover all the Con<U+017F>pirators, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with the King to delay it, on condition they
<U+017F>hould keep a <U+017F>trict eye upon him, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould
get away: In the mean time, to draw him from
<hi>Paris,</hi> they made a pretence to take a progre<U+017F>s into
<hi>Bretagne,</hi> and I return'd with my di<U+017F>patches to <hi>Bru<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els.</hi>

The Count <hi>de Chalais,</hi> who was far enough

attended him, had <U+017F>ent into <hi>Spain,</hi> pur<U+017F>uant to the
concert of matters in the Letters deliver'd him by <hi>la

at <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> and of which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had
been inform'd by an Expre<U+017F>s from the Queen, who
had a hand in the Con<U+017F>piracy, that is, <U+017F>o far as it
concern'd the De<U+017F>truction of the Cardinal, whom
<U+017F>he hated, but of all the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was innocent; and
was <U+017F>o far from the thoughts of marrying the Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that <U+017F>he did all <U+017F>he could to marry him
to her Si<U+017F>ter the Infanta of <hi>Spain.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi>
granted <hi>Chalais</hi> all that he de<U+017F>ir'd, but he had no
further enjoyment of it but in hopes, for his Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was <U+017F>eiz'd upon at his return, and the Cardinal
having now <U+017F>ufficient to convict him, delay'd no
longer his Execution.</p>
            <p>When this happen'd I was at <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well enough what a hand I had in it, I was not
without <U+017F>ome apprehen<U+017F>ions of being <U+017F>erv'd in the

any body may judge how it far'd with me in the
Convent, where I receiv'd from time to time my
orders from the Cardinal. The Marquis <hi>de Laicques</hi>
was <U+017F>till very intimate with me, but told me not a
word of what his intrigue had come to, being loth to
di<U+017F>courage me, by telling me of the ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of
their contrivances; for he had a de<U+017F>ign of making
further u<U+017F>e of me about a young Lady, whom he
often <U+017F>poke to me of, and expre<U+017F>t an extraordinary

not do it, con<U+017F>idering what had happen'd, for 'twould

deceive him. To <U+017F>peak of it to Madam <hi>De Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi>
or to her Gallant was to expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o to an
apparent danger, for they did nothing without one
another; <U+017F>o finding I could not be any more <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in tho<U+017F>e parts, I earne<U+017F>tly <U+017F>ollicited the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

Here I was forc'd always to play the Hypocrite, and
to talk in Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, a profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion very unplea<U+017F>ant to
me; here I was forc'd to go a begging, work in the
Garden, and to go with many a hungry belly: I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
reflected upon my leaving Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de St. Aunais,</hi>
to come to Court; it would not have been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I <U+017F>hould have been a Captain there, and now I

but that which troubled me mo<U+017F>t was, that I heard

the next <U+017F>treet I came at, where, having my Begging
Wallet at my back, I threw it in at a door, and going
directly to a Brokers, I whi<U+017F>per'd him in the Ear, and
told him that if he would <U+017F>ell me Suit of Clothes,
I would give him his own price; for I always had a

and in that I only differ'd from a <hi>Capuchin:</hi> The <U+017F>ight

to fetch me a Perriwig, a Sword, and a pair of Boots,
which compleated my accoutrements. In this equipage
I hir'd Po<U+017F>t-hor<U+017F>es, and riding on before the Po<U+017F>t-boy,
I got out of the Town as fa<U+017F>t as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; fear gave

not having been often on Hor<U+017F>eback I could not bear

being told that I was not yet come in, but they <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed

being <U+017F>o well order'd that no body perceiv'd me, they
all per<U+017F>waded the Archduke that I was <U+017F>till in the
City: the<U+017F>e delays were my <U+017F>ecurity, and they found
at night, <U+017F>eeing I did not come home, that I had
mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted <U+017F>omething, but <U+017F>till they fancy'd I was hid
<U+017F>omewhere in the Town, and <U+017F>o they <U+017F>ent out a
Proclamation for apprehending me, with a great

The Cardinal was very much <U+017F>urpriz'd when he
<U+017F>aw me, e<U+017F>pecially returning without his order, and
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing I came away only becau<U+017F>e I was weary of
my employment, he began to chide me in a furious
manner, but when I told him the danger I had been
in, and how narrowly I e<U+017F>capt, he chang'd his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and told me I had done very well; and he
him<U+017F>elf a little after gave me an account of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
I have related, and of the trouble the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
was in, that he could not find me out; and
he told me al<U+017F>o, that my Companion was clapt up in
Pri<U+017F>on, and was <U+017F>till there, and he believ'd was not
like to get out, till they had put him to the torture.</p>
            <p>I found at my arrival <U+017F>everal changes at Court;
the Marquis <hi>d' Humiers,</hi> Father of him who is now
Governour of the new Conque<U+017F>ts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
Mare<U+017F>chal of <hi>France,</hi> had receiv'd orders to quit his
place of fir<U+017F>t Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and
came every day to <U+017F>ollicit the Cardinal to endeavour
the recovery of it; but the Cardinal told him, he
mu<U+017F>t addre<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf to the King, from who<U+017F>e mouth
he had receiv'd the <U+017F>entence. His di<U+017F>grace was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd
by a very <U+017F>light matter, and he had this <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
at lea<U+017F>t, that it was not from any default of
his: He was red-hair'd, and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riwigs were not <U+017F>o
commonly wore in tho<U+017F>e days; wherefore he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the King hated the <U+017F>ight, comb'd his hair
with a Comb made of black lead, which colour'd
his hair as if it had been dy'd, <U+017F>o that the King knew
nothing but that 'twas naturally black; till one day,
as they were a hunting, there fell <U+017F>o much rain that
wa<U+017F>ht out the artificial colour, and di<U+017F>cover'd the
cheat; this was enough for the King to command
him, as I mention'd, to lay down his Office, and all
the Friends he could make, could not prevail with the
King to re-admit him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57806:37"/>
I receiv'd a great deal of kindne<U+017F>s from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
after I had <U+017F>hown him the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity there was for
my return; but whether it was that he lov'd to have
me always about him, or that he intended me no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
he contented him<U+017F>elf with gratifying me
from time to time, without thinking of any <U+017F>ettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for me: I had 2000 <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> given me at my
return, which was a con<U+017F>ideration noble enough, but
I was not of a humour to be rich, and therefore laid
up ne're a Groat: For I liv'd <U+017F>o extravagantly, that if I
had had a hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> I
<U+017F>hould have ballanc'd the account at the years end;
I knew well enough 'twas a fooli<U+017F>h way, yet I could
not tell how to help it: That I might therefore have
<U+017F>omewhat to tru<U+017F>t to, I askt the Cardinal to be<U+017F>tow
upon me a Company in the Guards, there happening
a vacancy at that time; but he told me I knew not
what I askt, for there was ne're a Captain in the
Guards, but would change Po<U+017F>ts with me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
that he had <U+017F>omewhat for me to do. Now
was I to think my <U+017F>elf oblig'd, and to thank him for
the favour of his refu<U+017F>al, tho I did not think it <U+017F>uch
an obligation, as he was pleas'd to account it: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he gave me another Abbey of <U+017F>ix thou<U+017F>and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
<hi>per annum,</hi> and I be<U+017F>tow'd it upon one of my
Brothers, at the very time when my Mother-in-law
was telling every body, that I had no intere<U+017F>t in the
Cardinal, and that he had <U+017F>o little value for me, that
I had lain two years in Pri<U+017F>on for debt.</p>
            <p>She meant my Journey to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> when <U+017F>he talkt
thus, which <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood nothing of, but tho I
heard this from <U+017F>everal, yet it did not at all hinder
me from doing what I thought my duty; there was
a great many in his condition who would have thankt
me for this; but when I came to propo<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57806:38"/>
<U+017F>honld give me a little con<U+017F>ideration, as is u<U+017F>ual in
<U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, <U+017F>he flew out again<U+017F>t me like a mad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<U+017F>he not only made a noi<U+017F>e of the difference I
had made between my Brother and the Curate, who<U+017F>e
Benefice I had given him <hi>gratis,</hi> but that I made my
Brother pay more than 'twas worth; <U+017F>o away <U+017F>he
goes to <hi>Orleans,</hi> to con<U+017F>ult the Ca<U+017F>ui<U+017F>ts, makes it a
Ca<U+017F>e of Con<U+017F>cience, and de<U+017F>ires to be inform'd, if
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not be guilty of Symony, in accepting this
Abbey for her Son.</p>
            <p>All this did not hinder me from doing my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for another of her Sons; knowing the elde<U+017F>t of
them did but lo<U+017F>e his time in a Country Village, I
got him into the Academy, where I paid for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and at la<U+017F>t brought him to the Cardinal,
and askt him how he would plea<U+017F>e to have me di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
of him. My de<U+017F>ign was to enter him among the
grand Mu<U+017F>queteers, but knowing that the Cardinal
was not very well with <hi>Treville</hi> who commanded
them, I would not do it without acquainting him
with it; I found I took the be<U+017F>t way too, for he told
me, I <U+017F>hould have a care of doing <U+017F>o, and <U+017F>hould rather
let him carry a Mu<U+017F>quet in <U+017F>ome other Regiment;
upon which I plac't him in the Guards, and in about
<U+017F>ix months time, the Cardinal procur'd me a Colours
for him, and he told me, when he gave it me, that
I might <U+017F>ee what difference he made between tho<U+017F>e
who were in his favour and others, for to tho<U+017F>e he
gave leave to <U+017F>erve him if they pleas'd, but the<U+017F>e he
took care to bind to him by obligations beyond their
merit.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things <U+017F>topt the mouth of my Mother-in-law
for the pre<U+017F>ent, and <U+017F>he was indeed afraid to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me <U+017F>o openly, for fear people <U+017F>hould throw <U+017F>tones
at her; but my Brother being unhappily kill'd the fir<U+017F>t
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57806:38"/>
Campagne he made, at the Siege of a Town in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> <U+017F>he begun to open louder than before, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about, that <U+017F>he knew me better than others; that
I had made away my Brother, that I might get the
E<U+017F>tate, and that 'twas for the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ign I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
two more of her Children to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had
put them into the Academy, and if I had indeed got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Benefice for another, 'twas only that he might
be oblig'd not to marry. Every one advis'd me to
let her alone for a mad woman, (if I may <U+017F>o call her)
and do no more for them; but what I did being for
my own <U+017F>ake more than hers, I never let the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
re<U+017F>t, till he had given me the Colours my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left, who was kill'd, to the elde<U+017F>t of the two
that were in the Academy: In the mean time, when
he came to march, I was fain to be at the charge of
all his Equipage, <U+017F>o that I may truly <U+017F>ay, that I had
the trouble and charge of Children, without having
had the plea<U+017F>ure of getting them.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things, together with my extravagant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
empty'd my <U+017F>tock, which made me often tell the
Cardinal in je<U+017F>t, that I was a Basket without a bottom,
but that he was like to pay for it all. So when ever
I was out of pocket, I would come to him and cry,
<hi>Good my Lord, have pity upon a poor Father who has <U+017F>ix
Children.</hi> 'Tis true I knew my time when 'twas fit to
make the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of compliments, I took him when
he was in a humour to laugh, and he <U+017F>eldom deny'd
me any thing; in <U+017F>hort I got about fifteen thou<U+017F>and
Livres a year of him in this manner, one year with
another, be<U+017F>ides the two Abbeys, and the two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns
in the Guards; he plac'd al<U+017F>o one of my Si<U+017F>ters
in the Nunnery <hi>de Monmartre,</hi> without co<U+017F>ting me a
Farthing; all which made me lookt upon to be not
a little in his favour, and yet I was <U+017F>till very much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57806:39"/>
di<U+017F>contented with my condition, for 'twas a daily
mortification to me to think that I had nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and if the Cardinal <U+017F>hould dye, I knew not
where to hide my head. He was about this time
building the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and waiting on him once thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>My Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>if I might but one time or other
come to have a Chamber here, with a Doctors allowance, I
<U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf a very happy Fellow. Thou art never
<U+017F>atisfy'd,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>thou costest me more than any four of
my Servants, and yet thou art always grumbling. God
forbid, my Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>but I am young now, and am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of wanting when I grow old. Why art thou <U+017F>uch an
ill husband then,</hi> reply'd he. <hi>Ah my Lord,</hi> return'd I,
<hi>your Eminence knows very well what a charge of Children I
have, and that I never ask you till I am in great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and
that notwith<U+017F>tanding all your bounty, I have not a penny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand.
I know your meaning,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>you would have
<U+017F>omething <U+017F>ettled on you in ca<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould dye; well, I will
think of it.</hi> I thankt him very heartily, for tho<U+017F>e
words comforted me exceedingly; 'twas above a
fortnight after this, before his Eminence took any
more notice of it; and thinking it not proper to
importune him every day, I gave my attendance
con<U+017F>tantly without <U+017F>peaking a word more to him of it;
but at la<U+017F>t he took me into his Clo<U+017F>et, and opening
a little Cabinet, <hi>Thou askest, me,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>for <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and 'tis but rea<U+017F>onable thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t have it;</hi> <U+017F>o pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out a <U+017F>mall Parchment ty'd with little Ribbons
he put it into my hands. <hi>Here,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>there is a
thou<U+017F>and Crowns a year upon the Bank of</hi> Lions, <hi>I think
thou art <U+017F>o ill a Husband that thou art not fit to be tru<U+017F>ted
with it, but as it comes in annually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s how overjoy'd I was at this
noble pre<U+017F>ent, I was better pleas'd with it than if he
had given me twenty thou<U+017F>and Crowns, for in <U+017F>hort
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57806:39"/>
I knew my own humour, and was not ignorant, tho
I could not help it, that I was not capable of laying
up a penny. This created me a great deal of envy in
the Family, when it was known how generous his
Eminence had been to me; and the other Servants
mutter'd at it, that all the kindne<U+017F>s was <U+017F>hown to
the new comers, while the old <U+017F>tanders were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
but all this was nothing to the noi<U+017F>e and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys
of my Mother-in-law: She told about, that it
was in vain to think to throw du<U+017F>t in her eyes, that
my ill nature would appear too plain, whatever di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e
I put upon it, but that it had never appear'd
better than on this occa<U+017F>ion, when I pretended to
have receiv'd a Pre<U+017F>ent from the Cardinal, to colour
my de<U+017F>ign of cheating my lawful Heirs: That I had
put the Money into the Bank my <U+017F>elf, and that I <U+017F>o
conceal'd whatever I got with the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ign. My
Father coming up to <hi>Paris,</hi> I complain'd to him of
this conduct of hers, but he poor man was <U+017F>o weak,
and <U+017F>o cow'd by his Wife, that 'twas to no more
purpo<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak to him, than to run ones head again<U+017F>t
the Wall.</p>
            <p>We were very much at <hi>Ruel,</hi> where the Cardinal
had a mo<U+017F>t delicious Seat, and it being a very fine
Country for <U+017F>port, which I extreamly lov'd, I never
thought the time long we <U+017F>pent there. There was
one <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who they nick-nam'd the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the
Captain of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and we being intimate friends
he us'd to call me out often to hunt with him; and
one day among the re<U+017F>t, having run down a Deer
in the Forre<U+017F>t, after the Sport was over, he would
needs have me with him to <U+017F>ee a little piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
that he kept at a by-hou<U+017F>e, out of the road;
I excus'd my <U+017F>elf for that time, and having left him,
he went all alone, without <U+017F>o much as a Valet; as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57806:40"/>
he came back, he meets a Country Gentlemans man
with a Fu<U+017F>ee on his <U+017F>houlder, and having askt him,
if he did not know that that was forbidden; the
Fellow <U+017F>eeing him all alone an<U+017F>wer'd, Yes that he
did, but he had a mind to kill a Hare, and what
then? <hi>Beaumont,</hi> a little <U+017F>tirr'd with this an<U+017F>wer, askt
him if he knew who he <U+017F>poke to. <hi>Know you?</hi> <U+017F>aid
the Rogue in<U+017F>olently, <hi>Yes, very well, you are markt
plain enough, any body may know you. Beaumont</hi> you
mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand had but one Eye, and therefore was
toucht to the quick with this impudent an<U+017F>wer; but
<U+017F>eeing the fellow upon his guard, he blew his Horn,
that if any body had been near him, they might
come to his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; upon which the fellow, who
was no Fool, retir'd immediately, and got away <U+017F>afe
to his Ma<U+017F>ters hou<U+017F>e, where I happen'd to be ju<U+017F>t
at that time; he told us not a word of what had
happen'd to him, if he had, we could have made it
up at fir<U+017F>t with a word <U+017F>peaking, but as we were at
Table, and he newly gone down into the Kitchin,
we heard a noi<U+017F>e in the Court, which made us ri<U+017F>e
to <U+017F>ee what was the matter; I was <U+017F>urpriz'd as well as
the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Hou<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ee the Yard full of
Blue Coats, being a party of the Guards, that <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
had <U+017F>ent. The fellow ignorantly came out to
them him<U+017F>elf, and askt them their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, who not
knowing his face, enquir'd for him by his own name,
which was enough to tell him their errand: So he
took no notice at all, but told them, he would go
in and call him. In<U+017F>tead of which he went and laid
him<U+017F>elf all along upon a beam, which was but that
morning put up in a hou<U+017F>e his Ma<U+017F>ter was building,
and he lay <U+017F>o, that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ee him; in
the mean time, the Gentleman taking this for a great
affront, that the<U+017F>e men <U+017F>hould come thus into his

hou<U+017F>e, was ju<U+017F>t going to di<U+017F>charge a Fu<U+017F>ee at them,

up to the Guards, who all knew me, I askt
them what was the matter, they told me the whole
<U+017F>tory as I have related it; <U+017F>o having de<U+017F>ir'd them not
to pre<U+017F>s into the hou<U+017F>e, till I came to them again, I
went and told the Ma<U+017F>ter, and propos'd that he
would let one of the Guards go in with me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them that the Servant was not in the hou<U+017F>e, I
had a great deal of difficulty to bring him to this, but
having told him the con<U+017F>equences of a refu<U+017F>al, he
was prevail'd on; in the mean time, the Guards
having be<U+017F>et the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that they were <U+017F>ure he
could no way e<U+017F>cape, they were for <U+017F>earching every
corner, and there was not a nook, nor a hole, but
they pry'd into; but finding 'twas all in vain, and
the fellow was not to be found, they concluded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
le<U+017F>s, than that he was beholding to the Devil
to convey him away. The Gentleman knew no

good while after they were all gone, and the coa<U+017F>t
clear, that he <U+017F>aw him creeping down from the

            <p>When the fellow under<U+017F>tood the danger he had

when finding him faltring in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and giving

committed, the Judges order'd enquiry to be

had told <U+017F>o many People of the inhuman action of
his Son, that the whole Town came in again<U+017F>t him;
the Officer having made this report, and due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings

            <p>This was without doubt a good le<U+017F><U+017F>on to all tho<U+017F>e,
who flatter them<U+017F>elves with hopes of e<U+017F>caping divine

I had, as I <U+017F>aid, obtain'd an En<U+017F>ign in the Guards
for my Brother, who had been at two or three
Sieges which had been made that Campagne; and
the Cardinal, being de<U+017F>irous to know how he had
behav'd him<U+017F>elf, enquir'd of the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
who came one morning to make his Court to
him; the <hi>Valet,</hi> who was in waiting at that time,
told me of it, and that the Mare<U+017F>chal made an<U+017F>wer,
that he was a very brisk young fellow. I took my
mea<U+017F>ures from this, to do <U+017F>omething yet better for
him, but being a<U+017F>ham'd to be always asking, I went
this way to work: we had yet a Brother whom the
Cardinal had not <U+017F>een, who began now to be of age fit
to go into the Army, and was a very compleat young
Lad; I pre<U+017F>ented him to the Cardinal, and askt
him, as I us'd to do of the others, how his Eminence
pleas'd I <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him? the Cardinal charm'd
with the <U+017F>ight of him, told me I ought to be very
well <U+017F>atisfy'd to have a Brother of his <U+017F>hape and
meen. <hi>My Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, at the <U+017F>ame time, <hi>an En<U+017F>ign
of the Guards would <U+017F>it very well on <U+017F>uch a Gentleman as he
is like to make, and a Lieutenancy on his Brother; and
<U+017F>ince it happens that there is <U+017F>uch a Vacancy now in the <U+017F>ame
Company, if your Eminence would plea<U+017F>e to be<U+017F>tow it on
him, I would <U+017F>ay, if I dur<U+017F>t, that he will not be wanting
in his Duty, or Courage for the Kings Service, when there
<U+017F>hall be opportunity.</hi> He con<U+017F>ider'd a while of what I
<U+017F>aid, and then return'd upon me, <hi>You have a mind
to bring me, and Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> d' E<U+017F>pernon <hi>together by the
Ears; don't you know he will let no body encroach upon his
Office, and that t'other day he would needs quarrel with the
King, for but offering to give away a Company in the Guards
which belong'd to him. My Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid I <U+017F>miling, <hi>if he
quarrels with your Eminence, here is three Brothers of us
will be your Seconds; and the re<U+017F>t, as they grow up, <U+017F>hall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57806:42"/>
all engage on your <U+017F>ide. Thou <U+017F>paeke<U+017F>t fair,</hi> <U+017F>ays the
Cardinal, <hi>but go to him from me, and tell him, he will
oblige me in gratifying you.</hi> I did not fail to return
him thanks for <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable a favour, and going
immediately to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>d' E<U+017F>pernon,</hi> he was pleas'd
to tell me, that I needed not his Eminences Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter, which I <U+017F>hould
have commanded from him at a word from my <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>Certainly the bounty of my Ma<U+017F>ter, the Cardinal,
was without example, and all my trouble was, that
I was not able to make any <U+017F>uitable return for <U+017F>o
many obligations; I <U+017F>ought however, as much as
it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for opportunities to expre<U+017F>s my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
and being one day drinking with <U+017F>everal
Gentlemen, one of them, that was an <hi>Engli<U+017F>hman,</hi>
began to reflect upon the Cardinal, whether it was
that the Wine was gotten into his head, and <U+017F>o
talkt he knew not what, or that he had <U+017F>ome private
malice again<U+017F>t him, I know not, but I de<U+017F>ir'd him
very civilly to <U+017F>peak in other language of my Ma<U+017F>ter,
unle<U+017F>s he re<U+017F>olv'd to di<U+017F>oblige me; but he talking the
more reproachfully for my taking notice of it, I lo<U+017F>t
all patience at that, and taking up a Plate I threw
it at his head; he was pre<U+017F>ently for drawing out his
Sword, but I was ready for him, <U+017F>o he lo<U+017F>t his de<U+017F>ign,
which was to have <U+017F>urpriz'd me before I could have
drawn; our Friends <U+017F>tepping in, prevented our fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that time, and endeavour'd to reconcile us,
but it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to bring him to any thing, for
going out he made a motion to me to wait upon him.
Every one of the Company offer'd me their <U+017F>ervice,
but I thankt them, and told them I <U+017F>aw no occa<U+017F>ion
to fear, however two of them would not leave me
till they <U+017F>aw me at my Lodgings, that if we had met
him, who had al<U+017F>o two friends, who went out with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57806:42"/>
him, we might have been upon equal terms, but we
<U+017F>aw no body, tho we went the direct way on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The next morning before I was up, my <hi>Valet de
Chambre</hi> came and told me, there was one wanted to
<U+017F>peak with me; I pre<U+017F>ently imagin'd it was from the
Gentleman, and bid him let him in, and de<U+017F>ir'd him
to <U+017F>it down by my bed <U+017F>ide. I knew him immediately
to be one of tho<U+017F>e two per<U+017F>ons, that went out with
him; <U+017F>o making a <U+017F>ign to him to <U+017F>ay nothing of his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, till I had <U+017F>ent my man out of the way, I
held him in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of one thing or another, as if
we had been very well acquainted, till I made
an errand to <U+017F>end away my man, and then he made
me his compliment, which was thus, That I had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
his Friend, who was a Per<U+017F>on of Quality,
and that nothing but my life could repair the injury I
had offer'd him: That he waited for me with one of
his friends, not reckoning him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o that I mu<U+017F>t
bring two of mine along with me to entertain them.</p>
            <p>There was nothing in all his compliment which
troubled me, but that I <U+017F>hould involve any body in
my quarrel; I could not tell who to think on a good
while, but immediately recollecting that I had two
Brothers, who had <U+017F>ome right to the quarrel, as
having <U+017F>o greatly <U+017F>har'd of the Cardinals bounty, I
re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>eek no further; <U+017F>o I <U+017F>ent for them, and
taking them with me towards the <hi>Bois de Boulogne,</hi>
which was the place appointed, where we found our
Adver<U+017F>aries ready; we immediately drew, and fell
to it. My younger Brother was wounded the fir<U+017F>t
Pa<U+017F>s, and tho it was a very dangerous thru<U+017F>t, yet he
at the <U+017F>ame time di<U+017F>arm'd and wounded his man; I
had done the <U+017F>ame with mine, and going together to
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t our elde<U+017F>t Brother, his Adver<U+017F>ary at that very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57806:43"/>
moment made a Pa<U+017F>s through his body, with which
he fell dead at his feet: This was a <U+017F>ight enough to
have mov'd any Brother to revenge; be<U+017F>ides the
blood which flow'd from his wound who was left,
had arguments in it to urge me to refu<U+017F>e him quarter;
but he begging his life upon our pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him very
hard, I thought it would not be for our honour to
refu<U+017F>e him.</p>
            <p>We brought off three Swords, a <U+017F>mall Trophy
compar'd to the lo<U+017F>s of our Brother, whom we left
dead upon the <U+017F>pot; and yet this was not all, for the
wound my younger Brother receiv'd, having pierc'd
his Vitals, tho the <U+017F>trength of his con<U+017F>titution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter'd
it for <U+017F>ome days, I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht to <U+017F>ee him
give up the gho<U+017F>t in my arms; I was never <U+017F>o griev'd
in my life, <U+017F>eeing my <U+017F>elf the cau<U+017F>e of the ruine of
two <U+017F>uch hopeful youths, whom I had, as it were,
led to be <U+017F>laughter'd on my account: 'Tis ea<U+017F>y to be
imagin'd the clamour of my Mother-in-law at this
news, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t me all that rage and fury could
put into her mouth, which I knew not what to <U+017F>ay
to, only that if I had known what would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
I <U+017F>hould have been more cautious of afflicting
her. I might have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething more for my ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but I thought 'twas more proper to let
others <U+017F>peak for me, and I flatter'd my <U+017F>elf that there
was none but were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the innocence of my
intention; but among all the<U+017F>e troubles which were
not <U+017F>mall, you will <U+017F>ay, I had yet another which
rackt me night and day, for tho the Cardinals ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had been the cau<U+017F>e of our quarrel, yet Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
being <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly forbidden, he would not <U+017F>ee
me, and I was oblig'd to ab<U+017F>cond as if I had been a
Murtherer; they told me at the <U+017F>ame time, that he
had order'd <U+017F>earch to be made for me, in order to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57806:43"/>
deliver me over to the Judges, and that he had <U+017F>ent
for the <hi>Procurator General</hi> about it. <hi>La Houdiniere,</hi>
who was always my Friend, was the fir<U+017F>t that advis'd
me to keep out of the way, telling me the Cardinal
was in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that he dur<U+017F>t not expo<U+017F>e him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to <U+017F>peak in my behalf; I dur<U+017F>t not de<U+017F>ire him to
do it neither, for fear his Eminence <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
he had <U+017F>een me, and I thought he would be more
<U+017F>erviceable to me, if without taking notice of any
thing, he <U+017F>hould endeavour to <U+017F>ound the intention of
the Cardinal. Things continu'd thus three months,
which was a long while for a man to lye incognito,
and if I had any Enemies, this was their time to
ruine me, and 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to reckon how many
<U+017F>tories they told of me to the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Maulevriere</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> was one
of the<U+017F>e, tho I had laid <U+017F>everal obligations on him,
and therefore always lookt upon him as my friend;
for 'twas thro my means that he got to be an En<U+017F>ign
in the Guards, which he had been refu<U+017F>ed; and <U+017F>ince
that I had introduc'd him to the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi>
to go with him to the Army; and I may truly <U+017F>ay,
that he <U+017F>how'd him a great deal of favour on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
This man, who was of a Family of the long
Robe, and <U+017F>uch a one as there were a thou<U+017F>and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in that Province, was always cracking, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him<U+017F>elf upon his Nobility, in <U+017F>uch manner, that
to hear him talk, one would not que<U+017F>tion but he
could derive his Pedigree from <hi>St. Lewis:</hi> I had told
him my opinion of this fooli<U+017F>h way of his a little
freely, which he pretended to take very friendly;
but my di<U+017F>grace coming upon this, he prov'd the
greate<U+017F>t Enemy I had; in <U+017F>hort, I was told by <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that he never had any opportunity to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with the Cardinal, but he us'd it to my di<U+017F>advantage;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57806:44"/>
which I re<U+017F>ented <U+017F>o ill, that though I was reduc'd to
this condition for fighting, I de<U+017F>ir'd to be at liberty
for nothing more than to demand <U+017F>atisfaction of
him. <hi>La Houdiniere</hi> was one of tho<U+017F>e that gave me
account of this, and coming to <U+017F>ee me one day told
me, I <U+017F>hould lay a<U+017F>ide all tho<U+017F>e thoughts, for the
Cardinal him<U+017F>elf had <U+017F>ufficiently reveng'd me of this
<hi>Norman.</hi> I no <U+017F>ooner heard that word, but I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to know the Hi<U+017F>tory of it, which was thus.
That he being come to his Eminence, and beginning
to reflect upon me as he us'd to do, the Cardinal told
him, 'twas a trick of a Ra<U+017F>cal to abu<U+017F>e one who was
ab<U+017F>ent, and could not an<U+017F>wer for him<U+017F>elf; that he
had known me longer than he had done, but that
it was not my practice to <U+017F>peak ill of any body; that
I was a fellow who had behav'd my <U+017F>elf well, but
was no boa<U+017F>ter of my own actions, and that perhaps
my misfortunes would not la<U+017F>t always. I could not
believe this was a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e likely to come from the
man that pro<U+017F>ecuted me; however I took it as a good
Omen, and it encourag'd me to have patience, till
time <U+017F>hould produce <U+017F>omething to my advantage.</p>
            <p>'Twas a whole month before I had the lea<U+017F>t rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
to hope, but at la<U+017F>t, when I began to de<U+017F>pair,
<hi>La Houdiniere</hi> came to me from the Cardinal to tell
me, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>urrender my <U+017F>elf to Pri<U+017F>on, and
fear nothing; he told me al<U+017F>o, that his Eminence
askt very kindly after me, telling him, that he knew
him to be my con<U+017F>tant Friend, and further <U+017F>ays <hi>La
Houdiniere, I am mi<U+017F>taken if you have not as great a <U+017F>hare
in the Cardinals favour as ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not <U+017F>ay, that I was very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the
kindne<U+017F>s he expre<U+017F>t, and that I de<U+017F>ir'd <hi>La Houdiniere</hi>
to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure his Eminence, that I had all imaginable <U+017F>ence
of his goodne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o I pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>urrender'd my <U+017F>elf to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57806:44"/>
Pri<U+017F>on, without requiring any a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my <U+017F>afety,
more than the Cardinals word. Tho<U+017F>e who heard
what I had done, but knew nothing of what had
pa<U+017F>t between the Cardinal and me, thought I was
out of my wits, and pitty'd my folly: Others, who
wi<U+017F>ht me ill enough, took this occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ollicit
again<U+017F>t me, and tho, as the Cardinal did me the
ju<U+017F>tice to <U+017F>ay, I never did any man any wrong, yet
I found a thou<U+017F>and that were glad of the opportunity
they thought they had to ruine me, and the wor<U+017F>t
Enemy I had, was the Count <hi>de Maulevriere,</hi> who
had married to his <U+017F>econd Wife, a Relation of the
Pre<U+017F>ident <hi>de Bailleul,</hi> and he employ'd her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to engage her Unkle again<U+017F>t me; and if that
Magi<U+017F>trate had not been an hone<U+017F>ter man than he, I
had been in great danger; but I found the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
again<U+017F>t me <U+017F>o favourable, that if I had drawn it
up my <U+017F>elf, I could not have contriv'd it better. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of aggravating the matter, or indeed of telling
the very matter of fact, as I have here done, there
was a relation, how the man not only abus'd me at
Table, but lay in wait for me at the <hi>Bois de Boulogue,</hi>
as I was returning from <hi>Ver<U+017F>ailles</hi> with my two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
that <hi><U+017F>e defendendo,</hi> I was oblig'd to draw as
well as tho<U+017F>e that were with me, and that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
I had fir<U+017F>t endeavour'd to tell him, the regard he
ought to have had to the Kings Edicts, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of di<U+017F>obeying in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es as this; and being fill'd
with a great deal of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tuff, and having <U+017F>o much
care taken of me, without my help, my ju<U+017F>tification
was both <U+017F>hort and ea<U+017F>y.</p>
            <p>I was <U+017F>till ignorant to whom I ow'd this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tho I <U+017F>ometimes fancy'd it mu<U+017F>t be the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
yet I could not think <U+017F>o long, when I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a man who had <U+017F>o much kindne<U+017F>s for me,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57806:45"/>
<U+017F>hould let me lye <U+017F>o long neglected in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
and would rather have told me how it was,
than <U+017F>end me a bare me<U+017F><U+017F>age not to fear: Being
however got out of Pri<U+017F>on, I went to throw my <U+017F>elf
at his Eminence's feet, whom I told I would deal
more <U+017F>incerely with, than I had done with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
that I would hone<U+017F>tly confe<U+017F>s to him, that
I had broken the Kings Order, but if I had been to
be a Vagabond twice as long as I had been, or to
have lo<U+017F>t my head upon a Scaffold, I could never
bear to hear him abus'd. <hi>Have a care who hears you,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, taking me up, <hi>'tis I that have brought you out of
this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, tho no body knows of it; and whereas I did
<U+017F>end indeed for the Procurator General to make your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
it was only with de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>ave you; if I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you as much,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>'twas becau<U+017F>e I make no
man Ma<U+017F>ter of my <U+017F>ecrets:</hi> Bouteville <hi>and</hi> de Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,
<hi>were executed but t'other day for the <U+017F>ame thing,
and what would they have <U+017F>aid of me,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>if I had
<U+017F>av'd one of my own Servants, when I but ju<U+017F>t before had
taken off a Relation of one of the fir<U+017F>t Princes of the blood,
and two Gentlemen allied to the chief Families in</hi> France.</p>
            <p>So obliging a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this made me throw
my <U+017F>elf again at his feet, and embracing his knees,
<hi>My Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>when <U+017F>hall I be <U+017F>o happy, as to dye for
<U+017F>o good a Ma<U+017F>ter; I mu<U+017F>t have liberty to <U+017F>ight again<U+017F>t all
that declare them<U+017F>elves his Enemies.</hi> He was extreamly
pleas'd to <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o zealous, and he took <U+017F>o much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in hearing me expre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf in this manner,
that he thought not of rai<U+017F>ing me from his foot.</p>
            <p>What he had told me of <hi>Bouteville</hi> and <hi>de Chappelle</hi>
was very true, but he did not tell me how he grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
his private grudge in executing the rigour of the
Law upon them. <hi>Bouteville</hi> being Father to the
pre<U+017F>ent Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Luxemburgh,</hi> was Cou<U+017F>in to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57806:45"/>
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as he told me, but to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>trictly
to the Prince<U+017F>s his Wife; but that honour was <U+017F>old
him very dear: You mu<U+017F>t know that the Duke
<hi>D' Enguien,</hi> elde<U+017F>t Son to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> having
marry'd Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Bre<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> the Cardinal's Niece,
and his Father having been forc't, again<U+017F>t his Will,
to con<U+017F>ent to that Match purely to <U+017F>ave his life, or at
lea<U+017F>t his liberty, his Son, who knew how he was
impos'd upon, lookt upon his Marriage as a mark of
his bondage to the Cardinals tyranny; and from
thence de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing both the Relation and the Wife, he
reproacht her daily with a thou<U+017F>and reflections, and
not altogether without cau<U+017F>e; her Birth was con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and <U+017F>he came of a very Ancient Family;
but the Duke <hi>D' Enguien,</hi> having employ'd a man
ver<U+017F>t in Heraldry to <U+017F>earch out the Original of her
Family, and he, after turning it from <U+017F>ide to <U+017F>ide,
made his report, whether 'twas true or no, that the
Hou<U+017F>e <hi>de Maille,</hi> of which <U+017F>he was de<U+017F>cended, came
by Ba<U+017F>terdy from an Archbi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Tours;</hi> this was
enough for that Duke, not only to in<U+017F>ult his Wife,
but al<U+017F>o to be very <U+017F>harp in reproaching the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and nothing being done but he had his Emi<U+017F><U+017F>aries
to inform him of it, he was <U+017F>o mov'd at this, that he
only waited for an opportunity to <U+017F>how his re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and 'twas not long before had one<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
               <hi>Bouteville,</hi>
who happen'd to fight a Duel, not only again<U+017F>t the
Kings Edict, but again<U+017F>t a particular order to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
was <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely pur<U+017F>ued, that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
before he could reach into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the
Count <hi>de Chappelle</hi> his Cou<U+017F>in, who was his Second,
and <U+017F>led along with him, was al<U+017F>o taken; and it
being to do a de<U+017F>pight to the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Conde,</hi> the
Cardinal caus'd them to be executed by the Hands
of the Common Hangman, under pretence of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57806:46"/>
Ju<U+017F>tice, but indeed to <U+017F>atisfy his private revenge.</p>
            <p>After I was thus re<U+017F>tor'd into favour, the Cardinal,
who lov'd me more than ever, made me <U+017F>everal gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
and askt me, If I had ne'r another Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prefer? I told him I had two, one to whom
I had given the la<U+017F>t Abbey, which his Eminence was
pleas'd to be<U+017F>tow on me; but that for the other, I
did not de<U+017F>ire to concern my <U+017F>elf for him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the misfortune to be accus'd of the death of
three others, I was unwilling to expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf to
the like reproach: I told him however I had a Si<U+017F>ter
that pa<U+017F>t in the world, for <U+017F>omething hand<U+017F>ome,
and intended to marry her to one of my Friends,
a Gentleman of <hi>Brettany,</hi> and that I only waited for
my Father and Mother-in-law's an<U+017F>wer. He heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to all this with a <U+017F>ingular goodne<U+017F>s; and a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
falling near us, which was in his Gift, he gave
it me without asking, and I pre<U+017F>ented it as freely to
my Brother, who was already in Orders; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
the mouth of my Mother-in-law afre<U+017F>h, who
complain'd now that one mu<U+017F>t have all and t'other
none; and that I ought rather to have given it to
him that had nothing. I e'n let her <U+017F>ay what <U+017F>he
wou'd, and only waited for an an<U+017F>wer to the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
about my Si<U+017F>ter, which it was three months before
they wou'd vouch<U+017F>afe to grant me; at la<U+017F>t, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
having a <U+017F>uit at Law that brought him to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and being glad to make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome friends of mine
to <U+017F>ollicit for him, he <U+017F>ent me a Note where I might
find him; I went to him immediately, and after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him my re<U+017F>pects, I askt him how it came about
that I had not heard from him all this while? <hi>'Tis
long of your Mother,</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd he very ingenuou<U+017F>ly,
<hi>who believes you have a de<U+017F>ign to deceive us: But Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid
I, <hi>what do you believe of it? In troth,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57806:46"/>
<U+017F>ame freedom, <hi>I know not what to think of it, for when
the Debate lyes between a Wife that a Man loves, and a
Son who has oblig'd him, one has a difficult task to decide
it. You have no Obligation at all, Sir, to me,</hi> <U+017F>aid I,
<hi>but methinks you ought at lea<U+017F>t to do me a little more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not care to urge it any farther out of re<U+017F>pect
to him: His Cau<U+017F>e was again<U+017F>t Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
a Man from whom we have <U+017F>een a great many
Dukes and Governours of Provinces, and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
de<U+017F>cended; <U+017F>o that it was, as I may <U+017F>ay, the
Earthen Pot floating by the Iron Pot, which made me
doubtful of the Event, and I told my Father 'twould
be be<U+017F>t for him to accommodate the matter; he
told me he was willing to do <U+017F>o, upon which I
<U+017F>pake to the Cardinal, who had done <U+017F>o many things
for me, that he would plea<U+017F>e to concern him<U+017F>elf in
this. His Eminence <U+017F>poke of it that very day to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de la Vieuville.</hi> But he, who thought that upon
the account of his powerful intere<U+017F>t, he was able to
cru<U+017F>h my Father, as I hinted before; or at lea<U+017F>t that
he <U+017F>hould tire him out, an<U+017F>wer'd the Cardinal, that
he would do any thing he de<U+017F>ir'd him, but intreated
him rather to leave their Controver<U+017F>y to the deci<U+017F>ion
of the Law; the Cardinal could not well in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon
it after that, <U+017F>o he told me, that my Father mu<U+017F>t
not expect any accommodation, for Mr. <hi>De la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
would not hearken to it; but that for my <U+017F>ake
he would e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>e the Cau<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf for my Father:
I carried this great news to my Father, which at fir<U+017F>t
he could hardly believe. So the Proce<U+017F>s began, and
my Father having <U+017F>et forth in his Bill of Complaint,
that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Vieuville</hi> had committed <U+017F>everal
Wa<U+017F>ts, in a Village that we had near <hi>Nogent L' Arth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi>
which belong'd to him; he had not only the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57806:47"/>
impudence in his An<U+017F>wer to give him the Lye, but
run on in <U+017F>uch ill language again<U+017F>t our Family, as if
we had not been <U+017F>o much as Gentlemen. As no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
can offend but what is grounded on truth, <U+017F>o
nothing vext me in this but the Lye, tho I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>atisfy'd afterwards, when the Lawyers told me,
that the<U+017F>e were but words of cour<U+017F>e, which they
always put into their Pleas, without any de<U+017F>ign of
particular affront; and withal being <U+017F>trictly charg'd
by the Cardinal not to demand any other <U+017F>atisfaction,
I re<U+017F>olv'd to u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame Arms again<U+017F>t them, and the
next day return'd them the Lye, and prov'd our
Nobility. At night the Cardinal askt me how our
Cau<U+017F>e went on, and I having told him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
he wonder'd he <U+017F>aid, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o much upon that Nicety, his
Nobility being not <U+017F>o much above ours, and if I knew
what <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had <U+017F>aid one time to his Father, I
might have been <U+017F>ufficiently even with him upon
that <U+017F>core.</p>
            <p>He had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid thus, but I begg'd his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to tell me what it was, which he made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to do, but told me, that the Father of this <hi>de
la Vieuville</hi> belong'd to the Duke <hi>de Nevers,</hi> who to
recompence him for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervices which he had
done him, <U+017F>o often importun'd <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to
make him Knight of the Order, that he could not
put him off; and it being the Cu<U+017F>tom, that when the
King puts on the Coller of the Order, the Knight
kneeling down <U+017F>ays, <hi>Domine non <U+017F>um dignus;</hi> Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de la Vieuville</hi> repeating the <U+017F>ame words, the King
reply'd aloud, <hi>I know that well enough, but I mu<U+017F>t give
it you, or my Cou<U+017F>in</hi> de Nevers <hi>won't let me be quiet.</hi> The
Cardinal could not have pleas'd me <U+017F>o well, if he
had given me a hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns, as he did
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57806:47"/>
with telling me this <U+017F>tory which I carry'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Lawyers, and making them put it into
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir own language in our reply, it was a <U+017F>ingular
mortification to our Adver<U+017F>ary.</p>
            <p>This was good <U+017F>port for the Judges, who are glad
to have <U+017F>omething of any <U+017F>ide to laugh at, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into the bargain, I had my fill of it, and my
Father too, and that which was mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange, Mr. <hi>de
la Vieuville</hi> could not forbear laughing him<U+017F>elf. The
Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Domine non <U+017F>um dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> brought him a
little to rea<U+017F>on, fearing le<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with circum<U+017F>tances <U+017F>o very particular, <U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o
ran<U+017F>ack his Genealogy, and di<U+017F>pute his Original
which was from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and began to be <U+017F>orry that
he had refus'd the Cardinals Mediation. In <U+017F>hort, there
being <U+017F>everal other things which he was loth we
<U+017F>hould enquire into, he came to the Cardinals, and
meeting me at the door told me, that he was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at what he had heard ju<U+017F>t now, for he had never
known before, that his Adver<U+017F>ary was my Father,
which if he had been inform'd of <U+017F>ooner he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have di<U+017F>puted it. I knew well enough what this
meant, and being not of a humour to flatter him, I
told him, I had rea<U+017F>on to value my <U+017F>elf extreamly,
<U+017F>ince he was pleas'd to grant that to me which he
had deny'd to the Cardinal; and tho my Father had
been at great charges in the Suit, yet I was ready to
move him to an accommodation; and that if he
pleas'd to acquaint me with the conditions, I would
bring him an an<U+017F>wer; this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e vext him, and
telling me, that I did not accept his civility as I ought;
he flung away without <U+017F>aying a word more.</p>
            <p>So our Proceedings went on <U+017F>till, but finding that
he treated us with better language, we al<U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
reproaching him; our Proce<U+017F>s was to be heard
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57806:48"/>
before two Judges, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Turcan</hi> was one, a
man who having been fir<U+017F>t divorced on pretence of
Impotence, cho<U+017F>e rather to be thought <U+017F>o, than to
live with his Wife who was an infamous Woman;
he was entirely our Friend, but the Pre<U+017F>ident, who
was the other, was not; <U+017F>o that when he came to
<U+017F>um up the matter, as he read a clau<U+017F>e that was in our
favour, the Pre<U+017F>ident askt him, if that <U+017F>entence he
read was in the writing; <hi>Turcan</hi> who was very hot,
whatever complaints his Wife might make of the
contrary, and the Tryal being in the Evening, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two great Wax Candles by his Seat on the
Bench, he took one of them and threw it at his head,
<U+017F>aying, That a Man who <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <U+017F>uch a thing as
that was a Ra<U+017F>cal, and ought to be us'd accordingly.
The Pre<U+017F>ident by <U+017F>tooping down his head avoided
the blow, but asking him what he meant, and at
the <U+017F>ame time catching up the other threw it at him,
and <U+017F>truck him on the head; this di<U+017F>order put a <U+017F>top
to the Cau<U+017F>e which was ju<U+017F>t upon deciding. The
Pre<U+017F>ident went out to make his complaint, and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
went home to his own hou<U+017F>e, where he receiv'd
an Order to lay down his Office.</p>
            <p>Our Cau<U+017F>e by this means lay a<U+017F>leep, and out
Friends on both <U+017F>ides took that opportunity to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
an accommodation, and we being both pretty
well tir'd with the Law were the more ea<U+017F>ily brought
to compliance; they agreed that all reflexions on either
part <U+017F>hould be ab<U+017F>olutely forgotten, and indeed
'twas the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e they could take, for 'twas not
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to enter into the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e without recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
on each other. So the matter being concluded
my Father return'd home; but before he went away,
I de<U+017F>ir'd him to con<U+017F>ider of what I had propos'd to
him about my Si<U+017F>ter, which was <U+017F>o much his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57806:48"/>
to effect; he promis'd to <U+017F>peak to my
Mother-in-law about it, and two days after he came
home, he <U+017F>ent me word, that they would give their
con<U+017F>ents to what I propos'd, provided I would do it
without their disbur<U+017F>ing any Money; I admir'd, or
rather pity'd the <U+017F>ordid <U+017F>tupidity of the<U+017F>e people,
who having no more Children, as one might <U+017F>ay,
<U+017F>hould venture the lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>uch an opportunity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their Daughter, rather than part with about
twenty thou<U+017F>and Franks, purely from Covetuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s,
to <U+017F>ay no wor<U+017F>e of it, for they wanted no Money;
the Cardinal having for my <U+017F>ake, to pacifie my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
for the death of my two Brothers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
her to <U+017F>ell the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the elde<U+017F>t,
which he had not di<U+017F>pos'd of, thinking I had another
Brother to whom he would have given it, by which
<U+017F>he got a good <U+017F>um of Money, and more than would
have paid the Portion for my Si<U+017F>ter: However a little
after I receiv'd another Letter which explain'd the
former; in which they told me, that <U+017F>ince I thought
this <U+017F>o good a Match, they de<U+017F>ir'd me that I would
not let it <U+017F>lip for want of a little of my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance;
that I was in a condition able to do it, and it would
be but a <U+017F>mall matter to me, and for which my
Si<U+017F>ter would be eternally oblig'd to me.</p>
            <p>I was damnably vext at this, and <U+017F>o I gave them
to under<U+017F>tand, and my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion appear'd <U+017F>o in my
countenance, that notwith<U+017F>tanding all the care I
took to conceal it, the Cardinal ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cover'd it,
and askt me what the rea<U+017F>on of it was, but fearing he
<U+017F>hould think it was only an artifice of mine to draw
more Money from him I beg'd him to excu<U+017F>e me tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him 'twas nothing but <U+017F>ome of my private affairs,
not worth di<U+017F>turbing his Eminence with; he was
not <U+017F>atisfy'd with the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, but thinking I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57806:49"/>
equivocated with him, he told me, that he would
have me tell him po<U+017F>itively the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, I defended
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>till with the <U+017F>ame pretence, but the more he
<U+017F>aw me unwilling to di<U+017F>cover my <U+017F>elf, the more he
pre<U+017F>t me, <U+017F>o I was forc't to tell him, but at the <U+017F>ame
time told him my fears, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould think I had a
de<U+017F>ign upon him. <hi>I thought,</hi> <U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently, <hi>'twas
<U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of va<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence, and is this all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Go,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>I give this al<U+017F>o for your <U+017F>ake,

any more, for methinks they are mine rather, confidering
what they co<U+017F>t me every day,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could with all my <U+017F>oul have run into the fire for
him if there had been occa<U+017F>ion, I had <U+017F>uch a fence of
his bounty and many favours to me, but it being my
misfortune to be only a poor u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s fellow, I content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my <U+017F>elf to expre<U+017F>s my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion by my zeal for his
<U+017F>ervice. Thus my Si<U+017F>ter was marry'd at la<U+017F>t to the
per<U+017F>on that I had propos'd, and liv'd <U+017F>everal years
with the greate<U+017F>t happine<U+017F>s in the world, only that it
pleas'd God <U+017F>he had no Children; but about <U+017F>ix
years after, her Husband was taken with a fit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and <U+017F>he, who made it a plea<U+017F>ure to her to
<U+017F>uit her<U+017F>elf to his temper, liv'd with him <U+017F>o piou<U+017F>ly,
that <U+017F>he became an example to the whole Province
of <hi>Brettagne;</hi> but both of them growing zealous to
exce<U+017F>s, he turns Prie<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>he became a Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary;
and while he was a kind of a Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ionary in his own
Country, <U+017F>he retir'd into a Convent near <hi>Meulan,</hi> to
which <U+017F>he had been a Benefactrice.</p>
            <p>A few days after the Cardinal had done this la<U+017F>t
favour for me, he was <U+017F>eiz'd with <U+017F>o deep a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that one could not know him almo<U+017F>t to be
the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on; I could not forbear expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing to
him my trouble for the condition I <U+017F>aw him in, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57806:49"/>
the <U+017F>atisfaction which it would be to me, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trumental
to his recovery; he <U+017F>poke <U+017F>lightingly of
it, but yet I could perceive plainly enough, there
was <U+017F>omething more than ordinary in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all the pains he took to conceal it from me,
for I had <U+017F>tudy'd his humour <U+017F>o well, in that long
time I had the honour to have belong'd to him, that
I knew his temper as perfectly as if I had been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf;
however after <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer 'twas my Duty
to be <U+017F>ilent, tho I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly afflicted to <U+017F>ee that
his di<U+017F>content rather encrea<U+017F>t every day. To pa<U+017F>s
away the<U+017F>e trouble<U+017F>om hours, which held for two
months at lea<U+017F>t, I us'd to go to <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> to divert
my <U+017F>elf with a Lady, who very well de<U+017F>erv'd my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and that I might not bring any <U+017F>candal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, I always left my men at the Market Gate, and
went alone on foot to her Hou<U+017F>e. One night as I
came back to my Servants, I <U+017F>aw a man go out at
the Gate, who I pre<U+017F>ently remember'd to have <U+017F>een
at <hi>Bruffels,</hi> being a per<U+017F>on whom I knew was employ'd
in Intreigues of State; the un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hour of the
night, for 'twas pa<U+017F>t two a clock, made me imagine,
that a man of his character would not be <U+017F>o late
abroad for nothing: I pre<U+017F>ently acquainted the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
who told me I was mightily to blame I did
not follow him, I told him I had a good mind to
have done it, but that he perceiv'd I knew him, and
I was loth to increa<U+017F>e his <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion; he told me I
had done well, and pau<U+017F>ing a while, he askt me
what manner of man he was, enquiring of his age, his
<U+017F>tatute, his complexion and the like; I gave him the
be<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cription of him I could, and he immediately
gave orders to all the Po<U+017F>ts, Carriers and Coaches,
to take notice if any <U+017F>uch like man offer'd to go out of
Town, and laid men upon all the Roads, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57806:50"/>
to apprehend him if he travell'd any other way<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>I gue<U+017F>t by all this, that this very man was the
cau<U+017F>e of the Cardinals di<U+017F>turbance; and <U+017F>eeing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to place a Centinel near <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> I told
him there was no body could be <U+017F>o proper for that
Po<U+017F>t as my <U+017F>elf, for that I knew him, and he <U+017F>hould
not e<U+017F>cape me; he told me that was true, but on the
other hand he might know me too, and <U+017F>o might
mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t <U+017F>omething and avoid me; to remove this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and the thoughts of employing any other
per<U+017F>on, I told him no body could know him <U+017F>o well
by the bare de<U+017F>cription I had given of him, as I could
do with my own Eyes, and therefore any other
might <U+017F>uffer him to pa<U+017F>s and not know him, whereas
in a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e I had in my head, I would defy him to
know me, let him be as cunning as he would; he
askt how I had contriv'd to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf? I told
him I would dre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf up like a Beggar-man, and
laying my <U+017F>elf down in the <U+017F>treet like a poor Cripple,
I <U+017F>hould have the advantage of looking every one
that came by in the face; he lik'd my project very
well, and would needs have a view of me in my
Robes; <U+017F>o I bought very privately a pair of old
Crutches, a patch'd ragged Coat, and in <U+017F>hort all the
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary accoutrements of an arrant Beggar; and I
plaid my part as well, as if I had been Apprentice to
the Trade: The Cardinal bid me go, and told me,
that if I <U+017F>ucceeded, I <U+017F>hould do him the greate<U+017F>t
piece of <U+017F>ervice that ever I did in my life.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to excite me to do my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>o having taken my po<U+017F>t at the corner of the
<hi>Rue de Tournon,</hi> I begun to <U+017F>crew up my countenance
and make a hideous noi<U+017F>e, as if I had been in great
pain, be<U+017F>ides my poverty; a good many charitable
people gave me Money, but <U+017F>everal Coaches hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57806:50"/>
to come by together, I was afraid my man
<U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s by in the hurry, <U+017F>o I plac'd my <U+017F>elf as near
the Gate as I could get: The <hi>Swi<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> that kept guard
there were <U+017F>o di<U+017F>turbed with the noi<U+017F>e I made, that
they would have driven me away, but that I was fain
to promi<U+017F>e them to be more quiet; I lay in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
three days and three nights without making
any di<U+017F>covery, which made me fancy he might go in
and out by the Port <hi>des Carmes,</hi> <U+017F>o I chang'd my
Po<U+017F>t, and that very night I <U+017F>aw him, to my no little
joy, come with a Key in his hand, and open'd the
Gate him<U+017F>elf: The Cardinal had plac'd a man that
came almo<U+017F>t every minute to me, to enquire if I had
<U+017F>een any thing, and be<U+017F>ides that there was men po<U+017F>ted
from <U+017F>treet to <U+017F>treet to relieve one another, if there
<U+017F>hould be occa<U+017F>ion to follow him; things being thus
di<U+017F>pos'd they watch'd for his coming out; about an
hour after this, I <U+017F>aw another man who came and
open'd the Gate ju<U+017F>t as the t'other had done before, he
was wrapt up in a Cloak <U+017F>o that I could not know
him; but order'd the people I mention'd, who attended
for that purpo<U+017F>e, that they <U+017F>hould not fail to dog him
when he came out again, which they did <U+017F>o dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trou<U+017F>ly,
that he never had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of
them, but went <U+017F>trait to his lodging, without <U+017F>o much
as offering to look behind him.</p>
            <p>This effectually di<U+017F>cover'd the man, who prov'd
to be no le<U+017F>s a per<U+017F>on than Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi>
Grand Querry of <hi>France,</hi> Son of the Mare<U+017F>chal
<hi>d' Effiat;</hi> and the Cardinal no <U+017F>ooner knew it, but
he told me he was an ungrateful man, and he <U+017F>hould
dye for it, or he would know why not. Indeed it
was the Cardinal that had advanc'd him at Court,
and to requite him he was plotting his ruine, with
the Duke <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> who after having form'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57806:51"/>
Intreigues again<U+017F>t the Cardinal, which always
prov'd fatal to tho<U+017F>e that engag'd in them, was now
hatching another, that was not like to meet with
much better <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; for the other man was dogg'd in
like manner, and the Cardinal being inform'd, that
he lodg'd at the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germain,</hi> in the <hi>Rue de
Canetes,</hi> he was <U+017F>o well ob<U+017F>erv'd, that he could not
<U+017F>tir a foot but he knew it; they di<U+017F>cover'd <U+017F>everal of
their haunts, where one <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> a little crooked,
but very cunning fellow, us'd to be with them: I
pre<U+017F>t the Cardinal to apprehend the Con<U+017F>pirators,
for it was in his power, and it was needful too, that
he might prevent any de<U+017F>ign that they might have
again<U+017F>t his per<U+017F>on; but as all he yet knew of the
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was but circum<U+017F>tantial, he waited for plainer
proofs to convict them; he <U+017F>ent me to lye on the
Road to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> as a Guide to <U+017F>uch as rode Po<U+017F>t, that
I might ob<U+017F>erve all <U+017F>uch as went to or return'd from
<hi>Spain;</hi> in the mean time they kept a <U+017F>trict eye upon
the Con<U+017F>pirators, and the Cardinal having caus'd
<hi>Fontrailles,</hi> to be follow'd to <hi>E<U+017F>tampes,</hi> he took po<U+017F>t
there, with de<U+017F>ign as was thought, to go into <hi>Spain;</hi>
the other man of <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> follow'd him a few days
after, and I <U+017F>ent the Cardinal word they were gone,
and I had conducted them as far as <hi>Bayonne:</hi> 'twas a
very <U+017F>imple thing of the<U+017F>e people to go two of them
the <U+017F>ame way, but God, who infatuates tho<U+017F>e who
lye in wait for blood, not only blinded their eyes in
this, but <U+017F>uffer'd the <hi>Fleming</hi> to come back the very
<U+017F>ame way, where I had orders to apprehend him;
he was very much <U+017F>urpriz'd, and knowing he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
enough about him to prove him guilty, and
would endanger his life, for he was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
whereas I thought he had been a <hi>Fleming,</hi> he poi<U+017F>on'd
him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>omewhat he carry'd about him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57806:51"/>
my perceiving it, which was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, that he
<U+017F>well'd in le<U+017F>s than two hours time; I did what I
could to <U+017F>ave him, but having no <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of it, and
no help at hand, the Poi<U+017F>on had wrought its effect
before a Phy<U+017F>itian could be had.</p>
            <p>I found quilted in his Boots, the Original Treaty
which <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had been negotiating with the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the name of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> and <hi>de Cinqmars;</hi> and taking
po<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time to bring it to his Eminence,
and give him an account of what I had done, I took
the Road to <hi>Languedoc</hi> whether he was gone, with
the King, who was going to the Siege of <hi>Perpignan;</hi> I
found him di<U+017F>temper'd both in body and mind, but
chiefly the latter; for <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t the
King again<U+017F>t him, and his friends had ju<U+017F>t given him
notice that he was ruin'd with the King, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to quit <hi>Narbonne,</hi> to be nearer <hi>Provence</hi> and
<hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Governors whereof were at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> had taken upon him to a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inate
him in that Journey, and they <U+017F>ay he had promis'd
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to do it, who hated him mortally,
but having <U+017F>lipt an opportunity which he had one
day, being alone with him at lea<U+017F>t a quarter of an
hour, he could never get the like afterwards. His
Eminence receiv'd me as if I had been his good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;
and being not at all concern'd that the man was
dead, <U+017F>ince I had got the Treaty, he <U+017F>ent me with it
to the King, after he had taken a Copy of it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>Having made me the Confident of his pre<U+017F>ent
trouble, I took the liberty to advi<U+017F>e him to keep
the Original by him, and <U+017F>end only the Copy to the
King, <U+017F>ince no body could be an<U+017F>werable for what
might happen, and if they <U+017F>hould chance to get it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57806:52"/>
from me, he would be at a lo<U+017F>s to make out what he
pretended; but he told me in the condition things
were, there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to undeceive the King
immediately, and that if he did not <U+017F>end him the
Original, perhaps he would not believe the Copy:
Upon this an<U+017F>wer I went away immediately; and
the Count <hi>de Charo<U+017F>t</hi> who was in waiting, very civilly
introduc'd me to the Kings pre<U+017F>ence. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone I <U+017F>urpriz'd him extreamly with the pre<U+017F>ent I
made him, he communicated it to no body, and askt
very kindly how the Cardinal did: I told him, as I
was in<U+017F>tructed, that he was very ill, which was the
rea<U+017F>on that he had not waited upon his Maje<U+017F>ty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his order; for I forgot to tell one thing
that was very particular, which was, that before
the Cardinal came to <hi>Tara<U+017F>con,</hi> he had <U+017F>ent to tell the
King he was coming to Court, and that the King
had an<U+017F>wer'd, he <U+017F>hould not give him<U+017F>elf that trouble,
but might <U+017F>tay in the Country for the recovery of
his health.</p>
            <p>This was the rea<U+017F>on why they told him he was
undone, and al<U+017F>o why he retreated towards <hi>Provence</hi>
and <hi>Dauphine:</hi> In the mean time, as he was the
greate<U+017F>t Politician of the age, he knew there was no
way <U+017F>o likely to recover him in the Kings favour, as to
reduce the King to <U+017F>ome want of him; for the King,
who was a timorous irre<U+017F>olute Prince, was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of directing him<U+017F>elf in the lea<U+017F>t difficulties:
The Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Grammont,</hi> who was wholly devoted
to the Cardinal, play'd this card for him, and <U+017F>uffering
him<U+017F>elf to be beaten on purpo<U+017F>e by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in
the battle of <hi>Honnecourt,</hi> he left by that means all the
Frontier Country of <hi>Picardy</hi> open to the Enemy; the
King upon this news immediately has recour<U+017F>e to the
Cardinal, and he having made a fair pretence not to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57806:52"/>
come to Court, was now not only order'd to come
away with all <U+017F>peed, but the King goes part of the
way him<U+017F>elf to meet him, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing he was not able
to make ha<U+017F>te enough; <U+017F>o the Siege of <hi>Perpignan</hi> was
broken off.</p>
            <p>'Twas in this interim that I brought the King the
Treaty that I mention'd; he bid me go back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and let no body know that I had been with
him; I met the Cardinal on the way, who was not
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ick but he could follow me, and being come to
the King, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Cinqmars</hi> was immediately
apprehended, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Thou</hi> to whom he had
committed the <U+017F>ecret. The King care<U+017F>t the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately at their meeting; but this great
man had conceiv'd <U+017F>o much indignation in his mind,
at the Kings u<U+017F>age of him after <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices,
that he fell into a di<U+017F>temper call'd the Hemorrhoides,
which tormented him extreamly; all this however
did not eclip<U+017F>e the vigour of his mind, which was
not to be equall'd tho under the langui<U+017F>hment of a
cruel di<U+017F>temper; he made them pull down the <U+017F>ides
of the door to bring him in as he lay in <U+017F>tate upon the
Bed; and he was carry'd all the way on mens <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the <hi>Swi<U+017F>s</hi> Guards mo<U+017F>t commonly performing
that <U+017F>ervice.</p>
            <p>I was extreamly ca<U+017F>t down to <U+017F>ee my Ma<U+017F>ter in this
condition, while the Court generally rejoyc'd at it;
for he had ruin'd the fortunes of a great many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, tho he had rais'd the Glory of the
King, <U+017F>o that every one would have been glad to
have <U+017F>een him dead, in hopes to recover them<U+017F>elves
again, which the weakne<U+017F>s of the Kings capacity
gave them rea<U+017F>on to think would be ea<U+017F>y if he were
out of the way. The King, like a mo<U+017F>t Chri<U+017F>tian
Prince, <U+017F>hut him<U+017F>elf up often in his Clo<U+017F>et to pray,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57806:53"/>
but as Prayers without Endeavours are fruitle<U+017F>s, the
Court was full of caballings in prejudice of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
In the mean time they enter'd proce<U+017F>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi> and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Thou,</hi>
whom they had <U+017F>ent to <hi>Lyonn,</hi> and committed to the
Ca<U+017F>tle <hi>de Pierre-Enci<U+017F>e.</hi> The Youth of one, for
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Cinqmars</hi> was not above two and twenty,
and the Reputation of the other, made them to be
univer<U+017F>ally pity'd, and open'd the mouths of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
again<U+017F>t the Cardinal, for he was not very
well belov'd by the Populace, who exclaim'd at his
Cruelty, not regarding the Ju<U+017F>tice he had now on
his <U+017F>ide, nor con<U+017F>idering the crimes they were guilty
of; they cry'd out he was mercile<U+017F>s and blood-thir<U+017F>ty,
and ript up the <U+017F>tory of the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Marillac.</hi>
His Eminence being told of this, for he lov'd to be
told whatever was <U+017F>aid of him, would <U+017F>ay to me
<U+017F>ometimes, that he was very unhappy, that 'twas
allow'd to private men to pur<U+017F>ue even to death, one
that attempts to a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inate them; but that for him,
he mu<U+017F>t not be allow'd, be<U+017F>ides the particular attempts
upon his own life, to take notice of tho<U+017F>e made upon
the Royal Authority, but Envy would cen<U+017F>ure all his
proceedings as <U+017F>o many acts of Inju<U+017F>tice. I have <U+017F>een
him <U+017F>o affected, when he has been talking to me of
the<U+017F>e kind of matters, that he could hardly refrain
weeping, and when I would reply to him, that he
ought not to regard publick fame, which oftentimes
<U+017F>aid it knew not what; he reply'd, that 'twas that
neverthele<U+017F>s which made a man immortal, and 'twas
hard to take <U+017F>o much pains for that <U+017F>ort of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and yet at la<U+017F>t leave the world with the <U+017F>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>He <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e things with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible accents of
<U+017F>orrow, that <U+017F>ufficiently te<U+017F>tify'd the greatne<U+017F>s of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57806:53"/>
his Soul. In the mean time they cut off the heads of
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi> and of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Thou;</hi> and
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had run the <U+017F>ame fate, having
been <U+017F>eiz'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> had he not bought his life with
the lo<U+017F>s of his Principality of <hi>Sedan.</hi> People admir'd the
Cardinal <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pare him, having had <U+017F>everal Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his ill will, for this was not the fir<U+017F>t time,
that he had attempted to embroil the Kingdom, and
e<U+017F>pecially to <U+017F>ide in all occa<U+017F>ions again<U+017F>t the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
in <U+017F>hort, 'twas but t'other day that he had been
pardon'd for being concern'd in the Rebellion of the
Count <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons,</hi> whom he had not only <U+017F>helter'd in
his Hou<U+017F>e, but had taken up Arms for him; but all
that can be <U+017F>aid to this is, that the Cardinal could
forget injuries to him<U+017F>elf, when the Honour of the
King and Kingdom requir'd it.</p>
            <p>Let them <U+017F>ay what they will, this was the man
born to lay the Foundations of the pre<U+017F>ent greatne<U+017F>s
of <hi>France,</hi> and whom all good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ought to
have wi<U+017F>ht had been immortal; but God, who puts
an end to all things, having determin'd him to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
limits, which he could not out-live, took him
from hence, and he dy'd, to the inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible grief of
all his Servants. I had fore<U+017F>een it two or three
months before, for his di<U+017F>temper was attended with
vi<U+017F>ible tokens of death from the beginning, and I
was troubled extreamly to <U+017F>ee mo<U+017F>t people rejoyce at
it: The King him<U+017F>elf was doubtful of his recovery,
tho he had tho<U+017F>e about him that in<U+017F>inutated a notion
into him, that the Death of the Cardinal would
be his happine<U+017F>s: This was <U+017F>omething <U+017F>trange, if we
reflect, that this great Mini<U+017F>ter, who found things in
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>orry condition when he fir<U+017F>t came to the
Helm of the Government, had reduc'd the rebellious
<hi>Hugonots,</hi> had humbled the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Austria,</hi> by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57806:54"/>
taking from it the Kingdoms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
and the greate<U+017F>t part of <hi>Al<U+017F>ace;</hi> <U+017F>av'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and in
<U+017F>hort had done <U+017F>o many wonders, that Po<U+017F>terity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
already to acknowledge, that a man who did
<U+017F>uch great things, mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>omething in him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
He told me as he lay a dying, that he had
always lov'd me above any of his Servants, and that
he was <U+017F>orry he had done no more for me; that if the
King would take his advice, it <U+017F>hould be to employ
me in affairs of the greate<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence, for that I
had all the Conduct, Courage and Wit that was nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary
to accompli<U+017F>h any de<U+017F>ign, all which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
in <U+017F>everal ca<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>If I had ever been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the marks of his
e<U+017F>teem in his life time, I was much more <U+017F>o now, all
his pa<U+017F>t favours came at once into my mind, and
thinking what I was going to lo<U+017F>e, and that in a
moment, this man who had made all <hi>Europe</hi> temble,
<U+017F>hould be no more, I was <U+017F>o afflicted, that I am <U+017F>ure
if the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ence of it had continu'd but two days,
I <U+017F>hould have been di<U+017F>tracted. His Eyes were no
<U+017F>ooner clos'd, but the King made it appear that he
di<U+017F>lik'd all he had done, for he immediately recall'd
all tho<U+017F>e who had fled for fear of the Cardinals pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
this gave me <U+017F>uch an aver<U+017F>ion to the Court, that
I re<U+017F>olv'd not to continue in it a quarter of an hour
longer: Several Per<U+017F>ons of Quality invited me to
their Service; the Duke <hi>d' Orleans</hi> <U+017F>poke to me by
<hi>Egremont</hi> one of his Gentlemen, who to prevail with
me, told me, I needed look no farther for my Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
than to him, who had made his fortune in
the <U+017F>ervice of that Prince, that he had gotten two
hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns, and that if he <U+017F>hould live
but to be fifty years old, he did not que<U+017F>tion but to
get twice as much, but he did not tell me that he had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57806:54"/>
got all this by ways that I <U+017F>hould not care to practice;
he plaid at Tables with his Ma<U+017F>ter, and having a
parcel of Sharpers that went halves with him, they
made <U+017F>port for the Duke to laugh at, which caus'd
him to commit <U+017F>everal errors in play, and gave him
opportunity to play fal<U+017F>e, or to <U+017F>et up a Game or two
more than there was: Thus, as I <U+017F>aid, he came to
get <U+017F>o much Money, but as <U+017F>uch gains <U+017F>eldom pro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
he grew <U+017F>o litigious, that he <U+017F>pent all that in
Law which he had gotten at play.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>poke to me by the Duke
<hi>de Rochefoucaut,</hi> who began now to appear at Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t,
from whence he had been a long time bani<U+017F>ht with
the re<U+017F>t; but tho he was a Prince of the greate<U+017F>t
Politics, he did not <U+017F>how it in this, to <U+017F>end a per<U+017F>on
to me that was one of the greate<U+017F>t Enemies my Ma<U+017F>ter
had. I was ju<U+017F>t going to retire my <U+017F>elf when the
Queen Mother did me the honour to <U+017F>end me word,
that <U+017F>he would have me go to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> to do her a
<U+017F>mall piece of <U+017F>ervice there; I was amaz'd at this
propo<U+017F>al, from one who I knew could not love any
of the Creatures of my Ma<U+017F>ter, from who<U+017F>e Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try
<U+017F>he had received <U+017F>o much mortification; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
other things, he remov'd all her Friends from
her by one means or another; and had <U+017F>o little re<U+017F>pect
for her, or rather <U+017F>o much zeal for the public <U+017F>ervice,
that upon information that <U+017F>he had receiv'd Letters
from <hi>Spain,</hi> he had caus'd her to be <U+017F>earch'd, without
any regard to mode<U+017F>ty, or the re<U+017F>pect due to her Sex:
This was an in<U+017F>olence <U+017F>he would never forgive him,
and which I thought al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hould make her extend her
re<U+017F>entment to any thing that belong'd to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
I believ'd too, that this was only propos'd to
me, that they might have an opportunity to take me
off, and that Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> having inform'd them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57806:55"/>
of my e<U+017F>cape out of <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> intended, if <U+017F>he could
get me thither, to be<U+017F>tow that upon me which
e<U+017F>cap'd before; being po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with this opinion,
return'd her Maje<U+017F>ty thanks for the honour <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd
me; but being not contented with my
excu<U+017F>es, I was fain to <U+017F>hift it off with telling her, that
I was employ'd in the Cardinals time in that Court,
where I was <U+017F>o well known, that the way to have an
affair effectually mi<U+017F>carry, was to put it into my
hands.</p>
            <p>Thus I conceal'd my fear, and dextrou<U+017F>ly put her
off with excu<U+017F>es; but the Queen, who had, ju<U+017F>t as I
gue<U+017F>t, been inform'd by Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> of
what had happen'd to me in that Country, told
me, that I <U+017F>hould not trouble my <U+017F>elf, for <U+017F>he knew
what I meant, but that going from her I <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>afe, and that <U+017F>he would give me her royal word for
my <U+017F>ecurity: Such a continu'd importunity, in <U+017F>pight of
all I could <U+017F>ay, made me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her the more, <U+017F>o I
thankt her Maje<U+017F>ty again, and begg'd her pardon; and
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ent in my room <hi>Morville,</hi> one the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
helpt her to, who <U+017F>ince the death of my Ma<U+017F>ter
was become Chief Mini<U+017F>ter of State. This errand
was to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>la Porte,</hi> the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de
Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi>'s Confident, and to know from his own
mouth, if 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to gain the Count <hi>de</hi> ..... who
was the Archdukes Favourite; that in ca<U+017F>e of
the Kings death, which 'twas thought could not be
far off, there might be an Army ready upon the
frontier to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the Regency to the Queen; <U+017F>he
made no que<U+017F>tion of gaining this Favourite by the
help of Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e:</hi> But Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi>
who knew already what power <U+017F>he had with the
Queen, and was loth <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould increa<U+017F>e it by a new
<U+017F>ervice <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable as this, too readily in<U+017F>inuated
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57806:55"/>
into her, that <hi>la Porte</hi> would manage this matter by
him<U+017F>elf with le<U+017F>s noi<U+017F>e and more <U+017F>afety; and the
Queen who had not <U+017F>o much affection for Madam <hi>de
Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> as <U+017F>he had formerly, was ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morville</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> ea<U+017F>ily gain'd <hi>la
Porte,</hi> with the hopes of being made fir<U+017F>t Page to the
King, he charg'd him whatever he did, not to reveal
it to the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e;</hi> and he, who ow'd
his fortune to her, who from a Mechanic Taylor,
which was his Trade, had been rais'd by her, even
to her Bed, readily con<U+017F>ented to betray his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s
and Benefactrice, in hopes of further advancement.
The Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... was more in favour with
Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> than <hi>la Porte</hi> thought of; for <U+017F>he
being an amorous Lady had given him unque<U+017F>tiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proofs of her e<U+017F>teem, <U+017F>o that <hi>la Porte</hi> had no
<U+017F>ooner broken the <U+017F>ecret to him, but he di<U+017F>cover'd it all
to his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s; 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to expre<U+017F>s the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F><U+017F>es
re<U+017F>entment, <U+017F>he flew out in all the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
language <U+017F>he could think of to <hi>la Porte;</hi> but he
who was a fellow of a very <U+017F>harp wit, imagining
that <U+017F>o great a confidence of the Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... could
not proceed but from an affection that had met with
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>oft returns from her; in<U+017F>tead of appearing <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, return'd her reproaches upon
her <U+017F>elf for her Incon<U+017F>tancy; telling her, <U+017F>he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
this di<U+017F>covery at the price of her honour, and
that a man who was abus'd in <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible a part as
his Love, ought to revenge him<U+017F>elf by all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible

this <U+017F>ort of return, e<U+017F>pecially from him, and was
going to ca<U+017F>heer him, yet on <U+017F>econd thoughts <U+017F>he
dur<U+017F>t not venture to do <U+017F>o, for fear he <U+017F>hould return

            <p>The Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... who was jealous of <hi>la Porte,</hi>

<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the re<U+017F>entment of the Dutche<U+017F>s, kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf

at his own hou<U+017F>e, and continu'd to do thus till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into <hi>France;</hi> which caution of his, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
was the <U+017F>aving of his life.</p>
            <p>During all the<U+017F>e Intreagues the King declin'd <U+017F>o in
his health, that 'twas plain to all the world he could
not live long, and Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> having <U+017F>o

for the news of his death, not only that <U+017F>he
might be recall'd to Court, but not que<U+017F>tioning the
rai<U+017F>ing of her fortune; wherefore to oblige the Queen,
and fix her <U+017F>elf in her Maje<U+017F>tys opinion, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd
to effect that by her own intere<U+017F>t, which the Queen
had attempted to do by an underhand treaty with <hi>la
Porte;</hi> but fearing that as long as <hi>la Porte</hi> was with
her, the Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... would never heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in her de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>he concerted matters with <hi>la

<U+017F>lighted every thing for it; <U+017F>o that as <U+017F>oon as ever he
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he went away to the Queen, whom
he told, that not being able to <U+017F>ucceed in his negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for her Service, Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
it, and would doubtle<U+017F>s perform it better
than he could have done. The Queen, who had
<U+017F>uch confidence in the Cardinal, as we before noted,
having acquainted him with this, in<U+017F>tead of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, he was exceedingly troubled at it, and told
the Queen <U+017F>he was going to ruine her <U+017F>elf, for if the
King <U+017F>hould come to di<U+017F>cover what had pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was
undone; his aver<U+017F>ion to Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> being
invincible, that 'twas well enough to entertain <hi>la Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e he was lookt upon as a Per<U+017F>on out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and therefore would not be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, and
might <U+017F>ome time or other be of u<U+017F>e to them; but
for Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e,</hi> it was neither <U+017F>afe to hold
any corre<U+017F>pondence with her, nor could <U+017F>he be any
way <U+017F>erviceable at this time.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who knew this to be very true, was the
ea<U+017F>ier to be per<U+017F>waded, <U+017F>o they <U+017F>ent Madam <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reu<U+017F>e</hi>
word, that they were very much oblig'd to
her for the pains <U+017F>he had taken, but that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
po<U+017F>ture of affairs, they did not think fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in tho<U+017F>e mea<U+017F>ures any further: In the mean
time, the Cardinal <U+017F>et <hi>la Porte</hi> at work upon the
Queen, to le<U+017F><U+017F>en her e<U+017F>teem for Madam <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reu<U+017F>e,</hi>
and made that <U+017F>ervice the further condition of
the preferment they had promi<U+017F>ed him; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s
they delay'd till after the Kings death,
and then gave it him as if it had been at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of Madam <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e,</hi> who as cunning a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as <U+017F>he might be otherways, was made a property
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57806:57"/>
in this ca<U+017F>e, to take that for a favour done on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that was the reward of his Trea<U+017F>on in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, 'twas a Ma<U+017F>ter-piece of Policy
in the Cardinal, after having put by the Queen,
from tho<U+017F>e methods <U+017F>he had taken <U+017F>o much to her
advantage, to find out other ways to <U+017F>ecure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
to her. He fear'd Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs</hi> mo<U+017F>t,
who was Secretary for the War, and would have
been very glad to have him remov'd, and yet
made u<U+017F>e of him to make the propo<U+017F>al to the King,
and he had two de<U+017F>igns in <U+017F>o doing: fir<U+017F>t, if the King
con<U+017F>ented to make the Queen Regent, then he had
effectually oblig'd her, as being the fir<U+017F>t contriver
of it; but if the King <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>ent it ill and fly ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
into a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at it, then 'twould di<U+017F>grace his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ary:
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs</hi> was <U+017F>uch a Fool, as to
be prevail'd on to engage in this affair; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that 'twould be a difficult thing, he <U+017F>et upon the
Kings weak <U+017F>ide, that is, he engag'd his Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or
in the matter; who repre<U+017F>ented to him, that having
in probability not long to live, he ought to think of
<U+017F>ettling his Con<U+017F>cience; that nothing was <U+017F>o much
requir'd of us at our going out of this World, as
forgiving our Enemies, and that he ought now to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all the di<U+017F>content, that had been between him
and the Queen; that he had already recall'd to Court
tho<U+017F>e whom he had <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected on her account, that
nothing remain'd now, but to give her <U+017F>ome Te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his reconciliation to her: that the pre<U+017F>ent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
offerr'd him one; which was to make her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of her Children, a thing <U+017F>o naturally her right, that
the Law excluded all other Relations from pretending
to it: That if he did otherwi<U+017F>e, 'twould look as if
he had <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>erve on his mind, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57806:57"/>
was <U+017F>o dangerous, as to equivocate with his
Con<U+017F>cience.</p>
            <p>The Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or was very ready to go upon this
fooli<U+017F>h Errand, whether that he thought him<U+017F>elf
oblig'd to it by his Office, or that he thought to
do a piece of Service to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs;</hi> but he
was immediately ca<U+017F>heer'd for his pains; and the
King coming to know afterwards, that this came
from Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs,</hi> he <U+017F>erv'd him in the <U+017F>ame
manner, giving his Office of Secretary to Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>le Tellier,</hi> who is now Chancellour of <hi>France.</hi> The
Fortune of this Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> and the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> his Son, being <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely great, that they
<U+017F>eem to equal that of Soveraign Princes, if not to
exceed them. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak a word to it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trate,
that where Merit is really the foundation,
there is no <U+017F>tructur can be too great to build upon it.</p>
            <p>Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>le Tellier</hi>'s Father was one of the Long
Robe, and brought up his Son in the <U+017F>ame Profe<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and having made him capable of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, he
had a mind to get him the Office of the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curet
<hi>de Chatelet,</hi> which is a thing independent from
any of the other Courts, and very con<U+017F>iderable. He
that <U+017F>old it having <U+017F>everal Cu<U+017F>tomers about it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
him to them all, on condition he <U+017F>hould pay
the Money down at a certain time, which was very
<U+017F>hort. But wanting 10000 Crowns to make up the
<U+017F>um, he had like to have lo<U+017F>t it, when Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Pelletier,</hi> who had an Office in the <U+017F>ame Court,
lent him the Money; <U+017F>o that all ob<U+017F>tacles being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
he entred upon the place, and behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
with <U+017F>o much reputation, that he was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Man, that had not his fellow for wi<U+017F>dom;
but all this did not prevent a very odd accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling
him. Being one day riding thro the Town,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57806:58"/>
there happen'd <U+017F>ome Tumult in the Streets, and his
Office (being a Magi<U+017F>trate) obliging him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it: The Grooms of the Kings Hor<U+017F>es laid
hold of his Bridle, and not knowing who he was,
they carry'd him with them into the Great Stable,
but the Querrys who knew him well enough made
their excu<U+017F>e, and made the Grooms ask his Pardon;
he was <U+017F>o good humour'd, that he made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of this violence; which if he had, might
have brought them into a great deal of trouble. In
the mean time, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> having <U+017F>ome
publick bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with him, and finding him to be a
Man of a prodigious capacity, he per<U+017F>waded him to
re<U+017F>ign his Office, and to come into the Council.</p>
            <p>'Twas by doing this, that he began to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
known to my Ma<U+017F>ter, whom I have often heard
<U+017F>peak of him, very much to his advantage; when
he appear'd at the Bar, he met with all the marks
of e<U+017F>teem that u<U+017F>e to be given to Per<U+017F>ons of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and at la<U+017F>t was preferr'd to be Secretary of State,
as I have mentioned before: but it was upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
neverthele<U+017F>s, that he <U+017F>hould pay Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>De<U+017F>noirs</hi> 400000 Franks, which he <U+017F>ent to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
but he refus'd them, expecting that if
any <U+017F>udden Change <U+017F>hould happen at Court, he
might get into his place again: So Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
had his Money again, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs</hi>
dying quickly after, the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> with the
con<U+017F>ent of the Queen Mother, gave him this <U+017F>um,
excluding the Heirs of <hi>De<U+017F>noirs;</hi> this and <U+017F>uch like
Obligations fixt him in their Intere<U+017F>ts, and he gave
good marks of his Ability in the nice occa<U+017F>ions, which
happen'd about that time; the Civil War being ju<U+017F>t
then broke out, in all which he continu'd firm in
the Intere<U+017F>t of the Queen Mother and Cardinal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57806:58"/>
               <hi>Mazarin,</hi> whom he always look'd upon as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</p>
            <p>After the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Death, he <U+017F>o gain'd
upon the young King, who had wit enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h
who <U+017F>erv'd him faithfully and who not;
that the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>ons, which oblig'd him to value
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tellier,</hi> oblig'd him at the <U+017F>ame time,
to apprehend Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Ponquet.</hi> There had been
<U+017F>ome difference between the<U+017F>e two, which made
People think, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tellier</hi> did contribute
underhand to his di<U+017F>grace; but to let the world <U+017F>ee
how they were mi<U+017F>taken, he never <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the King or meddled with the proce<U+017F>s; either
of which, if he had done, the other had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
been lo<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The King had no prime Mini<U+017F>ter at all after the
Death of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but if any body could
pretend to that place, it was without doubt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Tellier,</hi> he had two Sons and one Daughter.
The Daughter is married to the Marquis <hi>de Villequier:</hi>
who is now <hi>Duke d' Aumont;</hi> for his Sons, he
bred up the Elde<U+017F>t, who is the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
to Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and the younge<U+017F>t to the Church, and
who is now Coadjutor to the Arch-bi<U+017F>hoprick of
<hi>Rhiems,</hi> under Cardinal <hi>Antoine;</hi> by which means he
is certain to be, one time or other, Duke and Peer
of <hi>France;</hi> and the other had the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of being
Secretary of State after his Father. His great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
are <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h in the memory of all Men, that
'tis needle<U+017F>s to mention them; all the great tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of <hi>Europe</hi> were form'd in his head, and he
manages the place at this day, with as much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as my Ma<U+017F>ter did in his time, which is enough
for any man to <U+017F>ay in his Commendation; only I
mu<U+017F>t be allow'd to make this difference, between
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57806:59"/>
the pre<U+017F>ent time, and the days pa<U+017F>t, that my Ma<U+017F>ter
was <U+017F>o far from being <U+017F>econded, by a vigorous young
King, that he had none oppos'd his directions,
more than him who he endeavour'd to <U+017F>erve mo<U+017F>t;
whereas his pre<U+017F>ent Maje<U+017F>ty, is the fir<U+017F>t a Hor<U+017F>eback,
to execute tho<U+017F>e De<U+017F>igns, that have been projected
in his Cabinet.</p>
            <p>However it was, the Services both of the Father
and the Son, could not be better rewarded than
they are now. The Father is Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi>
the greate<U+017F>t honour that can be conferr'd upon the
Gown, and who is the leading Man, both at Court
and on the Bench: The Son is Secretary of State,
chief Mini<U+017F>ter, and in a word, the Per<U+017F>on on whom
the King relies, in matters of the greate<U+017F>t moment,
whether for Peace or War. In the mean time, I
mu<U+017F>t not forget one Circum<U+017F>tance, which proves the
gratitude of both the Father and the Son. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Colbert,</hi> who had the Admini<U+017F>tration of the
Finances, being dead about two or three years ago,
they procur'd his place, for the Son of Mr. <hi>Pellitier,</hi>
whom we have <U+017F>poken of, as a recompence for
the favour they had receiv'd from his Father.</p>
            <p>I have been a little larger than ordinary upon the
ri<U+017F>e and fortune of the Chancellor, and the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> his Son; 'twill be acknowledg'd not to
be <U+017F>o remote as may be thought, being to relate in
what follows, many great Actions, which have pa<U+017F>t
under their Mini<U+017F>try, and I ought to give an Idea of
tho<U+017F>e, which manag'd the Government, to <U+017F>hew
that <U+017F>uch Ma<U+017F>ter-pieces of Policy, could not proceed
from any Per<U+017F>ons, but <U+017F>uch as were perfectly ver<U+017F>t
in the nice<U+017F>t affairs of State.</p>
            <p>But to return to my own Ca<U+017F>e, ever <U+017F>ince I refus'd
the Negotiation at <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> I was frown'd upon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57806:59"/>
every where, and was <U+017F>o <U+017F>lighted by the Queen and
the Mini<U+017F>ter, that I re<U+017F>olv'd to retire. The King
in the mean time, having exil'd Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De<U+017F>noirs,</hi>
for having but offer'd to <U+017F>peak in favour of the
Queen, did not however proceed with the <U+017F>ame vigor
again<U+017F>t Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> nor <hi>Chavigny</hi> who had
e<U+017F>pous'd her Intere<U+017F>ts: 'Tis true, they did it genteely,
and in<U+017F>tead of propo<U+017F>ing it downright to the King,
to make her Regent, they only advis'd him while he
was in a condition to do it, to <U+017F>ettle his Affairs as he
pleas'd they <U+017F>hould be manag'd after his Death; that
the Infancy of his Children requir'd this at his hands;
at lea<U+017F>t he would have this <U+017F>atisfaction at his Death,
to know what <U+017F>hould become of them; whereas, if
he omitted it, they would be expos'd to <U+017F>trange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<U+017F>een
Accidents.</p>
            <p>The King could not deny, but what they <U+017F>aid was
highly rea<U+017F>onable, but he met with a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
difficulties, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he went about this
<U+017F>ettlement; he could think of no body to leave the
Government of his Children to, but the Queen or the
D. of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Brother; but the latter appear'd to
him, to be of too un<U+017F>ettled and unquiet Spirit, and
the other too much of a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> <U+017F>o he took the
middle of the<U+017F>e Extreams and joyn'd them both in
the Admini<U+017F>tration, hoping they would temper one
another, and perform the duty of <U+017F>o great a Charge
the better: It happen'd to this Contrivance, as it
does to a State that continues Neuter, while its
Neighbours are fighting out their Quarrel, neither
one nor t'other were pleas'd with what the King had
done for them, and new Plots were <U+017F>et at work on
both <U+017F>ides, to make him alter his re<U+017F>olution; the
Courtiers ob<U+017F>erv'd the Contrivances of both Parties,
but none knew which would prevail, or who <U+017F>hould
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57806:60"/>
govern the Queen, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould happen to get the
Power ab<U+017F>olutely into her hands, for <U+017F>he carry'd it <U+017F>o
fair to all <U+017F>ides, that <U+017F>he had every day new favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> did his utmo<U+017F>t to incline
the Scale on his <U+017F>ide; and to the end that the
Queen might be prevail'd on, by his zeal to her
Service, he improv'd every moment of the Kings
Life, to endeavour to gain him to do <U+017F>omething
more in her favour: He laid it before him, how a
Mother had natural Obligations, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the Intere<U+017F>t of her own Children,
from that of the neare<U+017F>t Relations; that 'twas not
the <U+017F>ame thing with re<U+017F>pect to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
for he who dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>everal times take up Arms again<U+017F>t
his Maje<U+017F>ty him<U+017F>elf, would make no <U+017F>cruple to do
the like again<U+017F>t a Child; that in the mo<U+017F>t flouri<U+017F>hing
condition of the State, his Birth occa<U+017F>ion'd that a
Multitude of the Nobility made their Court to him,
which they would have more rea<U+017F>on to do, when
joyn'd with <U+017F>o great an Authority. The King was
not mov'd with all this, but an<U+017F>wer'd that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care of all, by the form of Government,
that he had <U+017F>ettled in his Declaration; and <U+017F>o dy'd
without making any alteration.</p>
            <p>I had been <U+017F>o us'd to the Court, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
the re<U+017F>olution I had taken to retreat from
it, I could not bring my <U+017F>elf to do it. I follow'd
the fortune of the Duke <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
to whom my Ma<U+017F>ter had bequeath'd both his
E<U+017F>tate and his Title; <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay he was his Son by
Madam <hi>d' Eguillon,</hi> but he had not wit enough to
be the Son of <U+017F>o great a Man, which makes me give
no credit to that report: However it was, finding he
did nothing worthy of that Name, I took my leave of
the Court, without giving him any rea<U+017F>ons for it, being
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57806:60"/>
very melancholly at parting from a place, which I
thought was the mo<U+017F>t charming in the world. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
was to engage in the War, which was very hot on
all <U+017F>ides on our Frontiers; for tho I had lo<U+017F>t a great
deal of time, yet I found my <U+017F>elf able and vigorous
enough, as I thought, for the hard<U+017F>hip of the Service.
This oblig'd me to make my court to Mr. <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to whom I was particularly enough known, to give
me ground to hope for <U+017F>omething from him: But as
he was all policy, he <U+017F>poke to the Cardinal of me,
who forbid him giving me any Employment: I
knew immediately that he mu<U+017F>t have receiv'd <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>uch order as this, for Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> did not
<U+017F>peak to me as he us'd to do, and in<U+017F>tead of giving
me po<U+017F>itive a<U+017F><U+017F>urances, as he had done before, that
I <U+017F>hould have what I demanded, he put me off now
with telling me, he <U+017F>hould be very glad to do me any
Service; This was a word <U+017F>o cu<U+017F>tomary with him,
when he intended to do nothing at all, that I e'ne took
it forgranted: In the mean time, I was vext that he
had held me in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence <U+017F>o long, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la
Cha<U+017F>tres</hi> having ob<U+017F>erv'd, that I was grumbling and
fretting, as I came out of his Office, he told me that
if I pleas'd he would find me out a Ma<U+017F>ter, who
would make up all my lo<U+017F><U+017F>es and <U+017F>orrow for my old
one: I told him I <U+017F>hould be glad of it, provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and he naming to me at the <U+017F>ame time, the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort,</hi> I an<U+017F>wer'd him I had always a great
e<U+017F>teem for him, but he being engag'd in Intere<U+017F>ts
contrary to the late Cardinal my Ma<U+017F>ter, he could
not put any Confidence in me; nor indeed could I
<U+017F>erve him heartily: he askt me if I thought I did
wi<U+017F>ely, in talking at that rate, and that after having
liv'd <U+017F>o long at Court, I had made <U+017F>o little advantage
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57806:61"/>
of what I had <U+017F>een, as not to know that nothing but
Intere<U+017F>t rules opinion: that as long as Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
was alive, I did well not to engage with any of
his Enemies; but now at this time when I was <U+017F>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the pre<U+017F>ent Mini<U+017F>ter, I ought to joyn my <U+017F>elf
to the Intere<U+017F>t and Friend<U+017F>hip, of tho<U+017F>e who had
cau<U+017F>e to hate him, and if any one was on tho<U+017F>e terms
with him, 'twas certainly the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who
had been robb'd by him of the Queen Mothers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
when but for him, he might by his power
with her, have done any thing for his Friends; that
he was a brisk bold Prince, and knew how to value
a man of worth, and one, in <U+017F>hort, who<U+017F>e Service he
was very glad he had entred into; that if I pleas'd
he would <U+017F>peak to him for me, and 'twould be
enough to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h his Confidence in me, but to
tell him the aver<U+017F>ion I had to the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difficulty I had to quit the Court, and the
eager de<U+017F>ire I had al<U+017F>o to revenge my <U+017F>elf of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,

Hou<U+017F>e, where there is now a Convent, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
threw a <U+017F>tone at the Gentleman that was with

the Leads of the Hou<U+017F>e, who nodded their heads at
him, and thinking they had been Women, <hi>Morbleu,</hi>
<U+017F>ays he, <hi>they laugh at us;</hi> as he was <U+017F>aying this, they
hollow'd and threw <U+017F>tones at us again; and now we
could ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cern, that they were not Women as
we thought, but Men, who did not conceal them<U+017F>elves,
but began to Jeer at us and Banter us, and to over
do it too, <U+017F>o as 'twas not to be born: So my Friend
drew a Pi<U+017F>tol, and a Stone coming at him, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him on the Arm, he made no more ado but
fir'd, and narrowly mi<U+017F>t killing the per<U+017F>on that he
<U+017F>hot at; and was going to draw his other Pi<U+017F>tol, when
the people of the place told us, that it was the
Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was there with all his Court.
This advice came too late. We took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we <U+017F>hould be immediately pur<U+017F>u'd; and having
no way left, but to ride for it, we <U+017F>et Spurs to our
Hor<U+017F>es, and made off as fa<U+017F>t as we could: We were
hardly got to the top of <hi>La Montagne de bons hommes,</hi>
when 5 or 6 Hor<U+017F>emen <U+017F>hew'd them<U+017F>elves coming
full <U+017F>peed after us; and tho our Hor<U+017F>es were all in a
foam, we <U+017F>purr'd on amain, without giving them
breath: They had need have been good Hor<U+017F>es, to
have <U+017F>ecur'd us from the<U+017F>e pur<U+017F>uers, for they came
on as if they had flown, and were almo<U+017F>t up with

no way to e<U+017F>cape, we re<U+017F>olv'd to face them;
and my Friend who wanted no Courage, was going
to fire the Pi<U+017F>tol he had left, when one of his Friends
being of the Party, and knowing him, call'd him by
his Name, and told him <U+017F>ince 'twas he, all was well,
and he might put up his Pi<U+017F>tol again, at the <U+017F>ame
time running to him, he embrac'd him; <U+017F>o the re<U+017F>t
put up their Pi<U+017F>tols al<U+017F>o: we very civilly told them,
that if we had known it had been the Duke <hi>de Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57806:62"/>
we <U+017F>hould not have behav'd our <U+017F>elves as we
did; and they a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us on the other hand, that if
they had known it had been us, they <U+017F>hould have
us'd us better: But I que<U+017F>tion whether they would
or not; for a man that would go a Sharping, and
catching Cloaks off Peoples backs in the Night, on
the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> us'd to do,
would not have been ea<U+017F>ily prevail'd on, to be civil
to us.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel being thus ended, nothing would
<U+017F>erve them, but we mu<U+017F>t go back with them, which
I oppos'd with all my Power; as well for that I
would willingly be punctual at the place I was going
to, as al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e I knew I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected in
that Company: but all I could <U+017F>ay was to no purpo<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>o I was oblig'd to go with them. We found the
Duke <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> with five or <U+017F>ix others engag'd in
a Debauch; he never took notice that I had liv'd
with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> or that I had refus'd his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but <U+017F>et us down at the Table, where having
drank exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive hard, he had a mind to <U+017F>how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
a Prince; that is, to have a Frolick, that <U+017F>hould
have <U+017F>omething in it extraordinary. There was the
Collonel of the Regiment of <hi>Languedoc</hi> there, who<U+017F>e
Name was <hi>Wallon,</hi> a prodigious fat fellow, and took
<U+017F>o little heed to his <U+017F>hape, that in<U+017F>tead of Dyetting
him<U+017F>elf for it, all his delight was in cramming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
with good Cheer: This Collonel was to lye
down flat upon his back, and the Duke was to eat
an Omelette of Eggs upon his Belly; <hi>Wallon</hi> lay
down very readily, and expos'd his bare Belly for
their Table, and the Cook clapt the Omelette out
of the Pan upon it; while he was <U+017F>o drunk that
either he did not feel it burn him, or el<U+017F>e in point of
honour he would not confe<U+017F>s it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57806:62"/>
After every one had eaten of this Ragout, and
expre<U+017F>t their <U+017F>atisfaction with it, both the Duke and
all his Company, they mu<U+017F>t needs go all to <hi>Paris,</hi> to
Madam <hi>la Neveu,</hi> a Lady who was very well known:
let my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s be what it would, I was fain to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them in <U+017F>pight of my Teeth; They did there
all they were capable of doing in the condition they
were in, till the woman of the Hou<U+017F>e, being enrag'd
at their u<U+017F>age of her, and <U+017F>ome other Whores they had
<U+017F>ent for: The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to pacify her, told
her he would make her <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port; <U+017F>o he <U+017F>ent for a
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aire, under pretence of <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>turbance
in the Hou<U+017F>e: The Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aire came well guarded,
and the Duke <hi>d' Orleans</hi> having hid us in a Chamber
out of <U+017F>ight, there was no body appear'd, but he and
<hi>Wallon</hi> the Collonel; they were both lying on the
Bed, with Madam <hi>Neveu</hi> in the middle; and the
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aire thinking now he had catcht them in
the fact, and not knowing who they were, bid
them get up, but they refu<U+017F>ing, he bid his followers
pull them out by force; and they beginning to lay
hands on them, they were <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee us <U+017F>ally
out of our Hole, and the more, for that we did not
come on as if we intended to attack them, but with
our Hats in our hands, making our Re<U+017F>pects to the
per<U+017F>on they were a going to lug out of the Bed;
they were further <U+017F>urpriz'd when they <U+017F>aw the Rich
Habit, that was brought to the Duke, when he
went to dre<U+017F>s him; but when they <U+017F>aw the Blue
Ribbon, they were Thunder-<U+017F>truck and perfectly
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht: The Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aire began then to <U+017F>ee his
Error, and threw him<U+017F>elf at the Dukes Feet to beg
his Mercy; the Duke bid him fear nothing, and he
<U+017F>hould come off cheap enough: We did not know
what he would do, but he was not long a contriving:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57806:63"/>
he call'd down the other Women, who had not yet
appear'd, and <U+017F>et them on the Bed-<U+017F>ide in a row, and
taking one at a time, he made the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aire and
all his Attendants naked in their Shirts, with a wax
Candle in their hands, come and do homage to
<U+017F>omething he <U+017F>how'd them. thereby to make, as he
call'd it, an honourable <U+017F>atisfaction to the Ladies.</p>
            <p>After this, we had every one Liberty to go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we plea<U+017F>'d, and having lo<U+017F>t a great deal of time,
I was afraid that Mon<U+017F>ienr <hi>de Beaufort</hi> would be got
to <hi>Anet</hi> before me, <U+017F>o I Travell'd all night, for fear
he <U+017F>hould think I would di<U+017F>appoint him; but when I
came there I found he was not yet arriv'd, which I
was very glad of; But two days being pa<U+017F>t, and not
a word of him to be heard, I could not tell what to
make of it; Being very impatient and not knowing
how to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf, I took my Hor<U+017F>e and
went out upon the great Road, to <U+017F>ee if I could meet
with any body, at la<U+017F>t I <U+017F>aw a man come galopping
along, and immediately concluding that it was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
from him, I would have <U+017F>topt him to have
askt what news he brought; but he taking no notice
of me, rode on, and went into the Ca<U+017F>tle: as <U+017F>oon
as he was in they <U+017F>hut up the Gates, at which I was
<U+017F>urprized, for it wanted a good deal of night; I came,
and knockt at the gate to get in but all to no purpo<U+017F>e,
tho I waited above an hour; at la<U+017F>t, as I was ju<U+017F>t go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>aw them let down the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
I went in, and found that this affliction was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion'd
by that per<U+017F>on who brought them the News,
that the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> was apprehended at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince had been much in favour with the
Queen Mother, who had given him <U+017F>o many marks
of her e<U+017F>teem, as left it without que<U+017F>tion; for one day
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57806:63"/>
when they thought the King was ju<U+017F>t a dying <U+017F>he put
her children into his hands, which was the cau<U+017F>e that
all the Princes of the Blood were Jealous of him: if the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> had manag'd him<U+017F>elf wi<U+017F>ely after
this, there was all the appearance in the world that
he would have been made Chief Mini<U+017F>ter, at lea<U+017F>t
he would have been the Favorite: But having plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> and others to ruin the Cardinal

to fly the Kingdom: tho' I knew nothing of all the
intrigue, yet I was it <U+017F>eems involv'd in the mi<U+017F>chiefs

been <U+017F>een talking with Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Cha<U+017F>tres,</hi> he put
me down in the black Roll of tho<U+017F>e he intended to
<U+017F>ecure, and was <U+017F>urpriz'd with a witne<U+017F>s when at
my return from <hi>Anet</hi> I <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elf very decently <U+017F>ent

            <p>He did not continue <U+017F>o long in Pri<U+017F>on as I
did, for having none of tho<U+017F>e powerful friends that
he had, I was forgotten in my mi<U+017F>ery, and had not
<U+017F>o much as the poor comfort of being Vi<U+017F>ited; my
Father and my Mother in Law, <U+017F>eeing me embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

beginning of my Confinement, but as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<U+017F>o har<U+017F>h but grows familiar by cu<U+017F>tom, I made
a virtue of Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and bore it very patiently <U+017F>ix
whole years without any diver<U+017F>ion, but that of a

few books, which they gave me liberty to <U+017F>end for:
in the mean time the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> made his

and finding all <U+017F>orts of people di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with the
management of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he began his
intrigue anew, but with a little better <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s than
before; I had been <U+017F>o long in pri<U+017F>on, that I began
to think that all the world had forgot me or thought
I was dead: but when I dreamt of it lea<U+017F>t of all, I
<U+017F>aw a man come into my Chamber whom I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to have belong'd to the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he
told me that he came to offer me my liberty, if I
would promi<U+017F>e him that after I had recover'd it, I
would hone<U+017F>tly accquaint him with all that I knew of
the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi>'s de<U+017F>igns; I made no pau<U+017F>e
upon his words, but an<U+017F>wer'd him immediately, that
I never under<U+017F>tood till now, why I was committed,
which it <U+017F>eems was upon <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion that I <U+017F>hould hold
intelligence with that Prince, which God knew was
no <U+017F>uch matter<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but tho' I had no concern in the lea<U+017F>t
with him, nothing was capable of making me accu<U+017F>e
a man by whom I was but <U+017F>uppos'd to be e<U+017F>teem'd;
he would have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>everal things to have made me
alter my mind, but giving him no an<U+017F>wer, but that
I <U+017F>corn'd to be a <U+017F>py for any man, he left me as he
found me; and went to carry his <U+017F>tory to his ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
            <p>I pre<U+017F>ently concluded from hence, the Duke <hi>de
Beaufort</hi> had made his e<U+017F>cape, and that they were
afraid of him, and I long'd now to be at liberty to
joyn with him in his Re<U+017F>entment, and after thinking
<U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly how I might effect it, I found that there was
but one way, and I re<U+017F>olv'd upon that; I brib'd
the fellow that brought books to me, who coming
<U+017F>o often was not mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted, and he brought me at <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, Rope enough to reach down from my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57806:64"/>
Chamber window to the Ditch; how great <U+017F>oever the
danger <U+017F>eem'd, yet I ventur'd one very dark night, and
having gotten down with <U+017F>ome difficulty, I made
a <U+017F>hift to get through the Ditch, having before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
exact notice of every <U+017F>tep I was to make; <U+017F>o I
got off and came into <hi>Paris,</hi> at the <hi>Porte de St. Martin:</hi>
I lay under a Stall all that Night, it being too late to
di<U+017F>turb any of my Friends; but at break of day I
went into the <hi>Fauxburgh de St. Germaine,</hi> where I
got me a Lodging: I enquir'd there what News was
<U+017F>tirring, and was told that all the Town was in
Combu<U+017F>tion, upon the account of an Edict which
the Cardinal had publi<U+017F>h'd, by which be Taxt all
the Soveraign Courts. The Hatred I bore him,
made me forget the Love I bear to my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which was threatned with great Revolutions;
in <U+017F>hort, the Parliament, whom it principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
gave at the <U+017F>ame time a decree again<U+017F>t <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
and <U+017F>ome of the Members were <U+017F>o violent
again<U+017F>t him, that if the re<U+017F>t would have follow'd
their Councel, they would have ventur'd once to
revenge tho<U+017F>e many attempts, he had made upon
their Liberties and Laws, with the price of his
Blood.</p>
            <p>The People, who <U+017F>aw them<U+017F>elves ruin'd with
Edicts one upon the neck of another, joyn'd with
the Parliament, and all things <U+017F>eem'd to be in a
po<U+017F>ture for a revolt: but that which compleated all
was, that the Queen Mother clapt <U+017F>ome of their
Body up into a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<U+017F>on, which <U+017F>erv'd like a <U+017F>ignal for
all the re<U+017F>t to take up Arms. In a Moment the
Chains were drawn cro<U+017F>s the Streets, and all the Lanes
and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages barricadoed, and the Citizens left
their Shops and Employment, and form'd them<U+017F>elves
into Regiments for the War: So great was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57806:65"/>
Hatred again<U+017F>t the Cardinal. The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought to appea<U+017F>e this Tumult with good
words, but finding it to no purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<U+017F>ome of the Guards, which <U+017F>erv'd indeed but
to enrage the People. I thought now I might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out without danger, and a Boy that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
liv'd with me, knowing me cried out, Here,
Here was one would be <U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ide with them, for he
had <U+017F>uffer'd deeply by the Tyranny of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and
coming up to me at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>aluted me; but
I was <U+017F>o vext to <U+017F>ee he had di<U+017F>cover'd me, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of accepting his Compliment, I fell to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him <U+017F>everely; but the Croud hearing what
he <U+017F>aid, flockt about me, and asking me a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
que<U+017F>tions, which I an<U+017F>wer'd as well as I could.
They made me go with them to the Main Guard,
telling me I <U+017F>hould be their Captain, if they met
with any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, for I lookt like a Souldier.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>turbance would have run further, if the
Queen Mother, who had before refus'd to <U+017F>et at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had made Pri<U+017F>oners, had not now
been better advis'd; but <U+017F>he relea<U+017F>t them, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one went home quickly. I was afraid however,
that this matter would be a new Cau<U+017F>e of Quarrel
at me; and in <U+017F>hort I made no que<U+017F>tion, having been
<U+017F>o rudely handled by him already<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
me now of having been a Ringleader in the
public Tumult; and tho the Queen had promis'd to
forget all that was done, yet knowing very well they
never wanted pretences, when they had a mind to
ruin a man, I thought it my be<U+017F>t way to get <U+017F>ome
Protection; that of the Parliament was the <U+017F>ecure<U+017F>t
as things then <U+017F>tood, for they had not only the love
of the People, who fooli<U+017F>hly thought all this had
been done on their account, but had al<U+017F>o engag'd <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57806:65"/>
Provinces in the Quarrel, who had no le<U+017F>s
good will to pull down <hi>Mazarin.</hi> The Parliament
received my Petition, which was pre<U+017F>ented by the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who was a per<U+017F>on very agreeable
to the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians,</hi> principally becau<U+017F>e they thought him
irreconcilable to <hi>Mazarin,</hi> <U+017F>o my reque<U+017F>t was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and being then <U+017F>afe enough, I adher'd to the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi>'s Party, who all of them hated the
Cardinal. If I <U+017F>hould mention all the Intrigues
and Contrivances laid again<U+017F>t him, 'twould <U+017F>well
the<U+017F>e Memoirs into many Volumes: but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to <U+017F>peak of nothing but what I had a hand
in my <U+017F>elf, I <U+017F>hall content my <U+017F>elf with telling you
that the Parliament having done all they could again<U+017F>t
him, he re<U+017F>olv'd to humble them; but 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to bring it about, without reducing <hi>Paris</hi> to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who having taken part again<U+017F>t him with <U+017F>o
much heat, and being <U+017F>till ready to break out into
Arms again, upon the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion, the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
did not only <U+017F>eem difficult, but above his
<U+017F>trength. There was above a Hundred Thou<U+017F>and
fighting Men in the City, to whom the Kings
Troops were as good as nothing: Neverthele<U+017F>s the
Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> who was now Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> by
the Death of his Father, being return'd from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and having promis'd him to e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>e his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
he drew his Army out of their Quarters; and
the Court being withdrawn from <hi>Paris,</hi> the City
was as it were blockt up. <hi>Paris</hi> being certainly the
mo<U+017F>t Populous City in the World, the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>topt up, brought them into great di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: every
one <U+017F>aid 'twas a <U+017F>hame they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>tarv'd <U+017F>o, by
a handful of People; <U+017F>o they appointed a day for a
general Mu<U+017F>ter. The Forces being all come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Captains who were all Coun<U+017F>ellors (for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57806:66"/>
the whole was an Army of Burghers) were for
drawing them up in Battalia, that the General
might take a view of them, but no body knew
which way to go about it; This was <U+017F>o pitiful a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
that it made tho<U+017F>e People laugh, that knew
no more how to do it than they: at la<U+017F>t out
<U+017F>teps a fellow from the Ranks all in a heat, and
blu<U+017F>tring about, <U+017F>aid aloud, that this was not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of Di<U+017F>cipline; that he had been <U+017F>ix
Months a Soldier in the Guards, and he was very
much deceiv'd, if he could not do it better him<U+017F>elf;
every body was overjoy'd that they had gotten a
<hi>Man of Experience</hi> among them, and having delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him the Command by a great <U+017F>hout of <hi>God ble<U+017F>s
the Parliament, and our New Officer:</hi> he was made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General of the Infantry, and as the mark of his
Office, he receiv'd the Truncheon, from the hands
of <hi>Videau de Grammont</hi> Coun<U+017F>ellor <hi>aux Enquites;
Grammont</hi> was ju<U+017F>t a going to give him his Cor<U+017F>let,
but being afraid of bringing a di<U+017F>grace upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
who had the Reputation of being of a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, he caus'd them to procure him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
His Son is as chary of his Cor<U+017F>let, to this
day, as he is of his Beard, and wears it in Carneval
time, which makes him look like an old Corporal,
di<U+017F>guis'd like a Coun<U+017F>ellor.</p>
            <p>This new Major was a little out in ordring his
Battalia: However all people admir'd what he had
done, and the Officers of the Regiment carried
him home to Dinner with them in Ceremony, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him the upper end of the Table; there they
con<U+017F>ulted of the means to rai<U+017F>e the Blockade of the
Town, and all that the Major <U+017F>aid was receiv'd like
an Oracle; but all this did not hinder the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> from attacking <hi>Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nton,</hi> where the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57806:66"/>
had po<U+017F>ted three thou<U+017F>and Men under Command of
one <hi>Claucleu,</hi> and this Po<U+017F>t being of great Con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
they detach'd a Party of twenty Thou<U+017F>and
Men to relieve it; I went among the re<U+017F>t, and had
the honour to be one of the Principal Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Cavalry, which was order'd to <U+017F>upport
the Infantry; we left them them to take the Front
when we went out, but they were not ambitious
for that which they they thought was not their due.
The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> appearing with three or four
Hundred Hor<U+017F>e, they were very de<U+017F>irous to take the
Rear-Guard, but the order of Battle being di<U+017F>pos'd
otherwi<U+017F>e, we would not allow it, and continu'd
to give them the honour of the Van, by retiring
our <U+017F>elves full <U+017F>peed back into the Town: they call'd
this a Flight, tho we <U+017F>ay, 'twas but our obedience
to the Command that order'd us to keep in the Rear;
however 'twas, if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had pleas'd, he
might have cut off all our Infantry, but he content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him<U+017F>elf with taking <hi>Charenton,</hi> where he lo<U+017F>t the
Duke <hi>De Chatillon,</hi> his Kin<U+017F>man.</p>
            <p>I was a<U+017F>ham'd to go into the Town again after
<U+017F>uch an action as this, for though, perhaps I was
none of the fir<U+017F>t that fled, yet it was enough di<U+017F>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
but to have been in <U+017F>uch bad Company; we
would <U+017F>everal times after that try our Fortunes with
the Enemy, but being always beaten, though we
were ten to one, I <U+017F>aw plainly I <U+017F>hould get but little
Honour by fighting at the Head of <U+017F>uch a Militia; in
the mean time the Parliament abated nothing of their
hatred to the Cardinal, but in their condition the
old Proverb would not hold good, <hi>Arma cedunt Togae,</hi>
<U+017F>o they thought of an Accommodation, and the more
too, becau<U+017F>e all the People of Quality, though at
fir<U+017F>t they took part with them, began to hold Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57806:67"/>
with the Court; 'twas however, oppos'd
by a great many, who were for demanding a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
of the Arch Duke, and the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who
was declared <hi>Generali<U+017F><U+017F>imo</hi> of the Party, was of this
opinion, <U+017F>o they nominated the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>De Noir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou<U+017F>tier</hi>
and <hi>Laicques</hi> to go thither, I was al<U+017F>o of this
number, not in the quality of a Plenipotenciary,
as they were, but in that of a <U+017F>ubaltern Mini<U+017F>ter,
who was to follow their Orders.</p>
            <p>I was not affraid now to <U+017F>how my <U+017F>elf there, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <U+017F>o good a Character, and did not doubt but
we <U+017F>hould be well receiv'd; in <U+017F>hort, the Arch-Duke
promis'd us to march his Army to remove our
Blockade, and I was left with him, to put him in
mind of his Promi<U+017F>e; but I was not there above
eight days, but I perceiv'd that the Count <hi>De</hi>—who
was <U+017F>till his Favourite, countermin'd all our
De<U+017F>igns. He did not care to have a Man <U+017F>o clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighted
as I to dive into his matters, and <U+017F>ent word
to <hi>De Laieques,</hi> who was his Friend, that they <U+017F>hould
recal me immediately; and all that I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
from this Conduct<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> was, that Madam <hi>De
Chevreu<U+017F>e,</hi> who <U+017F>eem'd to de<U+017F>ire the ruin of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
was always well with that Count, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to hinder the<U+017F>e Troops entring into the
Kingdom<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> to make a more advantageous Treaty for
her<U+017F>elf; our Journey had di<U+017F>turb'd the Court, <U+017F>o that
<U+017F>he was oblig'd to meet them half way to make
up the the Peace, and as the Arch-Duke was too
<U+017F>low in his Marches, and the Parliament beginning
now to repent of having call'd in Foreign Aid, the
thing was immediately concluded.</p>
            <p>Every one was for making his advantage in this
Accommodation; <U+017F>ome agreed for Money, and others
for Places, whil<U+017F>t poor I was the only per<U+017F>on that got
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57806:67"/>
nothing, though the chief of the Party had all along
promis'd to take care of my Fortune. I was then <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
how little confidence was to be repo<U+017F>ed in the
a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of Great Men, who promi<U+017F>e largely when
we can be <U+017F>erviceable to them, but fail not to forget
us when we cea<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>o any longer. In <U+017F>hort,
I had been reduc'd to very mean Circum<U+017F>tances,
but for my yearly Income at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which was
all I had now to tru<U+017F>t to, after I had maintain'd my
Brothers all this time at my own Charge. 'Twas
not for me then to <U+017F>et up for Quality, yet was it
<U+017F>ufficient to maintain me, with good Husbandry,
which at la<U+017F>t I practi<U+017F>ed, having never another
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to whom I could have recour<U+017F>e
for what I wanted, and <U+017F>o reduc'd my attendance to
a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and a Foot-boy, whereas in the
Cardinal's days, I never kept le<U+017F>s than <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even
Servants in Family. This <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>omething odd
to me, becau<U+017F>e I had ever liv'd great, but I knew
not yet what it was to be nece<U+017F><U+017F>itous, though it
was not long before I did to <U+017F>ome purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who hated me mortally, as well for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my E<U+017F>cape out of Pri<U+017F>on, as for <U+017F>iding again<U+017F>t
him in the late di<U+017F>turbances, caus'd my Revenue
at <hi>Lyons</hi> to be <U+017F>topt, and <U+017F>everal Attachments to be
made on it under borrow'd Names, though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of it till I went to receive the Money,
and then I was <U+017F>urpriz'd indeed to find my <U+017F>elf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to People I never knew; but making light
of it at fir<U+017F>t, I went to my Attorney, who told me
the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tory, and that I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ign a grant of Po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
to them, till the Cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be decided.
In the mean time he ask'd me for the Attachments,
but I was not <U+017F>o prudent to take them up, and <U+017F>o
was forc'd to go back to the per<U+017F>on that us'd to pay
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57806:68"/>
me, and who put me off till the next day; the next
Morning I went to his Hou<U+017F>e, but they told me
there that he was gone to a Si<U+017F>ter's of his, who lay
a Dying, about ten Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas with this Excu<U+017F>e they held me in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence
for a Fortnight at lea<U+017F>t, yet in all this time I never
dreamt of this Fellow's holding Corre<U+017F>pondence
with <hi>Mazarin;</hi> at la<U+017F>t one told me he had <U+017F>een him
in the <U+017F>treet, whereupon, with abundance of Joy
for his Return, I went to enquire for him; but when
I <U+017F>aw they us'd the <U+017F>ame Pretence as before, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
then, there was <U+017F>ome trick in it. I told them
roundly that I was inform'd of his being in Town
by <U+017F>everal People, who had <U+017F>een him, and vow'd I
would not <U+017F>tir till I had <U+017F>poke with him. He was
not very far off it <U+017F>eems, for hearing what I <U+017F>aid,
he cried out at a di<U+017F>tance, that all was well enough,
and they <U+017F>hould let me in. He made me then
a thou<U+017F>and Excu<U+017F>es for going out of Town without
giving me the things I required, telling me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but ju<U+017F>t come to Town, as I <U+017F>aw, he mu<U+017F>t have
one Night to look among<U+017F>t his Papers, and the next
day I <U+017F>hould certainly have them at my own Hour.
I was <U+017F>uch a Fool as to believe him again, and came
next Morning by break of Day, when feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
Sick, he told me in the condition that he was,
he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be as good as his word, and
endeavour'd to put me off another day. But my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was quite worn out with waiting, <U+017F>o I directed
my Attorney to draw me up an Order to make him
deliver the things. He no <U+017F>ooner heard what I had
done, but never talking any more of the Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he return'd an<U+017F>wer that I mu<U+017F>t make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to tho<U+017F>e at <hi>Lyons,</hi> his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion being at an
end, and to prove what he <U+017F>aid, he <U+017F>hew'd me the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57806:68"/>
Sham Copy of an Order to recal it. This was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with a Vengeance; however, being oblig'd
to write to <hi>Lyons,</hi> I <U+017F>ent my Contract by the Po<U+017F>t,
to the end, that the Per<U+017F>on whom I writ to about
this Affair, might as <U+017F>oon as he receiv'd it, proceed
with all Expedition. I expected two or three Po<U+017F>ts
to hear from him, but all in vain, for my Contract
was lo<U+017F>t it <U+017F>eems, and another Man, to whom I had
got one of my Friends to write, <U+017F>ends me this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I lo<U+017F>t a great deal of Time in this manner, but
'twas longer yet before I could procure a rough
draught of my Contract; at la<U+017F>t they <U+017F>ent me word
from <hi>Lyons,</hi> that the Pay-ma<U+017F>ter, who was formerly
there, was re<U+017F>tor'd to that Office, and that I mu<U+017F>t
addre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf to him. Accordingly I <U+017F>ent another
Summons, to which he an<U+017F>wer'd, That he had the
Attachments in his Hands 'twas true, but I could
not oblige him to deliver them till they were copy'd:
I order'd him then to <U+017F>end me the Copies, which he
was content to do, <U+017F>o he gave me in the Names of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of my Creditors, whom, as I <U+017F>aid, I never had <U+017F>o
much as heard of in my Life: I de<U+017F>ired them to
appoint what Court they would proceed in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had appear'd by their Attorney, there was
three of them who declin'd the Juri<U+017F>diction of <hi>Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi>
One of them was for removing the Tryal to
the <hi>Reque<U+017F>ts du Palais,</hi> another to the <hi>de L' Hotel,</hi>
and the third to the Grand Council, where all his
Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was done, as he pretended At la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> after our
Cau<U+017F>e had depended above three Months, and when
it was ju<U+017F>t going to be decided, they brought it into
the Privy-Council for the <U+017F>ake of that Judge's Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
'Twas my ill luck to have a Sollicitor who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
hated to take Pains, <U+017F>o that I thought our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57806:69"/>
was delay'd more out of his Lazine<U+017F>s than Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
but I was mi<U+017F>taken, for having gain'd one of
his Servants with a little Money, the Fellow told
me as a Secret, that in <U+017F>hort, 'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e
for me to wait for any conclu<U+017F>ion to my Affair, for
his Ma<U+017F>ter was expre<U+017F>ly order'd to the contrary. I
ask'd him how he came to know that, and he told
me, there was a certain Man who came often to his
Ma<U+017F>ter from the Cardinal on this Errand, and by
the De<U+017F>cription he gave me of him, I knew it could
be no other than <hi>Bellinzani,</hi> the worthy Servant to
<U+017F>uch a Ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
            <p>'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to expre<U+017F>s the Rage I was in when
I heard this: I <U+017F>poke of it with <U+017F>ome Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to the
Ma<U+017F>ter of Reque<U+017F>ts, but finding I was not likely to
get any Satisfaction from him, I went to make my
complaint to the Chancellour <hi>Seguier,</hi> who promis'd
to do me Ju<U+017F>tice. He continued but three days in
that Mind, for after <hi>Mazarin</hi> had <U+017F>poke to him, he
never regarded his Word, and though I gave my
con<U+017F>tant Attendance on him every day, I made no
Progre<U+017F>s in my Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. In the mean time Money
began to grow <U+017F>carce, and I was forc'd to borrow
of tho<U+017F>e Friends who were inclin'd to pity my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
My Father I had often writ to on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but receiv'd no an<U+017F>wer, and might have
<U+017F>tarv'd, if all the World had been like him. I
was advis'd to Petition the Queen-Mother, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
of a very compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Nature, and who only
was not belov'd by the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they did
not know her. I begg'd her therefore that <U+017F>he would
be pleas'd to order the Chancellor and Sollicitor
to do me Ju<U+017F>tice, and to ha<U+017F>ten the Tryal of my
Cau<U+017F>e, but 'twas my misfortune that that Prince<U+017F>s
committed all things to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57806:69"/>
whom you may be <U+017F>ure, as he was a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
I had little rea<U+017F>on to expect any Favour.</p>
            <p>It far'd with me at that time as with all in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ery,
I was for<U+017F>aken by tho<U+017F>e I had the mo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on, and after I had two or three Months
longer <U+017F>ollicited in vain, I was reduced to <U+017F>uch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Poverty that I was a<U+017F>hamed of my <U+017F>elf, and
knowing not where to hide my head, my la<U+017F>t Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
was to go to my Father's, in hopes after
what I had done for his Family, he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall Relief, when he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee me
<U+017F>uing for it in another manner than what I had
done in my Letters. I <U+017F>carce had wherewithal to
carry me down, and 'twould certainly have mov'd
any one to <U+017F>ee a Man who was lately in <U+017F>uch
Splendor, forc'd to <U+017F>tarve him<U+017F>elf for fear of want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Money on the Road. When I light at the
Door, the old Servants of the Family, who had
<U+017F>een my Grandeur, and <U+017F>aw me now, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their own Eyes, but my Father and Mother-in-Law
could not help knowing me, or they were
willing enough el<U+017F>e to forget me; for though I found
them at Table when I came in, they hardly had the
civility to make me <U+017F>it down, and when I did, the
mo<U+017F>t of my Entertainment at Supper was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
they made me for my extravagance, which
had brought me into this condition. How <U+017F>trange
a thing is this Mi<U+017F>ery, that the Mind as well as the
Body <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ink under its oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion! I was <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that I knew not what to <U+017F>ay for my <U+017F>elf, and
but I that <U+017F>igh'd at every word they <U+017F>poke, I <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have lo<U+017F>t both Life and Sence.</p>
            <p>After this Welcome the fir<U+017F>t day, I would not
have <U+017F>tay'd another in the Hou<U+017F>e, if I had known
whither to have gone; for alas, my old Friend the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57806:70"/>
Curate had been dead above two Years, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>eem'd to con<U+017F>pire to load me with Mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
Tho I bore them all, as well as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and endeavouring to bring my Father to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
I <U+017F>ounded him to find how he <U+017F>tood affected
to lend me <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall matter to carry me back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Paris.</hi> I told him mine was a plain ca<U+017F>e, that
they could not always deny me Ju<U+017F>tice, and 'twould
not be long before Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> would be
weary, and cea<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ecuting me, if it were only
to be free from the Complaints I <U+017F>hould make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
him. I told him abundance of other things,
to make him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that his Money would not
be thrown away, and that I intended to repay him;
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e all in a Fury, interrupting me, <hi>Why <U+017F>urely
then,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>you take me for one that is ea<U+017F>ily to be bubbled,
but you are mi<U+017F>taken Sir, go banter <U+017F>omebody el<U+017F>e with your

                  </gap> Stories, I know the rea<U+017F>on well enough why your Money
is <U+017F>topt, and pity the poor Creditors you rail at, as they are
not only like to lo<U+017F>e their Due, but as they have to do with
a Fellow of <U+017F>uch wicked Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e words made me <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate, but that I
reflected on the Sin I was going to commit, I had
certainly <U+017F>tabb'd my <U+017F>elf at the very in<U+017F>tant; yet I
could not forbear u<U+017F>ing a thou<U+017F>and Reproaches, and
though I knew well enough what my Re<U+017F>pect
oblig'd me to, yet I did, and <U+017F>aid many things which
were not <U+017F>o decent to be done to ones Father.
He took occa<U+017F>ion from this ('twas either he,
or my Mother-in-Law) to forbid me their Table:
and to put me out of all doubt, there comes
up one of the Servants about Ten in the Morning,
and <U+017F>preads me a Napkin on the Table in my own
Chamber, and acquaints me with their Plea<U+017F>ure;
tho' the Cloth was laid <U+017F>o early, it was not till after
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57806:70"/>
they had din'd that I had any thing brought me to
eat, and then I had the honour to <U+017F>hare in their
Scraps, with the Servants. But what madded me
above all was, to <U+017F>ee how great my Brothers liv'd,
particularly the Abbot who grew <U+017F>o wealthy, there
was none in all the Country, as he fancied, that could
compare with him. He kept two or three packs of
Dogs, two Hunt<U+017F>men, five or <U+017F>ix good Hor<U+017F>es,
and yet never was the Man that once invited me
to hunt with him, though he ow'd all his Greatne<U+017F>s
to my means.</p>
            <p>'Tis but meer Railery to <U+017F>ay that any one dies
of Grief, for if 'twere true, I could never have
outliv'd mine. At la<U+017F>t, after I had liv'd there
three Months in this manner, and not being able to
endure the ill treatment I met with, I re<U+017F>olved to
return to <hi>Paris.</hi> Much ado I had to <U+017F>queeze from
my Father Money enough to bear the Charges of
my Journey; but I was not got above two Leagues
on my way, before he that was his pre<U+017F>ent Curate
overtook me, and brought me ten Pi<U+017F>toles, telling
me that he had a good while intended to pre<U+017F>ent
me with them, but being in the Hands of one
of his Friends, he could not have them before,
adding, that his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or was oblig'd to me, as
he had been to his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or; <U+017F>o begg'd me
to accept of them, and wi<U+017F>h'd he could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
more for my <U+017F>ake.</p>
            <p>I had receiv'd in my Life many con<U+017F>iderable
Summs from the Cardinal, but I profe<U+017F>s I never
was <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his Liberalities, as of the kindne<U+017F>s
of this poor Curate; I told him therefore that I
heartily accepted of his Pre<U+017F>ent, and if Heaven
<U+017F>hould favour me with an opportunity, I would give
him proof of my Gratitude; for not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57806:71"/>
with him, but to tell him plainly how things <U+017F>tood,
I was in <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, that without this <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable
relief of his, I mu<U+017F>t have certainly <U+017F>tarv'd. After
a great many Compliments on both <U+017F>ides we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I kept on my way to <hi>Paris:</hi> When I came
there, I found the Civil War ready to break out
again. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was gone to St. <hi>Maur,</hi>
upon a fal<U+017F>e Alarm, with a Troop of Attendants
little inferior to the Kings. This Prince, who had
done Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> <U+017F>o much Service, as I have
mention'd, was in requital confin'd to a <U+017F>evere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment,
out of which being e<U+017F>cap'd by meer
good fortune, he continu'd <U+017F>o apprehen<U+017F>ive of the like
u<U+017F>age, that he never re<U+017F>ted from the thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of War, being in<U+017F>tigated by a great many
People that hated <hi>Mazarin:</hi> If I had been in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
I cou'd have wi<U+017F>ht my <U+017F>elf, 'twou'd not
have been long before I wou'd have waited on him,
and offer'd him my humble Service; but being now
in a condition, <U+017F>o f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r different from what I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in, I was forc'd to content my <U+017F>elf, only with
making Prayers and Wi<U+017F>hes for the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of his
De<U+017F>igns.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Parliament began again to
make Decrees again<U+017F>t <hi>Mazarin,</hi> <U+017F>o that he was forc'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to fly the Kingdom to avoid the fury of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, who all cry'd out to have him remov'd.
Ob<U+017F>erving therefore <U+017F>o favourable an opportunity,
I pre<U+017F>ented my Petition to the Court of Judicature,
in which I declar'd the <U+017F>tate of my Ca<U+017F>e, and what
inju<U+017F>tice I had <U+017F>uffer'd for a long while; and I had
this relief by it, that notwith<U+017F>tanding the Cau<U+017F>e was
depending in the Council, my Adver<U+017F>aries were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be heard before this Court. Upon this, no
body appear'd, and I obtain'd a Judgment again<U+017F>t
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57806:71"/>
the Pay-ma<U+017F>ter General, who was oblig'd to disbur<U+017F>t
me the Money, which he had before taken for his
own, with giving him a full di<U+017F>charge for it: He
dur<U+017F>t do no otherwi<U+017F>e, for fear I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>et an
ill name upon him, and have made him pa<U+017F>s for
another <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which was a Character at that
time, <U+017F>ufficient to have a mans brains knockt out,
e<U+017F>pecially at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Populace hated the
very Name of him. I receiv'd then all at once a
good Sum, which I had no <U+017F>ooner done, but I <U+017F>ent
twenty Pi<U+017F>toles of it to our Curate, ten for the
Principal, and as many more for the Intere<U+017F>t. The
removal of the Cardinal, was all this while nothing
but a <U+017F>ham to amu<U+017F>e the People; for he had <U+017F>till as
much authority in the Council, as if he had been
pre<U+017F>ent there. Every one was di<U+017F>turb'd at this, but
e<U+017F>pecially the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> who had a <U+017F>trong
Party in the Parliament, and was favour'd by the
People. For his Reputation, that was founded on
<U+017F>o many Glorious Victories which he had obtain'd,
gain'd him tho<U+017F>e who had only heard of them, as
well as tho<U+017F>e who had been witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>uch great
Actions. He pretended, as I <U+017F>aid, fear of the like
u<U+017F>age which he had met with; but the real motive
was to advance his own Greatne<U+017F>s, as was evident
by his Conduct: For at the <U+017F>ame time that he
appear'd irreconcileable to <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he treated
with him under hand; and if he cou'd have brought
him to his Demands, he wou'd not only have <U+017F>uffer'd
the Cardinal to return, but wou'd have been ready
to offer him his Friend<U+017F>hip. 'Tis not known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
what broke off the Treaty, unle<U+017F>s 'twas, that
the Ambition of that Prince tormenting him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
he made new Demands every day, <U+017F>till as the
other granted the old ones. But this I am inform'd
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57806:72"/>
from good hands, that the Cardinal <U+017F>ent often to
tell him, that he <U+017F>hou'd have whatever he requir'd,
and that the Troubles which happen'd pre<U+017F>ently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
were purely owing to the Prince <hi>de Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I were di<U+017F>pos'd to give a particular account of
all the Actions of the War, I cou'd do it as well as
another; but that being the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of an Hi<U+017F>tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
more than of one that writes Memoirs, I <U+017F>hall
content my <U+017F>elf with telling you only this, that after a
great many Me<U+017F><U+017F>ages backwards and forwards to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
they both had recour<U+017F>e to Arms. The Prince <hi>de
Conde,</hi> who had <U+017F>everal places of <U+017F>trength in his hands,
<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome of his Creatures to all of them, to provide
all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in ca<U+017F>e of a Seige, and e<U+017F>pecially to
<hi>Montrond,</hi> which was in the Heart of <hi>France,</hi> and at
that time held to be impregnable. My re<U+017F>entment
wou'd not let me <U+017F>tand Neuter in this War, <U+017F>o
I joyn'd my <U+017F>elf to the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who was
now reconcil'd to the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> thro the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> after <U+017F>o violent an
Enmity, that nothing would <U+017F>erve their turns, but
the immediate death of one or the other. Now you
mu<U+017F>t know that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was wholly
rul'd by the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi>
and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Chavigny,</hi> and the<U+017F>e three per<U+017F>ons having
their <U+017F>everal Intere<U+017F>ts to recommend, they had
often hinder'd the Peace from being concluded, when
the Duke him<U+017F>elf might have done it as he pleas'd,
<U+017F>ince the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> who had declar'd for him,
dur<U+017F>t not have oppos'd him. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who
was come to Court again, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf on the brink
of <U+017F>o many Troubles, was re<U+017F>olv'd to make his la<U+017F>t
effort to prevent them, to give the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
and the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> all the <U+017F>atisfaction they cou'd
de<U+017F>ire, provided they did not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t too much on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57806:72"/>
Terms of their Adherents. He de<U+017F>ir'd the
Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> to <U+017F>end him one of his Friends
whom he had a confidence in, but that he <U+017F>hou'd be
one who was never known to have been employ'd
in any of their former Negotiations, that their Treaty
might not be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, by them who<U+017F>e Intere<U+017F>t it
was that they <U+017F>hould not agree. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>
cho<U+017F>e out one of his own Gentlemen to <U+017F>end on this
Errand, to whom he deliver'd his Demands in writing,
with order to tell the Cardinal, that it wou'd be to
no purpo<U+017F>e to con<U+017F>ider a longer time on them, for
he wou'd never be brought to any lower conditions.
This was a hard Chapter for the Cardinal, who had
nothing now to choo<U+017F>e but Peace or War; but one
<U+017F>eeming much more eligible than the other, he
<U+017F>ign'd the Treaty, telling the Gentleman, that there
being <U+017F>everal things in it which requir'd <U+017F>ome time
before they cou'd be perform'd; he begg'd the Prince
<hi>de Conde</hi> to de<U+017F>ire the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> (who<U+017F>e Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
was not forgotten) to conceal them from his
Lady, becau<U+017F>e the Cardinal <hi>de Retis,</hi> the Duke
<hi>de Rohan</hi> and <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who had <U+017F>o great an influence
over her, wou'd certainly hear of it, and never re<U+017F>t
till they had broke the Treaty.</p>
            <p>If the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> had follow'd this advice, he
had without doubt prevented abundance of mi<U+017F>chief;
but fancying the Cardinal <U+017F>tarted this <U+017F>cruple, only
to appear more my<U+017F>terious in his Conduct, he comes
publickly with an exce<U+017F>s of Joy and Gaity, crying
aloud at a good di<U+017F>tance to the Duke of <hi>Orleans; We
have trapp'd the old Fox at la<U+017F>t, and have got him fa<U+017F>t in a
Noo<U+017F>e. Here, my Lord,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, delivering him the
Treaty, <hi>is your Demands, and for what concerns me in it,
I am very well content.</hi> The Duke <U+017F>hewing it to
his Lady, <U+017F>he immediately communicates it to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57806:73"/>
Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi> and to <hi>Chavigny.</hi>
They all in a <U+017F>urprize come to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
and ask him what in the Name of God he de<U+017F>ign'd
to do, to <U+017F>ign <U+017F>uch an Agreement; telling him, that
all the advantage was on the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s <U+017F>ide,
who had not only been addre<U+017F>t to, to negotiate with,
but to whom here were the greate<U+017F>t Conce<U+017F><U+017F>ions made:
That he was already po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t of Offices enough in the
Kingdom, without <U+017F>uffering him thus to ingro<U+017F>s all.
That his Ambition was in<U+017F>atiate, tho he endeavour'd
to palliate it: That the care he took of the Inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oceeded not out of any good
Nature he had to oblige them, but out of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity
which he fore<U+017F>aw, he might one day or other
have of their Service: That he him<U+017F>elf was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
more than any one, to hinder this increa<U+017F>e of
the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s power, for after him<U+017F>elf he was
next Heir to the Crown: That if he took not <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>peedy cour<U+017F>e to <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s his greatne<U+017F>s, 'twou'd be
<U+017F>oon too late. In <U+017F>hort, That they pray'd him to
con<U+017F>ider, that on the concluding or breaking off of
this Treaty, depended the Pro<U+017F>perity of the State, the
Safety of his own Per<U+017F>on and of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>But it was in other Terms that they <U+017F>poke of this
Treaty to the Dutche<U+017F>s of <hi>Orleans.</hi> They repre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her, that the de<U+017F>ign of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was
to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf of the Crown; that in the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he was with the People for his Victories, his
U<U+017F>urpation would be le<U+017F>s odious, if not altogether
agreeable; that after which, her Husband would
certainly be confin'd to a Cloi<U+017F>ter, if he were not
kept a Pri<U+017F>oner all his Life in <U+017F>ome other place; that
for her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he was not to expect a better fare than
to live all her days in a Convent, and it would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
e<U+017F>cape 'em, but they would di<U+017F>pute the legitimacy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57806:73"/>
of her Children, becau<U+017F>e her Marriage had never
been approv'd of but by force: That the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<U+017F>he had to prevent all the<U+017F>e misfortunes, was
to break off the Treaty, while they on their part did
all that lay in their power, to di<U+017F>engage the Duke
her Husband from a per<U+017F>on he had <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on
to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect: That <U+017F>he was particularly concern'd to
take this care of him, becau<U+017F>e he lov'd her tenderly,
of which he had given her <U+017F>ufficient proofs: That
they would not pretend to give her In<U+017F>tructions, but
if they might urge it without violating their re<U+017F>pect
to her, they would then <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all her Charms to accompli<U+017F>h this de<U+017F>ign: That
the Bed was the mo<U+017F>t proper place to <U+017F>et upon one
of her Husbands di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; that they had nothing
more to <U+017F>ay, but to with her to make u<U+017F>e of it, as
they were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <U+017F>he could do with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>On this occa<U+017F>ion the<U+017F>e arguments wrought but too
effectually on both of them. They were hardly ever in
private together that they had any other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
the Dutche<U+017F>s perceiving her Husband inclinable to
receive all the imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, with which <U+017F>he had been
prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t, pu<U+017F>ht on the affair to that extremity,
that the Treaty was broke off, without <U+017F>o much as
any tolerable rea<U+017F>on given by the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> than <U+017F>aw his Error in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Cardinals advice, but <U+017F>ince 'twas now
too late for any remedy, he re<U+017F>olv'd on other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures,
and rais'd new Troops to begin a <U+017F>econd Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War. The Cardinal having a mind to di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s
him of <hi>Montrond,</hi> caus'd <U+017F>ome Troops to march that
way, every one being in great expectation of what
would be the event between the two Parties. They
were not long without Skirmi<U+017F>hes, and a Collonel
of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Troops, call'd <hi>Concre<U+017F><U+017F>ant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in <hi>Bourges;</hi> they were in a di<U+017F>pute how to
treat him, whether as a Rebel or as a Pri<U+017F>oner of
War. The Dutche<U+017F>s of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who was in
<hi>Montrond,</hi> fearing le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e him as the

receiv'd an an<U+017F>wer as civil as could be de<U+017F>ir'd, it
was a very great encouragement to the Officers of
both <U+017F>ides to expo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, who before were
in no <U+017F>mall apprehen<U+017F>ions on that account. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this was no law to the Cardinal, for he order'd
another Officer that was taken to be hang'd; but

forbore to u<U+017F>e any more <U+017F>uch Severity.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> for all the jealou<U+017F>y he
had entertain'd of the Prince, did not yet <U+017F>eparate
from his Intere<U+017F>ts, to which he was retain'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
con<U+017F>iderations: he had rais'd <U+017F>ome Troops as well
as he, and gave them to the Command of the Duke

him, that no body can be better acquainted with all
that happen'd to him than my <U+017F>elf. He had been <U+017F>o
per<U+017F>ecuted by the new Mini<U+017F>ter, that the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi>
lookt on him as irreconcileable, and this re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of his Sentiments with their own, join'd
with <U+017F>ome popular ways, which he had made him
<U+017F>o agreeable to them, that they <U+017F>eem'd not content to
love him, but <U+017F>omething more, even to adore him.
The <hi>Fi<U+017F>h-Wives</hi> above all were tho<U+017F>e that made the
mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew of their kindne<U+017F>s for him. The<U+017F>e every

were the fir<U+017F>t to run to get a <U+017F>ight of him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Upon this he was call'd in deri<U+017F>ion <hi>the King
of the Mobb.</hi> But all their kindne<U+017F>s was nothing to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57806:74"/>
that of one of tho<U+017F>e hone<U+017F>t Women I am going to
tell you of; <U+017F>he comes to him one morning, and
brings with her a young Girl of about Seventeen or
Eighteen, a <U+017F>weet pretty Creature, and told him
that having no more Children in the World,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould think her <U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t body that could
be, if his Grace would do her Daughter the
honour not only to lye with her, but to get her with
Child. The Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> was not like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was thought to be a greater lover of Men
than of Women: So he told her very plea<U+017F>antly
that he was mighty glad to oblige her, and
would engage for the one, tho he could not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the other, yet he would do his be<U+017F>t to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
her in that too; and at the <U+017F>ame time to <U+017F>hew her
that he de<U+017F>ign'd to be as good as his word, he took
and led her Daughter into his Chamber, where after
he had lain with her, he <U+017F>ent them both home very
well pleas'd with their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>This Prince had a Si<U+017F>ter married to the Duke <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> a Per<U+017F>on of a thou<U+017F>and good Qualities,
with never a bad one. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having
occa<U+017F>ions<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that call'd him into the Province of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
which had declar'd in his Favour, gave the
Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi> the Command of his Troops, with
orders to act in Concert with tho<U+017F>e of the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort.</hi> If the Relation of Brothers-in-law
could have been <U+017F>ufficient, as one would have
thought it <U+017F>hould, to have united two Tempers
<U+017F>o va<U+017F>tly different as the<U+017F>e two, then the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> did not commit <U+017F>uch a great mi<U+017F>take, to
leave 'em together, and go into <hi>Guienne:</hi> But
not fore<U+017F>eeing that his ab<U+017F>ence would beget a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hatred, between the<U+017F>e two Princes, who had
been before at variance; he ran the greate<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>que
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57806:75"/>
that he ever did in his Life; for hearing on all
hands, that their enmity was not only arriv'd to
that pitch, that they were ready every moment to
cut one anothers Throats, but that all affairs were
like to be ruin'd by it; he made a de<U+017F>perate Journey
to them from <hi>Agen,</hi> by his pre<U+017F>ence to rectify this
di<U+017F>order. The Prince was to pa<U+017F>s the <hi>Loire,</hi> and
tho he took all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care to conceal his departure,
by giving out that he was gone to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> upon
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>pecial occa<U+017F>ions, yet the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi>
who Commanded the Kings Army on this <U+017F>ide of
the River, had notice of it, and pre<U+017F>ently detach'd
a number of <U+017F>mall Parties, to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves of
all the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es both by Land and Water: but he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
them, notwith<U+017F>tanding their extream Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
for travelling Night and Day, he was
gone by, before they could come up to the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Marqui<U+017F>s <hi>de Levi,</hi> one of
the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s Party, had procur'd of the Count
<hi>de Harcourt</hi> a Pa<U+017F>port to retire to his own Hou<U+017F>e, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uant
to a de<U+017F>ign of the Prince's, under the favour of
this Pa<U+017F>port, to wait on him di<U+017F>guis'd like one of
his Retinue. The Marquis <U+017F>tav'd for the Prince till
he came at <hi>Langres,</hi> and from thence they both took
the Road of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> the greate<U+017F>t part of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>s's
E<U+017F>tate lying thereabouts. While they were
there refre<U+017F>hing them<U+017F>elves, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who
was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Cardinal had lin'd the River with
his Souldiers, <U+017F>ent to <hi>Bu<U+017F><U+017F>i Rabutin,</hi> who was in <hi>la
Charite,</hi> and obtain'd a promi<U+017F>e from him that he
would favour his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; and he was as good as his
word, for he drew off the Guard that <U+017F>tood right
again<U+017F>t the Ferry of <hi>Allier,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
at the <U+017F>ame time coming up to that place, pa<U+017F>s'd over
without any manner of oppo<U+017F>ition. After this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57806:75"/>
e<U+017F>cape he made the be<U+017F>t of his way, tho the length
of the Journey and the badne<U+017F>s of the Roads had <U+017F>o
tir'd their Hor<U+017F>es, that they could not make all the
ha<U+017F>te they de<U+017F>ir'd. The King, who was on the <U+017F>ide
of <hi>Angers,</hi> came marching up the <hi>Loire;</hi> and had
<U+017F>ent out Expre<U+017F><U+017F>es to all places, with orders that they
<U+017F>hould apprehend the Prince, and <U+017F>ecure him alive or
dead. There was one of the<U+017F>e Scouts came <U+017F>o near
him, as to know his Favorite <hi>Guitaut,</hi> and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Prince him<U+017F>elf was not far of, inquir'd
for him of a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> who <U+017F>tay'd a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind:
If they had had the lea<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ence of Mind in
the World, they would have certainly kill'd that Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
upon the <U+017F>pot; the Duke <hi>de la Rochefaucaut</hi> thought
of it a moment after, but then the Fellow was gone.</p>
            <p>The King, as well as the Cardinal, was inform'd
of this Adventure, and immediately detach'd a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Hor<U+017F>e after him; who taking the Road of
<hi>Chatillon</hi> upon <hi>Loin,</hi> <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely per<U+017F>u'd him, that he very
narrowly e<U+017F>cap'd falling into their hands: But his
good Fortune deliver'd him, and having reach'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon,</hi>
he pa<U+017F>s'd on to <hi>Lori,</hi> where his Army than lay.
At his arrival there, he found matters infinitely in a
wor<U+017F>e condition, than what they had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
to him. The Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi>
were at open defiance one with another, for they
could not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble any longer their re<U+017F>entment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the occa<U+017F>ion I am going to tell you of. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> (a Town belonging in <hi>Apanage,</hi>
to the Duke of <hi>Orleans)</hi> had promis'd the Duke <hi>de
Nemours</hi> to give him notice of the approach of the
Kings Army, that <U+017F>o he might have time enough to
<U+017F>end them a Garri<U+017F>on. This they did not fail to do,
and he accordingly drew out of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s
Troops five or <U+017F>ix hundred men for that purpo<U+017F>e.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57806:76"/>
But the Officer that commanded them having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
fal<U+017F>e intelligence by the way, that the King
had already enter'd the Town, proceeded no further,
but came directly back again: Upon which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Gergeau</hi> <U+017F>ent another Expre<U+017F>s, to let them
know that if they neglected them in this manner,
they <U+017F>hould be oblig'd to open their Gates to the
fir<U+017F>t that appear'd. Whereupon the <U+017F>ame Troops
were remanded thither, but then 'twas too late, and
they return'd ju<U+017F>t as they had done once before.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi> was mightily incens'd at this
accident, and whether he really did <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect <U+017F>ome
Treachery in it, or that he was glad of that pretence
to vent his Spleen again<U+017F>t the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> is
uncertain, but he did not <U+017F>tick publickly to accu<U+017F>e
him of holding Corre<U+017F>pondence with the Enemy.
The Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> gave him the Lye, and had
not the whole Army interpos'd to per<U+017F>wade the
Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend his re<U+017F>entment, there
would have follow'd <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>order upon it.
A few days after this had happen'd the Prince <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
arriv'd, who pre<U+017F>ently undertook to mediate an
Accommodation, but the Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi> would
by no means hearken to it; yet out of his re<U+017F>pect
to the Prince, and the Intere<U+017F>t of their affairs which
would not permit him to attempt any thing at that
time, he was content to con<U+017F>train him<U+017F>elf (he <U+017F>aid)
but that afterwards, all the World <U+017F>hould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him when he <U+017F>aw his convenient time. The

this Encounter; and if his Infantry had not <U+017F>av'd
them<U+017F>elves by flying at the very beginning, he could
not have been more intirely routed. The Vi<U+017F>count

            <p>One of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Gentlemen happen'd
to be taken Pri<U+017F>oner <U+017F>ome time before this, and it
being publickly known that this Mare<U+017F>chal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on at Court upon the account of the late
Action, the mi<U+017F>carriage of which they attributed
to his neglect; the Prince found a way to let him
know, that if he would engage in his Intere<U+017F>ts, he
<U+017F>hould meet with more gratitude from him.
<hi>Hocquincourt,</hi> who was acquainted of this by <U+017F>ome
of his Friends, askt this Gentleman of the Prince's,
what advantage it was that he might expect from his
Ma<U+017F>ter, and he engag'd to procure him a hundred
thou<U+017F>and Crowns, provided he brought over with him
<U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e Troops which were at his Command.
<hi>Hocquincourt</hi> joyn'd with the Propo<U+017F>al, and told the
Gentleman, that if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had Money
enough to purcha<U+017F>e them, there was the Count <hi>de
Grandpre</hi> and two or three <hi>German</hi> Collonels more at
his Service. And indeed they all gave him their
words, but the Prince had not a Fund <U+017F>ufficient to
do it, and <U+017F>o the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s dropt; which if it had
taken effect, would have been of the la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

this Adventure and having a Letter for him from the

while we were at Table, who <U+017F>hould come in but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<U+017F><U+017F>aut:</hi>
He told <hi>Concre<U+017F><U+017F>aut</hi> what a rare Adventure he

he pa<U+017F>t thro Apartments very <U+017F>tately
furni<U+017F>h'd to her Clo<U+017F>et, which was very rich and
magnificent, and hung all round with Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57806:77"/>
that the Lady refus'd him nothing, and that
in <U+017F>hort, he was extreamly well pleas'd with the
Adventure, but for one thing. <hi>Concre<U+017F><U+017F>aut</hi> askt him
what that could be. He <U+017F>aid, it was becau<U+017F>e he had
found all the parts of that Lady's body to bear an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
proportion with her Shapes, and by that bid him
gue<U+017F>s if he could, who it was. There needed no
more to make <hi>Concre<U+017F><U+017F>aut</hi> jealous of the truth, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he did not <U+017F>tick to <U+017F>ay, he believ'd it was his
Si<U+017F>ter; but was the fir<U+017F>t of the Company that fell a
laughing, and <U+017F>o prevented the raillery of the re<U+017F>t,
who were prepar'd to fall on him. For all that, the
Prince, for fear we <U+017F>hould not believe it, and to put
it out of all manner of doubt, drew the Letter out
of his Pocket, and <U+017F>hew'd it to every one that had
had the curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee it.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was then in the Vigor of his
Youth, and had a great many little fellows about
him that were call'd Ma<U+017F>ters: The<U+017F>e were mo<U+017F>t of
them lewd and debauch'd, and led him into abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Extravagancies, which not only ruin'd his
Health, but his Affairs. For <U+017F>ome time after this,
that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had enter'd <hi>France,</hi> and
that the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> was inclos'd between
his Troops, tho<U+017F>e of the Princes, and tho<U+017F>e of the
Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> the Court Party being in
that di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, that they knew not which way to turn
them<U+017F>elves, if their Army was routed, at that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
I <U+017F>ay, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was retain'd at
<hi>Paris,</hi> by a di<U+017F>temper which it is not decency to
mention, but which had nothing of a Fever in it, but
the name; by which means he lo<U+017F>t his Advantage,
and could not di<U+017F>cover the Intelligence which was
held between the Court and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
for that Duke having receiv'd a con<U+017F>iderable Sum
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57806:78"/>
of Money on that account, <U+017F>uffer'd the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Turenne</hi> to retire to <hi>Melun,</hi> which had been impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for him to do, if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had been with
his Army.</p>
            <p>Tho the War <U+017F>eem'd to be carry'd on by both
Parties with great vigour, yet there were <U+017F>everal
Treaties <U+017F>et on foot, and manag'd under-hand. I
was twice or thrice at <hi>St. Germains</hi> upon <U+017F>uch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
from the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> whom <hi>Mazarin</hi>
had offer'd to make Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and to pay
him down two hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns, if he
wou'd leave the Princes party, and bring over with
him the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> on whom it was known,
that he had a great Influence. My Fortune was to
be made effectually too, and I was to have a Company
in the Guards for my pains in this affair; the Duke
was willing enough to accept of the propo<U+017F>als, and
was not wanting in his endeavours on his part, but
all our mea<U+017F>ures were broke by the means of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domoi<U+017F>elle
<hi>de Mompen<U+017F>ier,</hi> who being <U+017F>tark mad
to be marry'd, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had amus'd
with the hopes of having his Son, the Duke <hi>d' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army lying ju<U+017F>t at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> we
were every day in the City, and there I met with
my Si<U+017F>ter, who to avoid the effects of the publick
di<U+017F>turbances, had left her Convent and was come to
<hi>Paris.</hi> I was <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he had quitted the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Habit, but was much more <U+017F>o, to under<U+017F>tand that
<U+017F>he was return'd to her Husband. She, it <U+017F>eems,
had met with him when <U+017F>he lea<U+017F>t of all expected it,
and as true Love is encreas'd by ab<U+017F>ence, he no <U+017F>ooner
<U+017F>aw her, but was tempted to forget the Obligation
he lay under by the holy Orders, he had too ra<U+017F>hly
taken; nor was <U+017F>he behind hand with him, but laid
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57806:78"/>
a<U+017F>ide all her thoughts of Devotion. What happen'd
on this was <U+017F>omething extraordinary: She, who in
five or <U+017F>ix years that they had liv'd together before,
had never been with Child, was become in a few
months as big as <U+017F>he could tumble. I expre<U+017F>t my
<U+017F>urprize at the<U+017F>e proceedings, but all the <U+017F>atisfaction I
could get from her was this, that <U+017F>he was bound to
obey her Husband, and being join'd together by the
Holy Sacrament of Marriage, were to be <U+017F>eparated by
nothing but Death.</p>
            <p>To relate this Affair, which made a great noi<U+017F>e
in <hi>Paris,</hi> without breaking off the thread of my
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t tell you that my Si<U+017F>ter was brought
to bed of a Son, in her due time, and that they
liv'd together three or four years after, at the end
of which my Brother in-law dy'd. My Si<U+017F>ter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter on the E<U+017F>tate, which was very con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
met with oppo<U+017F>ition from his Relations,
who us'd this as a pretence, that her Son was Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.
Upon which a great Law Suit was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd,
which the pretended Heirs had a mind to
carry to be try'd in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome part of
the E<U+017F>tate lay there; but they having caus'd the
Goods which were at <hi>Paris</hi> to be <U+017F>eiz'd, and the
Contract of Marriage being made there, the<U+017F>e two
things brought them within the Juri<U+017F>diction of the
Ju<U+017F>tice of the place; be<U+017F>ides that, it <U+017F>olely belongs
to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to take cognizance of all
things relating to the Validity of Marriages.</p>
            <p>The pretended Heirs being now oblig'd to come
to a Trial here, committed their Cau<U+017F>e to one of
the able<U+017F>t Councel to manage, and he in his Plea
forgot nothing that the mo<U+017F>t artificial Rhetorick
could urge, when it intends mo<U+017F>t to per<U+017F>wade.
He exaggerated what a Reflection it would be on
Religion, to tolerate <U+017F>uch an abu<U+017F>e as this, which
was the very way to authorize what the <hi>Hugonots</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57806:79"/>
maintain, that 'tis lawful for a Prie<U+017F>t to marry; that
not only the Child ought to be declar'd illegitimate,
but the Mother ought to be puni<U+017F>ht for <U+017F>o black a

               </gap>rrid a Sacrilege: That nothing had
forc'd the marry'd Couple to a Separation; but
when once they had done <U+017F>o, to devote them<U+017F>elves
to God, it was a Vow of that nature, from which
none but the Pope him<U+017F>elf could di<U+017F>pence 'em:
That the pre<U+017F>ent Ca<U+017F>e was <U+017F>till different; here was a
Man who had not <U+017F>imply promis'd to devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to God, but one who was con<U+017F>ecrated by all that
is mo<U+017F>t Holy in Religion: In a word, a Prie<U+017F>t,
one who had a thou<U+017F>and times offer'd the Sacrifice,
by which we all hope for Salvation: One who had
receiv'd an infinite Number of Souls to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Pennance; had given the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and in <U+017F>hort, who had done all that <U+017F>o <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and <U+017F>acred a Character could intitle him to
do: That it ought to be con<U+017F>ider'd what would be
the con<U+017F>equences of allowing <U+017F>uch a Sacrilege; how
many Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and how many Sacraments would
be render'd ineffectual, and con<U+017F>equently how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souls eternally damn'd.</p>
            <p>'Twould be too tedious to recite all his Plea at
length, in which he was not <U+017F>paring of Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
again<U+017F>t my Si<U+017F>ter, who being pre<U+017F>ent, could
not hear them without an extreme Confu<U+017F>ion. At
la<U+017F>t her Councel began to <U+017F>peak, upon which every
one was <U+017F>ilent, and he <U+017F>aid, That he could not but
admire, an Action <U+017F>hould be repre<U+017F>ented <U+017F>o foul and
criminal, which was only a Slip of Weakne<U+017F>s, or
Humane Frailty: That he did not conceive the
fault lay <U+017F>o much in his Clients living with her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
after a Separation of 5 or 6 years, as in the
<U+017F>uffering him in a fooli<U+017F>h fit of zeal to turn Prie<U+017F>t.
That God had expre<U+017F>ly forbid to <U+017F>eparate tho<U+017F>e
who were thus join'd, how then could they <U+017F>uffer
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57806:79"/>
one, who had <U+017F>worn Fidelity to his Wi<U+017F>e, to violate
an Oath he had taken in the Face of the Church?
and Marriage being a Sacrament, the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent, could not di<U+017F><U+017F>olve
the fir<U+017F>t; That the Child had nothing to do with
the Indi<U+017F>cretions of his Father; that his Legitimacy
was confirm'd by his Fathers Contract with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by the Marriage Benediction he receiv'd.
In <U+017F>hort, if the Parliament, as they had often, in
uncertain Ca<U+017F>es, adjudg'd the ju<U+017F>t Intention of a
Marriage <U+017F>ufficient to legitimate the Children; how
much more rea<U+017F>on had he to hope for the <U+017F>ame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice,
in a Cau<U+017F>e where the Honour of the Mother
was <U+017F>o far from being call'd in que<U+017F>tion, that it was
never <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.</p>
            <p>The Judges were a long time in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, during
which 'tis no hard matter to imagine mine and my
Si<U+017F>ters Fears. I was but ju<U+017F>t come in, as the la<U+017F>t
man had done his Plea. The People that <U+017F>tood by,
but did not know me, told me the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of
the other Councels Plea, and <U+017F>ome of them were <U+017F>o
prejudic'd by his rea<U+017F>ons, as to tell us our De<U+017F>tiny;
but we were happy, that they were not our Judges.
They were mi<U+017F>taken in their opinion, as it prov'd, for
we unanimou<U+017F>ly carry'd our Cau<U+017F>e, and our Adver<U+017F>aries
were condemn'd to all the Co<U+017F>ts &amp; Charges of the Suit.</p>
            <p>This Affair however was the occa<U+017F>ion that <U+017F>ome

to the Bi<U+017F>hoprick of <hi>St. Malo,</hi> was refus'd his
Bulls, becau<U+017F>e he was parted from his Wife; but
on another account than that of my Brother. The

<U+017F>everal times ready to quarrel about precedency; which
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               </gap>judg'd the fir<U+017F>t place to him, who
came fir<U+017F>t to the Council. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>
complain'd of this regulation; the Ba<U+017F>tards of <hi>France</hi>
having this Previledge in the Kingdom, to take place
of all Foreign Princes; but he was an<U+017F>wer'd that it
could not be recall'd, and all his redre<U+017F>s would be
now, to con<U+017F>train him<U+017F>elf a little to come <U+017F>omething
the <U+017F>ooner. And he did not fail to do <U+017F>o, in<U+017F>omuch
that 'twas taken notice of, and <U+017F>aid, that he <U+017F>tood
Centinel there every day, to watch till the door

            <p>At length, after they had fully re<U+017F>olv'd the ruine
of the Cardinal, and the means to accompli<U+017F>h it, the

the <U+017F>ide of St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> to retire, but not content with
that, he turn'd his Forces again<U+017F>t St <hi>Denis;</hi> in which
there was a Royal Garri<U+017F>on. The place being of no
<U+017F>trength was ea<U+017F>ily carry'd, and for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on

could not be kept for any time. The Prince, who
had experienc'd what kind of Souldiers the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi>
were, when he had to do with them near <hi>Charen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

found them not more brave now they fought for
him, for they de<U+017F>erted him before St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and if
he had not had tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>tood by him, he had
been baffl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d before a little paltry Town.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was come back to <hi>Paris,</hi> but
in a few days return'd to his Army, perceiving the Kings
had taken the Field, on purpo<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>lodge his,
which by the means of the Bridge of <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> was
often cover'd by the river of <hi>Scine,</hi> <U+017F>o as to avoid
coming to a Battle. He found the Enemy had made a
Bridge of Boats ready on the <U+017F>ide of <hi>St. Denis,</hi> to
pa<U+017F>s over part of their Army, while the other marcht
on this <U+017F>ide of the River. Being therefore afraid to be
inclos'd, he decamp'd, and intended to retire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Charenton</hi> and <hi>Ville neuve St. Georges,</hi> where he

whom he had to deal with, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etrating into his
de<U+017F>ign, fell upon him from the ri<U+017F>ing grounds of the
<hi>Fauxbourg St. Martin,</hi> and furiou<U+017F>ly charg'd his Rear:
The Prince <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o hotly pre<U+017F>t, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pairing
of gaining the Bridge of <hi>Charenton,</hi> which he
could not pa<U+017F>s neither without defiling, re<U+017F>olv'd to
fight, <U+017F>ince he was forc'd to it, and commanded his
Van-guard to halt. They were come up as far as the
Entrance of the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antoine,</hi> where he found
<U+017F>everal Retrenchments, the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi> had ca<U+017F>t up, to
cover them<U+017F>elves from the Spoil of the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had ravag'd the Countries all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
The Prince, as he had the greate<U+017F>t know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Military Affairs of any man in his Age,
immediately concluded, that nothing could have
happen'd more advantageous, than what Fortune
her<U+017F>elf here offer'd him; <U+017F>o he drew his Troops into
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57806:81"/>
the<U+017F>e Retrenchments, and lodg'd them as fa<U+017F>t as they
came up.</p>
            <p>The Kings Army was <U+017F>tronger by half than the
Princes; but the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a part of 'em, being <U+017F>till on the other <U+017F>ide of the
<hi>Seine,</hi> their Forces were pretty equal. The King,
who did not imagine that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could
e<U+017F>cape him, po<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elf on the ri<U+017F>ing grounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Menilmontunt,</hi> from whence being out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he might <U+017F>ee all that pa<U+017F>t. He propos'd two
advantages to him<U+017F>elf in doing this, one was, by his
pre<U+017F>ence to animate the Souldiers; and the other,
that it would hinder the City of <hi>Paris</hi> from giving the
Prince a retreat. And indeed it had this effect, that
they did refu<U+017F>e to let his Baggage come in, which was

               </gap>'t to be left upon the Bulwark.</p>
            <p>The Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> hearing the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Turenne</hi> was going to engage the Prince, made all
the ha<U+017F>te <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing not to be done in a moment, <U+017F>o the Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
without him. The Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the entrance of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> made a vigorous
attack upon it, while at the <U+017F>ame time he <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome
of his Troops, to my to enter <U+017F>ome other part of the
City.</p>
            <p>I had always till now, a good opinion of the
Courage of the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> and thought the
Reflections made on him by the Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
proceeded rather from the hatred that was between
them, than from any ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion; but I <U+017F>aw now
that he did all he could to get into the Town, upon
pretence of declaring for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but
indeed, as I thought I had good rea<U+017F>on to believe, to
avoid fighting. For the re<U+017F>t, having told you the
zeal of the common people, in a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting <U+017F>ome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>es
of his, I ought al<U+017F>o to tell you how it came to
pa<U+017F>s, that they had now an other Opinion of him;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57806:81"/>
you mu<U+017F>t know, that he not only grew weary
of the War, but complain'd his Troops were
expos'd to all the Hard<U+017F>hips of an Enemy, which the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could not help, having not Money
to pay them, that <U+017F>o they might have been kept in
Di<U+017F>cipline; however the fight being begun, as I have
ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>aid, was maintain'd on both <U+017F>ides with
<U+017F>uch Re<U+017F>olution, that 'twas not known for a good
while who would have the better of it; but the Vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> knowing that the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de la
Ferte</hi> was marching with all <U+017F>peed po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly to join
him, made <U+017F>uch efforts that he di<U+017F>appointed his hopes
of <U+017F>haring with him in the Victory. The <hi>Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi>
were forc'd in two places, and tho the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> di<U+017F>puted their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age with an incredible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinacy,
he was in great danger of having all his men
cut off. If Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Montpen<U+017F>ier,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

Service. She <U+017F>eiz'd upon the <hi>Ba<U+017F>tile,</hi> a Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I had not been in very many actions, <U+017F>o I could

old Officers <U+017F>ay 'twas, and I know very well, <U+017F>ome
Squadrons charg'd five times; and tho they had been
often broke to pieces, yet they rally'd again as often;
here was abundance of men kill'd and wounded, and
the Duke <hi>de la Rochefaucaut</hi> was among the latter; he
receiv'd a hurt under his Eye, by which he lo<U+017F>t his <U+017F>ight
for the pre<U+017F>ent, but he has recover'd it again <U+017F>ince;
they carry'd him into <hi>Paris,</hi> which Madamoi<U+017F>elle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd

            <p>It pleas'd God to pre<U+017F>erve me in this action, tho I

I did, three days before he fought the Duel with the
Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi> in which the latter was kill'd. If the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had thought it worth his while he
might have prevented this misfortune; but he was
not <U+017F>orry that he was thus rid of this Prince, who was
his Rival in the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and as he
thought, better receiv'd there than him<U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that
when they told him he was kill'd, he hardly behav'd

was oblig'd to di<U+017F>patch both her and her Gallant a

            <p>I was extremely <U+017F>urpriz'd at this great Ingenuity,
e<U+017F>pecially in a man that was not accounted to have
over-much; nor indeed did I under<U+017F>tand the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ift of
the matter, which was to inform me downright
he was jealous; and that if any was <U+017F>o venturous as to
attempt upon the Lady he had now marry'd, there was
nothing <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate but he dur<U+017F>t undertake again<U+017F>t
them. Now he knew I was very intimate with a

ab<U+017F>ence, and 'twas reported it was on <U+017F>uch an account;
when I under<U+017F>tood what he meant, I took no notice
at all, as if I knew nothing, and tho he often run over
the <U+017F>ame Chapter, I always turn'd the deaf ear, till at la<U+017F>t
he was forc'd to explain him<U+017F>elf, and told me, that he
took me to be <U+017F>o much his Friend, that I would
keep a <U+017F>ecret; that his Wife kept company with a
per<U+017F>on he did not like, who it <U+017F>eems was of my
acquaintance; that I <U+017F>hould give him a caution of it,
and that 'twas dangerous to give but an umbrage to
<U+017F>uch a man as he; that a Letter might mi<U+017F>carry, and
therefore he cho<U+017F>e to have me go my <U+017F>elf; that I
<U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o go to his Wife, and tell her as much; and
if <U+017F>he took it unkindly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was <U+017F>trange methought that I <U+017F>hould be the
per<U+017F>on pick'd out for <U+017F>o great a confidence, and I
could not forbear telling him <U+017F>o; to which he return'd,
that he had known me a long time, and was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the many important affairs I had manag'd for
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and therefore concluded I was fit to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57806:84"/>
keep a <U+017F>ecret, and he hop'd I would do it for him, and
promis'd in requital to u<U+017F>e his intere<U+017F>t to get me a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
which he thought the Cardinal would not
refu<U+017F>e him.</p>
            <p>My fate threw me always upon <U+017F>uch Negotiations
as the<U+017F>e, and I was forc'd to obey it, <U+017F>o I came to <hi>Paris;</hi>
where I <U+017F>aw my friend, who told me the Mare<U+017F>chal
was mad; that he had <U+017F>een his Wife indeed, but 'twas

than to pa<U+017F>s away the time, and if her Husband
would return him all the Money he had lo<U+017F>t at play to
her, he would go to a Notary, and bind him<U+017F>elf never
to come near her any more, but till he had his revenge,
he would not promi<U+017F>e him. I thought this an<U+017F>wer very
weak, and made only to put me off; I told him I
wondred he would deal in this manner with a friend;
I knew nothing of his Intreague, being never cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

and then return'd,</hi> I thought, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> that you had been
one of my Friends, and I am very <U+017F>orry to find my <U+017F>elf deceiv'd.
Suppo<U+017F>e I had lov'd Madam <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> I made no que<U+017F>tion but
you would have been the readie<U+017F>t man in the world to have
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted me; for you know 'tis a thing that we always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
freely for one another, but 'tis enough, that you give me
the <U+017F>ame liberty you take your <U+017F>elf: However I'll tell you one
thing as a Friend, that Mon<U+017F>ieur the Mare<U+017F>chal is jealous
without cau<U+017F>e; I have had no concern with his Wife, but at
Play, and I will have one opportunity more to recover my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
again, and will come no more at her as long as I live.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>aw however there was more Intrigue in this
than he would have known, but I reckon'd I had
di<U+017F>charg'd my <U+017F>elf as a Friend, <U+017F>o I went to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e

an Errand; for when <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood it <U+017F>he was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd: She told me <U+017F>he was not much <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the proceedings of the Mare<U+017F>chal, that he
went to pick a quarrel with her that he might have a
pretence to make her away as he had done his other
Wife, but <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome Friends would revenge it if
he did; that if <U+017F>he had given him any occa<U+017F>ion to do
thus, why had he not told her of it, for he had not
<U+017F>aid a word to her of any <U+017F>uch thing; that it was no
<U+017F>trange thing to <U+017F>ee a Husband jealous, who had a
wanton go<U+017F><U+017F>iping Cocquette to his Wife; that as for
her, all the world knew <U+017F>he never <U+017F>tirr'd abroad, and
excepting at play, kept no Company at all; why
<U+017F>hould he accu<U+017F>e her then of Crimes which were not
to be manag'd without much intriguing and a<U+017F><U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

            <p>She would have talkt all day I believe, if I had not
interrupted her; but finding there would be no end
of it, I <U+017F>topt her, by telling her that I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed
to receive her Ju<U+017F>tifications; that as for me
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57806:85"/>
I was per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he had more Prudence, but that was
not enough, if her Husband was not <U+017F>o; that the way to
<U+017F>atisfy him fully, was to avoid the company of the man
whom he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>ee him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
at play, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he needed not matter it, there
being a great many in <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>he might play with as
well as with him, and that being done, I did not doubt
but her Husband would do her ju<U+017F>tice to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
her vertue as well as I; that this was only his
nice humour, which was for preventing any <U+017F>candal,
tho in the great po<U+017F>t he was, Malice it <U+017F>elf could fa<U+017F>ten
nothing on his conduct; yet if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
for it to work on hers, it would be full as bad.</p>
            <p>She an<U+017F>wer'd me, I might turn things as I pleas'd,
but <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t judge as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, that her Husband was a
Brute and a jealous-pated Man, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be
always unhappy with him, but <U+017F>ince it was her mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be <U+017F>o, I might tell him, <U+017F>he would obey his
arbitrary will and would <U+017F>ee the per<U+017F>on no more, there
was all this ado about; and if he would too, <U+017F>he would
hide her <U+017F>elf from all per<U+017F>ons that came to the Hou<U+017F>e,
even from her own Servants, for one was as rea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the other. The<U+017F>e words did <U+017F>ufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate
her concern, however as it was not my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to take any notice of it. I took my leave of her, but
with <U+017F>o mean an opinion of her vertue, that I very
much doubted <U+017F>he would not keep her word. In the
mean time to put a <U+017F>top to this, and to avoid any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, <U+017F>he broke off the Meetings for Play
which us'd to be at her hou<U+017F>e, and kept in <U+017F>everal days
without being <U+017F>een; but having privately entertain'd
the per<U+017F>on I mention'd, <U+017F>he made her <U+017F>elf amends for
the Pennance <U+017F>he had undergone.</p>
            <p>The Mare<U+017F>chal being inform'd of this, by Spies
which he kept always about her, and re<U+017F>olving to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h

the informations to the Cardinal, and askt him what
he pleas'd <U+017F>hould be done with them. <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who
was oblig'd to the Mare<U+017F>chal, order'd him to <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s
them, and to cau<U+017F>e the Dragoon to be <U+017F>trangled in

being afraid, that Madam <hi>la Ferte</hi> <U+017F>hould fare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <U+017F>ame manner, he <U+017F>ent her word privately to
take care of her <U+017F>elf, and to endeavour to regain the
good opinion of her Husband; <U+017F>he had been very
much di<U+017F>turb'd at the misfortune of her Gallant, but
this Compliment made her very <U+017F>erious. She fled to
the Queen Mother for protection, and feigning her
<U+017F>elf religious, <U+017F>he began to attend her to her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Mare<U+017F>chal finding <U+017F>uch an alteration in

and having been a long time from her, he receiv'd her

not put up all this <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily, but would have it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd

and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> who now had the
Soveraign Authority, hearing a great many fal<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of this Action, order'd us to be pro<U+017F>ecuted
with the utmo<U+017F>t vigour: <U+017F>o we were examin'd, and
that as <U+017F>trictly as if we had been the wor<U+017F>t of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
and I e<U+017F>pecially, having had <U+017F>ome words
formerly with him that was now our Judge, who
fancy'd that I did him an ill Office once with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>de Richlieu.</hi> If I had been con<U+017F>cious of any
guilt, I would without doubt have excepted again<U+017F>t
him, as a Party prejudic'd again<U+017F>t me; but knowing
my <U+017F>elf clear, I made no <U+017F>cruple of being examind
by him, which he was very glad of, thinking now
he <U+017F>hould have an opportunity to be even with me:
In <U+017F>hort, I perceiv'd that the Clerk, who held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondence
with him, and took my Examination,
wrote a great deal more down than I <U+017F>poke, which
made me di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with his reading it, <U+017F>o I wou'd
not <U+017F>ign it till I had read it my <U+017F>elf; but he told me
that was not their cu<U+017F>tom, and they would not
make a new Law for me. But this made me <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
them the more, in<U+017F>omuch that telling them
plainly that I would not <U+017F>ign it then, he not only
gave me a great deal of ill Language, but committed
me to the Dungeon. O God! What a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was I in,
to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf us'd like a Highway-man or a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
for a bare frolick, with no hopes of getting
out, and kept <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e that I could have no
Friend admitted to me, nor no body to <U+017F>peak a
word to, but the Keepers: I begg'd one of them
to convey a Letter for me to a Friend, and to help
me to a Pen and Ink to write it, and promis'd him
to do him more kindne<U+017F>s than it came to, when I
<U+017F>hould get out of Pri<U+017F>on; but he was <U+017F>o far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toucht with my entreaties, that he gave me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57806:88"/>
ill Language, enough to have madded a very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Man. The Chevalier <hi>de Rieux</hi> far'd not a jot
better than I; and being both accus'd of the <U+017F>ame
Crime, the Lieutenant Criminel was oblig'd to
treat him exactly in the <U+017F>ame manner, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould
be thought to pro<U+017F>ecute me, upon a private Picque.
The Chevalier was a very lewd per<U+017F>on, and
little better than his Brother (who we have known
to be a notorious Debauchee) and had like him,
the guilt of very many and great Crimes upon
him, which now reflecting on a little <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly,
he thought this a judgment on him for his wicked
cour<U+017F>es; and as Mariners in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s make vows for
their deliverance, <U+017F>o he made <U+017F>olemn promi<U+017F>es to
reform, if ever he got out of this unhappy bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s;
but he <U+017F>oon forgot them all when God had heard
his Prayers, and in<U+017F>tead of reclaiming, grew more
vicious than before; till he wa<U+017F>ted his E<U+017F>tate and
left him<U+017F>elf not a bit of bread, and then put him<U+017F>elf
into a Mona<U+017F>tery, that he might not <U+017F>tarve for want:
But this life not agreeing with his inclination, he
quitted his Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock, and little Band, and took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
turn abroad; when having try'd his Fortune all
the ways he could think of, he turn'd Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tick
a <U+017F>econd time, more to avoid Humane Ju<U+017F>tice, which
he was in danger of, than Divine; and taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is now a Curate in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
him<U+017F>elf no better than he did at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my own ca<U+017F>e. The Cardinal
being <U+017F>ollicited every day to make an example of
<U+017F>ome body or other, for the terror of tho<U+017F>e that
practic'd this way of robbing in the Streets, which
indeed was ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to <U+017F>top the in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
con<U+017F>tantly committed in the Street, <U+017F>o that
'twas not <U+017F>afe going abroad in the Night, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57806:89"/>
the Lieutenant Criminel to bring him the
informations; and having <U+017F>een ours, in the manner
the Judge had been pleas'd to draw it, he order'd
them to proceed again<U+017F>t us. This Order was too
publick not to be known at Court, and the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>de Rieux</hi> being related to almo<U+017F>t all the People of
Quality, he made no que<U+017F>tion but they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for him, for fear of <U+017F>uffering a blot upon the
Family, which they did; and applying to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminel, he told them he <U+017F>hould be very
glad to <U+017F>erve them, provided it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my receiving part in the favour; that our Crimes
were the <U+017F>ame, but if they who we had <U+017F>aid were
with us, would <U+017F>ubmit to be examin'd, which had not
yet been done becau<U+017F>e of their Quality, and would
te<U+017F>tify that 'twas I that prompted them not only to
go on the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> but al<U+017F>o to do all tho<U+017F>e ill things
we were accus'd of. The<U+017F>e were the conditions, and
<U+017F>uch did the<U+017F>e Gentlemen accept of; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it to the others, they found them very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
<U+017F>o they purchas'd their own liberty with my
ruine, and I was charg'd with a thou<U+017F>and things that
I never <U+017F>o much as dreamt of; <U+017F>o I was as it were
a Victim deliver'd up to the malice of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

had not God <U+017F>ent me deliverance by a way which

but coming again a <U+017F>econd time, <U+017F>he took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to <U+017F>how me, that <U+017F>he had a Letter for
me, which I <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>o as her Husband might

not perceive it; but this was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to do, this
man kept his Eye <U+017F>o continually upon me, which
oblig'd the woman to make as if <U+017F>he was looking
upon my Straw-bed, and turning it up, <U+017F>he threw
the Letter directly into it, where I found it when
<U+017F>he was gone: The Contents was, that <U+017F>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Lieutenant Criminel acted again<U+017F>t me with
a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, more like an Accu<U+017F>er than a Judge, which
had mov'd her compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; that I was a lo<U+017F>t Man,
if I did not get <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>on of very great Intere<U+017F>t

convey it for me.</p>
            <p>This was very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for me, my Per<U+017F>ecutor
being ready to confront me with his Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and
waiting immediately upon that to give Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, which would al<U+017F>o have <U+017F>oon been confirm'd
by the Parliament. Be<U+017F>ides, they had made new

depos'd that they found me upon the Brazen
Hor<U+017F>e, they depo<U+017F>ed now, that they took me in the
fact, Robbing on the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> and catcht me as
I was endeavouring to make my e<U+017F>cape. The
Keepers Wife was as good as her word, and made
u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame device to convey me the Pen and
Ink <U+017F>he had promis'd me, as <U+017F>he had to leave me
the Letter; <U+017F>o that having wherewith to do it, I
wrote two Letters, one to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the
other to Mou<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> Son to him that was
Keeper of the Seal; I directed both of them to him,
and the Keepers Wife having deliver'd them to
him, he told her, he wonder'd what I meant; that
while I was in favour, his Family, whatever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion

however, he would not fail to do me all the <U+017F>ervice
he could, and would have done it before if he had

acted again<U+017F>t me with <U+017F>o much private <U+017F>pleen, that

<U+017F>pun out my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to a great length: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s,
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> having repre<U+017F>ented to the
Council the inju<U+017F>tice that was done me, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminel was defeated, and was forbidden to
be Judge in the ca<U+017F>e, and the Dean of the Coun<U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors

               </gap>
having him<U+017F>elf like a Man of honour and hone<U+017F>ty,
the truth was brought to light, and my Enemies
were proved to be Lyars: So I came out of Pri<U+017F>on,
after having been confin'd four Months, whereof I
had been two Months and a half in the Dungeon.
My fir<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>it was to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me very kindly, without <U+017F>peaking one word
of what he had hinted to the Keepers Wife; he
return'd me the Letter I had wrote for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> not finding it convenient to deliver it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57806:91"/>
After having acknowledged this obligation, I
thought of di<U+017F>charging another of no le<U+017F>s value,
which was to pay my thanks to the good woman,
the Keepers wife; to whom having made an offer
of a very con<U+017F>iderable Pre<U+017F>ent, I was <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee
her refu<U+017F>e it. This affliction gave me lei<U+017F>ure enough
to reflect upon my <U+017F>elf, and having given my <U+017F>elf
up to the Plea<U+017F>ures of the World, like a Man that
never con<U+017F>iders he mu<U+017F>t one day dye, I had made
a re<U+017F>olution to change my cour<U+017F>e of Life: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s,
it coming into my head, that this woman
could not do all this for no end, or with no de<U+017F>ign;
and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had refus'd my Pre<U+017F>ent, I concluded it
could be no other than that of Love, and thought
my <U+017F>elf oblig'd to content her that way too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
con<U+017F>idering that I was going already to break
the promi<U+017F>e I had made to God in my Troubles.
But if I was <U+017F>urpriz'd at her refu<U+017F>ing my Pre<U+017F>ent, I
was much more <U+017F>o, at the manner in which <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
my Complement; for without that Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that 'tis <U+017F>o much the fa<U+017F>hion for Women to
make, who would be thought more vertuous than
they really are; <U+017F>he told me roundly, that I did not
de<U+017F>erve the Deliverance that God had <U+017F>o wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be<U+017F>tow'd on me; that I had more rea<U+017F>on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
him thanks than to pull down his vengeance on
me, by an account <U+017F>o criminal, as the Adultery I
had compa<U+017F>s'd in my Thoughts: That if <U+017F>he had
oblig'd me, 'twas only becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>tice
that was offer'd me, and this was but an ill
requital, to propo<U+017F>e <U+017F>o horrid a Crime to her. I
was heartily glad to <U+017F>tand corrected by <U+017F>o Chri<U+017F>tian
a reproof: and as vertue commands our e<U+017F>teem, <U+017F>o
I had more real value for her, than I <U+017F>hould have
had love, if <U+017F>he had yielded to my <U+017F>olicitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57806:91"/>
I had no <U+017F>ooner lo<U+017F>t the thoughts of this crime,
but I entertain'd another in my brea<U+017F>t; I re<U+017F>olv'd to
revenge my <U+017F>elf of my fal<U+017F>e Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and begun
with the Chevalier <hi>de Rieux,</hi> whom I forc'd to
draw in the <U+017F>treet, having met him by accident:
as he naturally was but a Coward, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to convince me, that I was under the greate<U+017F>t
mi<U+017F>take in the world, to offer that to him who was
always one of my be<U+017F>t Friends; but as I knew well
enough what I ought to believe, I took no great
heed to what he <U+017F>aid, but gave him <U+017F>everal blows
with the flat of my Sword, <U+017F>eeing he would not be
per<U+017F>waded to draw; but I was not <U+017F>atisfied with all
this: Next I meditated revenge again<U+017F>t the Count
<hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> who I knew had treated me uncivilly
behind my back: Tho he was of a mo<U+017F>t honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family, and tho his Quality exempted him from
giving me the common <U+017F>atisfaction in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, yet
I was re<U+017F>olv'd one way or other to let him know,
that I was not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the affront; and it was
not long before I had an occa<U+017F>ion put into my
hands; there was a Captain in the Marine Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
call'd <hi>De<U+017F>planches,</hi> who was one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in the Country, to whom he had behav'd
him<U+017F>elf very imperiou<U+017F>ly, upon pretence that his
Ance<U+017F>tors had rai<U+017F>ed their E<U+017F>tate by being Rent-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
or Stewards to his Family, by which means
they had left their Heirs a better E<U+017F>tate than their
Ma<U+017F>ter, intimating as if they had dealt unju<U+017F>tly by
him. 'Tis true this <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> had been <U+017F>o, and had
little le<U+017F>s than thirty thou<U+017F>and Livres a year E<U+017F>tate;
and having obtain'd Letters Patents for his Nobility,
and a Coat of Arms, now he thought he ought
not to bear all tho<U+017F>e meanne<U+017F><U+017F>es, which was impos'd
upon him by the haughty carriage of the Count:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57806:92"/>
Be<U+017F>ides this, that Prince had a great mind to a peice
of Land that belong'd to him call'd <hi>Rufflais,</hi> which
joyning to his E<U+017F>tate at <hi>Harcourt,</hi> he was always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
upon.</p>
            <p>I no <U+017F>ooner was inform'd of all this, but I offer'd
my Service to <hi>De<U+017F>planches,</hi> whom I had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with before; but I found means to let him
under<U+017F>tand, that I was like to be very hearty in
joyning with him again<U+017F>t one that was <U+017F>o much my
Enemy as well as his. This man, who was the
greate<U+017F>t Drunkard that ever I knew in my life, never
thankt me, nor nothing, but told me, he <U+017F>hould be
very glad to drink with me; and not to delay it,
de<U+017F>i'rd me to dine with him at the <hi>Flower de luce,</hi>
where he lodged, near the <hi>Ho<U+017F>tel de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons.</hi> He
told me however after his fir<U+017F>t Compliment, that he
was oblig'd to me, but I did not find him <U+017F>o eager
of the thing as I thought he would have been; <U+017F>o
that I concluded either that he wanted courage, or
that he was afraid of embroiling him<U+017F>elf with a
Prince of that intere<U+017F>t. I held of this mind till Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when having eaten his Soup, and taken off two
or three Bumpers, he began to talk very <U+017F>candalou<U+017F>ly
of the Count <hi>de Harcourt:</hi> I told him he mu<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e

               </gap> the way he ought
to revenge him<U+017F>elf of his Enemy; that I had heard
the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> had offer'd him <U+017F>everal in<U+017F>ults,
even in his own hou<U+017F>e, and if he pleas'd we would
go home with him, and <U+017F>ee if we could per<U+017F>wade
him, to come and do the like again. <hi>De<U+017F>planches,</hi>
who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion encrea<U+017F>t with his Wine, told me,
he lik'd the propo<U+017F>al very well; and having askt
two or three Officers of the <U+017F>ame Regiment, that
were with us, if they would be of the party, they
all agreed immediately they would go: So he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57806:92"/>
his Hor<U+017F>es to be <U+017F>addled, and de<U+017F>ir'd us to <U+017F>end
for ours. I thought we had nothing to do now,
but to put on our Boots and to mount, but 'twas not
his way to ri<U+017F>e from Table <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, and 'twas <U+017F>ix a
Clock at night before he would <U+017F>tir, and then he was
<U+017F>o drunk, that in<U+017F>tead of going about what had
been agreed, he fell to quarrelling with one of tho<U+017F>e
Officers, <U+017F>o that if I had not clapt in between, the
quarrel would not have ended without mi<U+017F>chief; I
endeavour'd to make him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his error, but
he being no more capable of rea<U+017F>on than a Hor<U+017F>e,
was the more unruly, till the Officer that knew him
better than I, was oblig'd to go out of the Room,
for fear-of pu<U+017F>hing the humour too far: The two
others, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould think he did <U+017F>o for want of
courage, told me at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>oftly, that
'twould be be<U+017F>t for us to withdraw too; that when
he was drunk he was quite mad, and if we did not,
we <U+017F>hould, it may be, find <U+017F>ome of the effects of his
di<U+017F>order: I <U+017F>aw rea<U+017F>on enough to believe them, <U+017F>o
we <U+017F>ent back our Hor<U+017F>es and went home to our own
Lodgings, while <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> was fighting with his
Men, and quarrelling with his Landlord and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
for letting us go.</p>
            <p>The next morning before I was up, he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, and taking no notice of la<U+017F>t nights
work, he askt me if I held my re<U+017F>olution, of going
with him into the Country as I had promis'd. I
told him Yes, and was ready to go when he pleas'd.
He told me he would go as <U+017F>oon as ever the other
Gentlemen were ready, to whom he had <U+017F>ent that
morning, and <U+017F>o de<U+017F>ir'd me to ri<U+017F>e: and then he took
five or <U+017F>ix turns in my Chamber, walking ha<U+017F>tily as
if he had <U+017F>ome great thing in his head; at la<U+017F>t it
came out, and he told me that he was di<U+017F>turb'd in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57806:93"/>
his thoughts, for fear he <U+017F>hould make a broil with the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who wanted nothing but <U+017F>uch an
opportunity to out him of his E<U+017F>tate: This made me
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of people always retain <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the meanne<U+017F>s of their Nature, in <U+017F>pight of
all the Patents of Nobility their Money may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them; and if the Officers had not come in, in
that very moment, I had put off engaging with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of <U+017F>o mean a re<U+017F>olution: I told them what
<hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> had been <U+017F>aying to me, at which they
<U+017F>hrunk up their <U+017F>houlders; but being Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
they told him, he ought rather to dye than
to bear the affronts he received every day; that
they did not de<U+017F>ign to go and quarrel with the
Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> at his own Hou<U+017F>e, but they
would only go with him and Hunt upon his Lands,
that lay next to the Count's, to let him <U+017F>ee that he
was not afraid of him.</p>
            <p>And to hearten him up, they gave him leave to
go to Breakfa<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t, upon condition he <U+017F>hould drink
but his <U+017F>hare of two Bottles of Wine; and this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the de<U+017F>ir'd effect, we got on Hor<U+017F>eback and
took the direct way to <hi>Normandy:</hi> Now tho this
Man had nothing to do, but to make ha<U+017F>te to our
Journeys end, yet all we could do, could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
him <U+017F>taying a whole day at <hi>Mantes,</hi> where he
lighting on <U+017F>ome excellent Wine, made them fill a
hundred Bottles of it, which we <U+017F>et in the head of our
little Troop, and convoy'd to his Hou<U+017F>e. And le<U+017F>t
the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who was at home, <U+017F>hould
have notice of our coming, we thought it be<U+017F>t to
come in in the Night; and having forbid the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
telling any body how many we were, we went
a Hunting the next morning, and rod up even to
the very edge of the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s Land,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57806:93"/>
which lay next to <hi>Rufflais.</hi> The Count being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
inform'd of it, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> and his Men, laid an Ambu<U+017F>cade for
them as they <U+017F>hould come back. In <U+017F>hort, as we
were riding under a Hedge, we were <U+017F>aluted with
two <U+017F>hots from the other <U+017F>ide, one of which <U+017F>truck
off the Pommel of my Saddle, upon which I turn'd
about immediately, and being very well mounted,
I came up with one of the Fellows that had <U+017F>hot,
before he had time to charge again; I could ea<U+017F>ily
have kill'd him if I would, but not being willing
to do <U+017F>o, I contented my <U+017F>elf with beating him
mo<U+017F>t unmercifully with my Fu<U+017F>il: The Fellow
knowing me, call'd me by my Name, and told me
he belong'd to <U+017F>uch a Gentleman, and hop'd that
for his Ma<U+017F>ters <U+017F>ake, whom he thought to be one of
my very good Friends, I would be pleas'd to pardon
him: <hi>'Tis your Ma<U+017F>ter Sirrah,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>is the cau<U+017F>e that
I u<U+017F>e you at this tate, but I will let you go, provided you
will promi<U+017F>e me to tell him <U+017F>o.</hi> He made no difficulty
of promi<U+017F>ing me this, and going another way to
e<U+017F>cape <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> and the Officers, who were in cha<U+017F>e

all over batter'd and bruis'd, and his Cloaths torn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
off of his back, <U+017F>o that any body might <U+017F>ee he
had fallen into very bad hands: <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> and his
Friends blam'd me extreamly for letting him go,
thinking that I ought rather have <U+017F>eiz'd him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
him to Ju<U+017F>tice; but I who aim'd mo<U+017F>t at my
private revenge, was very well pleas'd with what I
had done. In <U+017F>hort, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was <U+017F>o
enrag'd at the affront, he had as he thought receiv'd;
that he a<U+017F><U+017F>embled all his Friends, and not con<U+017F>idering

the very hou<U+017F>e at <hi>Rufflais,</hi> and to bury us all in the

Ruins. This was not to be done <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, but
we had notice of it, and the Hou<U+017F>e being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencible,

<hi>de Crequi Bernieulle,</hi> who was no Friend to the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and who<U+017F>e Hou<U+017F>e was then the
Seat of a little War between him and the Marquis <hi>de
Sourdeac;</hi> for there was not only a Suit at Law depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between them, but 'twas grown to that height,
that they made a formal War again<U+017F>t each other;
and oftentimes met one another in the field, with
fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen hundred men of a <U+017F>ide, as if they
would come to a <U+017F>et Battle; <U+017F>o we offer'd our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him to engage in his Party again<U+017F>t both the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac:</hi>
There was a great deal of difference between the<U+017F>e
Troops and regulated Souldiers, as appeared parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
one day, when the Count <hi>de Crequi</hi> being
advanc'd, the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner
fired one <U+017F>hot from a Fauconet at the Ca<U+017F>tle <hi>de
Nieufborg,</hi> but all the Squadron <U+017F>cour'd away as hard
as they could drive, every one laying the blame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
upon his Hor<U+017F>e, who was not us'd to
<U+017F>tand fire; but as the di<U+017F>grace was general, tho<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>tood were willing enough to take it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e.
As they made war upon the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac,</hi>
<U+017F>o did I upon the Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> upon who<U+017F>e
ground I ventur'd two or three times to kill <U+017F>ome
Partridges: The Bayliff came, and de<U+017F>ir'd me civilly to
forbear, pretending his Ma<U+017F>ter was gone to <hi>Paris,</hi>
but I knew well enough that was a <U+017F>ham, for the

the Trees, at the very Gates of <hi>Rufflais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought however I had done enough to te<U+017F>tify
my re<U+017F>entment, and <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> being on the other
hand oblig'd to return to the Army, I was oblig'd
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57806:94"/>
to bear him company to <hi>Paris,</hi> for he dur<U+017F>t not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to have gone alone; being arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> I
went pre<U+017F>ently to Court, and the Cardinal <U+017F>eeing
me, askt me whence I came, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that he knew all that had pa<U+017F>t; neverthele<U+017F>s

but I was <U+017F>urpriz'd, when in<U+017F>tead of that, he told
me I had done very well, and he <U+017F>hould like me the
better for it as long as he knew me; that one <hi>Folle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
le Sens,</hi> who was a Gentleman of that Country,
and who belong'd to him, had told him all, and
that I needed not be di<U+017F>turb'd at it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
might depend upon his Protection. I humbly
thankt him for this goodne<U+017F>s, but I askt him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
how he would plea<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me: For
while I was under confinement, he had given away
my Company; <U+017F>o that I lookt methought, in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
condition, little better than a <hi>Valet</hi> out of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
he bid me take no care of that, but attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, for he went every year into the Army with
the King; who began now, not only to <U+017F>hew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
great, but al<U+017F>o to give an early proof of what
he would one day appear. In <U+017F>hort, he delighted
in the War above all things, and tho they caution'd
him with regard to his Health, not to expo<U+017F>e his
Per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o in the Heats and Rains, yet he <U+017F>eldom
mi<U+017F>t being on Hor<U+017F>eback as long as any Day-light
was left.</p>
            <p>I had <U+017F>pent more time in the Court than in the
Army; and <U+017F>eeing however my Inclination led me
to the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yet that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me
to manage my <U+017F>elf in it, as well as tho<U+017F>e who had
been bred to it, I was not <U+017F>orry for the Command
the Cardinal laid upon me. I waited upon him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57806:95"/>
with the greate<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; and tho I
<U+017F>ay it, omitted nothing that might oblige him.
However, there was <U+017F>everal Poeple, who pretended to
per<U+017F>wade me that I took wrong mea<U+017F>ures, and among
the re<U+017F>t one <hi>Artignan</hi> and <hi>Be<U+017F>mau,</hi> who complain'd
that they had done the <U+017F>ame thing all their lives,
without any advancement more than what they were
at fir<U+017F>t; and indeed they made but a very <U+017F>orry fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
and were in <U+017F>uch a pitiful condition for the
mo<U+017F>t part, they knew not where to get a Penny
to buy a Dinner: This oblig'd them to think of
retiring from the Court; but as they were of the
furthe<U+017F>t part of <hi>Ga<U+017F>cogne,</hi> and that they had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to undertake <U+017F>o long a Journey, they try'd all
ways po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to rai<U+017F>e a little money, but all People
were <U+017F>o kind to them as to refu<U+017F>e them: for if they
had got together but ten Pi<U+017F>toles, we <U+017F>hould never have
<U+017F>een one of them Commander of the fir<U+017F>t Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Grand Mu<U+017F>queteers, nor the other with an
E<U+017F>tate of Three Millions of Livres, as he is at this
time: However, all they could <U+017F>ay was not capable
to di<U+017F>hearten me from following his Eminence to
the Frontiers. The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> went the
<U+017F>ame time with the King, and looking a little di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully
at me, I <U+017F>ent him word by one of my
Friends, that if he was not pleas'd, he had nothing
to do but to tell me <U+017F>o. He return'd again, that I
did not know my <U+017F>elf, but he <U+017F>hould find a time to
make me do it. This was a Bravade which I laught
at, and other People laught as well as I; for tho he
was a Prince, he ought not to have carried it <U+017F>o
high; and <U+017F>everal as good as he, and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of
his own Family too, had not thought it below them
to mea<U+017F>ure their Sword with a Gentleman; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
my Friend advis'd me to have a care of my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57806:95"/>
<U+017F>elf, but I <U+017F>lighted it, thinking a Prince of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was incapable of a ba<U+017F>e action; but tho<U+017F>e who
I thus gave my opinion to, told me, that he who
had done his be<U+017F>t to take me off when I was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
might very well be thought to attempt it now
I was at liberty: However, I was not deceiv'd in
him, and whatever his endeavours had been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
him<U+017F>elf, he never attempted any of tho<U+017F>e
ways they <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect: For I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
that any private Ambu<U+017F>cade, had been laid at
any time for me; and tho I did attribute to him an
accident which happen'd to me a few days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
yet I ought always to <U+017F>ay for the honour of
the Per<U+017F>on I had to do withal, that he fairly gave
me time to draw my Sword; and if I was roughly
handl'd, it was by the Fortune of the fight, and not
a private a<U+017F><U+017F>ault.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Breaute</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
who was a Man brave enough, and a very hand<U+017F>om
Per<U+017F>on, but of a behaviour <U+017F>o extraordinary in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that it render'd all the other good Qualities he
had, not worth taking notice of: He had this ill
temper by inheritance, from the Marquis <hi>de Breaute</hi>
his near Relation, who had <U+017F>o good an opinion of
him<U+017F>elf, that he challeng'd five and twenty
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> to fight them all one after another;
but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Grobendonc</hi> Governour of <hi>Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc</hi>
laughing at his in<U+017F>olence, told him, that he
<U+017F>hould have enough of one; and to make it good,
added, that he <U+017F>hould bring four and twenty <hi>French</hi>
men along with him, and he would <U+017F>end five and
twenty <hi>Spaniards</hi> to meet them. <hi>Breaute</hi> enrag'd
with this an<U+017F>wer, askt leave of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
under whom he <U+017F>erv'd, to accept of the Challenge,
and having obtain'd it, he manag'd the fight <U+017F>o unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57806:96"/>
that he was kill'd upon the <U+017F>pot, and two and
twenty of his Men, and the two other cry'd for
Quarter, who being brought Pri<U+017F>oners to <hi>Boleduc,
Grobendonc</hi> immediately hang'd them, which action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>h'd
his honour, and <U+017F>ullied the Victory his Party
had obtain'd; but he gave this rea<U+017F>on for it, That all
the Combatants had <U+017F>worn to maintain the fight to
the la<U+017F>t drop of their Blood rather than to demand
quarter, and 'twas but ju<U+017F>t that the<U+017F>e who broke
their word, <U+017F>hould expiate the perjury with their
lives, for a <U+017F>atisfaction to their Companions that
perform'd their vow to the la<U+017F>t. <hi>Breaute,</hi> tho as you
<U+017F>ee, he had no great cau<U+017F>e to brag of this action of
his Kin<U+017F>man, yet he had the <U+017F>tory always in his
mouth, and at every turn would repeat it, to <U+017F>how
that his Family had been always men of Courage;
and to make him<U+017F>elf more ridiculous, he would
bring it out, that if <hi>Grobendonc</hi>'s Men had had to do
with him, they <U+017F>hould not have come off <U+017F>o well.
I have heard him tell this <U+017F>tory very often, which
has made very good <U+017F>port to all the Company: But
having been taught by experience, that we <U+017F>hould
not always laugh at the follies of others, I was the
only Per<U+017F>on that kept my Countenance at the<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and con<U+017F>equently was furthe<U+017F>t off from the
thoughts of a Quarrel; and yet when I lea<U+017F>t thought
of it, I was oblig'd to fight him, upon pretence
that I had been as rude with him as the re<U+017F>t. My
honour would not permit me to refu<U+017F>e him, but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
there was <U+017F>omething more in the matter, and
being willing to know the bottom of it, I told him
that if he had no other cau<U+017F>e to quarrel with me than
that, he might put up his Sword again, for I had
never <U+017F>o much as dreamt of it; and that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were with me would give me the <U+017F>ame
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57806:96"/>
<U+017F>atisfaction, that I did not <U+017F>ay this out of fear, I
believ'd I had given proofs enough of my courage
in <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions, not to have it call'd in que<U+017F>tion
at <U+017F>uch a time: while I was <U+017F>aying this I kept at
Swords length off, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to have avoided fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But he de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing my ju<U+017F>tification, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excited on <U+017F>ome other account, threw him<U+017F>elf
upon me in a <U+017F>trange fury, and wounded me in the
<U+017F>ide. I became raging mad at the <U+017F>ight of the blood,
and making a de<U+017F>perate thru<U+017F>t, I ran my Sword to
the Hilt thro his Thigh, but he pre<U+017F>ently reveng'd
him<U+017F>elf, for at the next pa<U+017F>s he ran me quite through
the Body, upon which I dropt immediately, and he
di<U+017F>arm'd me.</p>
            <p>I had a <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, that this was done by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by what I heard the next Morning; for they
told me, that he carried my Sword to that Prince,
and that for joy of the Victory they made <U+017F>uch a
Debauche of it, that all the Company that were there,
were <U+017F>ent home in a lamentable pickle, and the Count
him<U+017F>elf made no <U+017F>cruple to own the fact: 'Twas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
di<U+017F>honorable for him to tell all the world thus,
that he could not fight but by Proxy, he had a name
bad enough already, after the manner that he liv'd
and treated his Lady, he needed not have taken <U+017F>uch
pains to encrea<U+017F>e it. In <U+017F>hort, he liv'd more like a
Bully than a Prince, which was the cau<U+017F>e that he
treated his Lady after <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort as I hinted but now:
That 'twas reported that he us'd to beat her, I know
not whether this was true at the bottom, or that his
being Brother to the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> who had kill'd
his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with ill u<U+017F>age, got him this Reputation:
However 'twas, this is certain, that this Lady, who
was a rich Heire<U+017F>s, not being able to bear his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57806:97"/>
retir'd to a Mona<U+017F>tery, where <U+017F>he remains to
this day.</p>
            <p>My wound was too great to be <U+017F>oon cur'd, my
Longs having been pierc'd quite through; and you
could not hold a Candle to the Orifice, but the
wind that came from it would blow out the light.
The Cardinal, who hated the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> and
his Family, becau<U+017F>e they were always again<U+017F>t him,
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected as well as I that this came from him, and
declar'd him<U+017F>elf openly in my favour; and told pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
that if he could get <hi>Breaute</hi> into his hands,
who now ab<U+017F>conded, he would teach him how to
quarrel in cold blood: Nor did he <U+017F>top there, but
to vex the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> more than for any
kindne<U+017F>s he had for me, he <U+017F>ent me his own Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and be<U+017F>ides that a Bag with about five hundred
Crowns: This was <U+017F>o unu<U+017F>ual a thing with him, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Money, and above all to a man that was
neither one of his Family, nor indeed one of his
Party, that every body was <U+017F>urpris'd, and <U+017F>o was I
my <U+017F>elf, and indeed could hardly tell what to think
of it, till <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> came to <U+017F>ee me, and inform'd
me that the Cardinal had <U+017F>ent for him, and told
him, that as <U+017F>oon as the Campaign was over he
would have him take <U+017F>ome of his Friends with him
down to his hou<U+017F>e, and do all they could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
affront that Count; and that his Eminence under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
I <U+017F>hould quickly be cur'd, would have me be
of the Party; and that he would certainly <U+017F>peak to
me of it, as <U+017F>oon as ever I was abroad again. In
<U+017F>hort, being gone to thank his Eminence after I was
well again for his goodne<U+017F>s to me, he told me, he
<U+017F>hould be very glad to have me go upon that de<U+017F>ign,
and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>twas he told me how the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de la
Ferte</hi> had juggl'd with me, when he pretended to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57806:97"/>
get a Regiment for me. I thought that this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
proceeded from <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>content the Cardinal
had with him; indeed they <U+017F>aid then that his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion that he was not true to
him, and that tho the Mare<U+017F>chal us'd to <U+017F>ay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
that he never had chang'd his Coat; 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they were not <U+017F>o good as their words to him
in what they promis'd him, rather than want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
on his part.</p>
            <p>The Campaign being ended, <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> took
four choice Lads of his own Company with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,
whom he di<U+017F>guis'd like <hi>Valets,</hi> that his de<U+017F>ign
might not be known; and we went all of us to his
hou<U+017F>e, where there came a Gentleman of <hi>Perigor,</hi>
that was a Captain in the <U+017F>ame Regiment. By the
way he receiv'd a Letter from his Collonel, who was
the Count <hi>de Tonecharante,</hi> by which he de<U+017F>ir'd him
very civilly indeed, to give a di<U+017F>charge to a certain
Souldier of his Company: It unluckily happen'd, that
the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger came in while he was at Table, and the
heat of the Wine adding <U+017F>omething to his ugly humor,
which was bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat the Count <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> bu<U+017F>ied him<U+017F>elf with
that he had nothing to do withal; that for his part
he would do nothing in it, and if the Collonel did
not like it he might take his cour<U+017F>e. Seeing
him di<U+017F>turb'd, we ask'd him what was the matter,
tho he had <U+017F>poke enough already to make us gue<U+017F>s
what it was; but he <U+017F>how'd us the Letter, which
was in the mode<U+017F>te<U+017F>t terms that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that not being able to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o bruti<U+017F>h, I
told him he was to blame to give <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer to
it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at I had not the honour to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
known to Count <hi>de Tonecharante,</hi> but he
mu<U+017F>t give me leave to tell him, 'twas not u<U+017F>ual to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57806:98"/>
deal <U+017F>o by ones Collonel, who was <U+017F>o generous to
reque<U+017F>t a thing of him which he could have done
without him; that 'twas what the Captains could
not have done without the Collonel; and if the
Collonel cho<U+017F>e to go the contrary way, 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
that they were unwilling to u<U+017F>e their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in prejudice of the Captains; that this refu<U+017F>al
would but put him upon giving the Souldier his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>s
without him, and that would not be all nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for he would eternally lo<U+017F>e his friend<U+017F>hip,
which he ought to pre<U+017F>erve above all things; that
'twas the practice always at Court, as indeed it
ought to be every where, that the Captains did all
that in them lay to keep a good under<U+017F>tanding with
the <U+017F>uperior Officers; that I <U+017F>poke as his Friend, and
pray'd him to con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e things a little; and tho
he had an E<U+017F>tate, and <U+017F>o did not value preferment,
yet he <U+017F>hould be careful to pre<U+017F>erve his Reputation;
that infallibly Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> would be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd,
and I be<U+017F>ought him but to think of that a
little.</p>
            <p>I know not how he did to have patience while I
<U+017F>aid all this; however, 'twas all one, he would have
it, that 'twas the Captains Office to give a di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s to
a Souldier, and that the Collonel had nothing to do
with it: And growing very high becau<U+017F>e I was not
of his Opinion, he had <U+017F>o little manners as to give
me the Lye in his own Hou<U+017F>e; for we were got to
<hi>Planches</hi> near <hi>D' Evreux,</hi> which was not above Six
or Seven Leagues from <hi>Rufflais,</hi> and belong'd to him.
He had no <U+017F>ooner let <U+017F>lip the Word, but I catcht
up a Plate and threw it at his head, and the Wine
having put Courage into him, he clos'd in wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me,
tho' three or four Per<U+017F>ons who were at the Table
with us got in between us; by good fortune for us
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57806:98"/>
both we had neither of us our Swords on, <U+017F>o our fight
being but with our Fi<U+017F>ts, 'twas not likely to be very
Bloody; however, we were <U+017F>o warm that 'twas
not without great difficulty that they parted us.
There was no great likelihood after this that we <U+017F>hould
proceed on our Journey, <U+017F>o I order'd my Men to <U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
my Hor<U+017F>e; the Gentlemen who were there did
all they could to accommodate matters: But he
<U+017F>tood off, and would do nothing; <U+017F>o I came away,
and being pretty late I could reach but to <hi>Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i</hi> that
Night, which was in the Road to <hi>Paris.</hi> Nothing
would <U+017F>erve him but he would follow me, that he
would; but his Friends, who <U+017F>aw I <U+017F>aid nothing but
what was true, prevented him, that he might <U+017F>ettle
his brains. The next morning 'twas quite another
thing, and he told the Gentlemen that I left with
him, that he was extreamly concern'd for what had
happen'd, and that they ought to have kept me, and
that he would go and overtake me to ask my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
They were all very glad to hear him talk af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
this manner, and having <U+017F>addl'd their Hor<U+017F>es,
they came all away with him a gallop. They came
up with me at <hi>Mantes</hi> where I baited, for I had no
occa<U+017F>ion to be in any ha<U+017F>te; when I <U+017F>aw them, and
that their Hor<U+017F>es were all in a foam, I wonder'd
what <U+017F>hould be the matter they were in <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te,
and pre<U+017F>ently imagining it was to affront me. I
plac'd my <U+017F>elf at the top of the Stairs in a po<U+017F>ture to
receive them with a Pi<U+017F>tol in each hand: But <hi>De<U+017F>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
advancing before them, and offering me his
hand in token of friend<U+017F>hip, he pray'd me to forget
all that was pa<U+017F>t, telling me, that I knew well
enough when a man's in drink he is not ma<U+017F>ter of
his rea<U+017F>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57806:99"/>
I could not find in my heart to be angry, hearing
him talk at this rate, for be<U+017F>ides that, I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
he had acted him<U+017F>elf in that which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd;
I had a mind al<U+017F>o to obey the Cardinal, by
who<U+017F>e order, as I have mention'd, I undertook
this Journey: So I went back again with him, after
we had embrac'd each other, and <U+017F>taying two days
at <hi>Planches,</hi> we came at la<U+017F>t to <hi>Rufflais,</hi> where we
under<U+017F>tood that the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was at home
at his Ca<U+017F>tle. I courted <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> to go abroad that
very day, but he pretended he was not well; <U+017F>o I
took my Fu<U+017F>il, and with only my own Servants,
went out quite to the grounds belonging to the
Count <hi>de Harcourt;</hi> there was no game <U+017F>tirring, but
going on more with a de<U+017F>ign to be <U+017F>een than to kill
any thing, I <U+017F>hot up in the air; one of the Count's
Servants came out immediately to <U+017F>ee who 'twas,
he knew me a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw me, and run in
to carry the news to his Ma<U+017F>ter: The Count under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
I had but two men with me, <U+017F>ent out all
his men, but took care to <U+017F>tay behind him<U+017F>elf:
When I <U+017F>aw I was like to engage nothing but a Mob
made up of Plowmen and Footmen, and that I
was in a fair way to be devour'd, I thought it was my
be<U+017F>t way to retreat; they per<U+017F>ued me clo<U+017F>e, but being
well mounted I got ground of them, till I came to a
lane that was ju<U+017F>t in the road: The<U+017F>e fellows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>u'd
me <U+017F>till, and made <U+017F>everal <U+017F>hot at me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance;
but I e<U+017F>cap'd a greater danger pre<U+017F>ently after,
for I was not gone fifty paces in the lane, when I
received a whole volley of <U+017F>hot from another <U+017F>ide,
at which, thank God, I was more afraid than
hurt, and not without cau<U+017F>e, for I had three <U+017F>hots in
my Hat, and two in my Cloaths; ju<U+017F>t at this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I di<U+017F>cover'd <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> with his Souldiers, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57806:99"/>
not doubting but they were going to <U+017F>et upon me, I
had certainly kill'd him, if he had not cry'd out, and
told me, that he did not think he had <U+017F>hot at me,
but at the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s men: I was <U+017F>uch a
Coxcomb to be per<U+017F>waded into this; and having
told them, that <U+017F>ince it was <U+017F>o, we had nothing to
do now but to fall upon them, they charg'd again,
and we turn'd upon them, and per<U+017F>u'd them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
return'd to <hi>Rufflais,</hi> they all made a great <U+017F>tir
about the danger I had been in, and he askt my
pardon, with a great many words to convince me,
that all that had happen'd was by accident; but my
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> who it <U+017F>eems had at that time
more wit than I, told me, as he was undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing me,
that I <U+017F>hould not tru<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf there, and that I was
with a man that made a practice of <U+017F>uch kind of
Villanies; for a Countryman thereabouts had told
him, that he had kill'd two or three <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely from
behind a Hedge; and that <U+017F>ince I had had a quarrel
with him, 'twould be my be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to get away
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I could: This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e made me begin to
recollect, what a Blockhead I had been to beleive
all he had <U+017F>aid to me, and re<U+017F>olv'd to leave a man
with whom there was <U+017F>o little <U+017F>afety; however I
wanted an excu<U+017F>e to come away, and having <U+017F>ent
one of my men to <hi>Brione,</hi> to <U+017F>ee if there was any
Letters for me, I gave him one which I had wrote
my <U+017F>elf, wherein 'twas mentioned, that I was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
immediately at <hi>Paris,</hi> about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of
con<U+017F>equence; <U+017F>o I took my leave of this Traytor,
without taking notice of any thing; and it
plea<U+017F>ing God, that I <U+017F>hould not continue long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
whether my <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion was well or ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it happen'd that a Souldier whom my <hi>Valet</hi>
had carry'd to drink with him, on purpo<U+017F>e to pump
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57806:100"/>
him, told him, that I was much in the right of it to
go away, for I had <U+017F>cap'd a <U+017F>cowring; he could not
get a word more out of him, tho he pre<U+017F>t him to
<U+017F>peak pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iner; but as this was enough to make me
judge of the per<U+017F>on, I was no <U+017F>ooner on Hor<U+017F>eback,
but I told him, I <U+017F>hould remember him as long as I
liv'd, and that at another time I would tell him
more; he <U+017F>tood mute at the<U+017F>e words, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him time to ju<U+017F>tifie him<U+017F>elf, I clapt Spurs to
my Hor<U+017F>e, and got <U+017F>o far from him, that if he had
<U+017F>aid any thing, 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to hear
him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time all that I had told him came to
pa<U+017F>s. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> having been inform'd
of his rudene<U+017F>s, gave the di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s to the Souldier
without him, and not content with giving him this
affront, he re<U+017F>olv'd to have him ca<U+017F>heer'd, the fir<U+017F>t
minute he could get an opportunity: The thing was
difficult to be done at that time, it being not then
as 'tis now, that the Collonels were ab<U+017F>olute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters
of their Regiments; for on the other hand, the
King was in want of Officers, and accordingly was
more chary of them, than it has been <U+017F>ince: Indeed
they did not come in <U+017F>uch crouds for Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ions in
tho<U+017F>e days, nor were not <U+017F>o prodigal either of their
E<U+017F>tates, or of their Lives; <U+017F>o that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charante,</hi>
tho he had re<U+017F>olv'd to do his utmo<U+017F>t to
throw him out, found it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to bring it to
pa<U+017F>s, till the Peace of the <hi>Pyrennes;</hi> but now the
time being come, that there was not <U+017F>o much need
of Souldiers, and the King making a reform among
his Troops, he manag'd it <U+017F>o, that he got his name
into the Li<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e that were to be disbanded,
tho it was a little out of the order, for he was the
fifth or <U+017F>ixth Captain of the Regiment, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57806:100"/>
us'd to begin at the younge<U+017F>t: <hi>De<U+017F>planches</hi> could
not bear this affront without making his complaint,
which the Count <hi>de Toncherante</hi> had fore<U+017F>een, and
had been beforehand with him, having waited upon
the King, and given him a large account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which was not only bruti<U+017F>h, but <U+017F>omething
wor<U+017F>e, for he was grown to that height, that <U+017F>acred
things were not free from his violence when he was
in drink, and he would <U+017F>peak either of God or the
the King, in the <U+017F>ame terms, as he did the wor<U+017F>t of
his Enemies.</p>
            <p>For all this he had the Impudence to go to the
King, and having pleaded the merit of his <U+017F>ervice,
how he had been <U+017F>everal years in the Army, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept his Company full, and had never been
charg'd with any failure of his duty; that he had an
E<U+017F>tate of his own, and did not <U+017F>erve meerly for his
Pay, and a thou<U+017F>and things to the <U+017F>ame effect. The
King, after he had given him Audience with a great
deal of patience, an<U+017F>wer'd him coldly, that he
knew all this as well as him<U+017F>elf, and that <U+017F>ince he
had been <U+017F>o faithful to him, he had done this to
give him lei<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>erve God, as regularly as he had
<U+017F>erv'd him; and tho he did not expect him to be a
Saint, yet he would not have him be impious; that
he had been inform'd from very good hands, that
he had pi<U+017F>t in the Holy Water Pot, in contempt of
that <U+017F>acred Element, and of all Religion; that he
did not know how it came to pa<U+017F>s he was not pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for it; and but that he under<U+017F>tood at the <U+017F>ame
time he was in drink, he <U+017F>hould perhaps have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
coming to him el<U+017F>e. <hi>De<U+017F>planches,</hi> who knew
in his heart, the King had tax'd him with nothing
but what was true, in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted no more upon it, but
went out with <U+017F>hame enough, and retir'd him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57806:101"/>
altogether to the Country, and never <U+017F>tirr'd out of it
but once, that he came to <hi>Paris</hi> to marry the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Brillac,</hi> Councellor of the great
Chamber; but this Lady neither, being not able to
cure him of his Debauchery, he kill'd him<U+017F>elf with
drinking in about five or <U+017F>ix years.</p>
            <p>I had re<U+017F>olv'd at my la<U+017F>t parting with him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<U+017F>atisfaction from him for the Treachery he
had us'd towards me; but having given the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
an account of the whole matter, he prohibited
me <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly, that I dur<U+017F>t not think of it: In the
mean time he <U+017F>ent me to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> upon a <U+017F>ecret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
which I mu<U+017F>t not reveal, and in which I could
not <U+017F>ucceed. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was <U+017F>till at
the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Court, and it happen'd while I was
there, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Beauvais</hi> was kill'd; he
was Father to the Counte<U+017F>s <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons,</hi> and Ma<U+017F>ter
of the Hor<U+017F>e to the Prince; he was a Man of
Courage, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad too good a conceit of him<U+017F>elf,
which was the cau<U+017F>e of his misfortune; for as he
was coming down from the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lodging,
he met a Gentleman coming up, and takes him by the
arm at the top of the <U+017F>tairs with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch <U+017F>orce, that he
threw him down, and walkt over him him<U+017F>elf.
The Gentleman would not <U+017F>o much as ask him the
meaning of it then, from the re<U+017F>pect he ow'd to
the Place; but going out immediately, he gets
a Friend, and <U+017F>ends him to <hi>Beauvais</hi> to demand
<U+017F>atisfaction of him for this affront. <hi>Beauvais</hi> was
not a man that us'd to refu<U+017F>e any body, <U+017F>o having
brought a Friend with him to be his Second, they
fought it out two and two of a <U+017F>ide; one of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
was quite kill'd upon the place, but he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better for this <U+017F>hort liv'd advantage, for he
receiv'd a Pi<U+017F>tol Bullet in his head, of which he dy'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57806:101"/>
in a few days. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being inform'd
of this accident, went to <U+017F>ee him before he dy'd;
and as he <U+017F>aw there was no hopes of his life, he told
him, that <U+017F>eeing the condition he was in, he ought
to leave all other thoughts but tho<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>oul;
that he had kept a certain Lady a long time, by
whom he had had <U+017F>everal Children, (one of which
was the pre<U+017F>ent Counte<U+017F>s <hi>de Soi<U+017F><U+017F>ons)</hi> but was never
marry'd to her; that he advis'd him to di<U+017F>charge
his con<U+017F>cience, which he might do by making her
his Wife; that he knew not how to <U+017F>how his
friend<U+017F>hip more to him, than by advi<U+017F>ing him for
his good; and that if he would be rul'd by him, he
would go and <U+017F>end for a Prie<U+017F>t immediately. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vais</hi>
had lo<U+017F>t all his <U+017F>ences, and had not <U+017F>poke a
word in four and twenty hours; but the Prince's
voice, or rather the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he made to him,
reviving him: <hi>No, my Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, rai<U+017F>ing his
voice, <hi>I <U+017F>hall not be rul'd by you, I never promis'd
her any thing, nor I don't <U+017F>ee, that I am oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any thing.</hi> The Prince reply'd, that he knew
that be<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf indeed, and that what he
<U+017F>poke was upon the common report that <U+017F>pread it
about <U+017F>o; to which the other having again an<U+017F>wer'd
the <U+017F>ame thing, he left him to dye in quiet.</p>
            <p>All this while the War continu'd with great fury,
not only on the Frontiers with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
in the heart of the Kingdom; and the weakne<U+017F>s

Authority, and the pre<U+017F>ent form of Government in
the Kingdom: I don't pretend to reflect, in <U+017F>aying
this, upon what the Parliament did, but upon the

               </gap>ty Tyrannies they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
in their own limits. Indeed they had in
every Province two or three of the<U+017F>e little Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for <U+017F>uch they were in effect, for the Kings
orders were but laught at among them, if they
were not agreeable to their de<U+017F>igns. This was
a great trouble to the Cardinal, but more to the
King, who had a thou<U+017F>and times more courage,
and who was more nearly toucht in the<U+017F>e practices
than others; but 'twas his time to wink at all this,
and as young as he was, he was extraordinary poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and cho<U+017F>e rather not to reform an abu<U+017F>e, tho
he knew it to be <U+017F>o, than to let it appear that it was
too great for him to attempt, in <U+017F>uch an uncertain
condition as things then <U+017F>tood. In the mean time,
never was there <U+017F>uch a prank play'd as was done now,
by a certain Coxcomb that had married one of my
Relations, and in who<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>e I had like to have been
involv'd. This Man call'd him<U+017F>elf the Marqui<U+017F>s
<hi>de Pran<U+017F>ac,</hi> he was a huge hulky fellow of him<U+017F>elf, but
his pride <U+017F>well'd him beyond all dimen<U+017F>ions; if he
had any Nobility in his blood, 'twas only that he
was Grand<U+017F>on to a Pre<U+017F>ident of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> but
<U+017F>ince I am fallen upon his Genealogy, I mu<U+017F>t give
you a <U+017F>hort hi<U+017F>tory of his Great Grand-father. He
kept a Brandy-<U+017F>hop at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and made a figure
<U+017F>o mean, that no body reckon'd him to be worth
above two thou<U+017F>and Franks. In <U+017F>hort, he not only
dwelt in a little na<U+017F>ty hou<U+017F>e, but bought and <U+017F>old
privately in other Peoples names. He had but one
only Son, who he had bred up well enough and
above what 'twas thought he could afford; for not
intending to make him a Brandy Merchant, he <U+017F>ent
him to the Univer<U+017F>ity. This young fellow was a
meer <hi>Thomas Diaforus,</hi> that is ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch another Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,

to <U+017F>ee one day at Church, one of
the Pre<U+017F>idents Daughters, and falls
de<U+017F>perately in love with her, in<U+017F>omuch, that but one

His Father, who as I <U+017F>aid, had no more Children,
and knew him<U+017F>elf to be richer than anybody thought,
was almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tracted to <U+017F>ee him in <U+017F>uch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And after a deal of pother to know what ail'd
him, at la<U+017F>t with much ado got the Secret out of

with that away he goes to her Father, and demands
her of him for his Son. The Pre<U+017F>ident thought the
little old fellow was mad, and askt him who he was,
that he <U+017F>hould come with <U+017F>uch a compliment to him;
and gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing at the man by the figure he made,
which was very indifferent, he was going to bid his
Footmen kick him down Stairs. The little man,
not at all daunted at the <U+017F>cornful treatment of the
Pre<U+017F>ident, and to come to the point, askt him how
much he could give his Daughter, for let it be as
much as it would, he would give his Son three
times as much in ready Money, be<U+017F>ides the refu<U+017F>al
of <U+017F>uch a place as his was, which he had <U+017F>ecur'd for
him when he <U+017F>hould be capable to manage it. The
Pre<U+017F>ident hearing him talk at this rate, could not
tell what to make of it; and <U+017F>eeing nothing in him
that lookt as if he were craz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

treat him civilly, but to ask him as civilly, if he was
able to make good what he talk'd of. The old man
told him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he was not very likely to be deceiv'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
his Money would not go, for 'twas all in <hi><U+017F>pecie;</hi>

and taking him home with him, he <U+017F>how'd him a
great Iron Che<U+017F>t, and in it above eight hundred
thou<U+017F>and Franks all in Gold.</p>
            <p>The Match was <U+017F>oon made up after <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ight
as this, and from this Conjunction <U+017F>prung the Father
of our Coxcomb; I leave any one to judge whether
I have done him wrong in giving him <U+017F>uch a Title,
when they have heard his Story. Fir<U+017F>t, tho he
knew his own Original well enough, yet his Coach
would not plea<U+017F>e him unle<U+017F>s it was adorn'd with a
great many Coats of Arms; <U+017F>o without any regard
to the Coat that his Grand-father had taken up, and
which <U+017F>erv'd his Father well enough, he picks out
<U+017F>uch Coats as he lik'd be<U+017F>t, and orders the Herald to
quarter them with his own, and to divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<U+017F>ixteen quarters, the lea<U+017F>t of which belong'd to
<U+017F>ome Prince or other, and withal gives a mo<U+017F>t glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Livery, that made all the Town <U+017F>tare at him.
The City of <hi>Paris,</hi> like other great Cities, never
wants Sharpers, who live by their wits, at the price
of other peoples follies. One of the<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erving our
Gallant, and finding him ruuning <U+017F>tark mad after the
vanity of Grandeur, pre<U+017F>ents him with a very formal
Genealogy, by which he made it out as clear as the
Sun, that he was de<U+017F>cended in a direct male-line
from the Family <hi>De Dreux,</hi> a younger branch of the
Blood Royal; and that as <U+017F>uch, he had a right to bear
in his fir<U+017F>t and fourth quarter the arms of <hi>France,</hi> and
in the <U+017F>econd and third tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Dreux:</hi> He was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd
with his di<U+017F>covery, and I happening to be
then at his Hou<U+017F>e, he askt me what I thought of it:
I found he was too well pleas'd with it for me to
contradict it, for I had no mind to di<U+017F>oblige him:
So I having given my opinion in his own <U+017F>ence, I
made him <U+017F>o compleat a Fool, as that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

<U+017F>ends for his Coach-maker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, be<U+017F>peaks a new
rich Coach, giving him the Arms that he would
have <U+017F>et upon it; he chang'd al<U+017F>o his Plate, and
made the <U+017F>ame Coat of Arms be engraven upon
that; and to omit nothing that might add to the
Lu<U+017F>tre of his Family, in <U+017F>ome Writings he had
making, he caus'd him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>til'd, <hi>The mo<U+017F>t
Serene Prince L. ... de Dreux,</hi> adding however
the Surname of <hi>Rhedon,</hi> which was his true name,
but which he intended to drop in proce<U+017F>s of time,
or to attribute it to <U+017F>ome accidental imaginary entail,
as a great many other Families in <hi>France</hi> do; who, if
they were to tell the truth, would be very much at
a lo<U+017F>s to make out their Original.</p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides this, the new Marqui<U+017F>s <hi>de Pran<U+017F>ac</hi> chang'd
his Livery again, and took up the <U+017F>ame with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoi<U+017F>elle
<hi>de Montpen<U+017F>ier</hi>'s, the Lining only excepted,
one being green, and the other blue; and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
his Attendants with four Pages and <U+017F>ome Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
he went beyond <U+017F>everal Princes in his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page:
He took care in all his greatne<U+017F>s not to forget
a Canopy of State, and wanting nothing but the
name of his Highne<U+017F>s to make him a compleat
Prince, <U+017F>ince he now began to beleive him<U+017F>elf to be
really one; I was the fir<U+017F>t, that to carry on the je<U+017F>t,
be<U+017F>towed that title upon him; he took this <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
kindly of me, that I mu<U+017F>t eat always at his
own Table, and if I would beleive him, he could
not part with me. He that fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>et him up for a
Prince, was al<U+017F>o very liberally rewarded, and being
re<U+017F>olv'd to outdo me, made one addition more to his
title, and <U+017F>til'd him his Royal Highne<U+017F>s, telling him,
that <U+017F>ince he was de<U+017F>cended from <U+017F>o many Kings, he
did not <U+017F>ee any rea<U+017F>on, why he <U+017F>hould content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
with the bare title of his Serenity. Our Marquis
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57806:104"/>
thought this very rational, and giving his a<U+017F><U+017F>ent by
nodding of his wi<U+017F>e head, he <U+017F>how'd how well pleas'd
he was with it; but being re<U+017F>olv'd to manage this
humour, I began a little to contradict this, and his
Highne<U+017F>s was to be Judge between us; I told him
then, that was the way to call the re<U+017F>t of his Titles
in que<U+017F>tion, to give him one that did not belong to
him; that none but the immediate Children of
Kings took this Title upon them, and that was but
lately neither, and that the very next remove was
that of Serenity, as in the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the
Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> his Brother, to mention no more:
This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e allay'd a little the vanity of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<hi>de Pran<U+017F>ac.</hi> But the other Gentleman, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
him<U+017F>elf further, told him, that the Title of
Royal Highne<U+017F>s was well enough, for the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> had a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd it; I reply'd, that he never
knew any body give it him but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gazetteers;
and if it was due to the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Orange,</hi> as <U+017F>he
was a Daughter, and Si<U+017F>ter of a King of <hi>England,</hi>
it did not follow, that her Husband <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>til'd
<U+017F>o upon that account; that the Princes of the Blood
Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as well as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>France,</hi> never
lo<U+017F>t their quality, tho they did marry Husbands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to them<U+017F>elves, and therefore 'twas a mi<U+017F>take
of his, to give the Husband the Title, which was
due only to the Wi<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>His Highne<U+017F>s of <hi>Pran<U+017F>ac</hi> was pleas'd to think me
in the right, and to be content with the character
that was his due, <U+017F>o he told us with a very grave,
tho a very fooli<U+017F>h manner, that time would bring
every thing to pa<U+017F>s. All People were amaz'd to <U+017F>ee
him <U+017F>et up <U+017F>uch an E<U+017F>chutcheon, and to appear in
<U+017F>uch an Equipage: But he having not an E<U+017F>tate to
an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>uch a prodigious expence, it <U+017F>hrunk his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57806:104"/>
Revenue, <U+017F>o that to le<U+017F><U+017F>en his charge he was fain to
retire into the Country, till his Exchequer <U+017F>hould
be in a condition again to <U+017F>upport his Pageantry.</p>
            <p>This piece of Fopery pa<U+017F>t well enough <U+017F>o long as
the War held, but when the Court, (the Peace being
<U+017F>ettled) had lei<U+017F>ure to look into civil affairs, the King
gave order to the Procurator General of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to enquire, how the Marquis <hi>de Pran<U+017F>ac</hi> came to
be a Prince of the Blood: Whereupon the Procurator
General goes with his Officers to make him a vi<U+017F>it,
and finding how the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tood, he caus'd them to
break in pieces all the Coaches where the <hi>Flower de
Lis</hi> were quarter'd in the E<U+017F>cutcheons, and calling
for his Plate, they caus'd that al<U+017F>o to be bruis'd,
and the Arms to be beaten out; be<U+017F>ides they gave
him a Summons, to an<U+017F>wer to a Complaint which
was pre<U+017F>ented to the Parliament upon this <U+017F>ubject.
Never was man <U+017F>o perplext as his Highne<U+017F>s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
upon this occa<U+017F>ion; he <U+017F>ent for him that had
wheedled him up in this fancy, but he knew well
enough, 'twas no time for him to be <U+017F>een; then he
<U+017F>ent for me, and I went, for I had a mind to <U+017F>ee
how he carry'd it under his mortification. Really
the man de<U+017F>erv'd Pity rather than Envy; for he was
<U+017F>o great a Fool, that he would <U+017F>till be call'd his
Highne<U+017F>s; for having fail'd in <U+017F>howing him that
re<U+017F>pect, he told me with a great deal of gravity,
that I <U+017F>hould have a care of being too familiar
with him; that his Cau<U+017F>e was not yet lo<U+017F>t, and
that before long he might be in a condition to
make me repent affronting a Prince of the Blood:
But he abated much of his Pride <U+017F>hortly after, when
the Procurator General, who pro<U+017F>ecuted him vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly,
condemn'd him in a Fine of fifty thou<U+017F>and
Crowns, and declar'd him and his Po<U+017F>terity unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57806:105"/>
of the Priviledge of the Nobility; and <U+017F>everal
other clau<U+017F>es in the <U+017F>entence to degrade him of his
Honour. Be<U+017F>ides all this, the Lawyers advis'd him
to drop his preten<U+017F>ions, and with much ado prevail'd
with him to do it; but that which was wor<U+017F>t of all,
he was forc'd to draw up the <U+017F>urrender of his claim
him<U+017F>elf, no body caring to meddle in <U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s;
in which he <U+017F>et forth, that the man I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
and my <U+017F>elf, were the per<U+017F>ons who in<U+017F>inuated
into him, that he was a Prince of the Blood; and
that he, meaning no harm, verily beleiv'd it had
been <U+017F>o; but that <U+017F>ince it appear'd otherwi<U+017F>e, the
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>incerity oblig'd him to relinqui<U+017F>h the thoughts
of it; that he begg'd his Maje<U+017F>ty's Pardon, and
hop'd, that having not intended any way to offend
him, he would be pleas'd to extend his Royal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to him, and not pro<U+017F>ecute him with the utmo<U+017F>t
rigour. I was <U+017F>ummon'd to an<U+017F>wer upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition,
and my Friends thought I <U+017F>hould have
been <U+017F>ecur'd; but being examin'd, I made it appear,
that I was far from prompting him to that folly, and
only made my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>port at it; that 'twas not my
fault, if he had not more wit to take a thing <U+017F>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly,
which was <U+017F>poken only to banter him; that I
knew his Original too well to beleive it my <U+017F>elf; but
that in <U+017F>hort, 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to make a Fool a Wi<U+017F>e
Man let one do what one could: My Examination
did him more <U+017F>ervice than I had fore<U+017F>een, for there
being other circum<U+017F>tances, that made him appear a
very weak per<U+017F>on, the Parliament us'd him gently,
and he got clear with asking the Court's Pardon,
and paying a thou<U+017F>and Crowns Fine.</p>
            <p>After this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he was oblig'd to change his
Name and his Arms; as for his Name, he re<U+017F>um<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
his own, but for his Arms, 'twas four or five years
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57806:105"/>
before he could re<U+017F>olve upon it; <U+017F>o he bare upon
his Coach nothing but his own Cypher with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet,
and nothing at all upon his Plate; at la<U+017F>t he
gave for his Arms a <hi>Lyon Sable</hi> in a <hi>Field Or,</hi> but as
he could not forget the <hi>Flower de Lis,</hi> he put a great
many in the alliances which he quarter'd with his
own, which was as much as to tell the world, once
a Fool and always a Fool. After this, tho he was
three<U+017F>core and ten years of age, he thought him<U+017F>elf
young enough to fall in Love, and to begin his
Amours, he makes Love to Madam the Dutche<U+017F>s
<hi>de Saux,</hi> but in <U+017F>o very a re<U+017F>pectful manner, that he
never <U+017F>poke a word to her, but contented him<U+017F>elf to
go to the <hi>Fauxbourg Saint Germaine,</hi> where he <U+017F>tays all
the while the Ma<U+017F>s was celebrating at the Convent
<hi>des Minims,</hi> only to have the honour to <U+017F>ee her go by,
and returns the happie<U+017F>t Man in the world, if <U+017F>he
vouch<U+017F>af'd to take the Holy Water from his Hands,
and takes but <U+017F>o much notice of him, as to bow
when he gives it her. The Dutche<U+017F>s was a good
while before <U+017F>he imagin'd any thing, but <U+017F>ome body
having told her Husband, the Duke <hi>de Saux,</hi> he
was re<U+017F>olv'd to ob<U+017F>erve the humour him<U+017F>elf, which
having <U+017F>een, he order'd his Lady to look a little
favourably upon him; which put the good man <U+017F>o
be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elf, that if it continu'd a month or two
longer, he mu<U+017F>t certainly have been <U+017F>ent to a Mad-hou<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Becau<U+017F>e I would not break off this <U+017F>tory, I have
run on thro the tran<U+017F>actions of <U+017F>everal years, which
I mu<U+017F>t look back again to, for what relates to my
own affairs. I was pretty well with the Cardinal,
and tho I had not <U+017F>ucceeded in my Voyage to
<hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> he employ'd me again in a <U+017F>ecret bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
he had on foot on that <U+017F>ide, which was to get off
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57806:106"/>
the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> from the Intre<U+017F>ts of the Prince
<hi>de Conde,</hi> for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake he had <U+017F>acrific'd his fortune;
for had he continu'd in his duty, he had not fail'd
being made a Mare<U+017F>chal of <hi>France:</hi> Indeed there
was few men under<U+017F>tood military affairs better, nor
that was fitter for any great enterprize; and yet for
all this, the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> quarrell'd with him, for
not having punctually ob<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>ome Orders he
gave: The Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> excus'd him<U+017F>elf, and
<U+017F>how'd him how the occa<U+017F>ion requir'd him to make
<U+017F>ome little alterations. But the Prince, who was the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate<U+017F>t man alive, turning ha<U+017F>tily from him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the fire, would not hear him <U+017F>peak, but in a
fury, <hi>Ah</hi> Marcin, <U+017F>aid he, <hi>who would have thought, that
you would have us'd me as you do;</hi> repeating the <U+017F>ame
words over and over five or <U+017F>ix times with <U+017F>o much
heat, that he bit the Chimney-peice with his teeth
for madne<U+017F>s. <hi>Marcin,</hi> <U+017F>eeing what a rage he was in,
thought it his be<U+017F>t way to retire, for fear of <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wor<U+017F>e. The Cardinal was, by his Spies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
inform'd of this mi<U+017F>under<U+017F>tanding, which
was the occa<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>ending me on this Errand.
The Ri<U+017F>que was great in this adventure, for it had
been as much as my life had been worth, if I had
been di<U+017F>cover'd; but going for a Merchant of <hi>Leige,</hi>
I lodg'd in a private <U+017F>treet, and feigning my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ick
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I came into my Lodgings, I told my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
I had a Letter of great con<U+017F>equence to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to the Count <hi>de Marcin;</hi> I wrought <U+017F>o well
with my Ho<U+017F>t, that he offer'd me freely to go and
carry it to him for me. I charg'd him to deliver it
to his own hands, which he carefully perform'd.
The Count <hi>de Marcin,</hi> who gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing at the thing,
carry'd on the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, bad him take care of me, and
that if I wanted for any thing, he <U+017F>hould tell me, I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57806:106"/>
<U+017F>hould not <U+017F>cruple <U+017F>ending to him; that he could
not come to <U+017F>ee me till the next day, becau<U+017F>e he was
ju<U+017F>t taking Hor<U+017F>e to ride out of Town, but that he
would be with me at Eight a Clock in the morning
without fail. My Landlord, coming back with
this good news, did not que<U+017F>tion but I was at home,
but I had po<U+017F>ted my <U+017F>elf in Ambu<U+017F>cade, about ten
or a dozen doors off to <U+017F>ee, if in<U+017F>tead of an an<U+017F>wer,
he did not bring a Party of Souldiers with him to
apprehend me; and I <U+017F>tay'd out upon the <U+017F>cout, at
lea<U+017F>t an hour after I <U+017F>aw him come back; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coa<U+017F>t was clear I return'd home; he askt me
whence I came, who he had left in no condition to
go out, and if I intended to increa<U+017F>e my illne<U+017F>s. I
told him, that I had a mind to be at the Ma<U+017F>s, tho
I was <U+017F>o weak, I was hardly able to get back again.
This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e being over, he told me what Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Marcin</hi> had <U+017F>aid to him, which I was overjoy'd to
hear, hoping that <U+017F>ince he had lent an ear to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my me<U+017F><U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge, <U+017F>ome good i<U+017F><U+017F>ue might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be made of it. I waited that night with great
impatience, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marcin</hi> being come at
the hour appointed, he ask'd me what Propo<U+017F>als I
had to make to him, and what Credentials I could
<U+017F>how to <U+017F>atisfy him, if he <U+017F>hould treat with me. I
told him for that matter I had <U+017F>ufficient; and not
to give him any rea<U+017F>on to doubt it, I <U+017F>how'd him
my Letters from the Cardinal. He told me this was
<U+017F>omething indeed, but it was not enough howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
that I ought to have had a Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the King him<U+017F>elf; that tho the Cardinal
did govern the Kingdom as Chief Mini<U+017F>ter, yet he
di<U+017F>engag'd him<U+017F>elf oftentimes from very <U+017F>trict Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
and Treaties, on pretence that the King did
not approve of them; and that this was his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57806:107"/>
only to try people how they were affected, or
to make them <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to their own Party; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I might tell him, what advantages they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him; that if they were <U+017F>uch as he <U+017F>hould
think worth while to con<U+017F>ider of, I might then
return and get a larger Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and if not,
that then 'twould be needle<U+017F>s to give me <U+017F>o much
trouble. He had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on indeed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
for what he <U+017F>aid of the Cardinal; for he had
<U+017F>everal times in that manner, <U+017F>hifted his head out
of entangling Ca<U+017F>es, while the Civil Wars la<U+017F>ted:
As for example, in the Ca<U+017F>e between the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> and the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he render'd the
Prince <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected by the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians;</hi> who doubting
the Prince would not perform his Engagements, he
broke off <U+017F>everal times with him, when the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> thought all things were concluded of:
However, being de<U+017F>ir'd to declare my <U+017F>elf, I told
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marcin,</hi> that if he would quit the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>ts
of the Prince, and break off his Treaties with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the King <U+017F>hould give him fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Crowns in Money, a Government of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in the Heart of the Kingdom, with an a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of being made a Knight of the Order at the
fir<U+017F>t Promotion. I had <U+017F>everal other offers to make
to him, but I was like our Shopkeepers, who never
<U+017F>how the be<U+017F>t of their Commodities till the la<U+017F>t. I
conceal'd what I had more to <U+017F>ay, till I had heard
him <U+017F>peak, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at I might know what his intention
was. He told me the Cardinal banter'd him <U+017F>ure,
to make him <U+017F>uch offers as the<U+017F>e at this time of day,
for he had offer'd him more than all this long ago;
that either he mu<U+017F>t beleive him to be extreamly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
at the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> or that he was reduc'd
to great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, to fancy he was to be tempted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57806:107"/>
with <U+017F>uch a little matter as this was; that he did not
offer him half the value of the lo<U+017F>s he had receiv'd
in his own E<U+017F>tate in <hi>France;</hi> that this was far from
making amends for the ill treatment he had met
withal; that if he had quitted <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in a time
when his pre<U+017F>ence was mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary there, the
Cardinal ought only to blame him<U+017F>elf for it; for
that after having put him in Pri<U+017F>on, at the <U+017F>ame
time when the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi>
and the Duke <hi>de Longeville</hi> had been apprehended,
tho he had never been concern'd in any thing, that
might give the lea<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion; he ought to
have kept his Orders more <U+017F>ecret, which he had
given to treat him in a different manner from them,
after the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was gone out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that there was nothing which a man would
not venture upon to gain his Liberty, and that he
remembred every day what the lo<U+017F>s of his had co<U+017F>t
him; that he was fain to purcha<U+017F>e his E<U+017F>cape, at
the price of throwing him<U+017F>elf out at Window,
from the top of a Hou<U+017F>e, which broke one of his
Legs, and that to avoid the like treatment, there was
nothing <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred in the world, that he would not
violate; that the Cardinal <U+017F>hould not then accu<U+017F>e
him, as he did every day, of the blacke<U+017F>t crimes
that ever were committed; that if there was any
one could be tax'd with <U+017F>uch crimes, 'twas he who
had caus'd him to be apprehended, once already,
without cau<U+017F>e, and would have done it a <U+017F>econd
time, if he had not taken care to prevent him;
that bare <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion ought not to be <U+017F>ufficient ground,
to u<U+017F>e extremities with men of Hone<U+017F>ty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but they <U+017F>hould have plain Matter of Fact to
charge and prove upon them. He made a long Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <U+017F>ort, full of complaints, too many to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57806:108"/>
incerted here; and I would not interrupt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I knew, that when a man has di<U+017F>charg'd his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he is the more tractable to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
In the mean time, finding that he began
to be cool, I told him, that I did not pretend to
ju<U+017F>tify the Cardinal, but that I would tell him this, tho
by the by, that a man who is in <U+017F>uch a Po<U+017F>t as his
Eminence, is often at a lo<U+017F>s, and that too much
confidence would have ruin'd him; and that 'tis the
con<U+017F>tant Maxim of Politicians, to <U+017F>ecure always the
per<U+017F>ons of them whom they <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, and then to
examine whether they were guilty or no; and that
if he had been in his place, he would have done no
le<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf: That his falling in <U+017F>o violently with
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> was what the Cardinal could
not be pleas'd with, who <U+017F>aw that Prince, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns
laid for his ruin, <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf to be carry'd
to all manner of extremities; that 'twas too late to
recall tho<U+017F>e things now, therefore 'twas better to
drown the remembrance of them in a hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
which he might make very much to
his advantage; that <U+017F>ince the Offers I had made
him were not <U+017F>atisfactory, I begg'd him to tell me
what it was he expected, and that I would u<U+017F>e my
endeavours with the Cardinal, that he <U+017F>hould have
full content. He told me that he would think of
it, and that this Conver<U+017F>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion having already been
too long, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being naturally jealous,
to take away from them all cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, he
would not come to me any more there, but pray'd
me to go to <hi>Liege,</hi> and to come to him to his Ca<U+017F>tle
<hi>de Modave,</hi> where he would be in eight days time:
but he could not tell what I would do to pa<U+017F>s thro
the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Towns upon the Road, which I could not
avoid; that he would have given me a Pa<U+017F>s-port
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57806:108"/>
him<U+017F>elf, if the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> had been ab<U+017F>ent; but
as it belong'd to him, he dur<U+017F>t not encroach upon
his authority, and that it might do me more harm
than good if it <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>cover'd; that 'twould
be better for me to apply my <U+017F>elf to the Governour's
Secretary, as if I was of <hi>Liege;</hi> that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of
People would do any thing for money, without
much troubling them<U+017F>elves to examine into it. I
thankt him for his Coun<U+017F>el, but I had no occa<U+017F>ion
to make u<U+017F>e of it; for that I was provided with all
tho<U+017F>e things before I came to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els;</hi> and in<U+017F>tead
of coming by the great <hi>Paris</hi> Road, I came down
the <hi>Meu<U+017F>e</hi> in a Luggage Boat, which had a Pa<U+017F>s-port
for <hi>Liege.</hi> The Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Fubert</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Sedan,</hi> having notice from the Cardinal,
that I went from him about affairs of Con<U+017F>equence,
had in<U+017F>tructed the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Boat, and that I
might pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>afely at <hi>Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> I di<U+017F>guis'd
my <U+017F>elf and went for one of his Boys; at <hi>Liege</hi> I
was directed to a man the Cardinal employ'd there
for a Spy, and he got me a Pa<U+017F>s-port under the name
of a Burgher of that Town, <U+017F>o that having nothing
to fear I went not from <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> till the day before I
was to be at <hi>Modave:</hi> I lay that Night at <hi>Lovain,</hi>
and leaving <hi>Loo</hi> on the left hand, I went on and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> about a League fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I <U+017F>tay'd <U+017F>ix days in the chief Town thereabout
for News of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marcin,</hi> for the Country
People, who came every day into the Town, would
pre<U+017F>ently have brought the News if he was come

that he <U+017F>ent before him were come, I went

I was di<U+017F>guis'd like a Ma<U+017F>on, as was agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected coming to him, becau<U+017F>e he was a great
lover of Building, <U+017F>o that there was no notice taken,
tho we were lock'd up together for a great while:
he knew me as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw me, and asking me if
I had brought him the Draught that I had promis'd
him, I an<U+017F>wer'd him yes, and taking a Paper out of my
Pocket I made as if I would give it him, but he bid
me keep it; and when he had view'd a thing, which
he was treating with <U+017F>ome Workmen about, we
<U+017F>hould then go into his Clo<U+017F>et and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of it.</p>

Minutes after, and how well it had taken; that <U+017F>ome
of the Workmen had envy'd me, becau<U+017F>e they
thought I came to take the work out of their hands;

I concluded my la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with: He told me, that
was ea<U+017F>ie to do, and <U+017F>o going on with it, explain'd
him<U+017F>elf upon the matter: That they <U+017F>hould make

Knight of the Order at the fir<U+017F>t promotion, General of

The<U+017F>e demands being <U+017F>o extravagant, I was amaz'd;
however, as my In<U+017F>tructions reach'd further than I
had yet di<U+017F>cover'd to him; I told him, I had wrote
to the Cardinal about it, <U+017F>ince I had the honour to
<U+017F>ee him, and had receiv'd this an<U+017F>wer: That in<U+017F>tead

withal that he <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of the dignity of the

to whom be<U+017F>ides that dignity, they had given fifty
thou<U+017F>and <hi>Lovis Dor's.</hi> I told him yes, I believ'd they
did, but that he was not ma<U+017F>ter of a <U+017F>trong place as
'tother was, when he took the opportunity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>uch a bargain for him<U+017F>elf; and that when the

con<U+017F>ider'd; that he was but a private Captain among
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and could not do them much more

might <U+017F>how it to the Cardinal, to whom I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd

any thing but to ju<U+017F>tify my <U+017F>elf to his Eminence,
that I had done my be<U+017F>t; who knowing <U+017F>o well
what had happen'd between Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Marcin</hi> and

<hi>de Marcin,</hi> taking it quite otherwi<U+017F>e, ro<U+017F>e up in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57806:110"/>
a rage, and told me, he could find in his heart to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
me that moment to his ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment: For
what did I <U+017F>ee in his face to propo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a thing to
him; and if this was the Cardinals method, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
a man in Negotiotions on purpo<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>cover
it to his own Party, he <U+017F>hould have a care of him;
that if he <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>uch a Fool to give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand, he made no que<U+017F>tion but they

that he perceiv'd I was only <U+017F>ent to ruin the

that however, he would be <U+017F>o generous as to let me
go, provided I went about my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s immediately,
for he had nothing more to <U+017F>ay to me. I was quite

commanding my <U+017F>elf, I let him go on without

I told him, that if the Cardinal had any <U+017F>uch de<U+017F>ign,
'twas more than I knew; but for my <U+017F>elf I could
give him an account of mine, and I would ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
tell him the rea<U+017F>on why I made <U+017F>uch a propo<U+017F>al
to him. That I had to do with a Per<U+017F>on that was
very difficult, and that expected every thing <U+017F>hould
come to pa<U+017F>s to his own fancy; that I had <U+017F>een him
<U+017F>o prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with an opinion, that my negotiations
could not fail, that I was very careful to <U+017F>atisfy him
at my return, that I had done my be<U+017F>t; that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to him, that I was to blame to make
him <U+017F>uch a Propo<U+017F>al, having not the honour to be
known to him, and the de<U+017F>ire I had to <U+017F>ee him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>France,</hi> where his merit would meet with
another <U+017F>ort of recompence than what he found from

            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e cool'd him a little, but not at all
prevail'd with him to le<U+017F><U+017F>en his demands; <U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing
there was no good to be done with him, I took my

Towns. The Duke <hi>De Normou<U+017F>teir</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Charleville,</hi> and to whom I was particularly
known, askt me were I had been; but having no
order to communicate to him any of my Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
I told him, I came from the <hi>Spaw,</hi> where I had
been ordered by the Phi<U+017F>icians to go to drink the
Waters: He took this for an An<U+017F>wer, and having
<U+017F>ent out his Cavalry into the Country of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
for a Military execution, the People having
refu<U+017F>ed to pay their Contributions, I was oblig'd to
attend till their return; and there being a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other people, who waited as well as I, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us a Convoy of the fir<U+017F>t that arriv'd, but we
were but little the <U+017F>afer for them, for they were but
thirty Troopers, and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>o fatigu'd with the
duty they had been upon, that both Hor<U+017F>e and
Man were ready to fall every <U+017F>tep they took: If
the re<U+017F>t of the Company would have been rul'd by
me, we would not have <U+017F>taid for them at all, for
we were enough of us to have ventur'd; but the
majority was again<U+017F>t me, and over-rul'd me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I would or no: which we had all of us cau<U+017F>e
enough to repent of. In <U+017F>hort, <hi>Montal,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour

of <hi>Rocroy</hi> for the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> knowing
well enough that there was a great many people
waited for the return of the Convoy, <U+017F>et one to
give him an account what time they came back,
and be<U+017F>et the ways with <U+017F>everal parties; <U+017F>o 'twould
have been a miracle if we had e<U+017F>cap'd them. When
we were come within a mile and half of <hi>Pierre-Pont,</hi>
the Enemy, who were hid in a Wood, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
us; and having divided them<U+017F>elves into
two Bodies, one attackt us in the Front, and the
other in the Flank; our Guard made but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance,
and would have run away if they could,
but their Hor<U+017F>es, as I <U+017F>aid, being harra<U+017F>s'd, they were
taken immediately; for us, we made a body by our
<U+017F>elves, and made a <U+017F>how to defend our <U+017F>elves, and
at the fir<U+017F>t charge we kill'd two of their Officers;
but being overpowr'd by numbers, we were forc'd
to <U+017F>eek our <U+017F>afety from the <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s of our Hor<U+017F>es;
and <U+017F>o made away to get back to <hi>Charleville.</hi> In
the mean time, having ob<U+017F>erv'd, that the Dragoons
had gotten before us, and had po<U+017F>ted them<U+017F>elves in
a Defile, by which we mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity pa<U+017F>s, I got
into a Wood, and tho I was per<U+017F>u'd by three Hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
yet I lo<U+017F>t them, and coming out on the other
<U+017F>ide I <U+017F>aw no body appear, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
I was out of danger; and I travell'd two
Leagues without any oppo<U+017F>ition, and was ju<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to my <U+017F>elf that I had e<U+017F>cap'd, when four
Hor<U+017F>emen very well mounted di<U+017F>cover'd me; and
one of them coming up to me with the u<U+017F>ual que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Qui vive,</hi> or who are you for? I had no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
an<U+017F>wer'd, <hi>Vive France,</hi> but he bid me <U+017F>urrender
my <U+017F>elf, or I was a dead man: In the mean time,
the other, who were coming towards me, and were
not above ten paces off, rendring it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57806:111"/>
to e<U+017F>cape them, I was oblig'd to give place to my
ill fortune, and to yield my <U+017F>elf their Pri<U+017F>oner; <U+017F>o I
was carry'd into a Neighbouring Wood where the
re<U+017F>t of the Troop lay in Ambu<U+017F>cade; and he that
commanded them, having ask'd who I was, and
whence I came: I told him that I was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
and that I came from <hi>Charleville.</hi> It happen'd that
this was a Gentleman that liv'd but two Leagues
from my Fathers, <U+017F>o making my <U+017F>elf known to him,
he would not <U+017F>uffer me to be <U+017F>earcht, or any way
roughly dealt with, but us'd me very civilly.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>taid there with him till Evening that they broke
up their Ambu<U+017F>cade, which I thought very <U+017F>trange,
knowing 'twas not cu<U+017F>tomary to do <U+017F>o till Sun ri<U+017F>e:
But he told me 'twould <U+017F>ignify nothing to <U+017F>tay there
any longer, for they only waited for any Per<U+017F>ons
they could find that had got away from the others;

               </gap>ut <U+017F>ince they had met with no body but me, 'twas
very probable the re<U+017F>t were all taken; and indeed <U+017F>o
it prov'd<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for I found them all got to <hi>Rocroy</hi> before me,
which was <U+017F>ome Comfort to me in my Affliction;
yet <U+017F>till I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, that I was better treated than
any of them, for there was not one of them but
had lo<U+017F>t his Money, whereas I kept mine, of which,
to my great comfort, I was very well provided. In
the mean time I was in great perplexity, whether I
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>end to the Cardinal or no; for on one hand
I con<U+017F>ider'd if I did <U+017F>o, he might perhaps get me out,
but then on the other hand my applying my <U+017F>elf to
the fir<U+017F>t Mini<U+017F>ter of State, might give them cau<U+017F>e to
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, I was not the Per<U+017F>on I pretended to be; for
I had told Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montal</hi> that I was a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Foot in the Regiment of <hi>Grancy;</hi> of which
Regiment I was throughly acquainted with all the
Officers; In<U+017F>omuch that when he que<U+017F>tion'd me, I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57806:112"/>
gave him an exact account of the State of the whole
Regiment: At la<U+017F>t, having well con<U+017F>ider'd what I
had to do, I thought 'twas be<U+017F>t to let it alone, and
to di<U+017F>cover my <U+017F>elf to the fir<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on that <U+017F>hould get
his liberty upon <hi>Parol,</hi> or till the general exchange of
Pri<U+017F>oners, which was expected would not be long;
I had al<U+017F>o another re<U+017F>erve, which was <U+017F>ince I had
Money, to offer my ran<U+017F>om, but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montal</hi>
would not accept of it, <U+017F>o I found my <U+017F>elf fru<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of that de<U+017F>ign. Tho we were not far from the
Capital City of the Kingdom, where every one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
has <U+017F>ome acquaintance, yet 'twas not to be
imagin'd, how few there was that receiv'd any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
from their friends; I could not however <U+017F>ee
<U+017F>o many worthy Gentlemen <U+017F>uffer, without <U+017F>haring
with them <U+017F>omething of what I had left, which
un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable bounty <U+017F>oon <U+017F>hew'd me the bottom of
my Pur<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>till I comforted my <U+017F>elf, that I had
half a years Arrears due to me at <hi>Lyons;</hi> but when
the time was come, the que<U+017F>tion how I <U+017F>hould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor<U+017F>e

perplexity, and I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ign my own name,
which I had conceal'd from Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> and
call'd my <U+017F>elf by the name of one of the Lieutenants
of <hi>Grancy;</hi> <U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e I would not expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf to

               </gap>ent my Money, having received recruits

<U+017F>hould be askt to repay me, and I that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted every
body, was de<U+017F>erted in <U+017F>uch a manner, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was mi<U+017F>erable beyond expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I was
oblig'd to live above three months upon the Basket;
and to compleat my misfortune, my Linnen was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57806:112"/>
<U+017F>tolen from me, and I had but one Shirt and one
Crevat left me in the whole world, <U+017F>o that I was
fain to lie a bed all day to have it wa<U+017F>ht; for my
part, when I call to mind how 'twas with me at
that time, I cannot imagin how I was able to bear
it; and above all to find tho<U+017F>e whom I had a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
in their di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>hun me as if I had the Plague, tho
they knew in their own Con<U+017F>ciences, that I had
never been reduc'd to this condition, but for my
compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to them. All this while there was no
appearance of the General Exchange, which we had
<U+017F>o long lookt for, altho the Campagne was ready to
begin; that was all the news that I enquir'd after,
for I was, ju<U+017F>t as it were, <U+017F>inking under my mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
my Cloaths, and e<U+017F>pecially my Shirt, hung all
in rags; and for Beer or Wine I had almo<U+017F>t forgot
the ta<U+017F>te of them. In <U+017F>hort, I, who had compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of every body, found all the world cold and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to me, they would wi<U+017F>h me better fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but no body would do any thing to procure
it.</p>
            <p>'Tis ea<U+017F>y to judge, that my mind was perplext un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all this affliction almo<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>traction, and was a

Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Grancy</hi> having given in the names of the
Officers of his Regiment who were Pri<U+017F>oners, left
my name out, as he very well might, for that he
who<U+017F>e true name it was, remain'd with the body;
<U+017F>o I had the unhappine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee all my fellow Pri<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57806:113"/>
overwhelm'd with trouble, that Nature it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>unk
under it, and I fell into a Fever which held me
two months at lea<U+017F>t, and being carry'd to the Ho<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
all my hopes depended upon an Officer of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> whom I thought to be an hone<U+017F>t man, and
to whom I had di<U+017F>cover'd my <U+017F>elf; I had de<U+017F>ir'd
two things of him before he went away, one was
that he would convey a Letter for me which I had
writ to the Cardinal, in which I had given him an
account of the <U+017F>ad accident that had befallen me;
the other was to <U+017F>end me the half years revenue
that was due to me of my rent at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him to receive, and to that end gave him a
Blank Receipt <U+017F>igned with my hand, for the Pay-ma<U+017F>ter
to fill up as u<U+017F>ual in that ca<U+017F>e; but in<U+017F>tead of
doing me this kindne<U+017F>s, he not only run away with
my Money, but was <U+017F>o barbarous as to keep my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which I had written to the Cardinal. I waited
with impatience for an an<U+017F>wer from him, and from
his Eminence, but I heard from both of them alike;
yet I was <U+017F>uch a credulous Coxcomb as to flatter
my <U+017F>elf for three months, that there was <U+017F>ome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
thing had fallen out to hinder him; at la<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>eeing I was for<U+017F>aken both of Heaven and Earth, if I
may dare to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o, my de<U+017F>pair was <U+017F>o great, that
I was ready to lay violent hands upon my <U+017F>elf; in
the mean time I relaps'd into my di<U+017F>temper, and
was come to that extremity, that they began to tell
me I ought to think of <U+017F>ettling my Con<U+017F>cience; I
askt then for a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, and having, as it happened,
fallen into the hands of an hone<U+017F>t man, I made him
my Confident in <U+017F>ome part of my <U+017F>orrows; I told
him of the fal<U+017F>e name I had taken up, and how it
depriv'd me of that relief which otherwi<U+017F>e I might
have had. I dur<U+017F>t not tell him any more, le<U+017F>t out of

he could, offer'd him<U+017F>elf very freely, to go for me
to <hi>Paris;</hi> and having gladly accepted his pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er, I
gave him a Blank <U+017F>ign'd, as I had done the Officer
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> that he might receive whatever there was
due to me from <hi>Lyons;</hi> I did not tell him how much,
for I was afraid that Officer had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there being by this time another half year due, he
brought me likewi<U+017F>e the like <U+017F>um of five hundred
Crowns, excepting a <U+017F>mall matter for the Charges
of his Journey. If I dur<U+017F>t have tru<U+017F>ted him, as I

and the rather, becau<U+017F>e they began now to talk of
the General Peace, which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had
always rejected it, <U+017F>eem'd now more inclinable to,
<U+017F>ince the ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s they had in the la<U+017F>t Campagnes;

and if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> <U+017F>hould happen to beat us, all our

for before, the Jealou<U+017F>y which aro<U+017F>e between the<U+017F>e

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57806:114"/>
di<U+017F>orders being prevented, we got the better of the

with any Conque<U+017F>ts, till we had added that of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
which neverthele<U+017F>s was to be deliver'd up to

Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> who apprehended nothing <U+017F>o
much as a Peace, <U+017F>aid openly, that it all depended
upon the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of this Enterprize; and I, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as I heard how it was, pray'd heartily it might come
to pa<U+017F>s, as I had rea<U+017F>on to do, for I <U+017F>aw plainly
enough, that this was the only hope I had left for
the recovery of my liberty; but the place being of
the greate<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence to both Parties, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
were not le<U+017F>s vigilant in the defence of it, than
we were vigorous in our attacks; and they who
had always before <U+017F>hun'd giving Battle with a great
deal of caution, now drew all their Forces together
into the Field, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having join'd
them with his Forces, advanc'd together within
Cannon-<U+017F>hot of our Trenches. The Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> who did not expect to take <U+017F>uch a place as
this without blows, had di<U+017F>pos'd all things for their
reception, like a great Souldier; and the Enemy
knowing who they had to deal with, re<U+017F>olv'd to
make a di<U+017F>covery of his Lines, before they advanced
any further. Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Au<U+017F>tria,</hi> who commanded
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would tru<U+017F>t no body for this <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but advanc'd him<U+017F>elf with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
to take the view; and the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Hoquincourt</hi>
who was with them, having with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
than wit, adventur'd too far before the re<U+017F>t,
was kill'd with a Mu<U+017F>quet-<U+017F>hot; this made the re<U+017F>t
retire, but did not put by their de<U+017F>ign of attacking
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57806:114"/>
us in our Trenches. The Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> having
notice of this by his Scouts, was re<U+017F>olv'd to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
with them, and coming boldly out of his
Trenches drew up in a po<U+017F>ture to receive them;
he did not <U+017F>tand to encourage them by amu<U+017F>ing
them with a long Speech, but riding thro the Ranks
to <U+017F>ee that all things were in order, he <U+017F>how'd a
countenance <U+017F>o full of a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that put <U+017F>uch an
opinion into the minds of his Souldiers, as was a
good Omen of a certain Victory.</p>
            <p>If I had been in this Engagement my <U+017F>elf 'twould
have pleas'd me to have given you the particulars,
the account being <U+017F>o much to our advantage, but I
know too well the errors they are <U+017F>ubject to, who
write of <U+017F>uch things from the mouths of others, and
<U+017F>hall therefore, to avoid the <U+017F>ame mi<U+017F>takes, content
my <U+017F>elf with telling you in general, that the Vi<U+017F>count
<hi>de Turenne</hi> having broken the whole body of the
Enemies Army, <U+017F>at down immediately before <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
which he oblig'd in a few days to capitulate;
and from thence he march'd his Army along the
Sea Coa<U+017F>t, and took in all the <U+017F>mall Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
for having gain'd <U+017F>o great a Battle, and
taken <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a Town in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, they
thought there was no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting him; and he would
have over-run all <hi>Flanders,</hi> if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not
taken their mea<U+017F>ures very <U+017F>peedily to obtain a Peace.
I was too much concern'd in the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of the<U+017F>e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
not to be very inqui<U+017F>itive about them, my
Liberty depending upon them; and therefore I was
always teazing my friend the Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tick to <U+017F>end
me word how things went: Fir<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>ent me word
of the Battle, and how the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of that put the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> upon u<U+017F>ing their utmo<U+017F>t endeavours for a
Peace; this overjoy'd me, but I waited in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57806:115"/>
eighteen months longer before 'twas brought to
perfection. I can't imagine what the Cardinal
thought of me all that while, for 'twas three years
before he had any news of me. Without que<U+017F>tion he

               </gap>'d writing to him from
one day to another till at la<U+017F>t 'twas <U+017F>o long, I thought
'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e to write at all; I was blam'd
for it by many, but I think with very little rea<U+017F>on,
con<U+017F>idering my circum<U+017F>tances.</p>
            <p>At la<U+017F>t the happy hour arriv'd, the General Peace
was made, and I was deliver'd: a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever I
got out I went to wait on the Cardinal, whom I
found at <hi>Vincennes;</hi> he took me for an Apparition at
fir<U+017F>t, but recovering his <U+017F>urprize, he askt me whence
I came, and how I had the Impudence to <U+017F>ee his
face, after I had <U+017F>erv'd him <U+017F>o. I told him, I
thought I had rea<U+017F>on enough, con<U+017F>idering what had
befallen me, and I would make him<U+017F>elf my Judge,
if he would plea<U+017F>e to give me a hearing; I told him
then the rea<U+017F>ons that prevented my writing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the particulars I have ju<U+017F>t now related; he
made light of it, and <U+017F>hrinking up his <U+017F>houlders,
as if he thought me craz'd, he told me for an<U+017F>wer,
he was <U+017F>orry for me, but if I talkt at that rate, God
help me, he thought the be<U+017F>t he could do

and <U+017F>o <U+017F>candaliz'd at it I was, that I went out all in
a rage, and meeting with <hi>la Cordonniere,</hi> who is now
Lieutenant General, but then belong'd to him, I
told him, that his Ma<U+017F>ter was <U+017F>o haughty with his
good fortune, that 'twas intollerable; that 'twas all
one to him who he affronted, and a Gentleman
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57806:115"/>
<U+017F>hould have no better u<U+017F>age from him than a Slave,
but I hop't the time would come, that I <U+017F>hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my <U+017F>elf of him for the language he had given
me. I thought I had <U+017F>poken this to one of my
friends, when I <U+017F>aid it to <hi>la Cordonniere,</hi> who I had
oblig'd, and lent him Money <U+017F>everal times, when he
was but a mean fellow, and wanted it enough; but
forgetting all tho<U+017F>e obligations, I had no <U+017F>ooner
opened my mind to him with all this freedom, but
he began to take his Ma<U+017F>ters part, and one word
bringing in another, we both drew, and were both
of us wounded, and if we had not been parted by the
Marquis <hi>de Rennel,</hi> we had not left off without <U+017F>ome
mi<U+017F>chief or other; and it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to
pro<U+017F>ecute the heat after this di<U+017F>covery, we went off
each of us as our occa<U+017F>ions directed: Mine was to
hide my <U+017F>elf, the Cardinal having publickly <U+017F>worn,
if ever I fell into his hands, I <U+017F>hould come <U+017F>horter
by the head. I made my retreat into a Convent, the
Prior whereof was my true friend; while <hi>la Cardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
was vi<U+017F>ited by a crowd of the Grandees, who
to make their Court to the Cardinal, could <U+017F>ubmit
to any mean Re<U+017F>cal that had but his favour. This
affair of mine making a great noi<U+017F>e in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
where I was began to be afraid of me, which
the Prior perceiving, was fain to give out, that I
was de<U+017F>irous of taking the Habit, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
was to pa<U+017F>s the Probation; <U+017F>o he directed me to
go every night to the <hi>Office,</hi> and to make great <U+017F>hew
of my Devotion, for being to <U+017F>ave the life of a
friend, he made no <U+017F>cruple to make u<U+017F>e of any <U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to effect it. 'Tis not for me to di<U+017F>pute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did well or ill in it; I am <U+017F>ure the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
mine, for without his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I had run a
great ri<U+017F>que of a Scaffold; for the Cardinal, who
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57806:116"/>
was a true <hi>Italian,</hi> revengeful as the Devil, when
he could not come at my body <U+017F>eiz'd my rent,
and had reduc'd me to a very mi<U+017F>erable condition, if
my friend the Prior had not <U+017F>tuck clo<U+017F>e to me; but
he differ'd in that, e<U+017F>pecially from his Brethren of
the Order, who <U+017F>tudy nothing but their own intere<U+017F>t,
for the more mi<U+017F>erable he <U+017F>aw me, the more he
<U+017F>trove to comfort me; for my part I knew not what
to think of my <U+017F>elf, but in my opinion it was my
evil de<U+017F>tiny rather than any fault of mine: I made a
<U+017F>trict examination of my <U+017F>elf, as if I had been to
make my own Proce<U+017F>s, but whether <U+017F>elf love was
predominant in me, or that indeed I was rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
than guilty, I could find no <U+017F>atisfactory rea<U+017F>on
to condemn my <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>tay'd in this Convent till the Death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
which tho it happen'd quickly after, yet 'twas
not <U+017F>ooner than I de<U+017F>ir'd, for as godly as I was grown,
I could not heartily wi<U+017F>h well to a man that had done
me <U+017F>o much injury, and who, after he had been the
cau<U+017F>e of my lying three years in Pri<U+017F>on, oblig'd me
now to another Confinement, in a place not one jot
more agreeable to me than the place I came out
of; if I had been any thing <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>pos'd, I
had certainly become a Religious, and I oftentimes
<U+017F>ecretly wi<U+017F>ht, Heaven would have given me the
Grace to attempt it; but being not cut out for that
Vocation, I was fain to have Patience with all my
Fury. The Count <hi>de Charoft</hi> whom I have formerly
mentioned, and who was pleas'd <U+017F>till to retain a
kindne<U+017F>s for me, <U+017F>poke to the King in my favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I dru<U+017F>t appear, and having given him an account
of my adventure, of which his Maje<U+017F>ty was wholly
ignorant, he was pleas'd with a great deal of goodne<U+017F>s
to give me his Pardon, provided the Scuffle I had
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57806:116"/>
had with <hi>la Cardonniere</hi> could not be prov'd to be a
Duel; for he had <U+017F>olemnly <U+017F>wore at his Coronation
upon the holy Evangeli<U+017F>ts, that he would never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
any one that was guilty of that crime, an Oath
which we <U+017F>ee he hath never yet di<U+017F>pens'd with; and
if we may judge by what happen'd <U+017F>oon after I e<U+017F>cap'd,
we may conclude he never will; I mean the affair of
Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs <hi>de la Frette,</hi> and of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Chalais,</hi> in
which I was very happy that I was not engag'd, as
you will <U+017F>ee by the following <U+017F>tory.</p>
            <p>You mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand, that about a fortnight or
three weeks before, I happen'd to be playing at
Tennis with a Gentleman of <hi>Poictou,</hi> call'd <hi>la Verie</hi>
an Officer of the Guard; we play'd at the Tennis
Court in <hi>la Rue de Vangirard,</hi> near <hi>Luxembourg;</hi> there
was a great many better Tennis Courts in <hi>Paris</hi> than
that, but we went thither, becau<U+017F>e our Lodgings
being both near it, we had the convenience of going
in our Morning Gowns; we plaid <U+017F>everal Games,
and when we were ju<U+017F>t a going to give over, the
Chevalier <hi>de la Frette</hi> came in, and <U+017F>tanding by the
Ball Basket, as if he had a mind to quarrel, began to
to<U+017F>s the Balls into the lower Hazard of the Tennis
Court. <hi>La Verie</hi> lo<U+017F>t the Game, and being a little
out of humour upon it, becau<U+017F>e at that time we did
not play by the Set, but paid for the Balls we <U+017F>hould
loo<U+017F>e, de<U+017F>ir'd him, that he would plea<U+017F>e to divert
him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e; I know not whether
he <U+017F>poke it <U+017F>urlily or not, or whether the Chevelier
<hi>de la Frette,</hi> who to <U+017F>ay the truth was a <U+017F>ort of a Bully,
took it for an affront on purpo<U+017F>e to make a broil,
but without any more ado he takes the whole Ba<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
up, and throws the Balls all about the Tennis
Court, this occa<U+017F>ion'd <U+017F>ome hot words between
them, and the Chevelier <hi>de la Frette</hi> was in <U+017F>uch a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57806:117"/>
rage, that not con<U+017F>idering that the other was not
only without a Sword, but as a man may <U+017F>ay, quite
naked, he drew and made a pa<U+017F>s at him: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that <U+017F>tood by ran in between them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him doing any mi<U+017F>chief, <U+017F>o we left off the
Play, and went into the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing-room to put on our
Cloths. There was no Gentlemen there<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>o that
having parted us, they apprehended nothing of any
further mi<U+017F>chief, and we went away without any
notice being taken. <hi>La Verie</hi> told me, if he was
ruin'd by it, he would have <U+017F>atisfaction. I dur<U+017F>t
not di<U+017F><U+017F>wade him, tho 'twas again<U+017F>t my judgment,
le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould think 'twas for want of Courage,
and <U+017F>o I, that was but ju<U+017F>t got out of one <U+017F>nare, fell
into an other, that was ten times more dangerous. I
was fain to be the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to go and carry the
Challenge to the Chevalier, who liv'd in the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>treet, at a great Hou<U+017F>e, now belonging to the Duke
<hi>d' Elbeuf.</hi> I had nothing to do to make him a long
Compliment: He told me pre<U+017F>ently he knew my
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and preventing me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> told me, that we mu<U+017F>t
get another man; for that two of his Friends who
had heard of the quarrel, had made him promi<U+017F>e
that he would not engage without them: Upon this
we went to <U+017F>ee if we could find the Count <hi>de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
younge<U+017F>t Son of the Marquis <hi>d' Entragues,</hi> who
has <U+017F>ince taken upon him the Title of Marqui<U+017F>s
<hi>d' Illiers,</hi> and was made under Lieutenant in the Light
Hor<U+017F>e of the Guards, and lo<U+017F>t his life at the battle of
<hi>Seneff.</hi> But happy enough for him, we could not
find him; but as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought for him at his Fathers
hou<U+017F>e, <hi>L' Ho<U+017F>tel d' Entragues,</hi> we met with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who was his Neighbour in the Country, one
<hi>Chilvant,</hi> who made up our Party; <U+017F>o we fought
behind the Convent of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where I was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57806:117"/>
wounded, and our <U+017F>ide had the wor<U+017F>t of the day,
but no body was kill'd. We every one <U+017F>hifted for our
<U+017F>elves, knowing we were lo<U+017F>t men if we were di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd';
but as good luck would have it the thing
was never known: <hi>La Verie</hi> return'd to his Po<U+017F>t as if
nothing had been done, and none of us had the
lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>turbance about it. For my part, I had taken
<U+017F>anctuary at the Marqui<U+017F>s <hi>de Noirmou<U+017F>tier,</hi> Elde<U+017F>t
Son to the Governour of <hi>Charleville,</hi> of whom I
made mention before, but he <U+017F>oon inform'd me there
was no need to be afraid, <U+017F>o I appear'd again too as
well as the others.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight or three weeks after this, as I
hinted before, happen'd the quarrel of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs
<hi>de la Frette,</hi> which did not come off <U+017F>o well: The
Elde<U+017F>t was at a Ball at the Palace Royal, where was
a great appearance of Courtiers: when all was over
and every one preparing to go out, this <hi>de la Frette</hi>
who re<U+017F>ented <U+017F>omething from Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Chalais,</hi>
about a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and had a mind to let him know it,
rudely ju<U+017F>tled him <U+017F>everal times as he went out. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Chalais</hi> looking about to <U+017F>ee who ju<U+017F>tled
him, pre<U+017F>ently knew <hi>la Frette,</hi> and gave him <U+017F>ome
words about it that were di<U+017F>obliging enough. If
they had had Swords there would have been <U+017F>ome
di<U+017F>order about it in the Palace, tho that was a very
improper place to quarrel in, but every one being
dre<U+017F>t for the Ball, <hi>la Frette</hi> would take no notice of it
there, but waited without for him to demand <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
They <U+017F>oon agreed upon it, to fight three
to three, and fixt the place, where they <U+017F>hould meet
the next day, it being too late for that night. This
was in too publick a place to quarrel, and make a
<U+017F>ecret of it; the King was made acquainted with it,
and immediately <U+017F>ent away the Chevelier <hi>de St. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57806:118"/>
to tell Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Frette,</hi> that he po<U+017F>itively
forbid him fighting, and that if he <U+017F>hould dare to do
it, he <U+017F>hould certainly dye for it. <hi>St. Agnan,</hi> who
was his Cou<U+017F>in German, found him out pre<U+017F>ently,
and made him this compliment. <hi>De la Frette</hi> told
him, that he hop'd he had more regard to his honour
than to make him forfeit his word; that the hour
was at hand, and 'twas in vain to think of di<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
them; and be<U+017F>ides being his Friend too,
he <U+017F>hould rather expect, that he would make one in
their number, and that they would <U+017F>end to <hi>Chalais</hi>
to provide him<U+017F>elf with another man. The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>de St. Agnan,</hi> never con<U+017F>idering that he was
<U+017F>ent by the King with <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere a me<U+017F><U+017F>age to prevent
it, nor how <U+017F>trictly all <U+017F>orts of Duels were forbid,
ra<U+017F>hly embarques in an affair, which he could never
hope to get clear of; and join'd with them in it, <U+017F>o
they immediately <U+017F>ent to <hi>Chalais</hi> to provide a fourth
man. The Marquis <hi>de Noirmou<U+017F>tier</hi> his Brother-in-law,
who was already engag'd, knowing of the
affair I had lately had with the Chevalier <hi>de la Frette,</hi>
immediately thought upon me, and <U+017F>ent about to
look for me; but very happily for me, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
that night at play at a Friends hou<U+017F>e; and tho
it is not the cu<U+017F>tom at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon any occa<U+017F>ion, to
<U+017F>tay from ones Lodging, yet it being very late, and
that the <U+017F>treets were at that time very full of Rogues,
I was oblig'd to take a Bed with them. This odd
<U+017F>tep <U+017F>av'd me from all the mi<U+017F>chiefs of this affair,
and was the only time that I could <U+017F>ay, I was
oblig'd to fortune for my deliverance; and that tho <U+017F>he
had always cro<U+017F>t my advancement, yet <U+017F>he had not
re<U+017F>olv'd my ruine. The eight Gentlemen who
fought, were the Chevalier <hi>de la Frette, Ovarti</hi> his
Brother, <U+017F>ince called by the name of <hi>d' Amilly,</hi> and is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57806:118"/>
now Lieutenant in the Guards, the Chevalier <hi>de St.
Agnan</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Flammarin,</hi> on the one <U+017F>ide.
The Prince <hi>de Chalais,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Noirmoustier,</hi>
the Marquis <hi>d' Antin,</hi> Brother to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>pan,</hi>
and the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Argenliece</hi> on the other.
The <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was not fatal, only to
the Marqui<U+017F>s <hi>d' Antin,</hi> who was kill'd upon the <U+017F>pot;
but the re<U+017F>t got off cheaper, yet their condition was
bad enough. The King was in a great rage when
he heard of it, but above all at the Chevalier <hi>de St.
Agnan,</hi> who indeed was more to blame than all of
them. In the mean time their danger was equal,
there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity for them to think of getting
out of the Kingdom, and that very privately too;
for the King had given <U+017F>evere orders at all the Ports,
and all the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es on the Confines to <U+017F>top them.
However they got off, <U+017F>ome into <hi>Spain,</hi> <U+017F>ome into
<hi>Portugal,</hi> <U+017F>ome one way, and <U+017F>ome another, as their
own good fortune guided them. But as whatever
a man enjoys in a foreign Country has a <U+017F>ort of
bani<U+017F>hment in it, while he is kept out of his own;
<U+017F>o with all the joy of their e<U+017F>cape, they had every
one time to repent of his folly: No body pittied
the Chevalier <hi>de Agnan,</hi> all the world <U+017F>aid he had no
more than he de<U+017F>erv'd; the Brothers <hi>de la Frette</hi> were
as little as he, for they were <U+017F>o very quarrel<U+017F>om upon
every <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion, that they were very well
compar'd to a vicious Hor<U+017F>e, that will let no other
Hor<U+017F>e come into the Stable. For the re<U+017F>t, every
body was concern'd for them, and would have been
very glad, if it had been po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the King
would have a little wink'd at it on their accounts:
Indeed they were all very hone<U+017F>t Gentlemen, and
de<U+017F>erv'd better fortune; but not one per<U+017F>on dur<U+017F>t
<U+017F>peak to the King for them, and tho the Duke <hi>de
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57806:119"/>
Agnan</hi> was very near to his Per<U+017F>on, yet he was one
of the fir<U+017F>t that told to the King, his Sons Crime
was of a nature too gro<U+017F>s to be forgiven, and that if
he knew where he was, he would be the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hould
bring him to ju<U+017F>tice; that therefore he would not
trouble his head to ask any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour for him, and he
believ'd that all People would be of his mind. This
was a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e well enough for a Court Para<U+017F>ite,
that <U+017F>uited all he <U+017F>aid to the temper of his Prince,
but very ill became a Father, who at lea<U+017F>t ought to
have extenuated the Crime of his Son, not agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it. The Relations of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs <hi>de la Frette</hi> took
other Mea<U+017F>ures. If they dur<U+017F>t not expo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves
to <U+017F>peak to the King, they <U+017F>et all their wits at work
to prevail with him: The Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

who<U+017F>e Husband was Amba<U+017F><U+017F>ador at <hi>Rome,</hi> oblidg'd
him to <U+017F>peak to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and tho the Holy Father
at the <U+017F>ame time ought to ju<U+017F>tify the Kings <U+017F>everity
in the<U+017F>e matters, yet that did not hinder him from
promi<U+017F>ing his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in this occa<U+017F>ion. In <U+017F>hort,
having a Legate re<U+017F>iding at <hi>Paris,</hi> on <U+017F>ome Affairs
needle<U+017F>s for me to repeat, he order'd him to <U+017F>peak
to the King in his name on their behalf: The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>s
could not have employ'd any who<U+017F>e Intere<U+017F>t was
more likely to prevail, the <hi>Pope</hi> having power to
di<U+017F>pence with the Oath, which 'twas <U+017F>uppos'd was
the chief cau<U+017F>e, that made the King <U+017F>o inflexible
to all <U+017F>orts of Application. But he an<U+017F>wer'd the
Legate, that he <U+017F>hould be glad to oblige his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
in any thing, but that in this his hands were
ty'd, and that none but God him<U+017F>elf could di<U+017F>charge
him of an Oath <U+017F>o <U+017F>olemnly taken: Not that he
call'd in que<U+017F>tion the Authority of the Holy See,
but that 'twas for the Honour of God who made
him a King, that he <U+017F>hould be a Prince of his word,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57806:119"/>
and he did not que<U+017F>tion but the Pope him<U+017F>elf would
forbear pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him any farther, if he pleas'd but to
con<U+017F>ider the con<U+017F>equence of it.</p>
            <p>The People ador'd the King when they came to
know the an<U+017F>wer he had made the Pope; and his
Holine<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf, who indeed concern'd him<U+017F>elf in
it, but at the Importunity of the Duke <hi>de Chaulnes</hi>
was overjoy'd at the con<U+017F>tancy of the King; and if
one may credit what I heard from a Per<U+017F>on of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<U+017F>ecretly, thankt the King for the refu<U+017F>al: On the
other hand, the Duke <hi>de St. Agnan</hi> coming to be in
extraordinary Favour <U+017F>oon after, no body doubted
but he would employ it in behalf of his Son, but he
was very cautious; whether 'twas that he <U+017F>aw it
would be to no purpo<U+017F>e, or as others thought, that
he was without natural affections.</p>
            <p>This affair having made a great noi<U+017F>e, as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
with things at fir<U+017F>t, People began now to
forget it, another publick accident happening to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the <hi>Finances</hi> was <U+017F>eiz'd and committed to
Pri<U+017F>on; indeed he had <U+017F>uch powerful Enemies that
'twas a miracle how he e<U+017F>cap'd the Scaffold. About
the time he was Arre<U+017F>ted they gave out <U+017F>everal things
again<U+017F>t him to render him more odious to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but I owe this Te<U+017F>timony to the Truth, to <U+017F>ay
that many of them were really fal<U+017F>e, which I can more
ea<U+017F>ily ju<U+017F>tify, than <U+017F>ay that I had not a hand in <U+017F>ome
of them my <U+017F>elf. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> was a man of a
large Soul, and a very generous Spirit, and 'twould
have appear'd more had he been of any Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion
but of the Long Robe. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> had taken
an aver<U+017F>ion to him, for that he being Procurer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to the Parliament, he could not bear to hear
the Cardinal reflect upon that great Body, of which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57806:120"/>
he had the honour to be a principal Member: He
had however often told the Cardinal that he
would not deny, but there were <U+017F>everal Per<U+017F>ons in
that A<U+017F><U+017F>embly that he could wi<U+017F>h were not: But this
was not <U+017F>atisfaction enough for an <hi>Italian,</hi> who made
nothing to retain a grudge again<U+017F>t a man all the days
of his life, tho being of an effeminate cowardly nature,
he dur<U+017F>t never di<U+017F>cover his malice, but ju<U+017F>t when he
was a dying, and then he told the King, that he was a
man, who not only profu<U+017F>ely wa<U+017F>ted the publick
Trea<U+017F>ure, but al<U+017F>o apply'd great <U+017F>ums of it to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
u<U+017F>e; that he lived in greater <U+017F>plendor than the
King him<U+017F>elf; that his Hou<U+017F>es were finer than the
Royal Palaces, both for the Buildings, and the
Magnificence of the Furniture; that he gave private
Pen<U+017F>ions to <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons about the Court, a
<U+017F>hrewd <U+017F>ign that he had <U+017F>ome dangerous things in his
head; that he had caus'd <hi>Belle I<U+017F>le</hi> to be fortify'd, a
place which he had bought of the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Gondi,</hi>
which had the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> the antient Enemies of the
Kingdom, behind it, <hi>With whom,</hi> <U+017F>ays the Cardinal,
<hi>I will not a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your Majesty he doth not hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondence;</hi>
that the only way to prevent <U+017F>uch a
mi<U+017F>chief, was to <U+017F>trike at the root, and to make <U+017F>ure
of <U+017F>uch a dangerous man<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that neverthele<U+017F>s this was
to be done very cautiou<U+017F>ly, and to be <U+017F>ure not while
he was Procurer General, becau<U+017F>e then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be his Judges, and he would certainly
get off; that therefore he <U+017F>hould take his mea<U+017F>ures
accordingly, and above all, that it <U+017F>hould be done
with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y, that he might be <U+017F>ure to have no
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of it.</p>
            <p>This was ju<U+017F>t at the time of the Cardinal's
Death, who that he might <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf a true
<hi>Italian</hi> to the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ent for this very Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:57806:120"/>
and embrac'd him, calling him one of his be<U+017F>t friends,
mentioning to him the many obligations he had
receiv'd from him during the Civil Wars, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
how he had <U+017F>ent him fifty thou<U+017F>and Crowns,
when he was oblig'd to fly, and retire to <hi>Leige,</hi>
which he had not paid him till a long time after:
But as this was his manner to wheadle with tho<U+017F>e
he had a de<U+017F>ign to betray, <U+017F>o his being upon the
brink of the next world, did not one jot alter his
mea<U+017F>ures; for he left the King prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with all
tho<U+017F>e fine <U+017F>tories he had made of this Mini<U+017F>ter.
His Maje<U+017F>ty, who was perfectly form'd for all tho<U+017F>e
great things we have <U+017F>ince <U+017F>een him execute, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olute
Ma<U+017F>ter of his own <U+017F>ecrets, which is one of
the mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ential qualities of a great man; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
di<U+017F>cover'd his intentions to no <U+017F>oul but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>le Tellier,</hi> who<U+017F>e fidelity he had try'd in too
many occa<U+017F>ions of the la<U+017F>t moment, to have any
cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect; and to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who
the Cardinal had recommended at his death, as a fit
per<U+017F>on to manage the Finances, and the<U+017F>e he made
exactly per<U+017F>ue the method the Cardinal had <U+017F>aid down,
which was not to attempt Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> till they
had got him out of the Office of Procurer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>And now, <U+017F>ince we have occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak of this
Mon<U+017F>ienr <hi>Colbert,</hi> who had been one of the mo<U+017F>t

and in tho<U+017F>e days he was counted a very hone<U+017F>t man.
My Si<U+017F>ter, whom I told you of, had a great Trial
about the birth of her Son, had by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a certain rent charge upon the <hi>Ho<U+017F>tel de Ville,</hi> and

the <U+017F>ealing of it, we made them look over all the

that neither his name nor ours was to be <U+017F>een in it:
The only refuge we had left, was the Oath he was to
take, but our friends having very well ob<U+017F>erv'd to
us, that he that was Knave enough to cheat us,
would al<U+017F>o be Villain enough to for<U+017F>wear him<U+017F>elf,
we were advis'd to make up the matter; <U+017F>o we gave

he was admired both by his friends and his enemies;
but the latter, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ully an action that got him <U+017F>o much
honor, reported pre<U+017F>ently, that he had robb'd the
King of <U+017F>uch Sums, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter was not
worth his taking notice of; and as nothing is <U+017F>ooner
credited than an ill report, every body believ'd it,
till by the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of his affairs it appear'd, that he was
<U+017F>o far from having made him<U+017F>elf rich, that he was
above two Millions in debt. Being thus out of that
Po<U+017F>t, which was his Protection, the King thought
it be<U+017F>t to make a <hi>Tour</hi> into <hi>Bretagne,</hi> before he

<U+017F>tartled abundance of people, nor were
they le<U+017F>s <U+017F>orry for him, for tho it happen'd at a time

people, by rea<U+017F>on of the great Taxes, yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

from the re<U+017F>t, who they had markt out as the publick
grievance of the people; others were mov'd chiefly
by their intere<U+017F>t, for he had oblig'd the affections of
abundance by <U+017F>uffering them to get by him, and the<U+017F>e
could not <U+017F>ee him carry'd to Pri<U+017F>on without regret,
who had done every body rather good than harm;
and if he had been guilty of any thing, 'twas
only under the Mini<U+017F>try of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and in
executing his orders too punctually. But that which
mov'd them mo<U+017F>t to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, was to <U+017F>ee the
King put <hi>Colbert</hi> in his place, one who under the

ambition, always deceitful, tho he pretended to be
fair, preaching hone<U+017F>ty in all his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, while

nothing but Clemency and Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
of not one good quality, but that he knew how
with an exqui<U+017F>ite art to hide his own faults. People
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57806:123"/>
thought him a man wholly given up to bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, one
that had no time for Softne<U+017F><U+017F>es and Plea<U+017F>ures, and
yet no man was more Debaucht than he; he had his
hours for his Amours and his hours for his Publick
Affairs, only with this difference, that in the latter
he always put on a <U+017F>tarcht formal gravity; but in the
other appear'd with a free humour, and an air of
Gallantry.</p>

him that 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to invent; as that
he had Debaucht the greate<U+017F>t part of the Women of
the Court, by means of his money; and his end in
this was, that their Relations and Friends, who
would perhaps have a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him in his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<U+017F>hould be provoked rather to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t in his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine:
And in this ca<U+017F>e perhaps I can give a better
account than mo<U+017F>t People; as for in<U+017F>tance, they
had rais'd a report when the Queen Mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd

was on his <U+017F>core, when I am a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd upon very
good grounds, that it was for entertaining the
Marquis <hi>de Richelieu</hi> again<U+017F>t her Maje<U+017F>ties expre<U+017F>s
Command: This Lady, who was one of her Maids

acquainted with, and that <U+017F>o much, as I was <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for her: <U+017F>he was co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ted
one of the fine<U+017F>t women in the Court, and therefore
I was not at all di<U+017F>pleas'd to have it thought <U+017F>o, for
except <hi>Madamoi<U+017F>el de Meneville</hi> (who had her Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
there was none that would pretend to di<U+017F>pute
it. 'Twas not for me to decide the ca<U+017F>e between
the<U+017F>e two Beauties, being <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to be partial,
from what I have <U+017F>aid before. But to come to the
Story, One day as I was at <hi>Fountain Bleau,</hi> where
both the Queens continued while the King was in
<hi>Bretagne,</hi> <U+017F>he came to me in a great concern, and
with tears in her Eyes told me, <U+017F>he was ruin'd if I
I did not <U+017F>erve her in one affair, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to convey into her Chamber a Suit of Mens
Cloaths; but that I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ure not to be di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
for <U+017F>he had a great many Eyes upon her: I
askt her what the occa<U+017F>ion was, and if <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o
much concern'd in the di<U+017F>grace of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
as to oblige her to fly for it? <hi>No,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, <hi>'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that, I never was intimate enough with him to
be <U+017F>o very much concern'd for his misfortune; but this
I'll confe<U+017F>s to you, they will have it, that Love has caus'd
me to commit <U+017F>ome faults, fooli<U+017F>h enough to be puni<U+017F>h'd
for: That impertinent old Jade</hi> de Beauvais <hi>has been
buzzing in the Ears of the Queen Mother, that I have
<U+017F>een her Son in Law; and her Maje<U+017F>ty, who <U+017F>uffers
her <U+017F>elf to be govern'd by that Wretch, re<U+017F>ents it <U+017F>o highly,
that <U+017F>he has order'd one of my Relations to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me
into a Cloy<U+017F>ter; I mean the Counte<U+017F>s</hi> de Maulevrier,
<hi>the <U+017F>ame who<U+017F>e Husband you had formerly a quarrel
with; therefore for Gods <U+017F>ake deliver me out of her
hands, and do as I have de<U+017F>ir'd you; and then be <U+017F>o kind
as to get me a Hor<U+017F>e, and place him at the Kings Wine

            <p>If I had been in Love, as the World would have
me be thought, I leave any one to judge how this
Compliment would have pleas'd me; but having
really never pretended any thing of that nature to
her, I was very ready to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
at the occa<U+017F>ion: <U+017F>o I <U+017F>ent one of my Hor<U+017F>es to

Chamber with a Suit of my own Cloths; but there
being no body there to take it, I put it under the
Bed as <U+017F>he had order'd me; and the Chambers or
Lodgings of the Maids of Honour being always
open to the Gallery, I went and fell into a chat with
the good old Lady, Madam <hi>du Tilleul</hi> under <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>
of the Ladies: who was one of my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and walking up and down with her, I
<U+017F>aw lying upon the <hi>Toilet</hi> <U+017F>everal Combs, and a

the Lips too, and <U+017F>o without any con<U+017F>ideration, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<U+017F>ome to mine, they being a little chopt; but I
<U+017F>oon paid for my curio<U+017F>ity, for immediately my Lips
were all on fire, my Mouth was contracted, my

I made Madam <hi>du Tilleul</hi> laugh at that rate, that I

and which was wor<U+017F>t of all, I was not able to

that at my Age I ought to know that there are <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<U+017F>orts of Pomatum; that the <U+017F>ort I had meddl'd

but was de<U+017F>ign'd for another <U+017F>ort of u<U+017F>e; after he
had had his fill of this rallying, he left me, and went
to the Apartments of the Queen Mother, where he
made his Court at the expence of my misfortune. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
all the Town came to <U+017F>ee me, and finding
that I had really furni<U+017F>h'd them with <U+017F>ufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their mirth, I would have been one of the
fir<U+017F>t to have laught at the Je<U+017F>t, if I could but have
open'd my Mouth. This adventure was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the whole Court, for at lea<U+017F>t a
Week, they were <U+017F>o taken with it, that they <U+017F>ent
an account of it to <hi>Nants</hi> where the King was, who
as <U+017F>erious as he was, could not forbear <U+017F>miling at

though I wa<U+017F>h'd my Mouth often with fre<U+017F>h Water,
and <U+017F>ometimes with warm Wine, yet nothing but
time would bring me to rights again.</p>
            <p>This little di<U+017F>grace however hindred me from

abroad again, I could not hear any tidings of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoi<U+017F>elle
<hi>De la Motthe,</hi> but then I was pre<U+017F>ently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that the Counte<U+017F>s <hi>de Maulevriere</hi> had put her
into a Cloi<U+017F>ter at <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aliot,</hi> and that this confinement,
which was a true Pri<U+017F>on to her, was accompanied
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57806:125"/>
with a very <U+017F>evere reprimand made her by the
Queen Mother: I was inform'd al<U+017F>o, that this Lady
who was blindly in love with the Marquis <hi>de Richlieu,</hi>
had given her <U+017F>elf a great deal of liberty, in reflecting
upon <hi>la Beauvais,</hi> notwith<U+017F>tanding the re<U+017F>pect which
<U+017F>he ought to have had for the Queen; and reproacht
her among other things, that <U+017F>he took occa<U+017F>ion to
wait upon the King when he was but very young,
and to make him this civil reque<U+017F>t, that his Maje<U+017F>ty
would be pleas'd to lye with her. I could not ea<U+017F>ily
believe Madam <hi>la Motthe</hi> could be guilty of <U+017F>o great
a folly, but the thing being confirm'd to me by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, I askt them if what <U+017F>he reproacht the little
old Lady with one Eye for, was true, and if his
Maje<U+017F>ty had been <U+017F>o charitable as to oblige her?
They told me, that was not a thing to be que<U+017F>tion'd,
and askt me where I had liv'd, that I <U+017F>hould be the
only man in <hi>France</hi> that was <U+017F>o ignorant.</p>
            <p>Tho this was the true Hi<U+017F>tory of Madamoi<U+017F>elle
<hi>de la Motthe,</hi> yet Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Colbert</hi> had maliciou<U+017F>ly
nam'd her among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e, whom as he <U+017F>aid, Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>Fouquet</hi> had been intriguing withal; but this was a
<U+017F>mall matter compar'd to the other methods he us'd
for his ruine. He pickt out <U+017F>uch Members of the
<U+017F>everal Parliaments as he thought were the mo<U+017F>t
needy, and who watcht for an occa<U+017F>ion to oblige the
Court, to be his Judges: The<U+017F>e he fed with hopes,
and made them large promi<U+017F>es of Preferment, if
they would give their voices as he directed, and
upon this account was <U+017F>o confident of his de<U+017F>truction,
that he gave order to have a Scaffold made privately
ready for the occa<U+017F>ion. In the mean time he had <U+017F>o
firmly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t the King, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> could
not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly clear him<U+017F>elf, that his Maje<U+017F>ty had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
his Hor<U+017F>e Guards to attend him to <hi>Chartres;</hi> a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57806:126"/>
journey which he had contriv'd, not for any Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as was pretended, but to be out of the way of
any Applications, which he fore<U+017F>aw would be made
to him on behalf of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet;</hi> for tho he was
of no extraordinary Family him<U+017F>elf, he had marry'd
one of his Daughters to the elde<U+017F>t Son of the Count
<hi>de Charo<U+017F>t,</hi> and the King was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <U+017F>he would
throw her<U+017F>elf at his feet for her Father. Thus the
King <U+017F>tood ready to be gone, the very moment they

Pri<U+017F>oner; He told them he was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht to find
<U+017F>uch prejudice in that Court again<U+017F>t a man, as to
<U+017F>eem re<U+017F>olv'd on any terms, right or wrong, to hurry
him out of the world; that at fir<U+017F>t view indeed
there might be <U+017F>ome appearance of guilt; there had
been found, 'twas true, among his papers, a rough
<U+017F>cheme of a Rebellion, with <U+017F>everal methods how
to rai<U+017F>e it, and other projects for his conduct in <U+017F>uch
an affair, when it <U+017F>hould be brought to pa<U+017F>s; and

<U+017F>eem to de<U+017F>erve no le<U+017F>s than death: But when one
came to examine into the the proofs of the<U+017F>e Crimes,
there was cau<U+017F>e enough at lea<U+017F>t to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend ones
Judgment again<U+017F>t him; this was found among a
parcel of old wa<U+017F>te Papers, thrown by, not only into a
corner of the Room, but into the Chimny, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd
for nothing but the Fire, as Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>
had very well ob<U+017F>erv'd in his defence; that there
was no other marks of it, but as of a thing form'd in
his mind, provokt to it by the barbarous u<U+017F>age of
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who upon all occa<U+017F>ions had not
fail'd to te<U+017F>tifie his malice again<U+017F>t him; that, 'twas a

puni<U+017F>h'd for thinking Trea<U+017F>on, nor for intending, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s

like it in this ca<U+017F>e, but on the contrary, very
evident tokens that he had laid a<U+017F>ide <U+017F>o much as the

than God him<U+017F>elf, who <U+017F>o graciou<U+017F>ly pa<U+017F><U+017F>es

there was <U+017F>omething of more con<U+017F>equence than all
this that had been <U+017F>aid, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Fouquet</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
expre<U+017F>ly that he had wherewithal to prove
beyond contradiction, his repentance of that very
intention, if they had not inhumantly <U+017F>tole away his
Papers; that 'twas true tho<U+017F>e words might be <U+017F>poken
only to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, but 'twas al<U+017F>o true, that it
might be really <U+017F>o; this was certain, and not to
be denyed, that they had found among his Papers
<U+017F>everal Petitions adre<U+017F>s'd to Mon<U+017F>. <hi>Colbert,</hi> with the
title of my Lord, which was never given to him till
<U+017F>ince the impri<U+017F>onment of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet;</hi> that
this was a proof, they had come into his Hou<U+017F>e
without his knowledge, and <U+017F>earcht there at their
own plea<U+017F>ure; and 'twas an infallible con<U+017F>equence,
that they did <U+017F>o with a de<U+017F>ign to ruin him, becau<U+017F>e,
that under pretence of <U+017F>earching in that manner, they
had carried away all the Papers which he <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e
for his Ju<U+017F>tification; that notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, he
had clear'd him<U+017F>elf of the great Crime; his enemies
made <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tir about, of wa<U+017F>ting the Revenues of
the Crown; that he had laid before them an account
of his e<U+017F>tate, what he had when he entered upon the
Mini<U+017F>try, and what he had with his Wife; (which
rogether amounted to above a million) what Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
he had received, and what had <U+017F>ell to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other occa<U+017F>ions. And though the<U+017F>e were very
con<U+017F>iderable, yet he had not only <U+017F>pent all this in the

<U+017F>ervice of his Maje<U+017F>ty, but was run into Debt above
two Millions: that his extravagance ought not to
be reckon'd criminal, <U+017F>ince he had means enough of
his own to do it, without wrong to the King, and
he had done no injury to any body, but him<U+017F>elf,
poor man, and his Family.</p>
            <p>The greate<U+017F>t part of the Judges were amaz'd, not
<U+017F>o much at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this man, tho' that had a

to <U+017F>et him in the right way, all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>poke
after him, were of the <U+017F>ame mind, and tho<U+017F>e who had
before given their Voices for his Condemnation, being
a<U+017F>ham'd of <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t a Sentence; retracted their
judgment, <U+017F>o that in a moment, there was <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch
a change in the Court, as if <U+017F>ome influence from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
had wrought a miracle upon them: However,
as there was cau<U+017F>e enough to inflict <U+017F>ome puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> either for that project
of a revolt I mention'd, or that he had fortifyed
<hi>Bell I<U+017F>le</hi> on his own account, they thought fit to
condemn him to Bani<U+017F>hment. They were very much
<U+017F>urprized at Court, at a Sentence <U+017F>o little expected;
and it quite broke off their journey to <hi>Chartres,</hi> and
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Colbert</hi> fearing that if Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi>
<U+017F>hould ever be at liberty, he would find an occa<U+017F>ion,

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57806:127"/>
this was the Pennance for his faults, for they who
knew him in that place of Per<U+017F>ecution, <U+017F>ay he made
<U+017F>o good u<U+017F>e of it, that nothing could have happen'd
more to his advantage. And <U+017F>ince I have nam'd
this, I cannot forbear telling you a <U+017F>tory, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
upon the occa<U+017F>ion of his meeting with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur

this account. Upon the fir<U+017F>t meeting they <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
one another, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
immediately where he had <U+017F>een him, askt
him his Name? Whether or no he had forgot him
in the time of his Di<U+017F>grace: Or that, as 'twas mo<U+017F>t
likely, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Lau<U+017F>un</hi> was not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable
in his time, as to be known to him? But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>De Lau<U+017F>un</hi> having given him <U+017F>atisfaction who he
was, goes on to make him<U+017F>elf known to him, with
the common vanity of telling ones own Hi<U+017F>tory, by
acquainting him with the particulars of his life.</p>
            <p>Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> heard him very intently, for he
was extreamly <U+017F>urpriz'd at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

his Office of Collonel General of the Dragoons, in
the Army which marcht into <hi>Italy;</hi> how he had askt
the King to be made General, and upon the refu<U+017F>al

gave him the hearing, but ob<U+017F>erving the man, and
taking notice of the very mean figure he made, he
could not per<U+017F>wade him<U+017F>elf, the King, who was a

Prince of the nice<U+017F>t judgment, and known to be of a

Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> conceal'd his <U+017F>entiments, and would
by no means interrupt him, but when he came to
relate his Marriage with Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Montpen<U+017F>ier,</hi>
how the King had given his con<U+017F>ent to it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
recall'd it, and the concern that Prince<U+017F>s was
in at the di<U+017F>appointment, and all the con<U+017F>equences of
that affair; he could not forbear turning to another
Pri<U+017F>oner of State, that had join'd them ju<U+017F>t before,
and making a <U+017F>ign to his Forehead, as we do when
we would <U+017F>ignifie a man is craz'd, he gave him to
under<U+017F>tand that he thought no better of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Lau<U+017F>un</hi> perceiv'd it, but made
as if he took no notice of it, and went on with other
<U+017F>trange pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of his life, which did but confirm
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> in his former opinion.</p>

Daughter of one of the<U+017F>e Officers, with whom he
was to have two Millions of Livres. This Duke
being very much in favour, as we have formerly

'Twas thought he made this promi<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
the Duke being not very rich, and he had
a pro<U+017F>pect of marrying her more advantageou<U+017F>ly;
but whatever his thoughts were, he dur<U+017F>t not have
gone back from his word, if the Count <hi>de Seri</hi> had
liv'd to accept of it: Wherefore to pre<U+017F>erve his

had pleas'd God to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his Son, yet that he
had another left, and tho he was young, that <U+017F>hould
not hinder their alliance, <U+017F>ince he had a younger
Daughter of a <U+017F>uitable age, and he would give him

Gentility; and before the King had any thoughts of
her, there was a Gentleman <U+017F>o in love with her, that
he intended to marry her; he was of a very good
family near <hi>Chartres,</hi> and Heir to an E<U+017F>tate of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thou<U+017F>and Livres a year, which was counted an

and was a Lieutenant in the Guards; he had
but one misfortune, which was, that his E<U+017F>tate lay
<U+017F>o much in the power of his Father, that he dur<U+017F>t not
marry without his con<U+017F>ent: So he was oblig'd to
leave his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s for a while, to <U+017F>ollicit the old
Gentleman upon that account. It was gone <U+017F>o far

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57806:129"/>
he had a Father to deal with, that requir'd more time

meanne<U+017F>s of her Birth, and e<U+017F>pecially of her E<U+017F>tate,
were difficulties which were not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon over with
him, but took up <U+017F>o much time, that when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
things, and return'd at la<U+017F>t with his Fathers
con<U+017F>ent, he found things were <U+017F>trangely alter'd in
his ab<U+017F>ence, for the King had not only appear'd to
be in love with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>he had prevented
his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es by making a di<U+017F>covery of her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion

made <U+017F>trange of it, and return'd that <U+017F>he knew no

Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Colbert</hi> engag'd in all the intere<U+017F>ts of
Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de la Valliere,</hi> from the fir<U+017F>t moment
that he found <U+017F>he had an influence upon the King,
and this gave him the advantage of all pretenders to
the Kings favour. In the mean time, I, who had
liv'd all my days among the Grandees, found my
<U+017F>elf now as it were alone, and forgotten of all the
world, and if it had not been for my little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
I have <U+017F>o often mention'd, I <U+017F>hould have
been in but an ordinary condition. My Father was
yet living, and tho he was very ea<U+017F>y on account of
his family, mo<U+017F>t of them being provided for by the
good Offices I had done them, yet I could never have
the benefit of the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>upply from him; on the
contrary, if a Gla<U+017F>s of Water would have <U+017F>av'd my
life, I verily believe, he would have <U+017F>uffer'd me to
peri<U+017F>h for want of that relief: This was a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
grief to me when I reflected on it; but as it pleas'd
God I was not quite reduc'd, I bore it with the more
patience, e<U+017F>pecially when I con<U+017F>ider'd, that it was
not from any fault of mine. At la<U+017F>t, about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the year 1663. I receiv'd a Letter from
his Curate to come down with all <U+017F>peed, if I had
any de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him before he dy'd. I had no bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
to hinder me, <U+017F>o I took Po<U+017F>t immediately, and
in <U+017F>ix hours time I was at his Hou<U+017F>e; he was <U+017F>urpriz'd
to <U+017F>ee me, and imagin'd pre<U+017F>ently that I had been
privately <U+017F>ent for, but however he made as if he
was glad to <U+017F>ee me, and told me I had prevented him,
for his de<U+017F>ign was to have <U+017F>ent for me; that he being
weak, and his great age making it improbable that
he <U+017F>hould recover, he was willing to <U+017F>ettle his affairs,
and as there was nothing he de<U+017F>ir'd to prevent more,
than Law Suits among Relations, he did not <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
I would refu<U+017F>e, con<U+017F>idering the condition in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57806:130"/>
which I <U+017F>aw him, to agree matters now with his
Wife and my Brothers; and he pretended to oblige
me in doing it. For this purpo<U+017F>e he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old me, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his E<U+017F>tate <U+017F>hould be equally divided, his
Wife coming in for a part, be<U+017F>ides her Joynture;
that this was for my advantage, for <U+017F>he had brought
a great fortune to him, and which his E<U+017F>tate was
engag'd for; <U+017F>o that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come to demand
it, as is cu<U+017F>tomary in like ca<U+017F>es, <U+017F>he would carry
away above half the E<U+017F>tate. I made no an<U+017F>wer at
all to a Propo<U+017F>al <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t, he having no regard in
that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to the Joynture of my own Mother,
which was my Birthright, and which he ought to
have re<U+017F>erv'd for me, when he marry'd again. He
took my <U+017F>ilence in this ca<U+017F>e for an a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al,
and without pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing me to any reply, <U+017F>ent
away for a Notary. I <U+017F>uffer'd all this without giving
him the trouble of any contradiction, in re<U+017F>pect to
his indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; but when I <U+017F>aw the Notary was
come, and he began to dictate the<U+017F>e things to him.
I beg'd him to defer it, till I <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>ome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
about it; that I de<U+017F>ir'd him to remember, that
I was his Son as well as the re<U+017F>t, that they had always
enjoy'd the priviledges of his hou<U+017F>e, which I had
been depriv'd of. That his elde<U+017F>t Son by this <U+017F>econd
Wife was already provided with two good Benefices,
<U+017F>o that he might not only very well bate his Legacy,
but was in a good condition to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t his younger
Brother; that I had di<U+017F>pos'd of his Daughter, who
was rich enough al<U+017F>o to have no need of it; that I
did not <U+017F>ay this with any thought of depriving her
of the Inheritance, nor to take that from them
which Nature had given them a right to, but that
he ought to con<U+017F>ider me upon the <U+017F>ame account;
that I would con<U+017F>ent, if he pleas'd, that he <U+017F>hould
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57806:131"/>
give my Mother-in-law a Pen<U+017F>ion as large as he
thought fit, which I was ready to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>irm, and al<U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to my younge<U+017F>t Brother, that <U+017F>o, if his Brother

to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t; but for the re<U+017F>t he mu<U+017F>t permit

            <p>There was nothing could be more fair than my
Propo<U+017F>al, and indeed it was a meer impoveri<U+017F>hing

to my Mother-in-law and her Children, that
he would certainly have got up and <U+017F>truck me, if he
had been able to lift him<U+017F>elf up in the Bed; he told
me, that now he <U+017F>aw all that had been <U+017F>aid to him of
me confirm'd; that I was an unnatural Dog, and
one that would <U+017F>horten his days by my Di<U+017F>obedience;
that he had made me a Propo<U+017F>al too much to my
advantage, but that I would deprive my <U+017F>elf of it
purely in malice to di<U+017F>turb the Family; that he did
not wonder I had <U+017F>o many broils with my Ma<U+017F>ters,
who were better acquainted with my humours than
him; that another in my place would have made
his fortune, but that God had dealt with me as I had

might not be di<U+017F>compos'd at his departing out of the

would leave me his hearty Cur<U+017F>e, and that I <U+017F>hould
con<U+017F>ider of it, whether I was willing he <U+017F>hould dye

and labouring to make him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that
what I demanded was nothing but ju<U+017F>tice. I told
him once more, that if he did not plea<U+017F>e to let things
go in the ordinary way of Ju<U+017F>tice, for fear they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57806:131"/>
<U+017F>hould be too much to the prejudice of my Mother-in-law,
I was willing they <U+017F>hould have the E<U+017F>tate
who wanted; that I had as much occa<U+017F>ion of it as
any of them, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince there was a talk of
<U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Bank of <hi>Lyon,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t of retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the particular rents of it; that my
Brother the Abbot was like to be richer than all of
us together, from whom I had rea<U+017F>on to expect
nothing, <U+017F>ince, tho he ow'd all his fortunes to my
procurement, he never offer'd me a farthing when

            <p>My Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion perhaps might make me think this the

<U+017F>o indeed, but my Father it <U+017F>eems was of another

the E<U+017F>tate, and <U+017F>et my Seal upon the Goods, which
you may be <U+017F>ure put my Mother-in-law into a great
rage: She, who, when I did all I could to oblige
her, per<U+017F>ecuted me with <U+017F>o much cruelty, would not
fail to exclaim again<U+017F>t me upon this proceeding; I did
now as I us'd to do formerly, let her <U+017F>ay what <U+017F>he
pleas'd, and the rather, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he never had more
occa<U+017F>ion; however that <U+017F>he might have nothing
ju<U+017F>tly to reproach me with, and not out of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tru<U+017F>t
of my own Title, I offer'd her a thou<U+017F>and
Crowns a year, provided <U+017F>he would relinqui<U+017F>h her
other preten<U+017F>ions: this was a Pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>he ought to
have look'd upon as very civil in me, for in ju<U+017F>tice
<U+017F>he could hope for nothing but her own Fortune, of
which the be<U+017F>t part was never paid; but <U+017F>he having
taken <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ures which I knew nothing of, <U+017F>ent
me word, that I ought to have accepted the offers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57806:132"/>
my Father had made me, if I had been well advis'd;
but that <U+017F>ince I had not, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee in a <U+017F>hort time
whether I was in the right or no.</p>
            <p>This <U+017F>ort of talk did not trouble me, having no
apprehen<U+017F>ions of the trick they were going to play
me, but I went on to make out my Title, and was
bu<U+017F>ie with the Advocates, who according to their
rules, declar'd, I ought to have the whole E<U+017F>tate, if
it was never <U+017F>o great: So I concluded to take off the
Seals which I had put on, which I did in the cu<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
form, and found among the papers, that my
Mother-in-law was a <hi>Feme <U+017F>ole</hi> by the Contract of
Marriage: I <U+017F>uppos'd my Ca<U+017F>e was the better for
that, becau<U+017F>e that then if there had been any pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made out of her money, the E<U+017F>tate was not
an<U+017F>werable for them; and imagining, that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he
had <U+017F>hown <U+017F>o much ill nature, <U+017F>he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
this particular, I was <U+017F>uch a Fool to tell her
of it; but all the an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>he made me was, that the
end of the matter would di<U+017F>cover the truth, and
perhaps it might <U+017F>poil my mirth I could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
for the <U+017F>oul of me what <U+017F>he had in her head,
till at la<U+017F>t it di<U+017F>cover'd it <U+017F>elf in a moment, to my no
<U+017F>mall di<U+017F>turbance. The per<U+017F>on that made the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
brought me a bag of papers ty'd together, with
a Ballet or Ticket upon it, in which was written
with my Mothers own hand as follows, <hi>Di<U+017F>bur<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paid of my Money out of the <U+017F>everal parts of my
allowance, due to me from my Husband, for which I have
the Preference of Demand upon his E<U+017F>tate, before all other
Debts.</hi> I was not much <U+017F>urpriz'd at this, till I had
look'd a little further; but taking the papers out of
the bag, I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome contracts of Settlements, made
by my Grandfather to <U+017F>ome particular per<U+017F>ons in tru<U+017F>t,
for payment of Debts, one of which was for no
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57806:132"/>
le<U+017F>s than fifty thou<U+017F>and Crowns; <U+017F>o that if what
my Mother pretended had been ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he might well
<U+017F>ay, I had no cau<U+017F>e to laugh, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>poil my Mirth;
for I was remov'd out of the Family when I was but
a Child, and had never any account of their
affairs, <U+017F>o that I could <U+017F>ay nothing to this till I was
better inform'd: I <U+017F>aw well enough there was a
juggle in it, and the mo<U+017F>t favourable con<U+017F>truction I
could pa<U+017F>s on it, as to my Mother-in-law was, that
<U+017F>he had imploy'd the Revenue of her Sons Benefices
to her own u<U+017F>e; that which confirm'd me in this
thought was, that tho my Brother the Abbot left all
his affairs to the management of his Father and
Mother, yet I found but eight Livres and a half of
ready Money in the Hou<U+017F>e when my Father dy'd, a
fine <U+017F>um for a Family that made <U+017F>uch a figure in the
Country; or rather a very good mark of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
extraordinary management. However, after I
had mus'd upon this Ca<U+017F>e a while, I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider,
that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible my Grandfather <U+017F>hould
leave <U+017F>o many Debts, <U+017F>ince the whole E<U+017F>tate did not
amount to more, and my Father had marry'd two
of his Si<U+017F>ters, and had paid them five and twenty
thou<U+017F>and Livres each for their Portions; and from
hence I thought this was an infallible con<U+017F>equence,
that my Father was far enough from having his E<U+017F>tate
<U+017F>o much encumber'd; but that they were old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
that they had reviv'd by <U+017F>ome clande<U+017F>tine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
to make preten<U+017F>ions upon the E<U+017F>tate; the
chief of tho<U+017F>e Creditors being all Relations of one
kind or another to my Mother-in-law.</p>
            <p>I acquainted <U+017F>ome very judicious per<U+017F>ons with my
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picions, who were pre<U+017F>ently of my opinion, and
after them the Lawyers, who advis'd me however,
before I made any <U+017F>tir about it, or commenc'd any
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57806:133"/>
Suit at Law in the ca<U+017F>e, which could not but be
very inconvenient to me, that I <U+017F>hould try if I
could any way underhand di<U+017F>cover the Cheat. I
try'd all the ways that I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly think of,
having <U+017F>et <U+017F>everal Per<U+017F>ons of Quality of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to work for me, who knew what I had done
for the Family, and were mov'd to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to
<U+017F>ee me us'd in <U+017F>uch a manner: But tho they us'd their
utmo<U+017F>t skill<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and very heartily too, the Agents my
Mother-in-law had employ'd, had plaid their game
too <U+017F>ure to be di<U+017F>cover'd, and no doubt had been
well enough paid, <U+017F>o that all our endeavours were
to no purpo<U+017F>e, and I was forc'd at la<U+017F>t to begin a
tedious Suit at Law. Then I charg'd them with
Forgery concerning tho<U+017F>e pretended Reinbur<U+017F>ements,
and having obtain'd the liberty to publi<U+017F>h a Monitory
thereof, I caus'd it to be read in the Churches of
tho<U+017F>e Pari<U+017F>hes where they liv'd, whom I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected
had a hand in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aud, hoping that the time of
<hi>Chri<U+017F>tmas</hi> being at hand, when every one was to pa<U+017F>s
for Ab<U+017F>olution, 'twould oblige them to con<U+017F>ult <U+017F>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
with their Con<U+017F>ciences. My Si<U+017F>ter <U+017F>how'd
me at this time a particular mark of her Gratitude;
<U+017F>he came to me and told me, that tho <U+017F>he knew
what <U+017F>he was going to <U+017F>ay would embroil her with
her Mother, if ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come to hear of it,
<U+017F>he would neverthele<U+017F>s witne<U+017F>s the truth <U+017F>o far as to
tell me, that <U+017F>he had heard my Father often <U+017F>ay, in
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of <U+017F>everal things with my Mother-in-law,
that his Father had not left him one Farthing in
debt, but that on the other hand he found eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Franks of ready money in the hou<U+017F>e at his death:
She told me <U+017F>he remember'd this, as perfectly as if it
had not been above a quarter of an hour ago, and
that if it would do me any <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>he would make
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57806:133"/>
               <hi>affidavit</hi> of it before a Judge: I gave her a thou<U+017F>and
thanks for her good will, but not being willing <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould incur the hatred of her Mother for her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to me, I told her it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffice me to <U+017F>ee
<U+017F>uch a proof of her Love, without making her a
<U+017F>acrifice; that I was <U+017F>orry I was in no better a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for her <U+017F>ake; that I had re<U+017F>olv'd <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
be my Heir to that little I had, for I lov'd <U+017F>uch an
hone<U+017F>t principle; in <U+017F>hort, <U+017F>he did all I could de<U+017F>ire,
for <U+017F>he gave me a Declaration two or three days
after, whereby <U+017F>he relinqui<U+017F>ht any claim for her part
in any thing her Mother might pretend upon my
Fathers E<U+017F>tate, acknowledging that it all belong'd
to me, and charging her Son, in ca<U+017F>e of her Death,
not to meddle with it, but to make me re<U+017F>titution:
She forc'd the paper of this into my hands, and
made me take it, but I laught at her, and having
torn it in her <U+017F>ight, I told her we <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the ca<U+017F>e between her and I, if there was
no body el<U+017F>e concern'd; that I took this as kindly
of her, which <U+017F>he had now done, as if <U+017F>he had given
me a hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns; and that all my
trouble was, that I was not in a condition to requite
her kindne<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Our Cau<U+017F>e, which had at fir<U+017F>t been commenc'd in
the Country, was quickly brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> by the
means of one of my Mother-in-laws pretended
Creditors, who <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve her the
better there, where he had a great intere<U+017F>t, made
her remove it to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he did all his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.
I was <U+017F>o far from being <U+017F>orry for this, that they could
not have pleas'd me better, having perhaps as many
friends there as he, and hop'd they would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me in a Cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o very ju<U+017F>t. In <U+017F>hort, every one
proffer'd me his <U+017F>ervice, and I that had always hated
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57806:134"/>
Law Suits above all things, carry'd on this with <U+017F>o
much vigour, that I minded nothing el<U+017F>e. When I
think of this <U+017F>ometimes, I wonder what it was
wrought <U+017F>o great a change in me, unle<U+017F>s it was, that
my Mother having on all occa<U+017F>ions exa<U+017F>perated me,
I was very willing to have my turn in vexing her too,
and plague her as much as I could. In the mean
time however, the Cau<U+017F>e was again<U+017F>t me, and every
body told me, that when it came to a hearing I
<U+017F>hould be ca<U+017F>t, unle<U+017F>s I could produce <U+017F>ome Deeds
to make out the Cheat I pretended was put upon
me. I had brought the Contracts of my two Aunts,
whereby it appear'd they had receiv'd fifty thou<U+017F>and
Franks, and that 'twas likely my Father had a great
deal more, becau<U+017F>e we liv'd in a Country where
'twas the cu<U+017F>tom to be favourable to the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but the Lawyers laught at this, and told me,
that in matters of Law they did not u<U+017F>e to judge by
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition.</p>
            <p>I was to be <U+017F>ure <U+017F>trangely embarra<U+017F>t at this <U+017F>ort of
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elf at the point to be ca<U+017F>t for
the charges; when a certain Councellor of the
Great Chamber <U+017F>ent to me to tell me, that if I
would promi<U+017F>e to marry his Daughter, he would
engage I <U+017F>hould carry my Cau<U+017F>e. I askt of the
Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger who this Councellor was, but he told
me, he was not to tell me, unle<U+017F>s I accepted the
propo<U+017F>ition; but that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I had given him my
word, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee both my Father-in-law and his
Daughter. I reply'd, that folks did not u<U+017F>e to
marry they know not who, and before I promis'd
any thing, I <U+017F>hould be very willing to know who I
had to do with; that in the fir<U+017F>t place the propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<U+017F>eem'd a little freaki<U+017F>h, or to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, it
<U+017F>eem'd to come from a man that was not very <U+017F>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57806:134"/>
that my Father-in-law pretended belike to
<U+017F>ell me Ju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>ince it might chance I <U+017F>hould buy it
with the lo<U+017F>s of my Liberty, and perhaps of my
Honour; and in the <U+017F>econd place, this caution he
us'd to get my promi<U+017F>e before I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uffer'd to
know him, lookt as if he had no great confidence of
his own reputation; that I could not imagin who it
<U+017F>hould be, and could gue<U+017F>s but two or three per<U+017F>ons,
whom I would not name; but if it was any one of
them, I defy'd them, and would rather run the
hazard of being mi<U+017F>erable all my life, than to buy
my E<U+017F>tate with <U+017F>o di<U+017F>honourable a Match: The
man let me go on without the lea<U+017F>t interruption, till
I had quite done, and then <U+017F>hrugging up his <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he told me, this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e from a man of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
year old would be well enough, but for one that
had <U+017F>een almo<U+017F>t fifty, 'twas an inexcu<U+017F>able folly,
that I call'd it then <U+017F>elling of Ju<U+017F>tice; that he would
help me with his credit and intere<U+017F>t; what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had a man to prefer my intere<U+017F>t before my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-laws,
who in all appearance had the right on
her <U+017F>ide; that tho<U+017F>e Gentlemen who I talkt <U+017F>o <U+017F>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalou<U+017F>ly
of, were at the <U+017F>ame time the chief men in
the Parliament; that all per<U+017F>ons were at their beck,
and that if I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>o little wit and <U+017F>o much
boldne<U+017F>s, to offer them any ill language, I <U+017F>hould
certainly lo<U+017F>e my Cau<U+017F>e, which if I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o
much a Fool to do, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>oon al<U+017F>o be made to
pay the co<U+017F>ts; and that if he <U+017F>hould hear the News,
that all this was come to pa<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>hould be the fir<U+017F>t
to <U+017F>ay I was <U+017F>erv'd as I de<U+017F>erv'd.</p>
            <p>I confe<U+017F>s I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly touch'd with this threat,
and endeavouring in my <U+017F>elf to excu<U+017F>e the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this pretended Father-in-law, I told the
Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, perhaps he was not <U+017F>o much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57806:135"/>
on as I imagin'd; that perhaps the methods
he would u<U+017F>e to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me might be only intere<U+017F>ts, not
unju<U+017F>t; that <U+017F>uch men as they <U+017F>aw further into a
Cau<U+017F>e than other People, and doubtle<U+017F>s it was upon
that <U+017F>core, that he pretended to be able to help me
in mine; on the other hand, 'twas not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange,
he <U+017F>hould demand for his recompence, that I <U+017F>hould
marry his Daughter; for 'tis fair every man <U+017F>hould
ask what wages he plea<U+017F>es for his pains; that in
this ca<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ay the truth, 'twould not be my giving
his Daughter a portion, but his Daughter giving me
an E<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>ince without her I was ju<U+017F>t a going to be
not worth a groat. In <U+017F>hort, to <U+017F>ay the truth, the
aver<U+017F>ion I had for my Mother-in-law, reconcil'd me
to all the difficulties of this affair, more than I thought
'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me; <U+017F>o I told the man I would
venture, provided my Father-in-Law that was to be
was not Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou,</hi> and that the Woman was
not infamous. I had an implacable enmity in my
mind again<U+017F>t Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou,</hi> for a piece of Inju<U+017F>tice
that he did to <U+017F>ome very hone<U+017F>t Gentlemen of my
acquaintance, which I could not forgive him; and
he run <U+017F>o much in my head for a notorious fellow, I
would be <U+017F>ure to avoid, that it put others out of
my memory, who were every jot as bad as him<U+017F>elf;
the man taking it for granted the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was done,
names to me Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Canae,</hi> who was <U+017F>uch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Villain as <hi>Genou,</hi> if not a wor<U+017F>e; the very name
made me cry out as if <U+017F>ome <U+017F>udden di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter had <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me: The fellow perceiving his mi<U+017F>take, and
that no good was like to come of it, bid me have a
care what I did, that the lo<U+017F>s of my Suit at Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon my managing this affair; that the young
Lady was a di<U+017F>creet per<U+017F>on, and agreeable enough;
that to refu<U+017F>e it now would make her Father out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57806:135"/>
and he would certainly be my Enemy, and <U+017F>o
I might only thank my <U+017F>elf, if my Cau<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>carry'd. I
reply'd, the thing mu<U+017F>t be as it pleas'd God, but I
could never con<U+017F>ent to be Son-in-Law to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Canae;</hi> that he might indeed make me lo<U+017F>e my Suit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blackening his Con<U+017F>cience, <U+017F>ince he had been guilty
before of <U+017F>o many Villanies, as had already brought
it to the colour of the Chimney; that I could not
but wonder he had not found the means, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his Daughter, who by this time began to grow
<U+017F>omething <U+017F>tale; <U+017F>ince without doubt he had many <U+017F>uch
affairs as mine in his way; and might find <U+017F>ome Client
or other to make a Cully of; but it would not pa<U+017F>s
upon me.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>aid too much indeed, con<U+017F>idering I had a Suit
depending, and that he was one of the Judges, and e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
before a per<U+017F>on he particularly employ'd
in <U+017F>uch under-hand practices; who having given him
an exact account of what I had <U+017F>aid, my Mother-in-Law
her<U+017F>elf did not <U+017F>ollicit her Cau<U+017F>e, with <U+017F>o much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
again<U+017F>t me in publick, as he did in private. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'twas to his advantage, that I refus'd his Daughter,
for he married her to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Montigni,</hi> Son to the
Governor of <hi>Diep,</hi> who was richer than I <U+017F>hould have
been, if I had recover'd my E<U+017F>tate; and this co<U+017F>t him
nothing, but doing a little inju<U+017F>tice for him, ju<U+017F>t as he
offer'd to me.</p>
            <p>However, I never repented that this Gentleman car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
away the Prize, for <U+017F>he wears the Breeches man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and all that her Husband can do to <U+017F>hew that he
is Lord and Ma<U+017F>ter, is that, when he plea<U+017F>es he will go
to <hi>Chartres</hi> and get drunk, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he won't <U+017F>uffer him
to have a drop of Wine at home. I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I may be
allow'd to mention this <U+017F>tory, that reflects on his Son-in-Law,
becau<U+017F>e I have <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on to hate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In <U+017F>hort, he was the occa<U+017F>ion that about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
after I lo<U+017F>t my Cau<U+017F>e, and was condemn'd to pay
the charges, and <U+017F>ince that I have not had an Enemy,
has done me half the mi<U+017F>chief which he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:57806:136"/>
The charges amounted to a huge <U+017F>umm, and my
Mother-in-Law who had no thoughts of favouring me,
took out Execution again<U+017F>t me, at the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion of
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Canae,</hi> and clapt me into Pri<U+017F>on, at the
time when I lea<U+017F>t of all expected it: The <U+017F>umm was
no le<U+017F>s than two thou<U+017F>and livres, and money being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>carce then, as well as now, I could meet with
never a friend, would help me to <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>umm: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
abundance of them came to <U+017F>ee me, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with me at the ingratitude of this woman, but that
was a <U+017F>mall relief to me, <U+017F>o I was forced to take it as
patiently as I could: I found in the Pri<U+017F>on, a great
many hone<U+017F>t Gentlemen, who<U+017F>e misfortunes had
brought them into the <U+017F>ame condition, but they were
not <U+017F>o much concerned at their afflictions, as I was at
mine, for I <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>eek all manner of ways to divert
them<U+017F>elves, as if they had been at Liberty; but not
being of their humor, I <U+017F>pent my time in cur<U+017F>ing of my
Judges, and railing at the times, in which there was <U+017F>o
little Ju<U+017F>tice to be had; and there being Spies there, as
well as in other places, they inform'd again<U+017F>t me, <U+017F>o
from a Debtor, I was made a Criminal, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away to <hi>Pierre Enci<U+017F>e.</hi> I was a long time before I
could gue<U+017F>s what they were going to do with me, and
what I had done to de<U+017F>erve this <U+017F>ort of u<U+017F>age; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
that I had <U+017F>poken a little too freely of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Mini<U+017F>ter, I troubled my <U+017F>elf no further for a cau<U+017F>e
of my removal; but the Crime being of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence,
they gave me liberty to walk abroad. The
other pri<U+017F>oners <U+017F>eeing a new comer, were very eager to
hear my <U+017F>tory; I made no difficulty of telling them all
the particulars, and prote<U+017F>ting my innocence, but I
found this was <U+017F>o common a tale in <U+017F>uch a place, that
they were all as innocent, as by their own accounts.
Among the re<U+017F>t I found the Marquis <hi>de Fre<U+017F>ne,</hi> whom
I had known well enough to give him more particular
re<U+017F>pect, than the others, and on that account, I told
him my ca<U+017F>e ingenuou<U+017F>ly, and askt his advice what

               </gap><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould take, to make <U+017F>atisfaction for my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence;
he told me, he knew not what to advi<U+017F>e me
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57806:136"/>
to, in <U+017F>o nice an affair, and that he <U+017F>tood in as much
need him<U+017F>elf, his misfortune coming from a like cau<U+017F>e:
He <U+017F>urpriz'd me in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, having always been told
'twas for endeavouring to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell away his Wife to <U+017F>ome
Pyrates, and I could not forbear telling him what I
had heard; he an<U+017F>wer'd, that <U+017F>ince I had been <U+017F>o ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
he would acquaint me in a few words, with his
true Hi<U+017F>tory. Having no great matter of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in <U+017F>uch
a place, I was as willing to hear this adventure, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it mu<U+017F>t be extraordinary, as he could be to relate
it: So we <U+017F>at down on a bank, upon the Platform where
we was walking, and he told me, That before he was
married, he was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with her, who
was now his Wife, that tho 'twas his con<U+017F>tant maxim,
that Daughters took always after their Mothers, and
that he knew well enough what was the manner of her
Mother, yet it <U+017F>pite of his own-notions, he was <U+017F>uch a
fool to fall into the <U+017F>nare, and after having try'd all
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible means to enjoy her, and finding them ineffectual
but by marrying her, re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>atisfy his inclination
at any rate; <U+017F>o he ask'd her Mothers con<U+017F>ent, which
the old woman, not caring to part with her money, had
refus'd him; that this repul<U+017F>e had but encrea<U+017F>ed their
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on both <U+017F>ides, <U+017F>o that they re<U+017F>olv'd to do it
without her; upon which he had taken her away, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
goten a Prie<U+017F>t ready to marry them, this oblig'd the
old Gentlewoman to give her con<U+017F>ent; that upon this
he thought him<U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t man in the World.
But this happine<U+017F>s la<U+017F>ted no longer than three months,
when Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Ecuilli,</hi> his Brother, fell in love with
his Wife, and <U+017F>he with him, and that they manag'd this
with <U+017F>o little prudence, that he cou'd not but perceive
it pre<U+017F>ently, and was <U+017F>o enrag'd at it, that he was <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times tempted to di<U+017F>patch 'em both; but con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what a noi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch an action wou'd make in the
World, he thought of <U+017F>ome other method, and the
more, becau<U+017F>e, as fal<U+017F>e as <U+017F>he was, he cou'd not bring
him<U+017F>elf to that degree of hatred again<U+017F>t his Wife; but
having not the <U+017F>ame tenderne<U+017F>s for his Brother, re<U+017F>olv'd
to fight him, upon pretence of <U+017F>ome E<U+017F>tate that was to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57806:137"/>
be divided, and about which they had formerly had
<U+017F>ome words, and to urge him to it, he had frequently
taken occa<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about that concern; but
that the love he had privately for his Wife, caus'd him
to take all the reproaches he made him without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
It madded him <U+017F>o much the more to <U+017F>ee his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
policy, in avoiding all occa<U+017F>ions of quarrel, and
he was loth to fight him without <U+017F>ome apparent cau<U+017F>e;
but a circum<U+017F>tance which he happened to be an Eye-witne<U+017F>s
to, made him change his de<U+017F>ign of fighting him,
into a re<U+017F>olution of di<U+017F>patching him by a <U+017F>urer way;
for one day coming unexpectedly into her Chamber, he
had <U+017F>urpriz'd them in the fact, and before he entred the
Room had overheard them plotting together to a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
him: that his Brother <U+017F>eeing him coming in,
made as if he had been only toying with her, and he
on his part made as if he believ'd it, that he might not
give them any cau<U+017F>e of mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>o they parted
from one another, without any words of the matter,
but with the more re<U+017F>entment in their Hearts: For in
<U+017F>hort, he for his part had appointed one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
whom he knew he could tru<U+017F>t, to <U+017F>hoot him as
he was a Hunting, and his Brother at the <U+017F>ame time,
had hir'd <U+017F>ome Souldiers to do as much for him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it fell out <U+017F>o, that neither part was perform'd,
and yet the de<U+017F>ign on both <U+017F>ides became publick, and
made a great noi<U+017F>e in the World. His Servant in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
had taken <U+017F>uch gro<U+017F>s mea<U+017F>ures, that he had as
good have betray'd his Ma<U+017F>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for he made him be <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and that perfectly lo<U+017F>t him the favour of the
King, and al<U+017F>o was taken to be done upon account of
private intere<U+017F>t, and not from his jealou<U+017F>y; that after
this his Brother having not opportunity as formerly
with his Wife, and <U+017F>he being not of an inclination to
be content without a Gallant, e'n entertain'd them,
where <U+017F>he could find them, according to the cu<U+017F>tom of
her Family; that among others <U+017F>he happen'd upon one
who was a Per<U+017F>on of great Credit at Court, who being in
his young Blood, gave him<U+017F>elf up to his plea<U+017F>ures, tho
at the <U+017F>ame time, he had great employments, in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57806:137"/>
State. He told me, that their behaviour was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o
notorious, that he could not refrain taking notice of
it, and reflecting upon the Per<U+017F>on, which <U+017F>oon came to
his Ears, and there began his ruin. The Per<U+017F>on howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deferr'd his revenge, becau<U+017F>e the World would <U+017F>ay,
'twas too hard to ki<U+017F>s the Wife, and quarrel with the
Husband; and waited only for an opportunity, which
he was not long without. <hi>De Fre<U+017F>ne</hi> could not bear
the mocks and reproaches he met with in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
on this occa<U+017F>ion, and therefore re<U+017F>olv'd when this
Courtier <U+017F>hould be ab<U+017F>ent, he would take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to convey his Wife away. To prevent all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this, he made as if he would be reconcil'd to her,
and became <U+017F>o kind to her, that <U+017F>he was perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
and was as forward for going as he; finding
her in <U+017F>o good a humour, he took her at her word, and
taking the Road to <hi>Lyons,</hi> he carry'd her into <hi>Provence,</hi>
with a de<U+017F>ign to have <U+017F>hipt her on board <U+017F>ome of the
<hi>Levant</hi> Pyrates, and <U+017F>o to have <U+017F>old her, having bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
with a Captain of <U+017F>uch a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el for that purpo<U+017F>e:
But he had been <U+017F>o unfortunate, that his Wife had e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
as it were by a miracle, and that in<U+017F>tead of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him<U+017F>elf of a Whore, he had got the name of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
and a Ra<U+017F>cal, for attempting it; upon which her
Gallant, who, as has been <U+017F>aid, waited for a pretence to
ruin him, has laid hold of this, and had effectually lodg'd
him in that place, which was hardly <U+017F>o grievous to him
as the <U+017F>candal; that his Wife having procur'd a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to furni<U+017F>h her with money to carry her back to
<hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e, as to force him to go to
Law with her for it, before <U+017F>he would reimbur<U+017F>e, and
this came before the Parliament, where the <U+017F>aid Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
was oblig'd to tell the whole <U+017F>tory, to <U+017F>et forth
the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>he was in of the money, and to aggravate
the ingratitude of it; for indeed he had a great deal of
rea<U+017F>on to complain of her u<U+017F>age, after having done her
<U+017F>uch a remarkable kindne<U+017F>s; and tho, as he told me, he
ow'd this Merchant a great deal of ill will, for not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Wife where he found her, yet he could not
but acknowledge, <U+017F>he was very ungrateful to cheat him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57806:138"/>
of his Money, upon pretence, as <U+017F>he pleaded, that <U+017F>he
was under the Covert of a Husband, and <U+017F>o had no
power to make an Obligation.</p>
            <p>Tho I knew a great part of this Hi<U+017F>tory before, yet I
would not interrupt him; and he told me <U+017F>ome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
that I did not know before, as that he was in
Pri<U+017F>on for having di<U+017F>oblig'd his Wives Gallant. This
<U+017F>tory made me reflect on my condition, as not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>o unhappy as <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>ince I had never been
marry'd; and gave me <U+017F>o great an aver<U+017F>ion to that Sex,
that I made a Vow never to have to do with any of
them. I liv'd three years in this <hi>Pierre Enci<U+017F>e,</hi> without
<U+017F>o much as hearing either of Friend or Foe, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my <U+017F>elf confin'd for term of Life, I grew <U+017F>o melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and it <U+017F>o alter'd me, that people did not know
me; and the more I reflected upon my mi<U+017F>ery, the
more it afflicted me: Sometimes calling to mind my
old Ma<U+017F>ter, the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu,</hi> I more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately
bewail'd that lo<U+017F>s, than ever Lover did that of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.
In <U+017F>hort, having pa<U+017F>t my time in this condition,
with how much <U+017F>atisfaction you may ea<U+017F>ily imagin, the
Archbi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> Brother to the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi>
who acted as Lieutenant of the Province, <U+017F>ent me
word, that I might go abroad when I pleas'd, for his
Maje<U+017F>ty had given me the bounds of the City, only for
my Pri<U+017F>on. I return'd him my thanks, as if the favour had
come immediately from him<U+017F>elf; and he was vain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to accept my Complement, as if it had been his
due. I had been maintain'd at the King's charge all the
while I continu'd at <hi>Pierre Enci<U+017F>e,</hi> and by that means
had a little Arrears of my Rent due to me, with which
I made <U+017F>hift to pay my Mother-in-law, and had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in my Pocket; and now I began to re<U+017F>olve upon
being a good Husband, <U+017F>eeing to what I had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for want of two hundred Pi<U+017F>toles, to pay tho<U+017F>e
pitiful Charges. But whatever Re<U+017F>olutions a Man may
make, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to avoid one's De<U+017F>tiny. The
Archbi<U+017F>hop, having taken me with him a hunting, to
his Hou<U+017F>e at <hi>Nimis,</hi> which he had lately call'd <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villi,</hi>
notwith<U+017F>tanding he had told me, I <U+017F>hould not go
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57806:138"/>
out of the City; when we came back we mu<U+017F>t needs go to
play, and my Complai<U+017F>ance there co<U+017F>t me all the Money I
had in the World. Being in a rage at <U+017F>uch a misfortune,
it made me reflect upon the Life of this Man, who<U+017F>e Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
was <U+017F>o wide of his Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Indeed he was a
Military Archbi<U+017F>hop, and was <U+017F>urrounded with Guards,
in<U+017F>tead of Prie<U+017F>ts; following the Stag at the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of
fifty couple of Hounds, rather than following the
Cro<U+017F>s; making good Chear, in<U+017F>tead of Fa<U+017F>ting; boa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, and magnifying the Grandeurs of the Court,
rather than practicing, or preaching Humility; and in
<U+017F>hort, he governed the City of <hi>Lyons</hi> at <U+017F>uch a rate, that
he <U+017F>eemed rather a Tyrant than an Archbi<U+017F>hop. I <U+017F>aw
before my Eyes a thing no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange than true: He
would <U+017F>end every now and then for the Magi<U+017F>trates of
the Town, upon pretence of having received <U+017F>ome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from Court; and if he told them, that his Brother
the Mare<U+017F>chal had <U+017F>ent him word he had lo<U+017F>t a <U+017F>umm of
Money, they dur<U+017F>t do no le<U+017F>s than make him a Pre<U+017F>ent
of as much the next morning; this was the Price of
his Protection, and this co<U+017F>t me, as well as others, who
had Demands upon the Bank, one quarter part of my
Rent; for having thus exhau<U+017F>ted the Town by this <U+017F>ort
of Contribution, if I may be allowed that term, he
was oblig'd to <U+017F>ollicit a Warrant from the Council,
which reduc'd the Rents to three quarters the value.</p>
            <p>Having lo<U+017F>t all my Money, the Archbi<U+017F>hop <U+017F>ent me
word, he had Orders from Court to di<U+017F>charge me; <U+017F>o
I was at my liberty to go whither I pleas'd; this was
the unhappie<U+017F>t piece of good news to me that could be,
now I might go about my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, I had no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
left; <U+017F>o I was fain to continue in my old quarters
till I had recruited a little, and pa<U+017F>s'd away my time
there as well as I could. I had accidental conver<U+017F>e
with abundance of Strangers, for my Lodging being at
a Publick Hou<U+017F>e, and that City <U+017F>tanding on a very
great Road into many Provinces, we had new faces
came every day to quarter there as they travell'd, and
their <U+017F>ort of Conver<U+017F>ation I found very diverting; and
that for a man who had no great, but a <U+017F>hort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57806:139"/>
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort of life was not very di<U+017F>agreeable:
Among the re<U+017F>t, there came to lodge there one Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>St. Sylve<U+017F>tre,</hi> an Officer of <U+017F>ome Note in the Army,
I did not know him, but his humour, as well as mine,
being free and ea<U+017F>y to be acquainted, we <U+017F>oon fell into
Company together; he came from his Regiment, which
I think was quarter'd in Garri<U+017F>ons in <hi>Franche Comte;</hi>
and having fallen into the Company of a Gentleman of
that City, call'd <hi>Servietes,</hi> (Father to him who has the
fine Cabinet) This Gentleman came to him to invite
him to Supper; <hi>St. Sylve<U+017F>tre</hi> asking him leave to bring
me along with him, he was too much a Gentleman to
refu<U+017F>e; and I went very freely. After Supper he askt
us if we would play a Game at <hi>Tric-Trac;</hi> I took him
at fir<U+017F>t word, being pretty well acquainted with that
Game. We play<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>d but for half a Pi<U+017F>tole an end, and
Fortune <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o neuter among us, that we play'd above
four hours before any one of us had lo<U+017F>t a whole one,
and they both crying out we mu<U+017F>t not part <U+017F>o, truly we
play'd on till eight a clock the next morning, and by
that time I had the good luck to have won an hundred
Pi<U+017F>toles; the Cornet being quite overcome with <U+017F>leep,
told me, he demanded quarter, for he could hold up
no longer: I told him, it was for him to order that as
he pleas'd; for that tho I had every jot as much an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to <U+017F>leep as he, yet I would not leave off fir<U+017F>t,
becau<U+017F>e I had gain'd; <U+017F>o being both agreed we left off
play, under an agreement to go to it again after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<U+017F>o we lay down on the Bed, and having <U+017F>lept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four or five hours, they brought us <U+017F>ome Soup,
and then we went to play more vigorou<U+017F>ly than before,
and Fortune continuing to favour me, I won five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pi<U+017F>toles; at la<U+017F>t, con<U+017F>idering he could never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<U+017F>o great a <U+017F>umm, and that we <U+017F>hould be likely to play
all night again, he de<U+017F>ir'd me to play him three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pi<U+017F>toles a <U+017F>et, for three times running: I agreed
to it immediately, and won the two fir<U+017F>t currently,
but then fortune turning upon me, I lo<U+017F>t two more as
quick; <U+017F>o that being ju<U+017F>t where we began, we agreed
to our three Sets again; the<U+017F>e Games were more tedious
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57806:139"/>
than the other, both <U+017F>ides playing with more caution;
but I had the wor<U+017F>t of it at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that I was come to
two hundred Pi<U+017F>toles, which was all I had left, and <U+017F>o
we gave over play. This was no incon<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>umm for
the <U+017F>mall Game we began at, neverthele<U+017F>s he had once
lo<U+017F>t eight hundred Pi<U+017F>toles, by which we may <U+017F>ee there
is nothing <U+017F>o dangerous as play.</p>
            <p>This comforted me for my lo<U+017F>s with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<U+017F>hop,
and having got Money enough to carry me
to <hi>Paris,</hi> I took my leave of him. It was a good while
before I dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>how my <U+017F>elf at Court, for I took it for
granted, I <U+017F>hould not be lookt upon very well, after
this la<U+017F>t affair of mine. Indeed we were got into
an age, where the Mini<U+017F>ters expected as much reverence
as if they had been Petty Gods, and tho they could
pretend to no more merit than u<U+017F>ual, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make private Gentlemen <U+017F>how them as much
re<U+017F>pect, as Princes of the Blood: I went never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s
to vi<U+017F>it Mr. <hi>de Surenne,</hi> who I knew carry'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
after another manner; for as he came of a better
Family, than any of them could pretend to, <U+017F>o he was
much the more courteous and affable. I had the
honour to know him at Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s, and had
<U+017F>een him <U+017F>everal times <U+017F>ince that; he receiv'd me indeed
with all that Civility which is <U+017F>o natural to him,
and telling me that he was better pleas'd to <U+017F>ee me
there than at <hi>Pierre Enci<U+017F>e,</hi> ask'd me the particulars
of that affair, I told him I had a great deal
of trouble in it indeed: That the Cardinal had
done by me as the Ape does by her young ones; for
by loving me too much, he had been the cau<U+017F>e of
the ruine of my fortune; for if he had left me
to follow the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Arms which I had cho<U+017F>en,
I had in all probability been in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that the War was my Inclination, and that
had made me fall into it again under Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;</hi>
that Fortune had however <U+017F>eem'd to cro<U+017F>s my
Undertakings, yet I was re<U+017F>olv'd to try her again; that
on the other hand, I was now of an age which <U+017F>eem'd
more to require Ea<U+017F>e than a New Apprentice<U+017F>hip; yet
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57806:140"/>
I could not but tell him, if he had occa<U+017F>ion for an old
<hi>Aid du Camp,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch thing, I <U+017F>hould think my
<U+017F>elf very well accommodated; that my young blood
was <U+017F>ufficiently temper'd by my afflictions, he need not
be afraid I <U+017F>hould ruine things by my ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s; that I
thankt God my mind was <U+017F>tay'd and <U+017F>ettled now; and
yet when I was once a Hor<U+017F>eback, I was as capable
of undertaking the fatigues of the War, as I was at five
and twenty, which he <U+017F>hould find if he pleas'd to make
u<U+017F>e of me.</p>
            <p>I made him laugh with the manner in which I offer'd
him my <U+017F>ervice; and taking me at my w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, he told
me, he would appoint me a Comrade, who, tho he
was not <U+017F>o old as I, <U+017F>hould have no need of in<U+017F>tructions;
he meant one <hi>Clodore,</hi> who had been Captain in an old
Regiment, and was one that I knew very well, which
pleas'd me <U+017F>o much the better. This Man, tho he was
very well known for his Merits in <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions, yet
he was more known by <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e, not <U+017F>o much to
his advantage; he had the misfortune to have a Jilt to
his Wife, and one time as he was coming from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
one of his Friends having oblig'd him to bear him
company to a Hou<U+017F>e of ill repute, his Wife, who in his
ab<U+017F>ence took occa<U+017F>ion to divert her<U+017F>elf that way, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
to be one of the per<U+017F>ons produc'd for their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
You may judge how di<U+017F>turbing an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of this nature mu<U+017F>t be to a man of his Spirit;
he did not only handle her very roughly upon the
place, but <U+017F>ecur'd her, and put her into a Convent;
and yet quickly after, by a <U+017F>urprizing turn of his re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
e<U+017F>pecially for one who had always been lookt
upon as a Man of Honour, he chang'd his mind, took
her back again, and now actually lives with her. This
had been a great Di<U+017F>advantage to him, for he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
banter'd for it among the Souldiers; <U+017F>o that if
I had been a marry'd man, I <U+017F>hould not have car'd to
have joyn'd with him, for fear they <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid
we were Comrades in every thing; he was overjoy'd,
as he <U+017F>aid, to <U+017F>ee that I would <U+017F>erve again; <U+017F>o we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
our Equipage together, in order to make the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57806:140"/>
Campaign in <hi>Holland,</hi> which prov'd <U+017F>o glorious.</p>
            <p>Since the King had been marry'd we had <U+017F>everal <U+017F>hort
Campaigns on every <U+017F>ide, but the Forces of the Kingdom
were never all of them employ'd, except it were in
that of <hi>Li<U+017F>le;</hi> the King had never engag'd any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of great Reputation in tho<U+017F>e little Expeditions,
<U+017F>o that their failures made tho<U+017F>e great men to be the
more e<U+017F>teem'd. But having now to do with the mo<U+017F>t
flouri<U+017F>hing Republick, and who<U+017F>e Wealth went beyond
mo<U+017F>t of the greate<U+017F>t Monarchs, he made choice of the
two greate<U+017F>t Captains of Chri<U+017F>tendom, the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> and the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Turenne.</hi> The Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> undertook this charge with a great deal of <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
having receiv'd <U+017F>everal Mortifications <U+017F>ince his
return from the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> intere<U+017F>t; for except it was in
the year 1668, when they made u<U+017F>e of him for the
Conque<U+017F>t of the <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> they made no E<U+017F>teem
of him; and this great Employment happen'd to him,
more from the Marquis <hi>de Lovoys</hi> Jealou<U+017F>y of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> than any re<U+017F>pect to the Prince, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
all the great Actions he had done. The
occa<U+017F>ion of this Jealou<U+017F>y in the Marquis <hi>de Lovoys</hi> was,
that during the Campaign of <hi>Li<U+017F>le,</hi> he thought the Vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
had the Kings Ear to his prejudice; and <U+017F>o to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this great man he brought the other into play,
who had been as it were, confin'd to his Hou<U+017F>e at <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilli,</hi>
and had receiv'd <U+017F>everal affronts. Indeed this was
to be taken notice of, that when the King <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome
Troops into <hi>Hungary,</hi> the command of them was given
to his Cou<U+017F>in, the Count <hi>de Coligny,</hi> only to <U+017F>pight him,
becau<U+017F>e they two were at Enmity, and becau<U+017F>e every
body does not know this circum<U+017F>tance, it may not be
improper to relate it.</p>
            <p>In the year 1660, as I take it, the King being to
make <U+017F>everal Knights of the Order, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
had the Nomination of one, and the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi>
made no que<U+017F>tion, but he <U+017F>hould be the man, becau<U+017F>e
of the many obligations the Prince had to him, or at
lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould have been the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who
was then call'd the Count <hi>de Bouteville;</hi> and indeed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57806:141"/>
'twas thought the Prince would have certainly have
preferr'd one of tho<U+017F>e two, as well upon the account of
their quality, as that they both belong'd to him; but
he having nam'd his Favourite <hi>Guitaut</hi> to that Honour,
as it were over their Heads, the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi> was
<U+017F>o <U+017F>candaliz'd at it, that he went to him immediately,
and threw up his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Captain Lieutenant of
his <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> and the <U+017F>ame time told him, that he
did not de<U+017F>erve what he had done for him; that he had
left one of the be<U+017F>t Offices in the Kings Hou<U+017F>hold to
follow his fortune, and in return of all, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
before him a man that he could not <U+017F>o much as
call a Gentleman; that he had Children, and if ever he
<U+017F>hould live to <U+017F>ee them grown up, he would <U+017F>ooner
pi<U+017F>tol them with his own hand, than they <U+017F>hould ever
engage in any <U+017F>ervice but the King's. 'Twas the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi>'s character, that he was not the mo<U+017F>t patient
man in the world, but whether 'twas that he con<U+017F>ider'd
he had wrong'd the Count, or that he was willing to
regain him by any means, he treated him very civilly,
and told him, he had no rea<U+017F>on to be in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;
<U+017F>ince if he had nam'd <hi>Guitaut,</hi> in prejudice of the
Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and him<U+017F>elf, 'twas becau<U+017F>e, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
their quality would, <U+017F>ome time or other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it for them<U+017F>elves, which <hi>Guitaut</hi> could not hope
for from the meanne<U+017F>s of his; that if he had known
they would have taken it <U+017F>o ill, he <U+017F>hould perhaps have
taken other mea<U+017F>ures; that they <U+017F>hould therefore be
<U+017F>atisfy'd, and it <U+017F>hould be no fault of his, if they were
not better pleas'd for the future. Tho this was a great
deal to come from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who did not
u<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>o complai<U+017F>ant, yet the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from him in a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and was far enough from
any reconciliation.</p>
            <p>This was the chief rea<U+017F>on, as I noted before, for which
they gave him the command of the Troops that were
<U+017F>ent into <hi>Hungary;</hi> which <U+017F>o madded the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> that if he had not retir'd to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> where he
had lei<U+017F>ure to give vent to his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he had certainly
dy'd with the Grief of it: Here he continu'd a long
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57806:141"/>
time, under pretence of being troubled with the Gout.</p>
            <p>But when the King <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf entring upon a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
War, he chang'd his carriage to him, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with all the Care<U+017F><U+017F>es imaginable; and <U+017F>hutting
up him<U+017F>elf in the Cabinet with him and the Vi<U+017F>count
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> he <U+017F>pent <U+017F>everal whole days with tho<U+017F>e two
great men, to take his mea<U+017F>ures for the en<U+017F>uing War from
their known Experience. I <U+017F>hall not take upon me to
relate the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of that Campaign, it would be too
affected for <hi>Memoirs;</hi> be<U+017F>ides the whole World is full
with the remarkable Hi<U+017F>tory of it: Only this I <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ay, that the Enemy being at a di<U+017F>tance, we took our
own time, and made but very <U+017F>low foot<U+017F>teps at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this War. The Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who
fore<U+017F>aw what would happen, told the King, that
'twould not be always thus, and that if he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
more vigorou<U+017F>ly, he would find him<U+017F>elf in an error.
The King had a great confidence in Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
but the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who, to <U+017F>peak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
had indeed the direction of the Army, had no
<U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>t the King about it, but his Maje<U+017F>ty quite
alter'd his mind; <U+017F>o that <hi>Turenne</hi> finding he could do
nothing with the King by his advices, having not the
good fortune to be believ'd, let them take their own
cour<U+017F>e without troubling him<U+017F>elf about them. In the
mean time I had my Office of <hi>Aid du Camp,</hi> which was
ea<U+017F>y enough to me; and when I thought lea<U+017F>t of it,
they were pleas'd to change my quality, and mi<U+017F>take
me for a General, coming to me for Certificates. The
Duke <hi>de Longueville</hi> had a great many Gentlemen in his
Retinue, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t the Chevalier <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevreuil,</hi>
Brother to him who is now Colonel of the
King's Regiment; he was a very compleat Gentleman,
and had been very fortunate with the Ladies; for the
Duke's Mother lov'd him at that rate, that one day when
he came back from the Army, <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf helpt to
pull off his Boots, which was <U+017F>uppos'd to be, that he
might the <U+017F>ooner be ready to <U+017F>erve her in another way;
be<U+017F>ides this, he was very much in the favour of <U+017F>everal
other Ladies; in<U+017F>omuch, that if he had not ruin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57806:142"/>
by gaming, he might have been in a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but he would play away all that ever came near
him, whether 'twas his own or no; and one time he
lo<U+017F>t all the Advance Money of the Regiment of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
which was put into his hands for Recruits. He
had often practis'd the<U+017F>e tricks, <U+017F>o that he had not only
lo<U+017F>t his Reputation, but in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure his <U+017F>ences;
for he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf reduc'd at la<U+017F>t, to <U+017F>uch extremities,
that even di<U+017F>tracted him; yet for all this he could not
leave off Play. He was no <U+017F>ooner gotten into
<hi>Holland,</hi> but he begun afre<U+017F>h, and his old ill fortune
continuing, he lo<U+017F>t every penny he had; which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his old di<U+017F>temper upon him, he became perfectly
mad, and a Fever <U+017F>eizing him with it, in few days
carry'd him out of the world. The Duke, his Ma<U+017F>ter,
did not <U+017F>urvive him long, for getting <U+017F>ome Wine in his
head, in the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Camp, ju<U+017F>t before he pa<U+017F>t
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he made that fooli<U+017F>h <U+017F>tep which co<U+017F>t his own
life, and the lives of a great many brave Gentlemen.
There being but a little time between both their Deaths,
the Relations of the Chevalier <hi>de Monchevreuil</hi> came to
me, to de<U+017F>ire me to write to my Acquaintance in their
Country, that he dy'd for Grief at the lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o good a
Ma<U+017F>ter. 'Twas a very plea<U+017F>ant Reque<U+017F>t, when I knew
that they carry'd him to <hi>Nuits</hi> the day after we entred
<hi>Rhineberg,</hi> which was at lea<U+017F>t four or five days before
we pa<U+017F>t the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but feigning my <U+017F>elf ignorant, I told
them I would do <U+017F>o to oblige them, tho I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that he was <U+017F>ick before. I could not imagin,
what <U+017F>hould make them de<U+017F>ire this piece of <U+017F>ervice of
me, except it was, that they had a mind to conceal the
nature of his Death, to avoid a blemi<U+017F>h upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
but they had another rea<U+017F>on, for he having
play'd away a great many peoples money, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make them believe they had receiv'd it again, after
his Death, than that he dy'd for Grief at the lo<U+017F>ing of
it; and after all, 'twas a finene<U+017F>s that I could never
under<U+017F>tand, for let it be which way 'twould, 'twas of
no great con<U+017F>equence; and on the other hand, they
might be <U+017F>ure to expect, that tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57806:142"/>
their money; but the elde<U+017F>t Sons E<U+017F>tate was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd,
who was the only per<U+017F>on they could expect it of;
and if Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> had delay'd much longer to
take care of that Family, they had been <U+017F>o far from
paying Debts, that they had been reduc'd into very
bad circum<U+017F>tances. I can't be thought to <U+017F>peak this
enviou<U+017F>ly to le<U+017F><U+017F>en his quality, if you will but con<U+017F>ider
what I have <U+017F>aid of my <U+017F>elf, they may <U+017F>ee I do not
flatter; and if it <U+017F>hould ever come to pa<U+017F>s, that
I <U+017F>hould be as rich as the greate<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>hould never be for
boa<U+017F>ting of it. I did not indeed inquire of tho<U+017F>e Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
what their end was, but tho<U+017F>e people to whom
I wrote, wonder'd what the meaning of it <U+017F>hould be;
for coming pre<U+017F>ently after to under<U+017F>tand that he dy'd
di<U+017F>tracted, his Relations immediately concluded that I
was the cau<U+017F>e of it, and upon that account ow'd me all
the ill will po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; however not one of them had the
impudence to charge me with it; but as they were near
Neighbours to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> is famous for
Treachery, they did their utmo<U+017F>t to ruin me; and if
Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> had been in as much favour as <U+017F>he
is now, they might ea<U+017F>ily have done it, and the be<U+017F>t I
could have hop'd for, had been to have <U+017F>pent my life in
the <hi>Ba<U+017F>tile;</hi> but to my great good fortune her credit
was not <U+017F>o great at that time, and <U+017F>o all they could do
was to make Grimaces at me. The truth of it was, I
never <U+017F>ought to di<U+017F>abu<U+017F>e them, but taking not a word
of notice, either good or bad, I let them alone to do their
wor<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>In the mean time our Army gain'd ground in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and having pa<U+017F>t the <hi>Rhine,</hi> we came to the <hi>Iy<U+017F>el,</hi> and
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing al<U+017F>o that River, laid <U+017F>iege to <hi>Doesbourg.</hi> The
Duke <hi>de Orleans,</hi> the King's Brother, was in the Army,
and his Birth requiring, that he <U+017F>hould have the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
command, next to his Maje<U+017F>ty, he march'd on one
<U+017F>ide the River, and the King on the other. He had
nothing of the Air and Mein of the King; as much as
one was maje<U+017F>tick, <U+017F>o much the other had of meanne<U+017F>s
in his Countenance, and in his Manners; he had the
very Looks of a Woman, and painted like the Sex,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57806:143"/>
which he did, becau<U+017F>e 'twas <U+017F>aid he had a Tetter upon
his Cheek, and he would have been very much disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd
without it, which might be; but if he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>able
on that account, yet he was inexcu<U+017F>able in
another, for he wore a Cornet in bed, like a Woman,
in<U+017F>tead of a Night Cap, not forgetting a Scarlet
Knot, and a Riband of the <U+017F>ame to tye it under his Chin.
'Tis true, he was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>ham'd of it him<U+017F>elf, that he would
make all withdraw when he went to put it on; but as
always there was <U+017F>ome Valet, or <U+017F>ome Favourite, that
had acce<U+017F>s to him, the <U+017F>tory became <U+017F>o publick over
<hi>Paris,</hi> that all people knew it, and 'twas nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he
<U+017F>hould be very brave to have all the<U+017F>e failings, and yet
plea<U+017F>e the <hi>French,</hi> who are very nice and cen<U+017F>orious;
but indeed he wanted not that quality, for he who
avoided the Sun, for fear of his Complexion, would at
the <U+017F>ame time expo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to Fire, fearle<U+017F>s of Death.
In <U+017F>hort, he laid hold of all occa<U+017F>ions to <U+017F>ignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
which was not very plea<U+017F>ing to his Favourite the
Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> not <U+017F>o much out of tenderne<U+017F>s of
his Ma<U+017F>ter, as of that <U+017F>hare he was oblig'd to take in the
danger; for tho he had acquir'd <U+017F>ome reputation at Sea,
<U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince, when with the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> and
another, they ventur'd in a <U+017F>mall Shallop to burn a great
Ship of the Enemies; they will have it, that he did it
rather by the excitement of others, than any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had to <U+017F>uch actions: This was <U+017F>omething
<U+017F>trange for one, that was Son to one of the greate<U+017F>t
Captains, and one of the brave<U+017F>t Souldiers we have had
a great while; this made me believe, that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<U+017F>pread abroad of him, was nothing but Lies;
but tho I was <U+017F>o charitable, the truth was too plain to
be conceal'd, for the next year at the Siege of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tricht,</hi>
he behav'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ight of the whole
Army, that there was no more que<U+017F>tion to be made of
his Cowardice. But to return to the Siege of <hi>Does<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi>
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Martinet,</hi> Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and
Collonel of the Kings Regiment, was very unhappily
kill'd in the Trenches, by a Cannon-<U+017F>hot which came
from the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s quarter. The King was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57806:143"/>
exceedingly troubled at it, for he had indeed been very
<U+017F>erviceable in the Army, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing the fir<U+017F>t that put the
Infantry into that Order and Di<U+017F>cipline which we now
<U+017F>ee among them; but the Souldiers, who like Brutes, that
know not what is good for them<U+017F>elves, di<U+017F>lik'd him for
his Severity, and were <U+017F>o far from regretting his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that they rather rejoyc'd at it. I may <U+017F>ay too, that
a great many of the Officers were not <U+017F>orry for it, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the innovations in their Di<U+017F>cipline to him;
which tho they depriv'd them of <U+017F>ome advantages they
us'd to make, yet were really very much for the <U+017F>ervice
of the King: However their Joy did them no <U+017F>ervice,
for things did not return to their old condition again
at the Death of <hi>Martinet;</hi> the Court too well approv'd
of his Maxims not to continue the practice. The King,
de<U+017F>iring to give the command of his own Regiment to
one who <U+017F>hould be capable of following his <U+017F>teps,
refus'd it to <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons of great quality, who made
their Court to him for it, and gave it to the Count <hi>de
Montbron,</hi> who was but a private Gentleman, but who
was already at the Head of the <U+017F>econd Company of the
Grand Mu<U+017F>queteers, and who<U+017F>e fortune had rais'd him
to that Po<U+017F>t, again<U+017F>t the expectations even of all the
world, as well as his own. Indeed tho he had merit,
yet that was a place which was not to be obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
favour too, and both little enough to gain it: He
had <U+017F>erv'd at fir<U+017F>t in the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where he
was a Captain; after which he was made Under-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
in Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Company of Mu<U+017F>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers.
The Cardinal dying, the King took that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
which was then called <hi>les Petits Mou<U+017F>quetairs,</hi>
till <U+017F>uch time as <hi>Colbert Maulivriere</hi> bought them of
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Mar<U+017F>ac,</hi> who then had the command of
them; the name of the Company was then chang'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and call'd the Second Company of the Grand
Mu<U+017F>queteers, which was done by the favour of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Colbert</hi> his Brother; in the mean time Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Ca<U+017F><U+017F>au,</hi> who dy'd Governor of <hi>Bergues,</hi> was before

put in over him, thought he had inju<U+017F>tice done him, and
<U+017F>o gave up his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, at the <U+017F>ame time that Mr. <hi>de
Montbron</hi> had the guard of Madam <hi>De Ple<U+017F><U+017F>is Belliere,</hi>
who was confin'd upon the account of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Fouquett;</hi> this was the beginning of his good fortune,
which afterwards was enc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eas'd by the affair of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Colbert Maulivriere,</hi> who <U+017F>welling with Pride to
<U+017F>ee his Brother <U+017F>o near the King, re<U+017F>ign'd his Po<U+017F>t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they refus'd him a con<U+017F>iderable Government which
he would have bought; and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montbron,</hi>
who had wi<U+017F>ely made his Court to the Marquis <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi>
got leave to treat with him about it, and having
marry'd a rich Wife he was the better able to compa<U+017F>s
it.</p>
            <p>By the<U+017F>e degrees he came to be what we now <U+017F>ee him,
and the King having given him his Regiment, and at
the <U+017F>ame time having made him Brigadier of Foot, he
quitted the Mu<U+017F>queteers to <U+017F>erve at the Head of tho<U+017F>e
Troops. I was overjoy'd that the King had made choice
of him for a Po<U+017F>t <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, and having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
one of his friends, I was one of the fir<U+017F>t to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
him; he receiv'd me very kindly, and told
me he had formerly been oblig'd to me, and <U+017F>hould be
very glad of an opportunity to <U+017F>erve me; I told him
that 'twas now in his power to do it, if he pleas'd, that
I had a Nephew, my Si<U+017F>ters Son, who was in the fir<U+017F>t
Company of Mu<U+017F>queteers, for whom I would beg a
Lieutenants place of him, if he had a Vacancy in his
Regiment; or if not, the next that <U+017F>hould happen; he
granted it me immediately, and the gentile manner of
his doing it, oblig'd me more than the Gift it <U+017F>elf; for
he went him<U+017F>elf to Mr. <hi>de Louvois,</hi> making the affair
his own, and telling him a thou<U+017F>and things in favour of
my Nephew, tho he had never <U+017F>een him in his Life. That
which made him <U+017F>o very hearty to me was, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
while he was not <U+017F>o great, I did him a very good

that <U+017F>he had indeed <U+017F>uch a Fortune, he had
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57806:144"/>
propos'd to marry her. I happen'd once to go and <U+017F>ee
this Lady, but without any de<U+017F>ign in the world but to
divert my <U+017F>elf in the Company, which was generally of
the be<U+017F>t; <U+017F>he having put a little confidence in me more
than ordinary, de<U+017F>ir'd me one time very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, to
give her my opinion of the Count <hi>de Montbron,</hi> and of
his E<U+017F>tate; I told her, that for his per<U+017F>on I could <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
her pre<U+017F>ently, but for the other I de<U+017F>ir'd a little
time; that he was a Man of Honour, and de<U+017F>erv'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
well, and that in general I knew he had
a good E<U+017F>tate, but in two or three days I would tell
her more particularly. I went pre<U+017F>ently to the Count
him<U+017F>elf, and inform'd him of this conver<U+017F>ation, and
de<U+017F>ir'd him to in<U+017F>truct me what I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay; and he
giving me my Le<U+017F><U+017F>on in Writing, I did all I could to
bring about the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but we had to deal with a
Fool, who was yet not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>y to be manag'd as we
thought for. She had amus'd a dozen people at lea<U+017F>t
at this rate, and while thus <U+017F>he talkt of Marriage with
all the world, there were <U+017F>ome certain Sparks, who
without troubling them<U+017F>elves with tho<U+017F>e things, had
found out a way to come directly to the point, and
con<U+017F>ummate without Matrimony. She was both old
and ugly, and but that <U+017F>he was a good Pay-mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
would have had but few Cu<U+017F>tomers; yet by the help
of her Money <U+017F>he found <U+017F>ome who had <U+017F>tomach enough
to be concern'd with her, and they had <U+017F>o drein'd her,
that now, if <U+017F>he could find a fair motion to a Husband,
there would be no great difficulty in the bargain.</p>

took an infinite number of places, and excepting a little

which were among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, be<U+017F>ides that, they had
no a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance at all from their Confederates, who <U+017F>eeing

expre<U+017F>t, but you may gue<U+017F>s at <U+017F>omething of it by this,
their State was <U+017F>o perplext, that they entertain'd any
thing that offer'd to <U+017F>erve, if there were but the bare
looks of a man. Upon which I have heard a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
<U+017F>tory of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who offer'd his <U+017F>ervice to the
Pen<U+017F>ioner of <hi>Holland</hi> to rai<U+017F>e a Company, who being
examin'd if he had been a Soldier, and whence he was,
and the like, after giving an<U+017F>wer to tho<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions,
he draws out his Sword, and tilting at the Wall,
<U+017F>how'd them that he was a brisk fellow; but the je<U+017F>t of
the ca<U+017F>e lay here, the Pen<U+017F>ioner having objected, that he
was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and con<U+017F>equently a Papi<U+017F>t: <hi>Yes,</hi> <U+017F>ays
he, <hi>I am <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince you mu<U+017F>t know it, but this Sword is a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant,
and ready to <U+017F>erve the States and your Lord<U+017F>hip.</hi> The
Pen<U+017F>ioner lik'd his blunt way of an<U+017F>wering <U+017F>o well, that
in<U+017F>tead of a Company, which he askt, he made him Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Collonel of a Regiment; but he had no <U+017F>ooner fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
the Money than he ran away, and never rais'd a Man.</p>
            <p>The Enemy being often thus cheated, and the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of their affairs encrea<U+017F>ing daily, began to think
that a Peace, however di<U+017F>advantageous it might be,
would be le<U+017F>s <U+017F>o than the War; by which in le<U+017F>s than a
month, they had lo<U+017F>t three whole Provinces: This was
the opinion of <U+017F>ome of the more timerous people, but
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was of another mind, and to that
end di<U+017F>patcht his Courriers to his Uncle, the Marquis of

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57806:145"/>
States; that we took indifferently his Towns and theirs,
all was alike to us. Tho the King was <U+017F>erv'd the be<U+017F>t,
and mo<U+017F>t exactly in the world, yet his Spies, who he
kept in that Country, gave him no account of this, till
eight days at lea<U+017F>t, after the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> had
advis'd him of it. I know not by what means he got
this news, but he came him<U+017F>elf to the King about it,
and informing his Maje<U+017F>ty of what he had heard, told
him, Now was the time for him to make a Peace, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
to his advantage; by which, at lea<U+017F>t, he might
demoli<U+017F>h the greate<U+017F>t part of the Towns he had taken,
and keep his Army entire to oppo<U+017F>e his Enemies. The
King would have the opinion of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
upon this affair; and having <U+017F>ent a Courrier to <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
whether he was carry'd to be cur'd of the Hurt he had
received, the Prince immediately gave the <U+017F>ame advice.
The King <U+017F>aw of him<U+017F>elf the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of their advice,
yet could not take their Coun<U+017F>el; for having left all
things to the management of the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
who thought he knew more than both of them, he let
<U+017F>lip the opportunity, being lull'd a<U+017F>leep by that Mini<U+017F>ter,
with the hopes of ea<U+017F>ily defeating all the Contrivances
of the <hi>Germans:</hi> And as generally one error draws on
another, e<U+017F>pecially with tho<U+017F>e that will never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

appear'd in the Field, and more from other parts,
and never follow'd that advice, till it came to the la<U+017F>t
extremity. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Turenne</hi> were very much di<U+017F>oblig'd to <U+017F>ee the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> harken'd to, <U+017F>o much to their Di<U+017F>honour, and
the Damage of the King's Affairs; and if <hi>Louvois</hi> had
not made up this Mi<U+017F>carriage by extraordinary Services,
perhaps the King had not been <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfy'd with
him, as we now <U+017F>ee him.</p>
            <p>Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> being come before <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
<U+017F>ent to compliment the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to know how

to belong rather to a Dome<U+017F>tick, than an <hi>Aid du Camp,</hi>
yet he was pleas'd to confer that honour upon me, as

me to cut <U+017F>hort my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as much as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible;
and ju<U+017F>t as I took my leave of him, the Duke of <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburgh</hi>
came into his Chamber; they had told him in
the Anti-chamber how bad he was, at which he put on
an air of concern and <U+017F>orrow, and entering the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in a fanta<U+017F>tick manner, or rather like a Fool, <hi>Fructus

would have <U+017F>taid a little longer in the Chamber to <U+017F>ee
the end of this Comedy, but my re<U+017F>pect to the Prince
oblig'd me, again<U+017F>t my will, to withdraw; all I could
do, was to <U+017F>tay in the Anti-chamber with <hi>De<U+017F>roches,</hi>
the Captain of his Guards, and de<U+017F>ire him to go in and
<U+017F>ee what became of that Maggot; but he told me, I
would take him for a Coxcomb, if he troubled him<U+017F>elf
to go in for <U+017F>uch a thing, that I did not know the
Duke of <hi>Mecklenburgh,</hi> if I expected he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay any
thing which was not very <U+017F>illy.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
drawn by the force of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Money, more than
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arguments, had given his word
to march to their relief, upon which they not only
broke the Treaty of Peace which was then on foot, but
ma<U+017F><U+017F>acred their Chief Mini<U+017F>ter, who they <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to
hold intelligence with us. Many others were ruin'd in
the <U+017F>ame fury, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t <hi>Mombas,</hi> one with
whom I had had <U+017F>everal affairs for a Gentleman, one of
my Relations, nam'd <hi>Brinon,</hi> whom he had notoriou<U+017F>ly
cheated. <hi>Mombas</hi> had lent his Mother ten thou<U+017F>and
Crowns, and had taken the <U+017F>ale of a peice of Land
worth 40 thou<U+017F>and Crowns for his <U+017F>ecurity, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
of repaying the overplus of the Money, but the
Contract was no <U+017F>ooner made, but he began to put a great
many <U+017F>ham tricks upon him; <U+017F>o that the poor young
man, who under<U+017F>tood nothing at all of the Law, had
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57806:146"/>
ignorantly given him a Di<U+017F>charge for 40 thou<U+017F>and
Francs, hoping thereby to facilitate the payment of the
remainder; but in<U+017F>tead of that, <hi>Mombas</hi> procures <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
pretended Creditors, who made Demands upon
him; and tho <hi>Brinon,</hi> before he engag'd the Land, had
<U+017F>ummon'd all his Creditors to make their Claims, more
or le<U+017F>s, as was owing to them, and to receive their
Money; yet did he make this a new ob<U+017F>tacle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the poor Gentleman to <U+017F>uch an Extremity, that
in a great deal of trouble he came to me. I <U+017F>poke to
<hi>Mombas</hi> about it, who pretending to be hone<U+017F>t, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
me to end the affair in fifteen days; but telling
me that he had not Money at <hi>Paris,</hi> he would give
it him in <hi>Holland,</hi> if he would go thither with him;
the unhappy Gentleman went with him, but when he
had him <U+017F>o far off, he forc'd him to li<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
in his Company, and then made him <U+017F>ign to what
he pleas'd. I was in a rage when I heard of it, but the
thing was pa<U+017F>t remedy, the Notary having <U+017F>ign'd it,
<U+017F>o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

'twas at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix years before he came back again; and
for my young Kin<U+017F>man, he let him peri<U+017F>h in mi<U+017F>ery, not
giving him one penny be<U+017F>ides his Pay.</p>
            <p>This thing lying always upon my thoughts, made
me malicious enough to rejoyce at his di<U+017F>grace; for it
was almo<U+017F>t as great as that of the Pen<U+017F>ioner of <hi>Holland,</hi>
<U+017F>aving that he did not lo<U+017F>e his life; for he lo<U+017F>t at
lea<U+017F>t 20 thou<U+017F>and Livres a year, and underwent a
<U+017F>evere Impri<U+017F>onment. During this, the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Turenne</hi> was commanded to march again<U+017F>t the Marquis
of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who approacht at the head of 24000

tho<U+017F>e were old <U+017F>tories, which they ought not to credit,

of con<U+017F>equence, the Elector would make me dine with
him, he was pleas'd to let us be very cheary together, and
I was not the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Frenchman</hi> that he had invited to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he did his be<U+017F>t to make us all drunk, and if we
had been as willing as he, he had <U+017F>ent us home in a very
fine pickle. There was a comical <U+017F>ort of a fellow at
the Table, who had introduc'd him<U+017F>elf into favour by
inventing a <U+017F>trange kind of In<U+017F>trument, I know not
what to call it, but by clapping it to another man's ear,
you might <U+017F>peak to him at a di<U+017F>tance, and yet no body
hear you; this fellow was one that put him<U+017F>elf forward
upon all occa<U+017F>ions, but had not wherewith to an<U+017F>wer
it. He had a Woman whom he maintain'd at a <U+017F>orry
rate, and often at the Electors co<U+017F>t; for when he
thought no body <U+017F>aw him, he would <U+017F>lip the Wing
of a Fowl, or any other good bit, underneath his Plate,
and afterwards very dexterou<U+017F>ly into his Pocket. We
had not taken notice of his Ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his great misfortune, happen'd to <U+017F>ee him pocketing
up a young Turky; <U+017F>o he came and whi<U+017F>per'd the
Elector in the ear, and told him, that if he would give
him leave, he would make him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port; the Prince,
who lov'd nothing better, would fain know how;
t'other excus'd him<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>aid, the <U+017F>tory was too
long to give him an account of, but if he pleas'd to
give a hint to the <hi>French</hi> Officers, as they ro<U+017F>e from
Table, that they <U+017F>hould not take any thing ami<U+017F>s,
whatever was done: The Prince was very well pleas'd,
and did as he de<U+017F>ir'd him; and they had hardly <U+017F>aid
Grace, before the Steward came, and told him, there
was certainly a Knave in the Company, for <U+017F>ome body
had taken off a piece of Gilt Plate from the Side-board;
and if he pleas'd, he de<U+017F>ir'd that every body might be
<U+017F>earcht, to <U+017F>ee who had got it; we being told, as I <U+017F>aid,
that there was <U+017F>ome Frolick in hand, was not concern'd
at this, but cry'd out, by all means, and that the
Steward had rea<U+017F>on for what he <U+017F>aid; <U+017F>o putting our
<U+017F>elves all in a row, the fellow was oblig'd to do <U+017F>o too,
and after the Steward had pretended to <U+017F>earch <U+017F>ome of
us, he came to him, and found the young Turky in his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57806:147"/>
Pocket; he <U+017F>aid not a word till he had hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then lugging it out by the Legs, he <U+017F>how'd it to the
Elector, crying out, that in looking for one Thief he
had found out another. The Elector laught ready to
kill him<U+017F>elf at this Farce, and <U+017F>o did we too; without
doubt this would have put any man but him out of
countenance, all the Company <U+017F>taring at him; but he,
who was as impudent as a Court Page, laught as fa<U+017F>t as
any of us, and <U+017F>peaking to the Elector; <hi>Tis true, my

home to my Dog, that is a little indi<U+017F>pos'd, and has a weak
<U+017F>tomach; but this Gentleman here, Mr. Steward, methinks
<U+017F>hould have let it alone, who is <U+017F>o us'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon one who u<U+017F>e to pretend very much to that Talent
him<U+017F>elf. And the Elector was <U+017F>o pleas'd, that for the
future he order'd he <U+017F>hould have a di<U+017F>h of meat always
provided for him.</p>
            <p>After I had done my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with the Elector I took
my leave, and return'd to give an account of my me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
to Mr. <hi>de Turenne.</hi> I told him al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>tory of the
Turky, which gave him diver<U+017F>ion enough. In the mean
time the Army marcht along the Banks of the <hi>Neckar,</hi>
and when we were within a league of <hi>Wimphem,</hi> all the
Officers came and made a complaint to him, that they
were paid in Money that would not go; that 'twas a
trick of the Payma<U+017F>ter, who no doubt receiv'd good
Money, but put them off with this Money for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Exchange. The Payma<U+017F>ter was my
friend, and I re<U+017F>olv'd to let him know, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible,
what was doing, I found him <U+017F>o perplext, that
I could ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cern he was guilty; but <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o
ca<U+017F>t down, I told him there was a remedy for all
things, and therefore he <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
and <U+017F>ince it was <U+017F>o, if he would be rul'd by
me, I would tell him what he <U+017F>hould do: Hearing me
talk thus, he told me in the greate<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion imaginable,
he <U+017F>hould owe his Life to me; confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing ingenuou<U+017F>ly,
that the de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>aving <U+017F>omewhat by it had put him
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57806:148"/>
upon doing it; I found him <U+017F>o troubled, that I was
afraid, if I did not tell him what I had to <U+017F>ay quickly
he would dye with the fright. So I askt him how much
the la<U+017F>t Remittance was which he had receiv'd, and if
he had <U+017F>ince that, paid any other Money than that ba<U+017F>e
Coin; he told me no, for he had receiv'd it from <hi>Stra<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
in<U+017F>tead of the <hi>Louis d' Ors</hi> which he had from
the Trea<U+017F>ury; that the la<U+017F>t Remittance was of 200000
Francs, but as he had told me, he had turn'd it all into
this bad <U+017F>ort of Money: When he had told me this, I
bid him go and draw out a particular of all the Money,
as well what was paid, as what he had in Ca<U+017F>h, but to
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e his hand <U+017F>o, that no body might know it to be
his writing; that when Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>end to <U+017F>earch, as he would not fail to do, he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>tand in it, that he had receiv'd no other but <U+017F>uch
Money, and offer to produce the account to make it
out; but in the mean time to appea<U+017F>e the Officers, he
<U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s his word to them, that if they had any of
that Money left at the end of the Campaign, he would
give them other Money, or good Bills for it; and to
make them ea<U+017F>y, to de<U+017F>ire Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> to make an
Order, by which all the Suttlers were commanded to
take it, upon the penalty of ten Crowns a man; he
found my advice very much for his advantage, for
Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> <U+017F>ending immediately after, and <U+017F>eeing
the account I mention'd, he told the Officers, the
Payma<U+017F>ter had paid them no Money but what he had
receiv'd, that they ought therefore to be <U+017F>atisfy'd with
his Offer, and making at the <U+017F>ame time an Order to the
Suttlers, there never was any more <U+017F>aid of it. By this
means the Trea<U+017F>urer, not only e<U+017F>cap'd the Puni<U+017F>hment
he fear'd, but al<U+017F>o made a very great Advantage to
him<U+017F>elf; for the Suttlers bringing back the Money to
him to change, he got three or four <hi>Sous</hi> a Crown out
of them too. He was <U+017F>o oblig'd to me, that he offer'd
to lend me any Money I wanted, but I having no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
thankt him, and refus'd it.</p>

he <U+017F>hould leave his own Country too much expos'd;

fail'd not to brave them in their Camp; and the
Officers were <U+017F>o bold, that they would come pickeering,
and challenge ours to exchange a Pi<U+017F>tol with them,
and 'twas none of their fault, if we did not try our force
with them; among the re<U+017F>t, there was none who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

out as the re<U+017F>t did, but in particular was continually
in<U+017F>ulting the whole Army, and no body could <U+017F>hoot
him, which made people believe, he had fortify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
with <U+017F>ome Charm; and a Trooper telling me <U+017F>o very
<U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, and that he had known <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons that
had done <U+017F>o; I laught at him, upon which he told me,
I needed not go far to be convinc'd, for that he him<U+017F>elf
had one; and if I doubted it, I <U+017F>hould fire a Pi<U+017F>tol at

try'd <U+017F>everal. He <U+017F>et me in a great fit of laughter at
the<U+017F>e words; and he finding me <U+017F>till of the <U+017F>ame mind,
pre<U+017F>t me to try him with my Pi<U+017F>tol, whether he <U+017F>aid
true or no; which I refu<U+017F>ing, he was <U+017F>o mad, that he
told me if I would not make the experiment my <U+017F>elf,
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him make it before my face: Upon which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57806:149"/>
he immediately goes from me till he came within
Pi<U+017F>tol <U+017F>hot of the Counter<U+017F>carp of the Town. I not
imagining his de<U+017F>ign, perceiv'd that he endeavour'd to
fetch off a Cow, of which there was a Herd grazing, as
big as a good Flock of Sheep; there was above 200
<U+017F>hot made at him, before he came at them; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

in the mid<U+017F>t of the Mu<U+017F>quet <U+017F>hot, which in an infinite
number were fir'd at him from the Town. At la<U+017F>t,
after having thus diverted the whole Army, and me in
particular, who knew the occa<U+017F>ion, he brings the Cow
to me, and askt me if I believ'd him now? I prote<U+017F>t, I
could not tell what to <U+017F>ay to it, but I put it off with
telling him, that this was all by good fortune, which
words were unhappily the cau<U+017F>e of his attempting the

the conduct of the Prime Mini<U+017F>ter, as if it had been him

reports, he was none of the lea<U+017F>t concern'd in her pre<U+017F>ent
advancement. We were all of us <U+017F>urpriz'd to hear him
rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o gravely, who came of a Family that never
was fam'd for any <U+017F>tore of Under<U+017F>tanding; but Nature
had been kinder to him than to his Family, for he had
<U+017F>ometimes very happy <U+017F>allies of Wit; and <U+017F>he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another miracle in his favour, that he was the fir<U+017F>t
of his Name that could pa<U+017F>s for brave. In <U+017F>hort, there
was nothing <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange as to <U+017F>ee any of the Hou<U+017F>e <hi>D'<g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>es</hi>
in the Army; which caus'd that Satyr upon him in the
<hi>Scandalous Chronicle,</hi> that he was not the true Son of his
Father.</p>
            <p>For all this Mon<U+017F>ieur, the Governor, under<U+017F>tood one
part of his Office well enough, for he had made the
Town pre<U+017F>ent him with <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>iderable Summs of
Money; and had it not been that they knew what
power <U+017F>upported his intere<U+017F>t, they had complain'd of
him at Court. I told this to the Count <hi>de Florin<U+017F>ac,</hi>
who continuing his Vein of Wit, an<U+017F>wer'd, that I needed
not wonder at that, for he had an excellent School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>ter,

of the Mare<U+017F>chal during his Government of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
and told me <U+017F>o many pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, as would take me
two days time to relate; but among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, he told
me one thing I <U+017F>hall never forget as long as I live, and
which I'll give you an account of, as a <U+017F>ample to judge
of the re<U+017F>t by. He told me, that the Mare<U+017F>chal being

brought him <U+017F>everal Pre<U+017F>ents, and among others a Pur<U+017F>e
of Gold Counters, every one weighing two <hi>Louis d' Ors,</hi>

upon them again, and liking them very well, more for
the Metal than the Device, he would have been glad of
<U+017F>uch another parcel at the <U+017F>ame price; and to that end

and they returning that it was <hi>Nancy: You are mi<U+017F>taken,

be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht, one can <U+017F>ee nothing here.</hi> The Magi<U+017F>trates
under<U+017F>tood him well enough, and being unwilling to
quarrel with him for a matter of 100 Pi<U+017F>toles, they
went and brought him a pre<U+017F>ent of Counters as big as
Medals, the <U+017F>ize of which plea<U+017F>ing him, he never exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd

            <p>This was no <U+017F>tory to tell the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi>
tho I had made it publick enough to others; for 'twas
not the way to make ones court to him, by telling him
any thing that lookt like a reflection upon another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
he was <U+017F>crupulous in things of this nature to an

govern my <U+017F>elf. In the mean time, tho we had made

as <U+017F>o many Marks of his Ambition, and therefore <U+017F>olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
al<U+017F>o the Princes of the Empire to confederate with
him. The Dukes of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> were very fond of it, as
being afraid to have <U+017F>o dangerous a Neighbour as the

having marcht into the three Bi<U+017F>hopricks I was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd

the Count <hi>D' I<U+017F>le,</hi> Collonel of Hor<U+017F>e, who was there
with his Regiment. I was not very well, and therefore
went to Bed betimes, and being ju<U+017F>t got to <U+017F>leep, I was
wak'd of a <U+017F>udden with a great Out-cry, as if the
Hou<U+017F>e had been on fire. I ro<U+017F>e immediately, and <U+017F>lipt
on my Gown to <U+017F>ee what the matter was, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the noi<U+017F>e was in the <U+017F>treet, I lookt out of Window,
where I <U+017F>aw the Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le</hi>'s Landlord crying out for
help after a hideous manner; I was not acquainted
with the Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le,</hi> but ju<U+017F>t knew him, he being a
<hi>Catalonian,</hi> and their Cu<U+017F>toms were a little too rough
for me, who without boa<U+017F>ting, I may <U+017F>ay had learnt
how to behave my <U+017F>elf well enough, by living with the
Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu;</hi> however being oblig'd to take the
Souldiers parts, as I was one my <U+017F>elf, I dre<U+017F>t me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and having taken my Sword, I was no <U+017F>ooner
got down, but going up to the man that cry'd out <U+017F>o,
I askt him, if there was no way to quiet this tumult?
By good fortune he knew me, we having lodg'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to me, <hi>Yes, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>I will be judg'd by you,
you are a Soldier, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay whether this <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>o or no? This Gentleman, who is quarter'd at my Hou<U+017F>e,
after having eat and drank what he pleas'd, will needs have
me let him lye with the Cook; now what would he have me
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57806:151"/>
to do? Or what does he take me for? Don't you know me
to be a Man of Honour?</hi> I profe<U+017F>s to you, tho I came
down <U+017F>tairs mighty <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, this <U+017F>tory made me laugh,
and <U+017F>eeing the man had got a great Rabble about the
Hou<U+017F>e already, I de<U+017F>ir'd him to quiet them, and I
would go and accommodate every thing for him. I had
much ado to per<U+017F>wade him, he telling me, I had to do
with a Devil, that would but laugh at me; but bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him not fear, I made him go into his Hou<U+017F>e, where
we found the Count, who had lockt him<U+017F>elf in with
one of the Kitchen Wenches, and would force her to lye
with him: I call'd to him to open the door, and told
him my Name, but 'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e; at la<U+017F>t I was
forc'd to tell him, that I came by Orders from Mr. <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> which he would know better when he <U+017F>aw
me. I took all this care, that he might not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me
to deceive him, and when he heard that, he dur<U+017F>t not
make any farther re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; I told him Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Turenne</hi> knew nothing of what had happen'd, yet, but
he would <U+017F>oon, if the uproar continu'd, and I would
leave it to him to imagine, how he would re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>uch a
di<U+017F>order; he, who we knew was a <U+017F>worn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to all <U+017F>uch irregularities; that they <U+017F>aid he would
needs have a Cook Wench; why he might have twenty
by to morrow, if he was put to <U+017F>uch hard <U+017F>hift; but to
force a Man of Honour to furni<U+017F>h him for his Debauch,
was a thing no man would take, and the be<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the World could put on <U+017F>uch an action, mu<U+017F>t be to
<U+017F>ay he was drunk, and that it was an ill extremity to
be forc'd to excu<U+017F>e one folly by another: I de<U+017F>ir'd him
to reflect on the<U+017F>e things, now while he had time for it,
le<U+017F>t, when 'twas too late, he <U+017F>hould come to repent
it.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le</hi> hearing me di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e at this rate,
grew a little mild; however it being the humour of
tho<U+017F>e people, that tho they are in an error will never
acknowledge it, he told me, that for my <U+017F>ake, he
would relinqui<U+017F>h his right, but that I knew well enough
it was his due. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was <U+017F>o ridiculous, it
had like to have renew'd the quarrel, if I had not <U+017F>topt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57806:151"/>
his Ho<U+017F>t, who was ju<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>ing up again, and having
pray'd them both to be peaceable, and live quietly,
<U+017F>ince it was but for <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, I made them <U+017F>hake
hands, and promi<U+017F>e to drink a Gla<U+017F>s together the
next day: His Ho<U+017F>t, who was an hone<U+017F>t man, told
us with all his Heart, and he would give us a Breakfa<U+017F>t;
and the Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le,</hi> who pretended to <U+017F>tand upon his
honour again, told us he would con<U+017F>ent, provided he
might treat us again at Night. The<U+017F>e civilities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, left me no room to que<U+017F>tion, but they
were both thoroughly reconcil'd, <U+017F>o I e'en went to Bed
again, and there had never been a word made of it, if
<U+017F>ome body had not fooli<U+017F>hly told the <U+017F>tory among the
Souldiers, which made the poor Count be mo<U+017F>t horribly
banter'd in the Army; and when he went by they
would <U+017F>ay, <hi>There goes our Friend that would have ki<U+017F>t the
Cookmaid: Would it not have madded any body to have been
<U+017F>o di<U+017F>appointed?</hi> And for me, they told me, that truly
I had done very ill to <U+017F>poil <U+017F>port in that manner, and to
prevent me for the future, they would have a Law
made, that I <U+017F>hould mind my own affairs, and not
meddle with them. The Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le</hi> <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o
rally'd with this <U+017F>ort of talk, that there being Troops
to be detach'd to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he procur'd an Order from
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> to be <U+017F>ent thither, out of the way.
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> was by this time come into the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
and to prevent the ruine of <hi>Holland,</hi> attempted
to give us <U+017F>ome diver<U+017F>ion, and in order to that, had
form'd a de<U+017F>ign upon <hi>Charleroy,</hi> in which they were
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, but they fail'd in the
attempt; which might have led them to con<U+017F>ider, how
unfit a match they were for <U+017F>o powerful an Enemy.
The Count <hi>d' I<U+017F>le</hi> thought by this means to have avoided
the raillery of the <U+017F>tory we have told, but in<U+017F>tead of
that, he carry'd into his own Country, a character
which perhaps would not have reacht <U+017F>o far, had he
continu'd where he was: In the mean time we
were preparing for the War in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
having now effectually declar'd upon us; and as
<hi>Al<U+017F>atia</hi> was like to be the Scene, on which the fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57806:152"/>
were to be acted, Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> gave orders
for the fortifying <hi>Saverne</hi> and <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> be<U+017F>ides <hi>Bri<U+017F>ac,</hi>
where <U+017F>everal new works were made to <U+017F>trengthen the
place. The Souldiers rejoyc'd at the<U+017F>e great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they were in the right of it, for they were
<U+017F>afe now from being disbanded, which otherwi<U+017F>e would
certainly have follow'd, if the Peace had been made
with <hi>Holland;</hi> for me, I was too old to expect making
my fortune by the War, and therefore was far enough
from plea<U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elf at the news; but on the contrary,
was really griev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the calamity of a ruinous Campaign, if they
had pleas'd to have us'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a little gentler
upon the Propo<U+017F>itions of Peace; but they carry'd it <U+017F>o
high with them, that contrary to the Genius of that
Nation, they joyn'd with the Inclination of the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> who pre<U+017F>t them to the War, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
to pro<U+017F>ecute it, what<U+017F>oever it co<U+017F>t him, having
built all his hopes upon the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of it.</p>
            <p>The King, who knew very well, he had no General
<U+017F>o fit to command in <hi>Germany</hi> as the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
continu'd him there, tho he wanted him el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
having great affairs upon his hands: For the

de<U+017F>erted us, and pretended he could not help it,
on <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons of State which had oblig'd him to it.
In the mean time our Coa<U+017F>ts were expos'd to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cents
of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and we, who being all along

was forc'd to <U+017F>ummon the Ban and Arriereban of the

<U+017F>hould make me <U+017F>eem older than I was indeed; but
affecting not only the Company and Manner of the
younger Men, but a certain ridiculous Air of Gaiety,
I mu<U+017F>t needs put on a flaxen Perriwig, when my Beard
and my Hair was as grey as a Goo<U+017F>e. Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi>
had a certain Gentleman call'd <hi>Roi<U+017F>guiot,</hi> a Man that
fancy'd mightily to wear a long grey Beard, and to
look always like an old man; this fellow was my
<U+017F>courge, and as if he had a mind to plague me, he
would be always telling me of <hi>Locates,</hi> and of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>ent for by the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> This was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the mo<U+017F>t glorious action of all my life, and yet I
could not bear his telling me of it, becau<U+017F>e he would be
always <U+017F>aying too, that he was but a Child at that
time, and that his Uncle us'd to cure him with that
<U+017F>tory, telling him, that Vertue never went without a
Recompence: For by this <U+017F>tory people begun to look
upon me, and wonder'd at me, that being <U+017F>o old, I
would appear <U+017F>o young, telling me that I could not be
much le<U+017F>s than four<U+017F>core. I was made at this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
and blu<U+017F>ht oftner for anger than <U+017F>hame; yet
others that were but lately come into the Army
told me, that I lookt very well, in which they
did not know how they pleas'd me; yet this did not
<U+017F>top the other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but every day one Blockhead
or another would be rai<U+017F>ing of it again, in<U+017F>omuch that
nothing was more welcome to me, than when <U+017F>ome
Order came to get on Hor<U+017F>eback, and there I was as
young as any of them. I have often been a<U+017F>ham'd of
my <U+017F>elf in my own thoughts, that I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch a
Fool, and that I <U+017F>hould be the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould condemn
it in another; how hard a matter is it for us not to be
opinionate of our <U+017F>elves; for after having experienc'd
this in my <U+017F>elf, I never reflected upon other per<U+017F>ons for
the like.</p>

did me to make my <U+017F>elf a young man. However this
was only the appearance, for they did their duty, only
that they could not pretend to keep them in order,
e<U+017F>pecially with <U+017F>uch people as commanded them, who

that this circum<U+017F>tance, together with the great

might be a <U+017F>ufficient ground to form an Aver<U+017F>ion
between them, was re<U+017F>olv'd to make a tryal, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more inclination to an Amour than to the War;
thought 'twould make him <U+017F>ome amends for his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onment,
if he could gain <U+017F>o delicate a per<U+017F>on to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable
to his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es. 'Tis hard to <U+017F>ay, whether he <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his de<U+017F>ign or not; but if I <U+017F>hould be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to cen<U+017F>ure, as the people that liv'd in the place,
I <U+017F>hould make no que<U+017F>tion of it, but take it for granted,
as they do: But as I am not apt to judge <U+017F>o lightly,
and e<U+017F>pecially in ca<U+017F>es of <U+017F>uch moment, where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>uch Quality is concern'd, I <U+017F>hould
rather choo<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, that tho 'twas probable it might be
<U+017F>o, yet 'tis not <U+017F>afe judging by probabilities; however
it was, the old Duke was not altogether without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and to be <U+017F>ure of him, he ha<U+017F>ten'd him away, and
<U+017F>ent him back into <hi>France.</hi> Any Man, but <hi>Sable,</hi> would
have been more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Glory of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
with <U+017F>uch a Prince<U+017F>s, than of his Liberty; but
he, who took his own way, was glad to be gone, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57806:154"/>
<U+017F>o return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he <U+017F>oon comforted him<U+017F>elf
for the lo<U+017F>s of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having nothing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb
him, he <U+017F>pent his time when he was not in the
Field in <U+017F>ome Employments, which were very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to him<U+017F>elf. He would go and vi<U+017F>it the meane<U+017F>t
Burghers, and would take more plea<U+017F>ure in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
than that of Per<U+017F>ons of the greate<U+017F>t Quality. I
have <U+017F>een him play <U+017F>trange pranks when I was at <hi>Bru<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els.</hi>
I have <U+017F>een him dance in the open <U+017F>treet among
the Mob, to the common Tunes of tho<U+017F>e people; and
he took that opportunity once to make a con<U+017F>iderable
Pre<U+017F>ent to a Lawyers Daughter, who he had an Intrigue
with. It was the fa<U+017F>hion in <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> to give the young
Ladies Garlands of Flowers for the Head; he gave her
one, where there was Flowers indeed, but 'twas <U+017F>et
with Diamonds be<U+017F>ides. They judg'd from thence,
that he was extreamly taken with her, for Liberality
was not his character, but rather the contrary; but
this was not the only proof he gave her of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
for her. She had a Mother who had an aver<U+017F>ion to any
thing of a Soldiers coming near her Daughter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he di<U+017F>guis'd him<U+017F>elf like one of the Long Robe,
that he might come to <U+017F>ee her, and the young one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
her Mother, 'twas a Pre<U+017F>ident of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and the
good Woman very hone<U+017F>tly believ'd her. This <U+017F>ort of
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e was very common, but he had a great many
others, in which no man took <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf:
He lodg'd in the <hi>Rue de Fripiere,</hi> call'd <U+017F>o from
the Pawn-brokers who liv'd there; and I <U+017F>aw him one
day dre<U+017F>t like one of tho<U+017F>e people, and he had lain all the
Door and Window of his Lodging with old Cloaths; <U+017F>o
that one that did not know him, would have taken
him for one of that Trade; and he him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>itting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
in a great Chair, with an Apron before him, <U+017F>cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his next Neighbour, all one as if he had been
his fellow. In <U+017F>hort, unle<U+017F>s 'twas they who had known
him very well, every body took him for a Broker. One
day a Trooper came and cheapned a Buff Coat which
hung up among other old Cloaths; the Duke told him
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57806:154"/>
he <U+017F>hould try it on before he made him any price; and
<U+017F>o taking it down, he put it on for him, which the
other let him do, not imagining 'twas the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain;</hi> but the Duke <hi>d' Ar<U+017F>chot</hi> coming by with a
great many other Officers, could not conceal their
knowledge of him, <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>uch a figure; by
which means the Hor<U+017F>eman finding his error, and not
knowing what would become of him, got up a Hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
while they were a making their Compliments to
one another, and not daring to <U+017F>tay to pull off the Coat,
rid away with it. The Duke, who had no mind to
lo<U+017F>e it, runs after him in the <U+017F>treet as hard as he could
drive, but the other having <U+017F>ix Legs to his two, 'twas
all to no purpo<U+017F>e. They rally'd him very heartily upon
this accident, which they thought might have made
him leave off tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of diver<U+017F>ions, but 'twas all one
with him, he was at it again in two or three days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a temper <U+017F>o naturally inclin'd to <U+017F>omething odd
and unu<U+017F>ual, that he was never better pleas'd than when
he was thus expo<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf: This was the cau<U+017F>e
he was <U+017F>o very much belov'd by all the common people
where ever he came. In <U+017F>hort, he was always familiar
with them, and would go to Dinner with a poor man,
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as with a rich; he would <U+017F>tand Godfather to
any of their Children, and would have all <U+017F>uch who<U+017F>e
Children he had <U+017F>o <U+017F>tood for call him Brother, he would
at lea<U+017F>t call them by no other name, and often has been
<U+017F>een to <U+017F>top in his Coach at a poor Trade<U+017F>man's Door to
ask how his Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip did, and all the Family.</p>
            <p>But to return to the War: The Enemy was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong,
that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was oblig'd to give ground,
and they took up their Winter Quarters on this <U+017F>ide the

Neighbouring Villages, with order to keep <U+017F>trict

Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> had po<U+017F>ted per<U+017F>ons of great experience at

not come to him for Orders, not he needed not be oblig'd
to march in per<U+017F>on, it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould be in

where the Enemy <U+017F>eem'd to bend their greate<U+017F>t

when every body had given me over, a Trooper that
was taken Pri<U+017F>oner by one of our Parties, and was put
into a Hou<U+017F>e next Door to where I lodg'd, told me, he
would undertake to cure me, if I would give him as

him, <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my Stomach, that in eight days time I was able to
get on Hor<U+017F>eback. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I was well, I re<U+017F>olv'd to
go to Mr. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who <U+017F>everal times in my Sickne<U+017F>s
had the goodne<U+017F>s to <U+017F>end to the Quarter, to know how
it went with me; but Mr. <hi>Pillois</hi> would by no means let
me go yet, for fear of a relap<U+017F>e. During the time he
kept me thus, I had an opportunity to do him a piece
of <U+017F>ervice, which very much oblig'd him, and which,
without vanity I may <U+017F>ay, was very much for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
tho I took no great pains in it neither; the
Enemy had be<U+017F>ieg'd a little Town near <hi>Homburg,</hi> and
he having Orders to relieve it, drew together what
Troops were at hand, which making not above 2500
Hor<U+017F>e, he found 'twould be a difficult thing, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iegers
having receiv'd a great Reinforcement, <U+017F>o that
they were at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>even or eight thou<U+017F>and Men; he
call'd a Coun<U+017F>el of War about it, and every body was
of the opinion, that 'twas not a thing practicable,
without expo<U+017F>ing the Troops to manife<U+017F>t ruine. I <U+017F>aw
him <U+017F>o extreamly afflicted with it, that made me try if
I could find any way to comfort him: I had heard <U+017F>ay,
that <U+017F>ometimes Policy goes beyond Strength, and being
re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>tudy upon it, I put my invention to the
rack, and at la<U+017F>t a thought came into my head, which
afterwards had a <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s as happy as I could de<U+017F>ire.

This was nothing but to write a Letter to the Governor,

place with le<U+017F>s than ten thou<U+017F>and Men, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Pillois</hi>
could not get ready before, but that now he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his <U+017F>uccor, and by two a Clock the next day he
would give the Enemy a Vi<U+017F>it, and that he <U+017F>hould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold out the place <U+017F>o long, and he <U+017F>hould be an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witne<U+017F>s
of the Sport. This Letter was to be carry'd,
directed to the Governor, but <U+017F>o to be contriv'd, that
it might fall into the Hands of the Enemy; and al<U+017F>o it
was to be order'd, that he who carry'd it <U+017F>hould not be
privy to the de<U+017F>ign neither. Having laid all the<U+017F>e mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures,
I de<U+017F>ir'd Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> that he <U+017F>hould get the
riche<U+017F>t Man in tho<U+017F>e parts he could meet with, and
threaten him, that if he did not carry that Letter <U+017F>afe,
he would not only burn his Hou<U+017F>e down, and all that
was in it, but he would certainly hang him, if ever he
came home again; he had confidence enough in me to
do all this for me, without inquiring upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and having got a Man, he would fain have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
him<U+017F>elf upon the account of the difficulty of pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
the Enemies Lines, but he had as good have <U+017F>aid
nothing. Mr. <hi>Pillois</hi> told him, in <U+017F>hort, he <U+017F>hould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go of this Errand, or of another into the next
World; <U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing there was no remedy, he prepar'd to
go on the Me<U+017F><U+017F>age: But while he was getting ready, my
Ho<U+017F>t, who I had gain'd with a promi<U+017F>e of a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
got before him, and <U+017F>taying by the way, met
him, and made him believe he was going about <U+017F>ome
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame way. Thus jogging on together, and
falling into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he who had the Letter to carry
told him, what a <U+017F>trait he was in, adding that he was
undone both ways, that if he <U+017F>hould perform his Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age,
he <U+017F>hould be taken in the Camp, and hang'd for a
Spy; and on the other hand, if he did not, he <U+017F>hould
leave his Wife and Children to the mercy of Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Pillois,</hi> who be<U+017F>ides the plundering and burning of
his Hou<U+017F>e, would treat him in the wor<U+017F>t manner that
could be imagin'd; that he had told him what would be
his fate, <U+017F>o that there was no room to flatter him<U+017F>elf;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57806:156"/>
that he had thrown him<U+017F>elf upon Providence, being
unable to make a choice, when it lay between his own
Life and theirs, who were as dear to him as his life.</p>
            <p>My Ho<U+017F>t pretended to pity his Misfortune, and to
gain more upon his belief, accus'd Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Pillois</hi> of
Cruelty; however after a great deal of talk, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
his concern for him, he told him, that if he
was in his place, he would e'n go and <U+017F>urrender him<U+017F>elf
into the hands of the Enemies, and tell them by what
Threatnings he was oblig'd to carry the Letter; that
they would let him carry it into the place, or they
would not let him, but either way he would <U+017F>ave his
Life, and his Wife, and Children, Mr. <hi>de Pillois</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he was taken, endeavouring to execute his Orders,
could have nothing to <U+017F>ay to him; and the Enemy on
t'other hand, would do him no hurt, <U+017F>eeing he had
put him<U+017F>elf voluntarily into their hands. The Man
thought this was an admirable expedient, and re<U+017F>olving
to take that cour<U+017F>e, gave him a thou<U+017F>and thanks. My
Ho<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>o good a mind, had done his bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and feigning that he was to go no farther that
way, left him, and coming back the <U+017F>ame way, he met
Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> who marcht at a venture with his 2500
Hor<U+017F>e; he gave us an account of what re<U+017F>olution he had
left the Man in, and we taking it for a good Omen,
made no que<U+017F>tion, but the Enemy would take it all
for truth, and the rather, for that the Man him<U+017F>elf had
been really made believe, there was a very great force
ready to march to rai<U+017F>e the Siege; in <U+017F>hort, what with
the Man's Report, and the Letter together, they were
<U+017F>o frighted, that they immediately re<U+017F>olv'd to rai<U+017F>e the
Siege, and retreat.</p>
            <p>We receiv'd this News when we were come within
three leagues of the Enemy; and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Pillois</hi>
having then no bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to go any further, marcht back
to his own Quarter, where in a little time he receiv'd
Letters from the Court, which complimented him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
on this happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; not but that it was
known by abundance of people, that I had a great <U+017F>hare
in the action, but as he was the General, and they bear
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57806:156"/>
the Reproach of ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>o ought to have the
Credit of the good; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o it was ju<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould have
the Privilege his place afforded him. And indeed I
ought to <U+017F>ay this in his prai<U+017F>e, that he was a Man that
perfectly under<U+017F>tood the Cavalry, and perhaps there
was none in the Army went beyond him, of which he
gave an undeniable evidence a little while after; when
in the Fight at <hi>Ein<U+017F>eim,</hi> he refus'd to charge at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Vaubrun;</hi> for <U+017F>eeing that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
kept their advantage, he cho<U+017F>e rather to <U+017F>tay till he
drew them out of their Po<U+017F>t, than to obey and be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
I do not <U+017F>ay he did well in di<U+017F>obeying, and he
that had <U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>o long, ought to have known, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can di<U+017F>pence with our obeying the Order of our
<U+017F>uperior Officer; and he found the effects of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
being ca<U+017F>hier'd for doing it; but yet he <U+017F>how'd
by that action, that he under<U+017F>tood his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s better
than Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> who commanded him; and the
Court was <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it, that tho they could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the fact on account of the example, yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him a Pen<U+017F>ion of a thou<U+017F>and Crowns a year, that
it might not be <U+017F>aid he had <U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>o long, and <U+017F>o well,
for nothing.</p>
            <p>Ju<U+017F>t as I was come back from this Adventure with
Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> there came an Officer to me and made
me a very plea<U+017F>ant Compliment, which was, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been pleas'd to quarrel with Mr. <hi>de Montperoux,
Mai<U+017F>tre du Camp</hi> of the Regiment <hi>de Rovergne,</hi> he had
occa<U+017F>ion to cut his Throat a little, and de<U+017F>ir'd me to be
his Second. I told him I was very much his humble
Servant, and I <U+017F>how'd my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t effectually, for
in<U+017F>tead of going to fight, as he imagin'd, I took care to
have us di<U+017F>cover'd, by which I prevented him from fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away his Life. This Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Montperoux,</hi> was a
very <U+017F>tout Man, but <U+017F>o very <U+017F>hy, that 'twas difficult to
conform to his temper; he had his Sallies of Humour,
which made him very ridiculous; but of all his Whims
that was the plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t, when the King gave him the
Regiment; for after the King had told him, he granted
the Regiment to him, he begg'd his Maje<U+017F>ty to give it
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57806:157"/>
the Name of <U+017F>ome of the Provinces of the Kingdom;
tho it was not the cu<U+017F>tom then, except for the old
Troops; telling the King, that he was <U+017F>o little known
in his own Country, that if the Regiment <U+017F>hould be
call'd by his Name, no body would li<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves in it.
The King thought this was <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>trange in a
<hi>Ga<U+017F>con</hi> too, who generally value them<U+017F>elves extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and don't u<U+017F>e to fail <U+017F>o in their own character;
however the King would not deny him, and he behav'd
him<U+017F>elf with a great deal of Bravery, till at la<U+017F>t, as it
often falls out with tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>erve a long time in the
Armies, he was knockt on the Head.</p>
            <p>I was of an age, as I have often <U+017F>aid, that I could
not expect to live long; and <U+017F>o much the rather would
not attempt to pre<U+017F>erve my Life at the Expence of my
Reputation; however what I had done, on account of
this Man that had de<U+017F>ir'd me to be his Second, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
to my Enemies to reflect on me, as if I had done
it for fear, and they began to count me a Coward: If I
had been as much a Fool as I have been formerly, I
<U+017F>hould have made <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief or other on that
account; but be<U+017F>ides that my Blood was not <U+017F>o hot
now, God fir<U+017F>t of all, and then the King, had forbid
my taking that Vengeance, we u<U+017F>e to call Satisfaction,
and I took another way to let them know, that I had as
much Courage, or more, than they that <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o. The
fir<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion that offer'd me, without taking notice of
any thing to the<U+017F>e Gentlemen, I de<U+017F>ir'd them to go out
with me to di<U+017F>cover the Enemy, and I carry'd them <U+017F>o
far, that they began to mutter at me, and told me, I
had certainly been hir'd by <U+017F>ome body, to bring them
all to be murther'd; this was all as I would have had
it. I told them, I wonder'd they <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover any
fear, who had been <U+017F>o ready to cen<U+017F>ure others; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no <U+017F>ign of returning, I came within reach of the
Enemies <U+017F>hot, when they were pleas'd to leave me.
This gave me opportunity enough to revenge my <U+017F>elf.
When I came back to the Camp, I told all this to their
Acquaintance, and to my own Friends, how they had
quitted me a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I came to the Enemies Quarter;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57806:157"/>
and tho <U+017F>ome people did not fail to tell them again, yet
they thought it convenient to take no notice of it, le<U+017F>t a
Man who valu'd his life <U+017F>o little, as they them<U+017F>elves had
<U+017F>een, <U+017F>hould not be always in the humour to bear their
Reflections. Indeed I was very unhappy to be <U+017F>o much
talkt of, for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter; <U+017F>ince the like happen'd
to another Man but t'other day, and no notice at all
taken of it. Every body knows, that the Marquis <hi>de
Crequi</hi> having challeng'd a Collonel, the Collonel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of meeting him as he had appointed, goes and
acquaints the Marquis his Father, who was General of
the Army, and taking him with him to the place, they
found the Marquis there with his Second; who being
<U+017F>urpriz'd, as no doubt any Son would have been, to <U+017F>ee
his Father in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>eeing there was no way
to conceal the de<U+017F>ign, he threw him<U+017F>elf at his feet, and
promis'd him never to attempt it more. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but good fortune and bad in the World. This
Collonel was <U+017F>o far from hurting his Reputation, that
he encrea<U+017F>t it, and pa<U+017F>t for a wi<U+017F>e man; and yet I not
only <U+017F>uffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, but had the misfortune to
have <U+017F>everal of my Friends reflect on me as well as the
re<U+017F>t, and I had no opportunity to tell them my mind,
tho I de<U+017F>ir'd it exceedingly; above all, an account of a
certain blu<U+017F>tring Fellow call'd <hi>Chateau Bautot,</hi> who, if
we would believe him<U+017F>elf, was the <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t man in the
Army; I had my Eye upon him, I never came into his
Company but I thwarted him, upon which he grew
<U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd, that I often found he had a great deal of
patience, and ea<U+017F>ily perceiv'd he was not <U+017F>uch a Bravo
as he <U+017F>aid he was. I ought indeed to have been content
to have mortify'd him in this manner, but I watcht for
a further opportunity, which at la<U+017F>t offer'd it <U+017F>elf when
I lea<U+017F>t lookt for it. When I return'd to the Camp the
next Campaign, I came to <hi>St. Di<U+017F>ier</hi> one day, when
there being a great many Troops in the place, I had
like to have lain in the <U+017F>treet all night, but that at la<U+017F>t
I found out an Ho<U+017F>t, who by the help of a Crown pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
me a Chamber; <U+017F>o I put my Baggage in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
to lodge there; I went out then to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57806:158"/>
of my acquaintance, but while I was walking with
them, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Chateau Bautot</hi> comes into the
<U+017F>ame Inn, and finding there was never a Chamber but
mine, makes bold to turn my Baggage out and take
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion; as <U+017F>oon as I came back they told me how it
was, and not believing any man could be <U+017F>o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
I run up Stairs to inform my <U+017F>elf; I was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to find him there who I wanted <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion
again<U+017F>t, and he was no le<U+017F>s, when he <U+017F>aw who it was he
was like to be concern'd with; but not giving him
time to make his excu<U+017F>e, I clapt the door to and bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and told him there was no rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould have
the advantage of the Inn <U+017F>o much, becau<U+017F>e I happen'd
to come in an hour or two before him, but I thought he
be<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erv'd the Chamber who was be<U+017F>t able to keep it.
With tho<U+017F>e words I drew, expecting that he would do
the like; but in<U+017F>tead of that, he told me he would
not be guilty of <U+017F>uch an ill action; that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
he had abus'd me, and as a further mark of it,
he would immediately remove his Baggage, if I pleas'd
to let them be carried away. I was a<U+017F>ham'd of his
Cowardice, and putting up my Sword, I told him that
at lea<U+017F>t then, he <U+017F>hould behave him<U+017F>elf more mode<U+017F>tly
for the future, that I had born a great deal from him, but
I <U+017F>hould not always take it <U+017F>o; that I would not u<U+017F>e
him as he had done me; tho I had much more rea<U+017F>on;
that I now was <U+017F>atisfied he had a great deal more
Tongue than Courage, and I <U+017F>hould take occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ome
time or other to tell him <U+017F>o, if he did not take care to
u<U+017F>e me better. Thus I remain'd Ma<U+017F>ter of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which I was not a little glad of I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you; for
I mu<U+017F>t own to you, I had rather it had been he than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Per<U+017F>on in the World, for tho I know I ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
yet I could not help being thoroughly pleas'd at
<U+017F>uch an opportunity to revenge my <U+017F>elf. This accident
however made him quit the Army, and go and <U+017F>erve
under Mr. <hi>de Schomberg</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he had a
Troop of Hor<U+017F>e in the Regiment <hi>de Ga<U+017F><U+017F>ion;</hi> but as he
was always a man of plea<U+017F>ure, he left the Army to run
after a Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s, and as he was coming back again, was
kill'd by the <hi>Miquelets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:57806:158"/>
As for me, I was <U+017F>till <hi>Aid de Camp,</hi> and tho the King
had <U+017F>everal in the Army who wore long Beards as well
as I, as the Marquis <hi>de Angeau,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>d' Arcy,</hi>
yet none of them would pretend to di<U+017F>pute the Seniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with me; however I was <U+017F>till very vigorous, and
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> would <U+017F>ay of me <U+017F>ometimes, that
'twas pity I began <U+017F>o late, and that, if I had as good a
con<U+017F>titution of body to the War, as I had of mind, I
<U+017F>hould have been able to do any thing. Indeed I us'd
to tire two or three Hor<U+017F>es a day; I was <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly
riding about in every corner, that they call'd me the
Petty General of the Army. I did not do this to make
people believe great things of me, but 'twas my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
and I always cho<U+017F>e rather to plea<U+017F>e all the world,
if 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, than to give offence to any; and I
know but one man in the whole Army, that complain'd
of me, and I leave the world to judge, whither that
was my fault or no. In the Regiment of Hor<U+017F>e <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
there was a Gentleman of <hi>Vexin,</hi> call'd <hi>Bellebuine,</hi>
who<U+017F>e Father having been one of my acquaintance, a
Captain in the Guards, I thought my <U+017F>elf oblig'd now
and then, to give his Son a hint of my ob<U+017F>ervations
of his conduct, and I had told him of <U+017F>everal things
which I thought were not very much for his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
indeed he was very debaucht, and tho he
had a very hone<U+017F>t Woman to his Wife, yet he run away
from her, and follow'd a Gang of na<U+017F>ty common
Whores: This could not but produce ill effects on him,
and all that I had foretold him came to pa<U+017F>s; he was
lookt upon in the Regiment, as one who 'twas <U+017F>canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to be <U+017F>een with, and be<U+017F>ides he had done two or
three very di<U+017F>honourable actions, and to compleat all,
he brought the fould di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e with him from <hi>Paris;</hi> and
whether he wanted Courage, or was unable to <U+017F>erve on
the<U+017F>e accounts, I know not, but he came to me one
day, and de<U+017F>ir'd me to ask leave of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
for him to go <U+017F>omewhere to be cur'd: We had
then the Enemies Army ju<U+017F>t at our Trenches, and thnking
it was not a proper time for any Man to leave the Army,
I gave him my opinion, that Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> would not

<U+017F>eeing I refus'd to <U+017F>peak for him, he went to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de

very <U+017F>ame thing as I had <U+017F>aid, which not <U+017F>atisfying him,
he went away without leave. In <U+017F>hort, I had good
rea<U+017F>on for what I <U+017F>aid, for the Armies engag'd in a day
or two after, and had he <U+017F>taid till then, I <U+017F>hould have
made no difficulty to have <U+017F>poke to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>
for him; and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> who was very civil to
him, told him, if he would have patience two or three
days he <U+017F>hould go; but going his own way to work, he
was ca<U+017F>hier'd, as he well de<U+017F>erv'd. God knows I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
accus'd him to Mr. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> but <U+017F>aid all I could
in his favour, when they told him of it; neverthele<U+017F>s,
he took all the di<U+017F>grace that was done him to be my
doing, and they wrote to me from <hi>Paris,</hi> that he
threatned me <U+017F>trangely; I made a trifle of it, and
indeed I knew him too well to be afraid of him, but I
was <U+017F>oon taught, that the brave<U+017F>t Men are not always
the mo<U+017F>t dangerous Enemies; but on the other hand, a
Man has nothing to <U+017F>ecure him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t Malice

the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germaine</hi> very late, three Men <U+017F>et
upon me with naked Swords in their hands, and I
knew him to be at the head of them. I was not <U+017F>o
much <U+017F>urpriz'd, but that I had time to ask him in cold
blood, if it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a Gentleman to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in <U+017F>uch a piece of Villany. I confe<U+017F>s he had been
in a great many ill actions, as I have before ob<U+017F>erv'd;
and now, having reduc'd him<U+017F>elf to the la<U+017F>t extremity,
he had li<U+017F>ted in the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> where, tho I do not
<U+017F>ay but there may be <U+017F>ome hone<U+017F>t Gentlemen, yet I
<U+017F>hall not fear to <U+017F>ay al<U+017F>o, there are others, who will

him<U+017F>elf for all <U+017F>ort of Villany, and I believe
'twas by concert with the<U+017F>e people, he that undertook
an action <U+017F>o horrid: I was in the more danger from
the<U+017F>e Rogues, becau<U+017F>e 'twas very late, and I could hope
for no help from the Watch, for they were gone, it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57806:159"/>
being near day: But I had not <U+017F>o much work with
them as I expected; and taking care to <U+017F>et my back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
a Shop, that they might not come behind me, I
<U+017F>tood upon my Defence; I have wondred a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
times, reflecting on the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, how it came to
pa<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince they had Villany enough to contrive <U+017F>uch an
action, that they had not arm'd them<U+017F>elves in another
manner; but <U+017F>o it pleas'd God to order it, I kept
them off in that fa<U+017F>hion with the point of my Sword,
till at la<U+017F>t a Coach was heard, which was the Duke
<hi>Le<U+017F>diguieres;</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever the Villains <U+017F>aw the
Flambeaus they fled; and the Duke, who was in his
Coach, knowing me by the light, made his Coach <U+017F>top,
and askt me what was the matter? I would not tell
him the name of him I had <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
out of my re<U+017F>pect to his Relations, who were
very hone<U+017F>t people: I only told him, I had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd
by three fellows, I knew not who, and if his
Grace had not come by in the minute, I did not know
how it might have far'd with me. He <U+017F>tept out of his
Coach immediately, for fear of a <U+017F>urprize, and we
walkt along together two or three whole <U+017F>treets, but
could <U+017F>ee no body. But this was a day of <U+017F>trange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
coming to a new Hou<U+017F>e, which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half fini<U+017F>ht, we heard a grievous groaning, which
was like a Woman's Voice: Mr. <hi>de Le<U+017F>diguieres</hi> order'd
his Footmen to go into the Hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ee what was the
matter, and we follow'd them; but I was <U+017F>trangely
<U+017F>urpriz'd when I <U+017F>aw what it was: 'Twas a Young
Woman extraordinarily well dre<U+017F>t, and to appearance
of <U+017F>ome Quality, with a Ma<U+017F>que on her Face; <U+017F>he was
fallen in Labour in that place, and without any manner
of help but a <U+017F>ort of a Girl, that was not like to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of doing her any <U+017F>ervice; I was extremely mov'd at
her circum<U+017F>tance, and <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething to her to make her
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it; but Mr. <hi>de Le<U+017F>diguieres,</hi> who was a hard-hearted
Man, fell a laughing at her, and was a going
to make her pull her Ma<U+017F>que off, and if it had not been
for me, I believe he would have done it, for he <U+017F>aid a
great many hard things to her which I did not approve
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57806:160"/>
of: I had a great deal of difficulty to get him away,
but having at la<U+017F>t per<U+017F>waded him, I did her a great
kindne<U+017F>s, for I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he had almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tifled her<U+017F>elf with
her Mask for fear of being known; and if <U+017F>he had been
to keep it on much longer there had been no <U+017F>aving her.
I had the Curio<U+017F>ity the next day to go and inqure about
her, making all the de<U+017F>cription I could of her Dre<U+017F>s
and Shape, and the like, I got <U+017F>o much information,
that I under<U+017F>tood 'twas a Councellors Daughter, that
pa<U+017F>t for a young Saint: However, tho <U+017F>he was of no
mean Family, yet the Child was expos'd to the Pari<U+017F>h,
and the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary was ju<U+017F>t taking it away as I came
by: If I had thought fit, I could have given him <U+017F>ome
light into the matter; but con<U+017F>idering that I ought not
to ruine a poor Girl, who without doubt had been
drawn in, I never <U+017F>poke a word of it.</p>
            <p>However this affair of <hi>Bellebrunne</hi> that befel me,
made me bethink my <U+017F>elf, and I was ju<U+017F>t a going to his
Captain, the Prince <hi>de Soubize,</hi> who I had the honour
to be particularly known to, and I knew he would do
me ju<U+017F>tice; but then con<U+017F>idering 'twas a <U+017F>orry Wretch
I had to do with, I thought 'twas not worth my while,
only I would look to my <U+017F>elf a little better; <U+017F>o I took
care to come home betimes at night, and if I was out
late, I always took <U+017F>ome of the Watch, who for a <U+017F>mall
matter would guard me to my Lodging; by which
means I avoided him in the night, and he had not
Courage enough to attack me by day light.</p>
            <p>I had follow'd the War now three years, in which
time I had plaid the good Husband <U+017F>o well, that I had
three years Rent in Bank, which I think was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for my Po<U+017F>t, where 'twas not the Cu<U+017F>tom to be
<U+017F>aving; for my pay was 100 Crowns every <U+017F>ix weeks,
and truly I made bold to live upon Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>
for my Diet; <U+017F>o that I never was in a better condition
in my life. But knowing not well what to do with
my Money, I enquir'd after an opportunity to put it
out; and <U+017F>peaking to a Friend of mine about it, he
told me, he could accommodate me him<U+017F>elf without
my <U+017F>eeking any further; that he had lent 20 thou<U+017F>and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57806:160"/>
Francs to a Gentleman of <hi>Provence</hi> to buy a place with,
and had taken a Mortgage of him for it, and he would
entere<U+017F>t me in it if I pleas'd; and that, tho it was not
u<U+017F>ual, yet he had a Counter Security al<U+017F>o upon the
place to the value of 20 thou<U+017F>and Crowns, between
him and the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>d' Humieres,</hi> who had lent 40
thou<U+017F>and Francs on the <U+017F>ame account; <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hould
run no hazard in it, and <U+017F>hould oblige him too. This
lookt <U+017F>o fair that I had nothing to object, and being
al<U+017F>o very willing to <U+017F>erve him, I fetcht him my Money,
tho I had intended to have put it into the Fund for
Annuities, or at lea<U+017F>t into the Town-hou<U+017F>e. Indeed I
had better have done <U+017F>o, but I was born to be a Beggar.
I receiv'd the intere<U+017F>t but a very little while; and the
Gentleman dying, the King gave the place to Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Bri<U+017F><U+017F>ac,</hi> Major of the Guard <hi>du Corps,</hi> without any
regard to the Obligation the other had made: I had
laid my mea<U+017F>ures <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>hly, that in<U+017F>tead of taking an
A<U+017F><U+017F>ignment of the Deed from the per<U+017F>on I lent the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to, with his Security for the payment, I let him be
quit, and my <U+017F>elf be con<U+017F>tituted in his place; <U+017F>o that all
the hopes I had, was upon the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>d' Arbou<U+017F>te,</hi> who held the <U+017F>aid Government; but then
under<U+017F>tanding that he owed already more than he was
worth, that thought was at an end; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en we
reckon'd, that if the King had an account of the Ca<U+017F>e, he
would cau<U+017F>e Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bri<U+017F><U+017F>ac</hi> to pay us; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becau<U+017F>e the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> was concern'd,
who we thought had intere<U+017F>t enough to appear for us;
the per<U+017F>on I had done this withal had great Friends too,
it was Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi> Brother to Mr. <hi>de Montauban,</hi>
Lieutenant General in the King's Army; but tho this
Man did his endeavour, the other did not <U+017F>tir in it,
telling us 'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e, for that Mr. <hi>de Bri<U+017F><U+017F>ac</hi>
not being able to pay us, to trouble the King about it,
would but be to ask him to give us <U+017F>o much Money out
of his own Coffer: But this did not <U+017F>atisfie Mr. <hi>de Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi>
and me; and as I did not care neither to appear
too publickly in it, all the care of the matter lay upon
Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi> who to <U+017F>ay the truth, <U+017F>par'd no pains in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57806:161"/>
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but 'twas three months before he could
have a word of an<U+017F>wer, tho he had given abundance of
Petitions to the King with his own hand; at la<U+017F>t Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Louvois</hi> told him, that if he would not offend
the King, he <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t his preten<U+017F>ions in this affair,
and think of <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e to ask of the King to make
him <U+017F>atisfaction. This was enough to let us know our
Money was lo<U+017F>t. But Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Saillaut</hi> thinking
him<U+017F>elf oblig'd on my account, but chiefly on account
of his own Family, not to be put off <U+017F>o, pre<U+017F>ented <U+017F>till
<U+017F>everal other Petitions to the King, to one of which the
King an<U+017F>wer'd him him<U+017F>elf, that he might know of the
Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> how that affair <U+017F>tood. Mr. <hi>de
Saillant</hi> having told me this, I troubled my <U+017F>elf no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thinking that Mr. <hi>d' Humieres</hi> having already
told us his mind, he had made his Court at the expence
of our Cau<U+017F>e, but I did him wrong; for very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly
he had told the King, that if he had not impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
him, 'twas becau<U+017F>e his Maje<U+017F>ty had already been
<U+017F>o bountiful to him, and that in his Maje<U+017F>ties favour he
could not be the poorer for the lo<U+017F>s of 40 thou<U+017F>and
Francs; but that it was otherwi<U+017F>e with Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi>
who, be<U+017F>ides that he was not very rich, had al<U+017F>o a very
great Family; as for me he <U+017F>aid nothing, for as I <U+017F>aid I
did not appear, and I <U+017F>aw al<U+017F>o that Mr. <hi>de Saillant</hi> did
what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. One would have thought <U+017F>o hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
a Declaration as this of the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>d' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi>
<U+017F>hould have done us <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice, and that the
King, or Mr. <hi>de Bri<U+017F><U+017F>ac</hi> would have paid us; but they
thought no more of that, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be oblig'd
to pay the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> too: <U+017F>o that Mr. <hi>de
Saillant</hi> had for his la<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer, that he <U+017F>hould not pre<U+017F>s
it any farther, but rather <U+017F>eek for <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e to ask
of the King; he car'd not for all this neither, but <U+017F>till
continued <U+017F>olliciting, tho to no purpo<U+017F>e at all.</p>
            <p>But to return to my other affairs, which this <U+017F>tory has
too much diverted. The year 1675 being begun, I
prepar'd again in the Campagne with Mr. <hi>de Turenne:</hi>
He had fini<U+017F>hed the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>o gloriou<U+017F>ly, that there was
nothing known like it; he had fought four Battels in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57806:161"/>
one Summer, with <U+017F>uch unequal Forces, as any body,
but he, would have been overthrown; but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or his Courage, always <U+017F>upply'd his Want of
Numbers; and in the la<U+017F>t fight, with not above 25000
Men, he drove the <hi>Germans</hi> back over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> tho
they were at lea<U+017F>t 70000 <U+017F>trong. In other places where
the War was more di<U+017F>pers'd, it was <U+017F>till proportionably
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful on our <U+017F>ide, the King having taken the <hi>Franche
Comte;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who made head again<U+017F>t
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having taken his Baggage at the
Battel of <hi>Seneff,</hi> and made him rai<U+017F>e the Siege of <hi>Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
In all the<U+017F>e places there fell a world of Men, and
a Peace <U+017F>eem'd equally needful to both parties, but one
thing rendred it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be effected. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Grana</hi> had been too cunning for Prince <hi>William</hi>
of <hi>Fur<U+017F>temberg,</hi> now Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and had
<U+017F>urpriz'd him in the City of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and taken him
Pri<U+017F>oner; and this had quite broken off all the Treaties
then on foot for the Peace of Chri<U+017F>tendom. He was
carry'd to <hi>Neu<U+017F>tadt</hi> under a <U+017F>trong Guard; and the
Emperor, who knew he was deep in the intere<U+017F>ts of
his Enemies, and afraid too of his capacity, re<U+017F>olv'd to
detain him, tho the action was condemn'd by all the
world, as again<U+017F>t the Laws of Nations; the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly at <hi>Cologne,</hi> on the part of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of that name; and the violence offer'd him there
was enough, without any further de<U+017F>ign upon him:
and people were the more concern'd at this too, becau<U+017F>e
of all things the Emperor him<U+017F>elf was a Prince far
from any <U+017F>uch ill de<U+017F>igns; but <U+017F>ome of his States-men
per<U+017F>wading him, that he could not be <U+017F>afe without it,
and that this Prince <hi>William</hi> had as much credit in the
Empire as him<U+017F>elf, he made his Judgment <U+017F>toop to his
Intere<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o his ruine was concluded on; and if the
Emperor had been le<U+017F>s religious he had not liv'd long.
In <U+017F>hort, they a<U+017F><U+017F>embled the next day, more indeed to
make a formal Judgment, than to examine much into
his Affair; but the Emperor would have but three of
his Mini<U+017F>ters there, of whom the Prince <hi>de Lokowits</hi>
was one. They condemn'd him to lo<U+017F>e his Head, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57806:162"/>
the Execution was appointed to be in private, and not
to be known till it was over. But the Prince <hi>de Loko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits,</hi>
who <U+017F>ign'd the <U+017F>aid Sentence much again<U+017F>t his
Will, whither it was that he was a Pen<U+017F>ioner to <hi>France,</hi>
as his Enemies gave out, or that he thought that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceeding would reflect upon the honour of the
Emperor his Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>ent word to the Popes Nuncio,
and de<U+017F>ir'd him to go to the Emperor, and to threaten
him with the Cen<U+017F>ure of the Church, if he <U+017F>uffer'd this
Sentence to be executed. The Nuncio, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Orders from the Pope to interceed for the Princes
Liberty, was very ready to forward the matter, and
<U+017F>ent immediately to demand Audience of the Emperor;
who being <U+017F>urpriz'd, when he under<U+017F>tood he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with an affair which he had committed to <U+017F>o
few per<U+017F>ons: the Emperor did all he could to find out
how he came by the information; but the Nuncio told
him, his Maje<U+017F>ty knew well enough what he told him was
true, and begg'd his Maje<U+017F>ty to con<U+017F>ider what might be
the effect of <U+017F>uch a proceeding. The Emperor, who is a
mighty religious Prince, and who<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>cience would
not permit him to contradict the Pope, <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf
to be blu<U+017F>ter'd out of his intentions, by the high words
of this Church-man, and <U+017F>o chang'd the Sentence from
that of Death to clo<U+017F>e Impri<U+017F>onment. It was al<U+017F>o a
great <U+017F>tep to his Deliverance, that he had taken up the
Habit of an Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tick, for that was the Nuncio's
great Argument to the Emperor, that he had nothing
to do to put to death a Man who was con<U+017F>ecrated to
the Church; and that if he was guilty of any crime,
the Pope ought to take cognizance of it.</p>
            <p>But if the Prince <hi>de Lokowits</hi> found means thus to
<U+017F>ave the Prince of <hi>Fur<U+017F>temberg,</hi> he ruin'd him<U+017F>elf by it;
for the Emperor pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting that this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
mu<U+017F>t come from him, caus'd him to be arre<U+017F>ted,
and <U+017F>eized upon his Secretary at the <U+017F>ame time, who
they put to the torture. It is hardly to be imagin'd the
barbarous u<U+017F>age they both receiv'd; for be<U+017F>ides this
affair for which they were re<U+017F>olv'd to plague him, the
Empre<U+017F>s, that then was, ow'd him a <U+017F>pleen, for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57806:162"/>
her Marriage, which <U+017F>he could never forgive him;
he had indeed pu<U+017F>ht on the Match with the pre<U+017F>ent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s,
and had the other dy'd <U+017F>ooner, perhaps he might
have made <U+017F>hift to have got off clear; but the Empre<U+017F>s
hating him, every one made their Court to her by pu<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at him, till at la<U+017F>t he was <U+017F>ent to one of his own
Ca<U+017F>tles, where they found means to poi<U+017F>on him, and <U+017F>o
<U+017F>ent him out of the way.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things had rais'd <U+017F>uch a ferment on both <U+017F>ides,
that in<U+017F>tead of Peace, or the hopes of it, the Flame of
War was kindled more violent than ever. All the
preparations imaginable were made on every <U+017F>ide; but
after all, fortune <U+017F>till declar'd for us, and every year
before the Enemy could be got together, the King had
taken two or three of their be<U+017F>t places; by this means
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> grew weaker and weaker, tho indeed
'twas chiefly by the negligence of the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi>
for in<U+017F>tead of committing the Government of tho<U+017F>e
Countries to an experienc'd Soldier, that under<U+017F>tood
things, the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermo<U+017F>a</hi> was then Governor,
who had never <U+017F>erv'd in any degree above a Captain of
Hor<U+017F>e, and was no way a match for the old politick
Commanders in the King's Army. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> had
another failing too, which was that they wanted Money
to make Magazines for their Forces; whereas the King
could take the Field in the middle of Winter, and his
Men had no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities to encounter, but the <U+017F>everity of
the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on; all the<U+017F>e things ought to have inclin'd them
to a Peace, and mo<U+017F>t people thought it would have done
<U+017F>o; but the Mini<U+017F>ters of State <U+017F>eeing with other Eyes,
they re<U+017F>olv'd upon the continuance of the War, to the
great regret of all <hi>Europe,</hi> who was quite weary of <U+017F>uch
a long and bloody contention.</p>
            <p>I had <U+017F>till my old po<U+017F>t, and being of <U+017F>o ill an age for
action, I <U+017F>ought for no other; and finding that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Turenne</hi> was almo<U+017F>t ready to go into the Field,
I got away before with my little Equipage: As I went
by <hi>Courtenai,</hi> I found a <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Officer of the Regiment
of <hi>Grana,</hi> call'd <hi>Cueillette,</hi> who had been taken Pri<U+017F>oner
at the Battel of <hi>Seneff,</hi> and was returning into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:57806:163"/>
with <U+017F>ome private Soldiers, who had run the <U+017F>ame
fate with him<U+017F>elf; they had an Order for Quarters,
paying for what they took; but the Sheriffs were forc'd
to put them all into a Barn with Straw for their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the Officer was lodg'd in an Inn, and I becoming
acquainted with him there, we lodg'd together for three
or four times; I found him a very civil Gentleman, he
told me he was a <hi>Lorrainer,</hi> and that he had been Page
to the Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> His
company was very agreeable to me, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince I
travell'd no fa<U+017F>ter than he, only it co<U+017F>t me a little
dearer; for when we came to <hi>Bar Sur Scine,</hi> he told
me his Money was all gone, and that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Louvois</hi>
having made him attend <U+017F>everal days for his Pa<U+017F>sports,
he had <U+017F>pent his Money, and knew not how to get more
till he <U+017F>hould reach to <hi>Mets;</hi> that if I would defray
his Charges <U+017F>o far, and his Men, I <U+017F>hould extreamly
oblige him, and he would certainly reimbur<U+017F>e me when
he came there. I believ'd all he <U+017F>aid, and did more for
him than I <U+017F>hould have been per<U+017F>waded to do for one
of my own Countrymen; at lea<U+017F>t unle<U+017F>s I had known
him very well: I told him he <U+017F>hould not be di<U+017F>turb'd,
I would let him have what he had occa<U+017F>ion for. When
we came to <hi>Mets,</hi> he told me, the Man who he was
directed to, was gone out of Town, <U+017F>o that in<U+017F>tead of
paying me what he had promis'd me, he mu<U+017F>t beg me
to continue my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to him, and <U+017F>upply him till
he came to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> that there he had abundance of
Acquaintance; and that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he came there,
he would punctually repay me all I had laid out for
him: I did not mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t him yet, but <U+017F>upply'd him
with whatever he wanted; but from that day to this I
could never <U+017F>ee one penny of my Money; and 'tis the
lea<U+017F>t that I can do, to give this caution to <U+017F>uch as read
the<U+017F>e <hi>Memoirs,</hi> to take heed who they tru<U+017F>t in that
manner: I have been <U+017F>ince told he is become a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,
but he might have paid his Debts fir<U+017F>t; for I do
not under<U+017F>tand they have any more priviledge than
other people to rob their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:57806:163"/>
In <U+017F>hort, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> <U+017F>oon after being come
to the Army, he had about as much cau<U+017F>e to be pleas'd
with the Inhabitants of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> as I had with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Cueillette;</hi> they promis'd him a thou<U+017F>and things
which they never perform'd, but he might have known
them, for they had us'd him ju<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame manner the
year before; this oblig'd him to pa<U+017F>s the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their giving up their Bridge to the Enemy; but
all the Country being ruin'd, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to tell you
what difficulties we were put to for want of Forrage,
and for fifteen days together our Hor<U+017F>es eat nothing
but Weeds we pickt up and down near the Camp. The
Quarter Ma<U+017F>ter General of the Hor<U+017F>e, gave Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Turenne</hi> an account of this every night when he went
for Orders, telling him the Cavalry could not <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer, if they were not permitted to Forrage, for it
had been a long time <U+017F>ince he would <U+017F>uffer them to go
out for that <U+017F>upply; but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd
him, that they would never dye with hunger, as long
as there was Leaves upon the Trees, and if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they might go and gather them if they pleas'd. The
Enemies far'd no better than we did, and we did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on neither <U+017F>ide but watch to <U+017F>ee which
would break up fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o as the other might make <U+017F>ome
advantage of it; for if we had a great Captain at the
head of our Army, the <hi>Germans</hi> had no fool with them,
being Commanded by no le<U+017F>s a Man than <hi>Montecuculli,</hi>
who had <U+017F>hown us a piece of his skill at the beginning
of the War in the fir<U+017F>t Campaign, when feigning to
march way, he countermarcht immediately, and went
directly the contrary, and on a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>urrounded <hi>Bon</hi>
in <U+017F>uch a manner, as we could by no means relieve it.
Thus the two Armies lay and both <U+017F>uffer'd great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
till at la<U+017F>t they came <U+017F>o near, as 'twas thought
they could not part without coming to a Battle, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was overjoy'd at the hopes of being deliver'd at
once from all the<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries; but ju<U+017F>t at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> thought the hour of
Victory was come, he was kill'd with a Cannon Bullet,
by the fault, in part, of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de St. Hillaire,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57806:164"/>
General of the Artillery; I <U+017F>ay by his fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> having <U+017F>poke to him to go
along with him, to view where he might place a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
he mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>tay to put on a Red Cloak, by
which they were known to be Officers, and that made
the Enemy fire at them; and the <U+017F>ame Ball that kill'd
the one, <U+017F>hot off the Arm of the other, as he was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <U+017F>omething they were taking notice of together.</p>
            <p>If another was to tell this <U+017F>tory, you might expect
<U+017F>ome account of the <U+017F>trange con<U+017F>ternation which <U+017F>eiz'd
the whole Army upon this unhappy accident; but I
can give no di<U+017F>tinct relation, for the confu<U+017F>ion I was in
my <U+017F>elf was <U+017F>o great, that I minded no body el<U+017F>e, nor
took no ob<U+017F>ervations of other matters; this I know,
that every body gave them<U+017F>elves over for lo<U+017F>t; and the
more, becau<U+017F>e the Marquis <hi>de Vaubrun,</hi> and the Count
<hi>de Lorges,</hi> without con<U+017F>idering that the condition we
were in requir'd a common unity for our general <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
fell to making Factions and Parties, and to draw
the great Officers to their <U+017F>ides, about the principal
Command. This had certainly been the ruine of the
whole Army, if it had continued but two days, but
<U+017F>ome of the graver heads remon<U+017F>trating to them, that
this was not a time for them to di<U+017F>pute Punctilio's of
Honour, and point of Command, but to con<U+017F>ider the
Honour of the King, and that they would be call'd to
an account for it if things mi<U+017F>carry'd upon this <U+017F>core:
At la<U+017F>t they per<U+017F>waded them to refer their preten<U+017F>ions
to <U+017F>ome of the principal Officers, cho<U+017F>en by the re<U+017F>t to
decide it between them; and <U+017F>o the differences being
compos'd, we began to retreat towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
where we had a Bridge of Boats. But we had taken
<U+017F>everal advanc'd Po<U+017F>ts very near the Enemy, and 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to draw our Men out of them before we decampt,
which we did without any lo<U+017F>s, <U+017F>etting fire to our
works, and principally at <hi>Wille<U+017F><U+017F>at,</hi> where all the Mills
were burnt. The Enemy, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Death of our General, imagining we would
re<U+017F>olve to retreat, as we did indeed, prepar'd to fall
upon us; and decamping the very moment that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57806:164"/>
to retire, they attackt us at a Pa<U+017F>s of a little River;
the Fight was very ob<U+017F>tinate on both <U+017F>ides, ours being
enrag'd at the lo<U+017F>s of their General, and the other in
hopes to make their advantage of our Confu<U+017F>ion,
knowing we had lo<U+017F>t our principal dependance; but
neither Party had their ends, for the <hi>Germans</hi> being
oblig'd to repa<U+017F>s the River with the lo<U+017F>s of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, we had the honour of the Action; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we were forc'd to proceed on our Retreat, and that
with all the caution imaginable; and the Enemy having
waited upon us to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> we pa<U+017F>t that River in <U+017F>ight
of their Army.</p>
            <p>My Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion being void by the Death of Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> I re<U+017F>olv'd to leave the War; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great many more in the <U+017F>ame circum<U+017F>tances, we
form'd our <U+017F>elves into a little Troop, that we might be
able to defend our <U+017F>elves if we <U+017F>hould be attackt; for
be<U+017F>ides that the Country was full of <hi>Schepepans,</hi> a <U+017F>ort
of people as dangerous as the Enemy, the <hi>Germans</hi> al<U+017F>o
had pa<U+017F>t the <hi>Rhine</hi> after us, and fill'd the Country with
their Parties, and we met with one of them pre<U+017F>ently,
with whom we engag'd, and had the good fortune ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to defeat them by plain force: We took the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that commanded them Pri<U+017F>oner, and they that took
him having <U+017F>earcht him, they found a Pa<U+017F>sport in his
Pocket, which they brought to me, for they had made
choice of me to command them, till we <U+017F>hould be pa<U+017F>t
danger. This Pa<U+017F>sport <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>omething particular to
me, for among us there was no body took Pa<U+017F>sports,
but <U+017F>uch as belong'd to <U+017F>ome Garri<U+017F>ons; but they told
me they did not belong to the Body of the Army, but
to certain Troops which the Enemy had po<U+017F>ted in <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places in <hi>Al<U+017F>ace.</hi> While he was talking with me, I
perceiv'd <U+017F>ome Blood to run down his Coat, upon which
I told him, I doubted he was wounded; he told us he
was not, for he knew nothing of it; but when he <U+017F>aw
his Blood he chang'd colour immediately, and which
was very <U+017F>trange, in a moment more he dropt down
dead; whether 'twas really from the greatne<U+017F>s of the
Wound, or the <U+017F>urprize of it that <U+017F>eiz'd him, which I
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57806:165"/>
am more apt to believe; for certainly Fear is capable
of producing more extraordinary effects than that:
And the Marquis <hi>d' <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>xelles,</hi> Collonel of the Dauphin's
Regiment, told me a <U+017F>tory a few days ago, that at the
Battel of <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>el,</hi> one of the Soldiers fell down dead in
the Ranks, before one <U+017F>hot was fir'd, ju<U+017F>t as they were
going to charge. 'Twas a great good fortune to us how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that this Man dy'd thus, without which, I, and all
my Troop, had been taken Pri<U+017F>oners, for we were
hardly got a League farther, before we met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party of the Enemies Hor<U+017F>e, who were at lea<U+017F>t
three hundred <U+017F>trong. I was a little <U+017F>urpriz'd, for our
Scouts had not had time to come to ask them who
they were for? But <U+017F>ome of their body came up to
me, and askt me who we were? It came <U+017F>trangely
into my Head, at the very moment, to make u<U+017F>e of
the Pa<U+017F>sport, I told you of, and with a greater pre<U+017F>ence
of mind than was u<U+017F>ual to me in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, I told them,
we belong'd to <U+017F>uch a Garri<U+017F>on, naming the place the
dead Officer had belong'd to, and to confirm it I <U+017F>how'd
them my Pa<U+017F>sport, which they taking for granted, let
us all go. 'Twas a great happine<U+017F>s to me, that I was
pretty well Ma<U+017F>ter of the <hi>German</hi> language, <U+017F>o that
they never imagin'd me to be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was what deluded them mo<U+017F>t. Being thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
got out of their Clutches we pur<U+017F>ued our Journey,
and arriv'd <U+017F>afely in <hi>France,</hi> where they had given over
all for lo<U+017F>t upon the Death of Mr. <hi>de Turenne.</hi> The
King him<U+017F>elf indeed expected <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter to fall out,
and therefore had <U+017F>ent an Expre<U+017F>s to the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
who was then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to put him<U+017F>elf at the
Head of the Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> with all the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
imaginable. The <hi>Germans</hi> were <U+017F>et down before

and for three days together had fir'd upon the
Town, and thrown in a great many Bombs; but this
only <U+017F>erv'd to encourage us again, <U+017F>eeing they made no
better u<U+017F>e of the advantage they had. I was ju<U+017F>t arriv'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57806:165"/>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> when the news of the<U+017F>e things came thither;
but nothing <U+017F>urpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me like the <U+017F>tory they told of
<U+017F>ome <hi>Jews</hi> in tho<U+017F>e Towns, who had got a way to put
out the Fu<U+017F>e of the Bombs, ju<U+017F>t as they were going to
break. They threw them<U+017F>elves de<U+017F>perately upon them
with the Hide of an Ox ju<U+017F>t kill'd in their hands, and
<U+017F>topping the Mouth of the Fu<U+017F>e <U+017F>o that no Air could
get in, they put the Fu<U+017F>e quite out. It had been a
brave contrivance for the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>es</hi> to have had <U+017F>ome of
the<U+017F>e people with them, upon the late recounter we had
with them; which if they had their City, which was
the mo<U+017F>t magnificent in the world, had not been reduc'd
to that condition we are told it now lyes in.</p>
            <p>The death of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was daily in my
thoughts, and if I had had the lea<U+017F>t inclination to a <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
I believe this alone would have caus'd me to
have retir'd to a Cloi<U+017F>ter; but that <U+017F>ort of life having
been always my aver<U+017F>ion, I made no advantage of the
example that great man left me, who had re<U+017F>olv'd to
retire him<U+017F>elf among the Fathers of the Oratory if ever
he had out-liv'd the War. I <U+017F>peak this to my own
<U+017F>hame, that an old Fellow as I was of above three<U+017F>core
and ten, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o fond of the World at that Age;
that I could not be per<U+017F>waded to for<U+017F>ake it. To <U+017F>peak
the truth, I did not <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o old as I was, as I have <U+017F>aid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for tho I might have been tru<U+017F>ted <U+017F>afely enough with
Women, yet my Age it <U+017F>eems did not appear <U+017F>o much,
but that I was capable of making <U+017F>ome people jealous:
Indeed I was the occa<U+017F>ion that a Gentleman of <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
who<U+017F>e name I <U+017F>hall conceal, made a pretty <U+017F>ort of an
e<U+017F><U+017F>ay upon his Wife, which might have been a fine Hi<U+017F>tory
if it had been publick, for being become extraordinary
jealous of his Wife, he gets him a Fryers habit, one of
the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ort he knew his Wife went to Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to,
and having brib'd her Page to be true to him, he order'd
it <U+017F>o that when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent the boy for her Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, he
<U+017F>hould bring her word that he was not well, but that
he had <U+017F>ent one of his Fellows of the Order. In the
mean time her Husband dre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in the habit, and
went to her Chamber, which being a dark Room, he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57806:166"/>
did not fear being di<U+017F>cover'd; being there, he began to
make <U+017F>trange work with her, for he in<U+017F>tead of acting
the Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, examin'd her particularly if <U+017F>he had not
entertain'd me, and <U+017F>he could not imagine why after
all <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ay to him, <U+017F>till he repeated the <U+017F>ame
que<U+017F>tion to her over and over, which he did al<U+017F>o to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him<U+017F>elf of <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion which he had in
his head, if I might believe what <U+017F>he told me the next
day; he got nothing from her but what <U+017F>he did not care
if all the World knew: But the truth was <U+017F>he knew
him by his voice which made her be cautious, and <U+017F>he
had Wit enough not to let him perceive it; but both
made a je<U+017F>t of their Religion, one to <U+017F>atisfy his jealou<U+017F>y,
and to find out, if it had been po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, the Intrigues of
his Wife, and the t'other, to cure his Jealou<U+017F>y if <U+017F>he
could, which only made him ill natur'd.</p>
            <p>While I <U+017F>pent my time thus, the Kings Army had
enough to do to repul<U+017F>e the <hi>Germans,</hi> and hardly cou'd
keep them from pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing into <hi>France</hi> it <U+017F>elf; for the
death of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was not the only misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that befel us, for there happen'd a wor<U+017F>e at <hi>Treves,</hi>
were the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Crequi</hi> was <U+017F>o intirely beaten,
that we have very rarely heard of <U+017F>uch a defeat; mo<U+017F>t
people, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e that did not know how things
were carry'd, thought the accident which befel M. <hi>Vignori,</hi>
the Governour of <hi>Treves,</hi> was the occa<U+017F>ion; they thought
I <U+017F>ay that he having agreed with Mr. <hi>de Crequi</hi> to <U+017F>ally
out and fall upon the Enemies Rear, and being kill'd
in the march, which the General knew nothing of, was
the cau<U+017F>e of the di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
all things, but I mu<U+017F>t explain this; for Mr. <hi>de Crequi</hi>
knew well enough before that his Hor<U+017F>e had thrown him
and broke his Neck, the Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Treves</hi>
having <U+017F>ent him word of it by an Expre<U+017F>s: the real occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of the misfortune was, that in<U+017F>tead of 200 Hor<U+017F>e,
which he had ordered to go out to forrage, the order
was mi<U+017F>taken, and all the Hor<U+017F>e went out, <U+017F>o that when
the Enemy appear'd, there was no Hor<U+017F>e to receive the
Charge or to cover the Foot. However 'twas, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57806:166"/>
perplext the Court very much, if the Enemy cou'd
have made the be<U+017F>t of their advantage, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
among them<U+017F>elves were the occa<U+017F>ion, that it all
ended with the taking the City of <hi>Treves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had followed a cour<U+017F>e of Life for four years pa<U+017F>t
which was very agreeable to me, and tho one would
have thought I <U+017F>hould have lov'd my ea<U+017F>e better, yet
I could not be quiet but I mu<U+017F>t return to the Wars,
but I could find no opportunity, for every body knew
me, and I was a<U+017F>ham'd at my years to go and beg an
employ, <U+017F>o I was forc't to <U+017F>it <U+017F>till whether I would or
no; I know not whether my di<U+017F>quiet at this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cau<U+017F>e brought me to it, but at la<U+017F>t I began to be
out of order, and in <U+017F>even or eight days I was <U+017F>o bad,
that I was given over by all people; my Di<U+017F>temper
was a Dy<U+017F><U+017F>entery, and tho they could find no way to
<U+017F>top it, yet I was of <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a con<U+017F>titution, that I do
not think I was <U+017F>ounder at 25 years of Age; from
whence I could not believe I was <U+017F>o ill as they <U+017F>aid I
was, and no body would tell me of it, but <U+017F>eeing my
<hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> cry, I would know what was the
matter with him, and he told me it was becau<U+017F>e the
Chyrurgeon had told him I was a dead man; I <U+017F>ay the
Chyrurgeon becau<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t know I fell <U+017F>ick in the
Country, and having no Doctor at hand, I would not
let them <U+017F>end for one: I was not frighted at what the
Boy <U+017F>aid, but finding my di<U+017F>temper increa<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>ent to
<hi>Paris</hi> for a Hor<U+017F>e Litter to carry me thither, being about
12 miles off; being brought thither I <U+017F>ent for a Doctor
that us'd to come to me, one <hi>Jonquet,</hi> and the fir<U+017F>t thing
he askt me was, if I had not had a debauch; I askt him
what he meant by it, for there was <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches;
that if he meant of women, I had not been a
hater of the Sex in my time, but he told me he meant as
to Wine, adding withal that if it was from that, he
would not undertake me, for it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
recover me; I a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him there was no <U+017F>uch thing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he told me then there was hope, however
he would promi<U+017F>e me nothing, for I was ancient and
therefore he advis'd me to <U+017F>end for a Prie<U+017F>t, and make
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57806:167"/>
ters even for another World, I believ'd him, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my <U+017F>elf wholly to Gods mercy and the Doctors art; he
took me into his management, and kept me in his
hands five Months intire, in which time I took <U+017F>ome
Phy<U+017F>ick or other of him every other day: This is a <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
every one may not believe, that one of <U+017F>eventy years
old <U+017F>hould hold out <U+017F>o long in a Di<U+017F>temper, that often
di<U+017F>patches younger men in half the time; at la<U+017F>t, my
Phy<U+017F>itian coming to <U+017F>ee me told me, 'twould be a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to him to take any more of my Money, and do me
no more good; that all that he could think of to give
me, or all that he could be inform'd of in con<U+017F>ultation
with others, <U+017F>erv'd indeed to keep me alive, but not at
all to recover me, and therefore he would come and <U+017F>ee
me as a Friend but not as a Phy<U+017F>itian. This was in <U+017F>hort
to tell me had given me over, however, tho both from
my Di<U+017F>temper and my Age I had rea<U+017F>on enough to fear,
yet I had no apprehen<U+017F>ion on me, I only de<U+017F>ir'd him, to
continue his good Offices, and come to <U+017F>ee me as he us'd
to do, but he like a very hone<U+017F>t man, would not take
any more Money; and tho my di<U+017F>temper held me four
Months longer, he never fail'd coming to <U+017F>ee me: I
<U+017F>hould tell you a lye if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, I was in as much
pain all that time as I was before, for I had a great deal
of ea<U+017F>e to what I us'd to have, but being not at all cur'd,
and re<U+017F>olv'd if 'twere po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, whate re it co<U+017F>t, to get
rid of the Di<U+017F>temper, I had recour<U+017F>e to a thou<U+017F>and
Quacks and Mountebanks to relieve me, and I took a
world of Slops and Drugs, but finding all was to no
more purpo<U+017F>e, than what Mr. <hi>Jonquet</hi> had done already,
I <U+017F>ent for one Father <hi>Ange,</hi> a Capuchin, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an admirable man for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of things; when
he came in, I told him a long <U+017F>tory of what I had <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by this Di<U+017F>temper, and that I hop'd he could tell
me of <U+017F>omething to cure me, he reply'd in a doleful Air,
that he had known <U+017F>everal that had langui<U+017F>h'd a longer
time under the <U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>temper than I, that the Duke
of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had had it four years together, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this might hold me as long; if I had been able I
believe I <U+017F>hould have beaten him to hear him talk in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57806:167"/>
<U+017F>uch a manner; but I was grown <U+017F>o weak that the
lea<U+017F>t puff would have blown me down almo<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o I
was forc'd to take it patiently, and only askt him if he
could tell me of any thing to do me good, at lea<U+017F>t that
I might get <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t, for I had not <U+017F>lept, as I may <U+017F>ay, in 8
months, and 'twas that which weaken'd me <U+017F>o extreamly.
The good Man to pacify me, brought me the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a miraculous Syrup, which be<U+017F>ides its Vertue, was <U+017F>o
plea<U+017F>ant to the ta<U+017F>te, that I thought when I took it, I was
drinking Rasberry-water. I <U+017F>lept after it 12 hours without
waking; and when he came to <U+017F>ee what effect it had
on me, I embrac'd him, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him, that I <U+017F>hould
be bound to acknowledge the remainder of my life was
owing to him. But I began to rejoyce a little too <U+017F>oon,
for all the other remedies he gave me, were <U+017F>o far from
having the <U+017F>ame effect, that they only put Nature into
a ferment; and all the benefit I had, was that I found it
ea<U+017F>y to take his Medicines, for they were all as plea<U+017F>ant
as the fir<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o I di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>t Father <hi>Ange,</hi> as I had
done all the re<U+017F>t: And I believe this unhappy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper
had <U+017F>till been my Companion, if Madam <hi>d' Ort,</hi>
Si<U+017F>ter to the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> had not happen'd
to come to <hi>Paris.</hi> I was acquainted with her, but more
particularly with her Husband, who was a very brave
Gentleman; <U+017F>he enquiring after her old Friends<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and
hearing what a pitiful condition I was reduc'd to, came
to <U+017F>ee me, and brought with her a certain <U+017F>ort of Bread,
which <U+017F>he had made up like a Cake, which I had no
<U+017F>ooner eaten of, but I found my <U+017F>elf perfectly cur'd: I
have carry'd <U+017F>ome of it about me ever <U+017F>ince, and I think
I may <U+017F>ay it has been the pre<U+017F>erver of my life.</p>
            <p>'Twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be brought lower than I was;
yet this good effect my affliction had, that it made me
more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the things of another world than I had
been formerly; I went to Church a little oftner than I
us'd; and in <U+017F>hort, I began to remember, that I was <U+017F>ome
time or other to dye: On this account having heard of
a certain Capuchin, call'd Father <hi>Marc d' Avano,</hi> who
was reported to work Miracles, I had the curio<U+017F>ity to go
and <U+017F>ee him. I took Po<U+017F>t from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:57806:168"/>
where I heard he was; but being told he was newly
gone from thence for <hi>Germany,</hi> I follow'd him, and
overtook him in the Country of <hi>Gueldres.</hi> I had no
occa<U+017F>ion to make much enquiry after him, for all the
Road was crowded with people, who came, as I did,
from all parts to <U+017F>ee him. But tho every one told me
with great earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, that they had <U+017F>een him cure <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and particularly the lame; yet tho I
look'd with all the Eyes I had, I could <U+017F>ee nothing of
it, only that the vogue was got <U+017F>o into the heads of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he had never le<U+017F>s than an hundred thou<U+017F>and
people about him, where-ever he quartred, and made a
figure like the Entry of <U+017F>ome great Prince; they built
Scaffolds, and paid for <U+017F>tanding at Windows to <U+017F>ee him
go by. My zeal having made me as much a Fool as the
re<U+017F>t, it was not long before I repented it, for the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
I was got upon to <U+017F>ee him, breaking with the weight
of the people, I fell down from a place <U+017F>even or eight
foot high, and broke one of my Arms; <U+017F>everal others
had the like misfortune, or were as much hurt; but tho
they <U+017F>ay 'tis a comfort to have companions in affliction,
I found none from it now, and the rather, becau<U+017F>e I
was in a Country, where 'twas a rare thing to
get a good Surgeon. I <U+017F>ent about for one of the be<U+017F>t,
but they brought me one that under<U+017F>tood no more
than one of our Apprentices in <hi>France;</hi> and after
he had very roughly handled me for about three weeks,
I found it was <U+017F>o ill <U+017F>et, that 'twas all to be done over
again. I repented a thou<U+017F>and times of my Devotion,
and curs'd the people that put this <U+017F>tory of Father <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi>
into my head; but all this did not cure me, I found
my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf reduc'd to the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of carrying my Arm to
<hi>Paris,</hi> in the condition 'twas then in; or el<U+017F>e to put my
<U+017F>elf into the hand of the Hangman of <hi>Ruremond.</hi> This
man under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>etting of bones, as well as breaking
them, and had got <U+017F>uch a name for it, that <U+017F>everal
Gentlemen told me, all people who thought them<U+017F>elves
ill cur'd by others, went to him. It <U+017F>eem'd an odd
thing to me, to apply my <U+017F>elf to the Hangman; but
con<U+017F>idering, I was but in an ill condition to be carry'd
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57806:168"/>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> I e'en deliver'd my <U+017F>elf over to him, like a
condemn'd per<U+017F>on in de<U+017F>pair: Being come to his
Hou<U+017F>e, I told him what had happen'd to me, and askt
him if he could do me any good; to which he <U+017F>urlily
reply'd, with the true air of a Hangman, that he had
cur'd tho<U+017F>e that had been wor<U+017F>e than I; he took hold
of my Arm and <U+017F>tretcht it out; and whether it was that
he handled me a little rudely, or the aver<U+017F>ion I had
to the Man, I know not, but I thought he had done me
a prejudice, and I gave him <U+017F>uch a look as would not
have pleas'd him, if he had <U+017F>een it: However, after
telling me, that he who had had me in hand was a <U+017F>orry
ignorant fellow, and making it out by a great many
terms of Art, which I have forgot, he askt me if I had any
body to hold me, while he perform'd his Operation; I told
him no, and I thought there would be no need, I hop'd I
had courage enough to bear it; and I <U+017F>uppos'd all the
pain he would put me to, would not force me to cry out.
He <U+017F>hook his head at that, which was as much as to <U+017F>ay
he believ'd ne'r a word of it, and told me he was not <U+017F>uch
a Coxcomb to attempt it upon that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition; but
<U+017F>ince I had no body with me, he would have <U+017F>ome of
his own people for that purpo<U+017F>e, and that he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay
for them, for they were gone upon a <U+017F>mall Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about a league or two off. This little Execution he
talkt of was; they had been breaking a Man upon
the Wheel that had kill'd his Wife<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> by and by they
came home, and with their hands all bloody, lay'd
hold of me, ju<U+017F>t methought as they had been doing
to that Murtherer. The Ma<U+017F>ter took hold of my Arm,
and broke it again in an in<U+017F>tant, without any engine but
his hands, but not without <U+017F>uch exqui<U+017F>ite pain to me,
that he had good rea<U+017F>on to tell me I mu<U+017F>t be held. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I was very well <U+017F>atisfy'd in going to him, <U+017F>or I
was well again in a few days, and never felt any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
in that Arm <U+017F>ince, any more than if it had never
been hurt.</p>
            <p>At la<U+017F>t this War ended, after it had held three
years, and all was concluded by the Peace of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi>
as much to the Kings advantage, as the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57806:169"/>
Campaign had been; for he had found out the way to
divide his Enemies in <U+017F>uch a manner, that in<U+017F>tead of
uniting their common intere<U+017F>ts, they fell into private
Treaties with him, and every one made their Peace as
well as they could. This was <U+017F>uch a fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>tep as the
like was never known, and they <U+017F>oon found their error.
A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever the King had <U+017F>eparated them, he lays hold
of the opportunity with his u<U+017F>ual policy; and as he had
<U+017F>een by the War, that his Kingdom would never be
perfectly at ea<U+017F>e, while <hi>Luxemburg</hi> continued in the
hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he re<U+017F>olv'd therefore to have it
in exchange for <hi>Alo<U+017F>t,</hi> which he had preten<U+017F>ions to of
another <U+017F>ort. This was not <U+017F>uch a Chimera neither as

among <U+017F>everal other Towns, in the cour<U+017F>e of this War,
and the Treaty of Peace expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, that all <U+017F>uch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hould remain to him, as were not mention'd
particularly in the Treaty, this was doubtle<U+017F>s his own,
there being not the lea<U+017F>t notice of it taken in the <U+017F>aid
Treaty; all the Objection was, that he had kept no
Garri<U+017F>on in it, and <U+017F>o the <hi>Spaniards</hi> <U+017F>aid it was actually
put into their power again, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever we had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
it. But the King return'd, that he had left it
to the keeping of the Inhabitants, who had always been
their own Ma<U+017F>ters, and therefore he would <U+017F>tand by
the Letter of the Treaty. In <U+017F>hort, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting, that Prince not to be <U+017F>o
much their friend as that requir'd, cho<U+017F>e rather to name
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ioners to accommodate the matter; the King
did the like, and they appointed the Town of <hi>Courtrai</hi>
for their meeting; which having produc'd nothing but
arguments Pro and Con, and no conclu<U+017F>ion appearing
likely to be made, the King order'd <hi>Luxemburg</hi> to be
inve<U+017F>ted.</p>
            <p>Every body thought this would kindle the fire again,
and that the War would break out hotter than ever.
The neighbouring Princes were <U+017F>o alarm'd, that

it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to adju<U+017F>t it, the King would have
<hi>Luxemburg</hi> or <hi>Alo<U+017F>t;</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> <U+017F>aw, 'twas
equally inconvenient to them to part with either; if
they gave up <hi>Luxemburg</hi> they <U+017F>hut out their Succors from
<hi>Germany,</hi> from whence they mu<U+017F>t come; if they
granted <hi>Alo<U+017F>t,</hi> it was to give away one of the be<U+017F>t Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> the income from that Bailliage
bringing in a Revenue of 1600000 Livres a year; and
be<U+017F>ides, the juri<U+017F>diction of it extended even to the Gates
of <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> on one <U+017F>ide, and <hi>Ghent</hi> on the other: <U+017F>o that
it would be to block up both tho<U+017F>e Cities. And to <U+017F>ay
all in a word, in the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity they had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to, the King taught them which to choo<U+017F>e; for
his Maje<U+017F>ty having more mind to <hi>Luxemburg</hi> than to
<hi>Alo<U+017F>t,</hi> <U+017F>ent them word that was better for his turn
than the t'other: But he had not the gift of per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion

in the mean time continu'd blockt up, which if it had
not, he mu<U+017F>t have made u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome force to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age on that <U+017F>ide the Country. The King

quarrel if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; <U+017F>o that the Souldiers were wholly
unprovided when they <U+017F>hould have come to fight. The<U+017F>e

<U+017F>ince there is no other Hi<U+017F>tory, I believe, will mention

He had quitted the Kings Regiment, where, as I <U+017F>aid
before, I had plac'd him, and had put him<U+017F>elf into the
Cavalry, where his inclinations led him to <U+017F>erve, and
was made a Captain meerly on the account of merit,
for a very gallant action which he had perform'd; and
tho it be not proper for an Unkle to prai<U+017F>e one of his
near Relations, yet I mu<U+017F>t not omit, that he had a very
good reputation in the Regiment; but <U+017F>o it hapned, that
in one day he lo<U+017F>t all that e<U+017F>teem he had obtain'd, which
neverthele<U+017F>s was not <U+017F>o much his fault, as that by his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Luxemburg</hi> was prevented falling into our hands at
that time. We had been already a good while before
the Town, and the Garri<U+017F>on began to feel the want of
many things, and above all of Money, for want of
which the Governor could not <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t his Men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>end <U+017F>ome body to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> to get

the Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine,</hi> and two other Officers,
and he order'd Capt. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> an old Soldier, for their
guard, who knew all the by-ways round the Town for
twenty miles together. <hi>Gregorie</hi> found means to get
them clear well enough, but we having <U+017F>ome people
in the Town, who gave us an account of every thing
that pa<U+017F>t, we had advice not only of their going out,
but of their errand to <hi>Bru<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> and could have trac'd
them thither if it had been needful; but we contented
our <U+017F>elves to watch them <U+017F>o exactly, as to be <U+017F>ure of them
as they came back. Our Spies look'd out <U+017F>o well,
that we had certain advice when <hi>Gregorie</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
were come within a days journey of the Town,
whereupon <U+017F>everal Parties were <U+017F>ent out, one of which
was commanded by my Nephew; it happen'd that
<hi>Gregorie</hi> fell into his Ambu<U+017F>cade in particular, and they
being but about <U+017F>eventeen Hor<U+017F>e, and my Nephew

<U+017F>atisfaction for this fal<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s; but 'twas all one, they
made them <U+017F>tay a full hour at the Ports; in which time
Captain <hi>Gregorie</hi> and the Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine</hi> con<U+017F>ulted
together what to do, whether they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay in the

to <U+017F>tay in the Town; <U+017F>o they took up in an Inn which
had a private back door, again<U+017F>t which they threw a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to amu<U+017F>e him, and that he
might not imagin he would be <U+017F>tirring that night, made
a <U+017F>trange revelling in the Inn, and <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e as if they
had been all drunk, and appear'd at the Windows with
Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es of Wine in their hands, and this they got <U+017F>ome
<hi>Germans</hi> to continue all night. The Centinels made no
que<U+017F>tion but 'twas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all the night; while in
the mean time they open'd the fal<U+017F>e door I told you of,
and threw a<U+017F>ide the Dung, and went about their bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
My Nephew knew nothing of their going till twas
quite day, when finding how 'twas, and under<U+017F>tanding
they were gone towards <hi>Coblentz,</hi> he follow'd them.
Tho <hi>Gregorie</hi> was a great way before them, yet his
Hor<U+017F>es were <U+017F>o fatigu'd, that he was afraid of being
overtaken before he got to the Town; wherefore <U+017F>eeing
a little Chapel upon the road, he re<U+017F>olv'd to take po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of that, and to defend it if my Nephew <U+017F>hould
attack him; but his ill fate would not put it into his
head to look there. So that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by without di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
them, <hi>Gregorie</hi> came out, and advis'd the Count
<hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine,</hi> and the two others, who carry'd the
Money, to venture with it alone. It was the be<U+017F>t coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el
that could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be given, for our Parties were
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57806:171"/>
very vigilant, and upon the <U+017F>cout on every <U+017F>ide; the
Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine</hi> took his directions, and with the
two Officers betook them<U+017F>elves to the Woods; but they
<U+017F>taid three days before they could get along, and had
<U+017F>taid longer, but that they were forc'd to venture for
meer hunger; Fortune favour'd their Vigilance, for
they pa<U+017F>t undi<U+017F>cover'd in the night, ju<U+017F>t between two
Squadrons of our Troops. They got into <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
in very good time, where the want of Money was <U+017F>o
great, that the Governour would not have known what
to do if they had <U+017F>taid any longer.</p>
            <p>As for Captain <hi>Gregorie,</hi> he wandred a long time in
the Woods, before he could get in; but all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
being <hi>Spani<U+017F>h,</hi> he found means to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o was

occa<U+017F>ion, which at la<U+017F>t offer'd it <U+017F>elf, and he got <U+017F>afe
into the Town; the Governor, who had been in great
pain for him, was overjoy'd to <U+017F>ee him return without
the lo<U+017F>s of a Man. We had News every moment from
ths Town, and when the Hi<U+017F>tory of this E<U+017F>cape came to

him e<U+017F>cape <U+017F>o; they wrote the account of it to the
Court, and very luckily for him, I was gone that very

and always ready to do offices of kindne<U+017F>s
to every body; he <U+017F>eeing me coming from Ma<U+017F>s at
the King's Chapel, de<U+017F>ir'd me to come and dine with
him. I was going to excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, for that I had
promis'd to dine with a Friend: <hi>I don't ask you,</hi> <U+017F>aid he,
whi<U+017F>pering in my ear, <hi>for the good chear you <U+017F>hall find

He <U+017F>aid no more to me then, having another man in
his Company, who he was not willing <U+017F>hould know
what he had to tell me; but this was enough for me to
put off any other appointment. So I went to him, and
there I had the whole <U+017F>tory; after thanking him for his
information, I ask'd him what I had be<U+017F>t to do in it;

only tell him, that this was a mi<U+017F>chance might have
happen'd to any body as well as my Nephew, and that
he had never had the misfortune to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and that if he would plea<U+017F>e to pardon him this,
it would oblige him to greater circum<U+017F>pection; he told
me <U+017F>everal other things I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, which I ob<U+017F>erv'd
exactly, but I found Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
that in<U+017F>tead of hearing me <U+017F>peak, he told me, that

he had taken <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> and he was going to
inform the King, how much he was beholding to him;
I begg'd of him not to do <U+017F>o with all the <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
but he was not a man to be mov'd with pitiful
words, and he had certainly done as he <U+017F>aid, had not a
Courier very happily arriv'd at the in<U+017F>tant, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<U+017F>eek <U+017F>ome friends to <U+017F>peak to him: <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> the <hi>Grand

leave him till he had promis'd his favour to my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
having thus happily made his peace, I <U+017F>ent him
word who he ow'd the obligation to, that he might not
be ungrateful, but above all I order'd him to thank
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Charpentier,</hi> without whom it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to have hindred his ruine.</p>
            <p>I came acquainted with the <hi>Grand Ma<U+017F>ter</hi> by the

of the be<U+017F>t of Women, and of whom I <U+017F>hall always
have a good opinion, for all that has been <U+017F>aid of her
Conduct in the World. I had very great obligations to
that Lord, yet <U+017F>eeing him one time when I was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a vi<U+017F>it; take a great deal of plea<U+017F>ure to reflect
on her, I de<U+017F>ired him to do me the favour to refrain from
<U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him if he did not, I mu<U+017F>t
go out of the Room; he told me he was glad to <U+017F>ee me
take my friends part <U+017F>o vigorou<U+017F>ly, but he hop'd I did
think that which he then <U+017F>poke was not out of malice,
and that he only talkt <U+017F>o to <U+017F>ee if I could make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57806:172"/>
for her; for all the world could tell him, that <U+017F>he
kept a certain young <hi>German,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had rais'd from
a Lackey to be her <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and from that to be
Ma<U+017F>ter of her Hor<U+017F>e, but he would <U+017F>ay no more becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he was a friend of mine; the be<U+017F>t could be <U+017F>aid tho was
this, that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>hewn affection enough for him to
marry him; and for his part he believ'd, they either were
already contracted, or marry'd upon Honor. I know not
how he came by the<U+017F>e particulars, but the truth was, that
Lady manag'd her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o unhappily with that fellow,
that every body reflected on her for it; but while we
were talking about it, came in Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Tonr,</hi>
who had marry'd Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Vitri,</hi> and I pre<U+017F>ently
gue<U+017F>t 'twas all from him, and that he did it in revenge
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had oppos'd his Marriage. His coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but I re<U+017F>olv'd to inform Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Vitri</hi> of it; but that <U+017F>he might not take ill my
freedom with her, I us'd a great deal of precaution in it:
I told her, if <U+017F>he would promi<U+017F>e not to take unkindly
one thing I had to <U+017F>ay to her, I would inform her <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that <U+017F>hould not be to her di<U+017F>advantage; <U+017F>he told
me I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>cruple <U+017F>aying any thing to her; and
after having made a great many prote<U+017F>tations, that I
<U+017F>hould extremely oblige her, I told her, that being in
company with a certain Duke, I heard her <U+017F>o <U+017F>everely
reflected on concerning her conver<U+017F>ation with one of her
Servants, that tho I was very much concern'd for her,
yet I was <U+017F>carce able to ju<U+017F>tifie her conduct. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
her however, that I had not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of her
Vertue, and would an<U+017F>wer for her to all the world bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for body; but if <U+017F>he would permit me to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
to her, this Groom was a fellow that de<U+017F>erv'd to
be hand<U+017F>omly cha<U+017F>tis'd, <U+017F>ince, when he knew what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
the world took of it, in<U+017F>tead of behaving him<U+017F>elf
cautiou<U+017F>ly to prevent the <U+017F>preading of <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e, he
had encreas'd it by his impudence, and had made peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe what really never was; that I knew he had
pull'd out handfuls of Money among his Comrades,
which was as much as to <U+017F>ay, that he who had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of <U+017F>omething <U+017F>o extraordinary, could want for
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57806:172"/>
nothing; that this I had taken notice of in particular,
but there were a multitude of <U+017F>uch like pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages;
tho without troubling her with <U+017F>uch trifles, I left it to
her <U+017F>elf to judge, if this was to be <U+017F>uffer'd in <U+017F>uch a
fellow.</p>
            <p>Tho <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid a thou<U+017F>and things to urge me to be
very free with her, yet I perceiv'd <U+017F>he was very unea<U+017F>ie
at my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, her colour came, and <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>ht
like fire when I touch'd <U+017F>ome particular points; and
when I had done, in<U+017F>tead of flying out on the Ra<U+017F>cal I
had <U+017F>o plainly detected before her, <U+017F>he exclaim'd vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on her Son-in-law, who <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid was the Author of
all the<U+017F>e Calumnies. It was to no purpo<U+017F>e in the world for
me to <U+017F>wear and deny it, <U+017F>he did not believe me, or at
lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he pretended not to believe me; but at the <U+017F>ame
time threatned what <U+017F>he would do to him; and <U+017F>he
gave proofs of her good will in a few days, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>ell a fine E<U+017F>tate <U+017F>he had about <hi>Nemours,</hi> that it
might not come to him: The <U+017F>umm being at lea<U+017F>t four
hundred thou<U+017F>and Francs, <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>oon find a
Chapman; and Mr. <hi>de la Tour</hi> did all he could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
people again<U+017F>t it, when he <U+017F>aw them inclin'd to
it. Indeed her conduct in this affair was inexcu<U+017F>able,
not only on that account, but as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o little di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
as to tell the fellow all I had <U+017F>aid to her. He,
who, tho he had chang'd his habit, had <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ervile
<U+017F>pirit of a Foot-boy, dur<U+017F>t not expre<U+017F>s his re<U+017F>entment
to me; but he had <U+017F>uch an influence upon his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
that <U+017F>he let me <U+017F>ee it in her countenance, which was
enough to have taught me to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and if <U+017F>he
had a mind to ruine her<U+017F>elf, to give her liberty:
Indeed 'tis <U+017F>o with all the world, and a man ought
not to attempt doing people good again<U+017F>t their will;
but as I did every thing different from other people, I
went to her again as I us'd to do, and told her, that for
all her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure at me, I was re<U+017F>olv'd to let her <U+017F>ee
how entirely I was devoted to her, and therefore came
to tell her, that in endeavouring to <U+017F>ell her E<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>he
made the world talk of her more than ever: That now
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57806:173"/>
they <U+017F>aid, for Money to give the Groom, <U+017F>he would
<U+017F>ell the Inheritance of her Family, and ruine her only
Daughter; that <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
of this would be, <U+017F>ince a per<U+017F>on of her quality
mu<U+017F>t needs be more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly touch'd with <U+017F>uch reports
than other people; that her Family, and that of her
Husbands too, were concern'd and at <U+017F>take; and if I
might venture to tell her what I had been told, there
were not wanting tho<U+017F>e that had re<U+017F>olv'd, by <U+017F>ome
means or other, to di<U+017F>patch the Ra<U+017F>cal that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
her, and made her the common talk and je<U+017F>t of
the Town.</p>
            <p>Nothing that I could ever <U+017F>ay to this Lady, made
<U+017F>uch an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon her as this la<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>tance;
<U+017F>he enquir'd who it was that told me <U+017F>o, but finding
me unwilling to name any names, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>t me to it by
all the intreaties and good words po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; but I begg'd
her pardon for not proceeding any further, which made
her imagin I had made the <U+017F>tory my <U+017F>elf. I told her
<U+017F>he was at liberty to believe what <U+017F>he pleas'd, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
time would make it appear too true, that I was
wholly incapable either of adding to, or dimini<U+017F>hing
from the truth: Upon which I left her without any
more ceremony. The next day, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing thro the <U+017F>treet
where <U+017F>he liv'd, I met Mr. <hi>Theodore,</hi> (that was the
name of the Groom) who thinking he had to do with
one of his own <U+017F>ort, comes up to me, and tells me, I
was well <U+017F>et a work to go and tell <U+017F>uch a parcel of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<U+017F>tories to his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s. He had no <U+017F>ooner
<U+017F>poke the words, but without any other reply, I gave
him his reward with two or three good rubs over the
Shoulders with my Cane, at which he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpriz'd,
that he did not <U+017F>o much as offer to put his hand to his
Sword. In the mean time he took another method to
revenge him<U+017F>elf, and gets an order to have me before
the Mare<U+017F>chals of <hi>France,</hi> and did not que<U+017F>tion, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e,
but according to their u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>everity, I <U+017F>hould have been
<U+017F>ent to Pri<U+017F>on. But I having acquainted the Mare<U+017F>chal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> of the matter, before whom that Court was
held; and al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>uch a fellow as he had not a right to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57806:173"/>
<U+017F>ummon before them; he could have no Audience
there, but was referred back to the common cour<U+017F>e of
Ju<U+017F>tice, and there I had been before hand with him, by
the advice of a cunning fellow I employ'd, <U+017F>o that he
was <U+017F>urpriz'd, when coming to get a Warrant for me,
he found him<U+017F>elf arre<U+017F>ted by vertue of a Judgment I
had obtain'd again<U+017F>t him in the <U+017F>ame Ca<U+017F>e. Madam <hi>de
Vitri</hi> was but ill pleas'd with me on this account, and
had told <U+017F>ome of my Friends, that I had <U+017F>o little
re<U+017F>pect for her as to abu<U+017F>e one of her Servants; that
<U+017F>he had always had a great re<U+017F>pect for me, but <U+017F>he
would never forgive me this as long as <U+017F>he liv'd. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd
them to inform her that I was provok'd to it by his
<U+017F>awcy language; that it was true I might have con<U+017F>ider'd
that I ought not to have been provok'd by any thing
<U+017F>uch a fellow could <U+017F>ay, but one is not always Ma<U+017F>ter
of ones pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; be<U+017F>ides a Man ought always to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his own honour; and if I had fail'd in that, yet
I de<U+017F>ir'd her to con<U+017F>ider, that having a Sword by my
<U+017F>ide, I ought <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s to bear <U+017F>uch affronts as
tho<U+017F>e. Another would perhaps have thought the<U+017F>e
excu<U+017F>es rea<U+017F>onable, but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Theodore</hi> having a
greater influence upon her than I, <U+017F>he was not at all
moderated, but continued as furious as ever. I did not
much trouble my head with it, having the <U+017F>atisfaction
of the general approbation in what I had done. Indeed
I dare <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he govern'd her<U+017F>elf more by her humour
than her rea<U+017F>on, as appear'd <U+017F>oon after in her <U+017F>elling her
Land for half the value, to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Boisfranc,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of the hou<U+017F>hold to the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> this
enrag'd all her Relations again<U+017F>t her, and the report
went that to make Mr. <hi>Theodore</hi> amends, for the affront
I had put upon him, <U+017F>he gave him good part of
the Money; Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Tour</hi> who had the greate<U+017F>t
concern, finding things went thus, thought he ought
not any longer to <U+017F>uffer this Wretch; however before
he did any thing, he thought 'twould be be<U+017F>t to theaten
him, to <U+017F>ee if he could make him run away of his own
accord; the de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>ucceeded, for Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Theodore</hi>
<U+017F>eeing that all the world was bent again<U+017F>t him, marcht
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57806:174"/>
off with his Money, without <U+017F>o much as taking leave of
his Dutche<U+017F>s, and if we may give any heed to the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Chronicle,</hi> <U+017F>he laid it <U+017F>o to heart, that it was the
cau<U+017F>e of her death. This is true tho, that <U+017F>he liv'd not
long after his departure, and it had been better for Mr. <hi>de
la Tour</hi> that he had gone 4 or 5 years before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e had not
then <U+017F>quandred away the be<U+017F>t part of her E<U+017F>tate, nor
lo<U+017F>t her Reputation, which before was <U+017F>o great, that no
Lady could have a better.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Blockade of <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
all this while inve<U+017F>ted, and tho the arrival of
the Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine</hi> gave new courage to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on,
yet the relief he brought could not la<U+017F>t always,
and that being wa<U+017F>ted they were reduc'd to the <U+017F>ame
condition they were in before; this made the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
very thoughtful, but at la<U+017F>t he committed one error,
for which, if he had been a Subject of <hi>France,</hi> he would
at lea<U+017F>t have lo<U+017F>t his Government, if not his Head. When
our Forces fir<U+017F>t approach'd, he brings a noi<U+017F>e of Mu<U+017F>ick
to the Ramparts, as much as to <U+017F>ay, he was very glad
to <U+017F>ee us, and that we had oblig'd him in giving him an
opportunity to <U+017F>how his Courage, and upon that made
<U+017F>everal Balls and Rejoycings in the Town; but he never
con<U+017F>ider'd that he had to do with Enemies, who knew
how to dance to other <U+017F>orts of In<U+017F>truments, and who<U+017F>e
Courage had been too well <U+017F>hown in the late War, to be
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected; and if I may be allowed to make a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap><U+017F>ion,
I would <U+017F>ay if they had been attackt by plain
force, it might, for ought I know, have fared with
them as it did with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at the Siege of
<hi>Lerida.</hi> He being flu<U+017F>ht with a multitude of Victories,
which he had gain'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and imagining that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was bound to follow him into <hi>Catalonia</hi> or where
he pleas'd, not at all concern'd at the misfortune that had
befallen the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> the year before, he
brings his Violins to play in the Trenches, and not
content with this, he <U+017F>ends to tell the Governour,
that he would give him every day <U+017F>uch Serenades; to
which the Governour an<U+017F>wer'd, he would endeavour to
return his civilities, but begg'd his pardon till the next
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57806:174"/>
day, his Violins being out of order, but he would take
care they <U+017F>hould be in a readine<U+017F>s by that time; his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
were a peal from his Cannon, which he caus'd to
fire without any intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and in the heat of it
he <U+017F>ally'd out and fell upon the Trenches with a de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
fury: The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> <U+017F>tood him gallantly,
and there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as no Courage wanting in him to beat
him back into the Town, but being not <U+017F>o well <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
as he ought, he was forc'd to give ground,
leaving at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>even or eight hundred of his men upon
the <U+017F>pot.</p>
            <p>Now if I might be <U+017F>uffer'd to give my opinion of <U+017F>o
great a Captain, I think he was very much to blame,
for where is the je<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of Bravado's? are not
there a thou<U+017F>and other ways for a man to <U+017F>ignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
and if one comes to be baulk't, as it happen'd here to
the Prince, how fooli<U+017F>h does it look? but I won't run
too much on this <U+017F>ubject. To go on with the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of
<hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> the Governour was a man of great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and he mu<U+017F>t have degenerated from his family if
he had been otherwi<U+017F>e, for it has been a hou<U+017F>e which has
produc'd a great many Gentlemen of extraordinary
worth; and the action which I am blaming him for,
proceeded indeed rather from an exce<U+017F>s than a want
of Courage; however he ought to con<U+017F>ider that even
too much Courage is an inexcu<U+017F>able fault in a General
or Governour of a Town, tho it may be allow'd in a
Souldier; however there was le<U+017F>s reflection made on
him, for this affair, than for another of a different
nature which happen'd <U+017F>oon after, and 'twas this
I meant, when I <U+017F>aid he had been very <U+017F>everely puni<U+017F>ht
for it, had he been in our <U+017F>ervice; being one Night at a
Ball within the Town, he happen'd to have <U+017F>ome words
with a Collonel of the Garri<U+017F>on call'd <hi>Cantelmo,</hi> who
thinking him<U+017F>elf affronted, whi<U+017F>per'd him in the Ear,
that if it would oblige him he would give him <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immediately: The Governour took him at his
word, and without <U+017F>o much as con<U+017F>idering that he had
an Enemy under his Walls, he withdrew from the Ball
without any noi<U+017F>e, and was immediately at the place
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57806:175"/>
appointed, in a by Street of the Town; the Governours
Second was the Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine,</hi> and <hi>Cantelmo</hi>'s an
under Officer of his Regiment; their Footmen had
Flambeaus to light them, and tho the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s held but
a little while, yet there was <U+017F>ome blood <U+017F>hed; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
gave <hi>Cantelmo</hi> a thru<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ide, which
glanc'd along upon his Ribs, and whether it was that
the Collonel thought him<U+017F>elf wounded wor<U+017F>e than he
was, or that his feet <U+017F>lipt, it was not known, but he fell
down, and the Governour coming up to him, he askt
his life, and was going to deliver his Sword; when the
Officer who was his Second <U+017F>eeing the danger his Coll.
was in, flew to his re<U+017F>cue with <U+017F>uch fury, that he had
run the Governour thro and thro if the Footmen had
not <U+017F>tept in and kept him off with their Flambeaus,
which they run ju<U+017F>t in his face, and <U+017F>o the battel ended,
for they knockt him down ju<U+017F>t by his Coll. and the
Count <hi>de Wal<U+017F>a<U+017F>tine</hi> being come up to the Governour,
they ea<U+017F>ily ma<U+017F>ter'd the other two who were down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If the Mare<U+017F>chal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who lay before the
Town, had had orders to have attackt it, no doubt he
might have made but <U+017F>hort work of it, while the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
that commanded it had <U+017F>o little di<U+017F>cretion, but
tho we had forces enough yet we dur<U+017F>t not attempt it,
as otherwi<U+017F>e we would have done, for we had mea<U+017F>ures
to keep with the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was the more
trouble<U+017F>ome to us, the more he was him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>turb'd
by his own people that hated us, upon which account he
concerted all matters with us. Let not the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi>
think the better of them<U+017F>elves for what I have mention'd;
I dont <U+017F>ay we were <U+017F>o afraid of them, as that we were
bound to do every thing they order'd; if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
again<U+017F>t us it had not been much the wor<U+017F>e for

               </gap> affairs, but 'twas not prudence for us to create our
<U+017F>elves new Enemies, when there was <U+017F>o many jealou<U+017F>ies
already of the progre<U+017F>s of our Arms. I allow they are
a brave people, but I dont doubt we have convinc'd
the World we are <U+017F>o too; one thing we excel them in,
and that is, in having abundance of experienc'd
Souldiers and Officers, bred to the War; and above all

a King, who if he abandons him<U+017F>elf to his plea<U+017F>ures,

            <p>I <U+017F>hall not give any other account why the Blockade

in the World; 'tis an action <U+017F>o lately done and <U+017F>o
well known, that all the world mu<U+017F>t remember it:
There were <U+017F>ome reflections upon my Nephew on the
occa<U+017F>ion of this de<U+017F>ign failing, which he laid <U+017F>o much
to heart, that I perceiv'd he was grown melancholy;
I advis'd him to lay down his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but he would
not do that neither, but being overcome with di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
at la<U+017F>t he fell de<U+017F>perately <U+017F>ick: I lov'd him
very tenderly, and indeed above all the re<U+017F>t of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and therefore I no <U+017F>ooner heard of it, but I took
Po<U+017F>t to go and <U+017F>ee him; 'twas no difficulty for me not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
my Age, for that <U+017F>ort of Coach which is
an invention we have from the <hi>Germans,</hi> carries one <U+017F>o
very ea<U+017F>y, that it is not the lea<U+017F>t inconvenience; at my
arrival at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> for there was his Quarters, I found
him <U+017F>omething better, and very glad he was to <U+017F>ee me,
for as I lov'd him, as I <U+017F>aid before, <U+017F>o he had the <U+017F>ame
affection for me; and it appear'd pre<U+017F>ently; for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<U+017F>o reviv'd him, that he began to recover apace,
and I never left him till he was quite well: And as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contributes to our recovery from any di<U+017F>temper,
more than a proper diverti<U+017F>ement; I endeavour'd to
bring it about for him, by inviting <U+017F>ome Ladies to
come and play at his Chamber. This did not continue
long, for in a little while he was well enough to vi<U+017F>it
them. There were at that time a Poppet-<U+017F>how in the
Town, and all the people went to <U+017F>ee it, the famous
Punchinello doing <U+017F>trange things; tho my Nephew, nor
I, did not much fancy tho<U+017F>e things, yet I carry'd him to
<U+017F>ee it; we were exceedingly diverted, and <U+017F>o were a
great many more be<U+017F>ides us, by <U+017F>ome extraordinary pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages
in this adventure. Some may think it very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in writing the<U+017F>e Memoirs, to trouble the World with
<U+017F>uch a mean <U+017F>tory as this of the Poppet-players; yet if
they plea<U+017F>e to have patience till they have heard it out,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57806:176"/>
they will be better <U+017F>atisfy'd; the rea<U+017F>on I mention <U+017F>uch
a trifle as this, is becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Hi<U+017F>tory depends upon
it, at wor<U+017F>t; it may make 'em laugh, as it hath done many
more be<U+017F>ides my <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brioche</hi> the famous Poppet-player of <hi>Paris,</hi> finding
people began to be weary of his fooleries in the City,
took his opportunity when mo<U+017F>t people were out of
Town, to make a turn in the Country; fir<U+017F>t he went
into <hi>Champagn,</hi> thence into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> <U+017F>o into <hi>Al<U+017F>ace,</hi> and
at la<U+017F>t he came to <hi>Stratsbourg,</hi> where abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
having never <U+017F>een Punchinello, run after him; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s there, he takes a march into <hi>Swi<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I can not po<U+017F>itively remember into what Canton
he went, tho I have been told that too; but in <U+017F>hort,
'twas in one where they were <U+017F>o perfectly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hows, that when he came to play his
tricks among them, they took him for a Conjurer and
thought he dealt with the Devil; away they go to the
Magi<U+017F>trates, who it <U+017F>eems were ju<U+017F>t as wi<U+017F>e as them<U+017F>elves,
and in <U+017F>hort they were going to give <U+017F>entence again<U+017F>t
him; but as it happen<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>d, before they would go <U+017F>o far
they bethought them<U+017F>elves of one Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi>
Colonel of a Regiment of <hi>Swi<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> which was in the <hi>French</hi>
<U+017F>ervice, and who happen'd to be then in the Country<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
he laught heartily at their <U+017F>implicity, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them
that there was no witchcraft at all in the matter, and
that in <hi>France</hi> they were <U+017F>o frequent, that they were to
be <U+017F>een in every Market Town; but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi>
being a joco<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of a man, and the Magi<U+017F>trates think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he only bantred them, they were re<U+017F>olv'd not to
take their mea<U+017F>ures wholly from what he <U+017F>aid, but to
be better inform'd, they order'd Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>d,
and there having te<U+017F>tify'd that they heard little
figures in the <U+017F>hape of Men and Women to <U+017F>peak, they
concluded they could be nothing but Devils, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without any more ado pa<U+017F>t their decree again<U+017F>t
<hi>Biroche:</hi> They carry'd the <U+017F>entence to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi>
who told them in <U+017F>hort, they were going to make
them<U+017F>elves ridiculous, and he was heartily <U+017F>orry that
his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>untrymen <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch abominable Fools. Being
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57806:176"/>
not able with this freedom to undeceive them, he re<U+017F>olv'd
to play 'em a Trick; he turn'd his tone immediately
and told them, that if he had not confe<U+017F>t the whole
matter at fir<U+017F>t, 'twas becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw they would engage
him in an ugly piece of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; that <hi>Biroche</hi> was a
<hi>French</hi> man, and the <hi>French</hi> were now <U+017F>o great, that
people ought to con<U+017F>ider well what they did before
they quarrell'd with them; but be<U+017F>ides that, he had a
great many per<U+017F>ons of Quality among his Poppets,
with Princes and Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>everal Countries, that
he did not know what relation he might have to tho<U+017F>e
great Per<U+017F>ons, but to be <U+017F>ure his intere<U+017F>t was very great,
<U+017F>ince they <U+017F>hould give him leave to bring them upon
the Stage in that manner, and that in a word, he found
they were going upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which might embroil
the whole Canton; but he would <U+017F>ay no more, 'twas
their part to con<U+017F>ider of it; but in ca<U+017F>es where Princes and
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were concern'd they could not be too cautious.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>poken mighty gravely, took with the
Magi<U+017F>trates extreamly: They told Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi>
that what he had told them was of con<U+017F>equence and
de<U+017F>erv'd con<U+017F>ideration, indeed, that they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly to advi<U+017F>e what was to be done,
before they proceeded any further, and pray'd him to
continue his good Offices to them on this occa<U+017F>ion; in
<U+017F>hort, they call'd their A<U+017F><U+017F>embly to con<U+017F>ult of the matter,
and they <U+017F>oon agreed, which was, that they <U+017F>hould have
a care of bringing a trouble<U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
and therefore they <U+017F>ent to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> to
tell him, that they would not proceed to extremity,
but content them<U+017F>elves with bani<U+017F>hing <hi>Biroche</hi> out of
the Canton, on condition that he paid the charges of
his pro<U+017F>ecution; Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> took upon him to
carry this me<U+017F><U+017F>age him<U+017F>elf; but <hi>Biroche</hi> would not hear a
word of it, <U+017F>o Mr. <hi>Du Mont</hi> told the Magi<U+017F>trates, that
<U+017F>ince <hi>Biroche</hi> would not <U+017F>ubmit to their <U+017F>entence, 'twas
his opinion they <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e his Poppets to be <U+017F>tript
of their fine Habiliments, for what ever relation they
might be to per<U+017F>ons of Quality, Princes and Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es,
they would have him do ju<U+017F>tice to be <U+017F>ure, and when
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57806:177"/>
they under<U+017F>tood he had refus'd it, they would blame
him: They thought this was the mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>onable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al
in the World; and <U+017F>ince they could have no <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from him, they <U+017F>ent and plundred all his Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and carry'd away all their fine Cloaths in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and poor <hi>Biroche</hi> was fain to dre<U+017F>s them all in
new Cloaths, before he could appear in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went next in his way to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> had done this fellow no mean
<U+017F>ervice, as you may judge by the <U+017F>tory, yet he thought
otherwi<U+017F>e, and made him a very ill return for it, of
which I can give a particular account, having been an
eye-witne<U+017F>s of it my <U+017F>elf. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> had been
a long time in Garri<U+017F>on at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got a Mi<U+017F>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<U+017F>s at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> had a fancy one time
to go thither to <U+017F>ee her; he went <hi>Incognito,</hi> and having
conceal'd him<U+017F>elf there <U+017F>ome time, his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s would
needs have him go with her to the Poppet-<U+017F>how, and
promis'd him <U+017F>he would <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him, that no body
<U+017F>hould know him; <U+017F>he had much ado to per<U+017F>wade
him: But as 'tis a hard matter to refu<U+017F>e any thing to a
per<U+017F>on a man loves, he agreed to go with her; <U+017F>he
dre<U+017F>t him up like a Burgher, and they <U+017F>at in a corner
by them<U+017F>elves, the young Lady having told her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it was one of her Fathers friends; <hi>Biroche</hi> coming
upon the Stage with his Punchinello, and looking
about him, <U+017F>pies out the Colonel, and knew him,
tho he did all he could to conceal him<U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o he makes
his Punchinello cry out Trea<U+017F>on, Trea<U+017F>on, Trea<U+017F>on in
<hi>Spain,</hi> Trea<U+017F>on in <hi>Germany,</hi> Trea<U+017F>on in <hi>England,</hi> Trea<U+017F>on
in <hi>Portugal,</hi> Trea<U+017F>on in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at la<U+017F>t, Trea<U+017F>on in
<hi>Flanders. Biroche</hi> tells him he <U+017F>hould hold his Tongue
and look he did not trouble his head with what was done
in the <U+017F>everal kingdoms of <hi>Europe;</hi> but Punchinello
run on and names all the other States of <hi>Chri<U+017F>tendom;</hi>
people wondred what this meant, becau<U+017F>e it was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from what they us'd to hear, none of the Plays
beginning like this; but it all came out in an in<U+017F>tant,
for <hi>Biroche</hi> turns to Punchinello and tells him, that
<U+017F>ince he had a mind to talk and prate, he would give
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57806:177"/>
him leave, only on this condition, that he <U+017F>hould not
<U+017F>ay a word that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi> Colonel of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Sui<U+017F><U+017F>e</hi> <U+017F>at there in that corner, dre<U+017F>t up like a
Burgher and his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with him; as there was a great
many Officers there who knew the Colonel well enough,
they all <U+017F>tood up and lookt on every <U+017F>ide, to <U+017F>ee if what
<hi>Biroche</hi> <U+017F>aid was true; in the mean time Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du
Mont</hi> helpt to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf, for being in a <U+017F>trange
confu<U+017F>ion to find him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>urpriz'd in <U+017F>uch a condition,
he made a great deal to do to hide him<U+017F>elf; but one
who knew him a little more particularly than the re<U+017F>t,
made him pull away his Hat from before his face; <U+017F>o
then it <U+017F>ignify'd nothing to endeavour to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
any longer; if he was in confu<U+017F>ion enough, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
was in more, and 'twas well for her that <U+017F>he
pull'd her Hoods over her face, by which <U+017F>he prevented
her being known. But the Comedy was quite put by
on this occa<U+017F>ion: Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> <U+017F>wore he would
be reveng'd on <hi>Biroche;</hi> but he left the Town the <U+017F>ame
day to get out of his way, and went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was
fain to lye hid too, for fear of the Colonels re<U+017F>entment.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer on this <U+017F>tory, becau<U+017F>e I fancy
every body will be pleas'd with it, for of all things that
have been <U+017F>aid of the <hi>Sui<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> I believe no one ever heard
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>imple bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s as this. By this time my Nephew
was quite recovered, and I came back to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
telling this <U+017F>tory, I had pa<U+017F>t for a great Lier, had not
<hi>Biroche</hi> been by to ju<U+017F>tifie it; and I de<U+017F>ire all that read
the<U+017F>e Memoirs and doubt of the truth of it, to inform
them<U+017F>elves from him. He tells a great many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
diverting enough, which I omit here on purpo<U+017F>e
becau<U+017F>e I would not make the <U+017F>tory too long.</p>
            <p>Being come back to <hi>Paris,</hi> I found I had got a little
<U+017F>tock of Money again aforehand; and tho I ought to
have learnt the wit to know what to do with it, having
paid <U+017F>o dear for my experience in the ca<U+017F>e of Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Saillant,</hi> yet I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till be con<U+017F>idering for<U+017F>ooth how
to improve my Money; this good husbandry was a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
came upon me a little too late; had I been <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e
when I liv'd with Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> I had had no need
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57806:178"/>
of it now; but it was my lot to be ruin'd, whoever I
dealt with.</p>
            <p>Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Saillant</hi> mu<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>e me if I <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, 'twas
a word <U+017F>lipt out by chance, and may well be forgiven a
man whom it co<U+017F>t eight thou<U+017F>and Francs be<U+017F>ides Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t,
only to do him a kindne<U+017F>s; however my de<U+017F>ign is
not to do him any harm, for he did his be<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o did
he that I am going to <U+017F>peak of, and I forgive them
both; I had 2000 Crowns by me in good Gold, and
as old age has this particular quality to love hoards, I
enquired of every body if they knew one to whom I
might <U+017F>afely put out this Money; they propo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal
to me, and I cho<U+017F>e out one of them, to my misfortune:
No body pleas'd me <U+017F>o well as one Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Jo<U+017F>eier de
la Jonchiere,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he made a good figure, and I
thought him a rich man: Any body wou'd have been
cheated as well as I, for he had a place of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thou<U+017F>and Francs a year, a fine Hou<U+017F>e of his own
at <hi>Paris,</hi> Rents on the Town-hou<U+017F>e, Lands in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and if one had had a hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns to
put out, he had <U+017F>ix times enough to an<U+017F>wer it; in <U+017F>hort,
I gave him my Money, and thought my <U+017F>elf very much
oblig'd to him that he would take it; but about <U+017F>ix
months after, going along the <U+017F>treet where he liv'd, I
<U+017F>aw a croud of people at his door, and enquiring what
was the matter, they told me they did not know the
particulars, but the Kings Souldiers had taken po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Hou<U+017F>e; which was enough to tell me my Money
was in danger, and I was too true a Prophet, for tho he
appear'd <U+017F>everal days after, yet his affairs and mine were
not much better than one another; he call'd his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
together, and I coming among the re<U+017F>t, he told us
he had enough to pay us all, if we would have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the King would have any compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
him, that he had had <U+017F>everal lo<U+017F><U+017F>es, which the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t
man alive could not fore<U+017F>ee. Fir<U+017F>t, that one of his
Factors had run away with a hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns.
Secondly that upon calling in the Money the pieces of
four Sous, and giving out the markt pieces, he had not
above eight days warning, and having a va<U+017F>t quantity
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57806:178"/>
by him, at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix Millions, <U+017F>ix hundred thou<U+017F>and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,
he lo<U+017F>t above eight thou<U+017F>and Francs by them; do
whatever he could; that tho Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> was
inform'd of his lo<U+017F>s, he being a Publick Notary him<U+017F>elf,
yet he had not <U+017F>par'd him in the Tax, but had rated
him, as he did the two other Trea<U+017F>urers General Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
of the War, at five hundred thou<U+017F>and Livres;
that nothing was <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t as that Tax which was laid
on them, on pretence that they had <U+017F>hared with <U+017F>ome
of the Under-Trea<U+017F>urers in their Cheats; that he would
not an<U+017F>wer for other folks, but for him<U+017F>elf he could
<U+017F>afely <U+017F>wear he had nothing to do with them; that all
his lo<U+017F><U+017F>es amounted to fourteen hundred thou<U+017F>and
Francs, which had all befallen him in a year or two;
that however he had this to comfort him, that no body
needed to lo<U+017F>e a farthing by him.</p>
            <p>He could not <U+017F>ay this to us without <U+017F>ome tears, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on his pa<U+017F>t fortune, which indeed compar'd to
his pre<U+017F>ent condition, was enough to move compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
who but a few days ago liv'd in <U+017F>plendor equal to a
Prince, and was now in a moment reduc'd to <U+017F>uch a
condition, as not to have a Bed to lye on: His Wife,
who was a <hi>Colbert,</hi> and marry'd him but for his E<U+017F>tate,
de<U+017F>erted him now <U+017F>he found he was like to be mi<U+017F>erable;
and his friends, at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch as call'd them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>erv'd him in the <U+017F>ame manner; and
to compleat his mi<U+017F>ery, his Brother-in-law, one <hi>Brebier,</hi>
who had marry'd his Si<U+017F>ter, put him in Pri<U+017F>on for a
Bill of Exchange he had paid for him. In <U+017F>hort, every
one run upon him, and did him all the mi<U+017F>chief they
could, and no body, but I, regarded the incon<U+017F>tancy
of fortune; but I thought my<U+017F>elf oblig'd, rather to
help him than to cru<U+017F>h him in this condition; I had
rather, that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay this than I, becau<U+017F>e it is of my
<U+017F>elf; however, tho I was in no condition to make large
gifts, yet I frankly gave him my two thou<U+017F>and Crowns;
and if all his Creditors had been of my mind, he would
ne'r have peri<U+017F>ht in Pri<U+017F>on, as now he is in great danger
to do. Perhaps God <U+017F>ent him this affliction, to puni<U+017F>h
him for being a little too <U+017F>ure of his pro<U+017F>perity; for there
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57806:179"/>
was nothing rich enough, or fine enough, neither for
him or his Wife. They would not give them<U+017F>elves the
trouble of going to the Play, but the Actors mu<U+017F>t come
and play at their own hou<U+017F>e. Their Diet was extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
nice, and every thing el<U+017F>e an<U+017F>werable, tho at the
<U+017F>ame time they thought, that they had a fortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.
He had a place which in time of War ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
brought him in le<U+017F>s than a Million a year in his turn,
and was at other times worth an hundred thou<U+017F>and
Crowns a year, and there were but three of them, who
had every one a year in their turn; a rare example of
the vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude of humane affairs, from whence one may
learn, that there is nothing <U+017F>o mortifying in a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as to reflect upon our former pro<U+017F>perity.</p>
            <p>A little after this happen'd, my Nephew came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and as he went out after dinner from one of his
acquaintances hou<U+017F>es, he was <U+017F>et upon by four Ruffians,
who after having <U+017F>tab'd him in three <U+017F>everal places with
their Swords, made off, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing they had kill'd him.
The Citizens are commanded, when any <U+017F>uch accident
happens, or when two draw their Swords to fight in
the <U+017F>treets, to di<U+017F>arm them, and <U+017F>ecure their per<U+017F>ons;
but this is an Ordonance which is but very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and 'tis with ju<U+017F>tice enough that the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi>
are accus'd of Cowardize; the Trade<U+017F>men being always
very little fond of parting a Fray in the <U+017F>treet; by which
means the<U+017F>e fellows got away: And tho I made great
<U+017F>earch after them, I could never hear a word of them.
My Nephews wounds were very bad, but yet not <U+017F>o dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as I was afraid they were, and <U+017F>o were cur'd in
le<U+017F>s time than I expected, which I was very glad of;
but however we were <U+017F>atisfied from this, that he had
<U+017F>ome Enemies underhand, and <U+017F>uch as were the more
dangerous, becau<U+017F>e they were not to be known, tho we
did our utmo<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>cover them. I enquir'd of him
who he had given any occa<U+017F>ion to, and on what affair he
could affront any body to de<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch u<U+017F>age; and after
having <U+017F>tudy'd a little on the matter he told me, he
could not tell who to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, except it was one <hi>Bletterie,</hi>
who was in his Winter-quarters in the Country, near
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57806:179"/>
the <hi>Loire;</hi> he had been acquainted with his Wife, who
had carry'd it <U+017F>o very obligingly to him, that he had a
very great e<U+017F>teem for her; that her Husband who was
always by, was <U+017F>o far from <U+017F>hewing any di<U+017F>like at it,
that he was always the forwarde<U+017F>t to invite him to his
hou<U+017F>e: However <U+017F>ince men are not always of the <U+017F>ame
mind, <U+017F>o he would not <U+017F>ay 'twas not on his account:
That this man having been oblig'd to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> about
the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> he had left <U+017F>ome Money with
his Wife, with order to give it to one that was concern'd
with him in the Farms; but that he happening at the
<U+017F>ame time, very unfortunately, to lo<U+017F>e all his Money, <U+017F>he
let him have two thou<U+017F>and Crowns, without any re<U+017F>pect
to the order her Husband had left with her; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
great di<U+017F>turbance follow'd, and the Farmer Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<U+017F>eiz'd his Goods for want of payment; that he had
wrote <U+017F>everal Letters to his Wife, but receiving no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
he was forc'd to come him<U+017F>elf; where <U+017F>he finding
her<U+017F>elf unable to <U+017F>atisfy him, was fain to pretend <U+017F>he
had been rob'd; but that upon enquiry the man was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that there was <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e lo<U+017F>t be<U+017F>ides his
Money.</p>
            <p>My Nephew having made this ingenuous confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I
troubled my <U+017F>elf no more at what had happen'd, but on
the other hand told him, he had but his due; for a man
that could not be content to ki<U+017F>s his friends Wife, but
mu<U+017F>t bilk her of his Money too, de<U+017F>erv'd no fair play,
but ought to expect to dye in the <U+017F>treet, as he had like
to have done. However, this did not hinder my making
all the enquiries I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to find out whether
this happen'd to him on that account or no. I made one
of my Servants I had tutor'd, hire him<U+017F>elf to <hi>le Bletteire,</hi>
who was to <U+017F>ay, he came from the <U+017F>ame Town where
my Nephew liv'd, and had been injur'd by him; which
was to draw <U+017F>omething from him, by which he might
gue<U+017F>s how he <U+017F>tood affected to my Nephew; but he
came away with a parcel of <U+017F>illy <U+017F>tories, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>covery. Another would have
been di<U+017F>courag'd after <U+017F>o many fruitle<U+017F>s attempts, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
too, after having <U+017F>pent more Money about it than
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57806:180"/>
can be imagin'd; for 'tis a cu<U+017F>tom at <hi>Paris,</hi> when they
fancy you are eager to revenge your <U+017F>elf, to have a
number of <U+017F>harping fellows come about you, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
<U+017F>ome this way, and <U+017F>ome that way, to give
you information; and if you hearken to them a little,
they <U+017F>oon find the depth of your Pocket.</p>
            <p>I was the Cully to the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of people for two or
three months; at la<U+017F>t, one that had <U+017F>erv'd me like the
re<U+017F>t, came and told me, he had found one of the Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians:
I thought this was only a trick to get more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and <U+017F>o I told him, if he did not get him about his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, I <U+017F>hould have him <U+017F>oundly kick'd; but he a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me the thing was true, told me, he askt me for
nothing till he had deliver'd the fellow into my hands;
and provided I would then give him ten Pi<U+017F>toles, he
would bring me to the place where he was; that in the
mean time my Nephew <U+017F>hould go before, where he
<U+017F>hould appoint, to <U+017F>ee that he would not deceive me,
and that he would order it <U+017F>o, as to help him to a <U+017F>ight
of the man, and if it was he, he <U+017F>hould be provided
with people ready to <U+017F>ecure him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> This Propo<U+017F>al was
<U+017F>o fair, that I could not refu<U+017F>e it, but I agreed to all his
conditions, and promis'd him more than he demanded.
So taking my Nephew along with him, he plac'd him in
a Chamber up four pair of <U+017F>tairs in <hi>la Rue de la Mortel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi>
where on the other <U+017F>ide of the <U+017F>treet, ju<U+017F>t over
again<U+017F>t him, the per<U+017F>on lodg'd whom he meant; he
plac'd my Nephew in ambu<U+017F>cade behind the Window,
telling him he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>oon <U+017F>ee him come to his Window,
and that he <U+017F>hould not have time to e<U+017F>cape. In <U+017F>hort,
in a moments time he came to the Window, as he had
<U+017F>aid, with a Woman who betray'd him; and my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
having view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him very exactly, was <U+017F>o well <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd,
that this was one of the per<U+017F>ons that a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted
him, that he <U+017F>ent to me to come on with the Officers,
which I immediately did with all expedition. Fir<U+017F>t, I
po<U+017F>ted three or four men at the corner of the <U+017F>treet, and
follow'd my Nephew with the re<U+017F>t, who would needs
be in the action him<U+017F>elf, as being mo<U+017F>t concern'd. We
pre<U+017F>ently en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red the Chamber he had taken notice of,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57806:180"/>
but found no body there; for he being at the Window
when we came to the door, fled to a back room; the
Woman whom we had <U+017F>et to watch, made a <U+017F>ign to us
where he was hid, and there we found him; but he
having fa<U+017F>tned all the Bolts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> we were forc'd to break the
door open: He put him<U+017F>elf at fir<U+017F>t into a po<U+017F>ture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a Pi<U+017F>tol among us, but hurt no body;
but throwing our <U+017F>elves in upon him, we took him, and
carry'd him into the <hi>Chatelet.</hi> My Nephew appear'd to
pro<U+017F>ecute him, and we had very good proof of the a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ault,
for it was made in the open day, and in one of
the mo<U+017F>t publick <U+017F>treets of <hi>Paris;</hi> but when they came
to be brought face to face with the Pri<U+017F>oner, truly there
was but one would be po<U+017F>itive that he was the man, the
other <U+017F>aying, 'twas too long ago to remember particular
faces: However, this was half a proof, and I did not
doubt but they would put him to the torture upon that,
as is u<U+017F>ual; and I hop'd <U+017F>o the rather, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>eem'd
a <U+017F>coundrel kind of a fellow, that had not above two
years ago run away from his Colours. But as <U+017F>orry a
Wretch as he was, he had good friends who <U+017F>ollicited
for him very hard, under-hand; among whom, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Genou</hi> was one, who having a great intere<U+017F>t in the
Parliament, all we could obtain was, that he <U+017F>hould
remain in Pri<U+017F>on three months longer, to <U+017F>ee if we
could bring any further witne<U+017F>s to inform them more
fully; <U+017F>o it lay upon us to u<U+017F>e our endeavour, for after
that time, if none appear'd, he would be at liberty:
But what could we do more than we had done? So the
three months run out, and we being not able to make
any further di<U+017F>covery, had the plea<U+017F>ure, after a great
deal of Money <U+017F>pent in the pro<U+017F>ecution, to have our
Proce<U+017F>s di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>t out of the Court.</p>
            <p>I attribute this di<U+017F>appointment to the <U+017F>ollicitation of
Mr. <hi>Genou,</hi> and I believe I am in the right. In the mean
time, it was no very hard matter to find out, what
made him <U+017F>o willing to appear again<U+017F>t us; for I had
done ju<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame thing in an affair that he had (or at
lea<U+017F>t <hi>Vedeau de Grammont</hi> his Kin<U+017F>man) again<U+017F>t a certain
Lady, who<U+017F>e Father was my very good friend; but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57806:181"/>
here lay the difference between my management and
his, that he <U+017F>av'd a man that de<U+017F>erv'd to be broken on
the Wheel, and I did nothing but what every hone<U+017F>t
man ought to do; and to the end, the Reader may not
think, I <U+017F>ay more of my <U+017F>elf than is my due, I will be
judg'd by all that hear the <U+017F>tory, which was as follows.
The <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on inviting me to take the air in the Country, I
left <hi>Paris</hi> with an intent to go and <U+017F>ee a Gentleman, one
of my Relations, call'd <hi>Mere,</hi> for whom I had lately
done a particular piece of <U+017F>ervice, in a difference he had
with one <hi>Domanchin,</hi> who had been a Notary, but now
was become a noted U<U+017F>urer. In <U+017F>hort, this <U+017F>ubtile old
Fox had cheated him, at lea<U+017F>t of fifty thou<U+017F>and Crowns:
The Gentleman having been put to great charges on
account of other people, particularly being to pay for
hunting Equipage for Mr. <hi>de Vendo<U+017F>me,</hi> he had been
quite ruin'd, if he had been forc'd to pay all that this
fellow demanded of him; he apply'd him<U+017F>elf to me to
help him to adju<U+017F>t this affair; and having found out his
Adver<U+017F>ary, I got him a Di<U+017F>charge for a very <U+017F>mall <U+017F>um
more than what was really owing, and abundantly <U+017F>hort
of the va<U+017F>t <U+017F>um he pretended to. This per<U+017F>on, thinking
him<U+017F>elf under great obligation to me, had a long time
invited me to come and <U+017F>ee him; and the weather being
<U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant as I <U+017F>aid, I had a mind to divert my <U+017F>elf, I
got on Hor<U+017F>eback by break of day, and arriv'd the <U+017F>ame
night at his hou<U+017F>e; he made me extraordinary welcome,
and I believe I <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>o if I had <U+017F>taid lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but as I never lov'd the Country for any long time
together, and al<U+017F>o having a mind to make another vi<U+017F>it
not far from his Hou<U+017F>e, I took my leave of him. My
other vi<U+017F>it was to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Herve,</hi> Coun<U+017F>ellor of the
Great Chamber, and one of my very good friends,
who I was told was at Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Salle</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e, who had
marry'd his Daughter; <U+017F>o I went directly to his Hou<U+017F>e,
but when I came to the Ca<U+017F>tle, I under<U+017F>tood that they
were neither of them at home, and that no body was
within but Madam <hi>Salle.</hi> I having had the honour of
acquaintance with her at her Father's, alighted to go
and pay my re<U+017F>pects to her. I had not been with her
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57806:181"/>
above half an hour, but they brought her word, that
<U+017F>ome of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Vedeau de Grammont</hi>'s Footmen,
who<U+017F>e Lands adjoyn'd to theirs, were a fi<U+017F>hing in the
Motes. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he heard it <U+017F>he chang'd colour, and
turning to me, <hi>Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>you are too much a friend to
my Father to <U+017F>uffer them to put <U+017F>uch an affront upon me;</hi>
and with tho<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he ri<U+017F>es up in a heat, and going
out of the room, <U+017F>he runs her<U+017F>elf to defend her right. I
had no thoughts of leaving her in a ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>o plain; but
tho the fellows were <U+017F>ent on purpo<U+017F>e to offer her that
affront, yet they dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tay, e<U+017F>pecially a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they
<U+017F>aw 'twas the Lady her<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>natching away
their Lines, they were in <U+017F>uch a con<U+017F>ternation, that if
<U+017F>he had pleas'd, <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily have bang'd them.
<hi>Vedeau,</hi> who was not far off, was <U+017F>urpriz'd when he
under<U+017F>tood how things were, and e<U+017F>pecially when he
heard that a <U+017F>ingle Woman had by her<U+017F>elf return'd the
affront he de<U+017F>ign'd, he was ready to bur<U+017F>t with anger.
He was a Man of War as you might gue<U+017F>s by his Habit,
of which I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak pre<U+017F>ently; and in particular of a
certain blue Coat which he had <U+017F>uch a kindne<U+017F>s for,
that he had wore it at lea<U+017F>t ten or twelve years. Away
he goes, rai<U+017F>es the Ban and Arrierban of his E<U+017F>tate, and
having made a fine Speech to them, to encourage them
to <U+017F>ome bold action, he tells them, that they mu<U+017F>t march
again<U+017F>t Madam <hi>Salle,</hi> to recover the Booty <U+017F>he had
made of his Mens fi<U+017F>hing Tackle; and he would have
led them on him<U+017F>elf, but that it was not proper for <U+017F>o
con<U+017F>iderable a Captain as him<U+017F>elf, to go on <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall an
Expedition. If I would <U+017F>ay any more to give you his
character, I might ea<U+017F>ily do it; but I need only <U+017F>ay,
that this was becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eems people which have
<U+017F>uch affairs as the<U+017F>e, ought not to be of the Party them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves;
and as 'tis with tho<U+017F>e that are out of love with
their own occupations, they won't trouble them<U+017F>elves
to know <U+017F>o much as the terms of art; <U+017F>o he left all tho<U+017F>e
things to the Men of War.</p>
            <p>I was newly gone from Madam <hi>Salle</hi> when this Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
came there, or el<U+017F>e I am <U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ooner have
been cut in pieces than have <U+017F>uffer'd them to offer her
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57806:182"/>
<U+017F>uch violence: But they having found her all alone,
neither her Sex, her Quality, no nor her Face, which
as it was all charming, <U+017F>o was at the <U+017F>ame time very
maje<U+017F>tick, could not put any <U+017F>top to their outrage; but
<U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he had plac'd her<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ingle at the door of
the Hall to di<U+017F>pute their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, they ru<U+017F>ht in upon
her, and <U+017F>he making what re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance <U+017F>he could, they
threw her down upon the ground, and I know not
what other in<U+017F>olencies they offer'd her; they drag'd
her about the hou<U+017F>e from place to place, as if <U+017F>he had
been a Criminal, and they had authority for what they
did; at la<U+017F>t having found what they came for, they
went away, after having <U+017F>aid all the bea<U+017F>tly things to
her they could devi<U+017F>e, and which they de<U+017F>erv'd to be
<U+017F>everely puni<U+017F>ht for. The Lady was a per<U+017F>on of too
much <U+017F>pirit, to bear all this without taking <U+017F>ome
cour<U+017F>e to revenge it. She <U+017F>ent a Man immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
to her Father, to inform him of what had pa<U+017F>t, and
he having overtaken me upon the road, and telling me
what had happen'd, immediately upon my going away,
I thought my <U+017F>elf oblig'd in honour to go back, and
offer her my <U+017F>ervice. I found her perfectly di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate,
and it <U+017F>ignify'd nothing to tell her, her Father had
credit, and friends enough to revenge this affront, this
gave her no <U+017F>atisfaction; and I believe, if I had not
proffer'd her my <U+017F>ervice, to go immedietely out and
per<U+017F>ue them, <U+017F>he had dy'd under the violence of the
oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and this di<U+017F>cover'd to me the Greatne<U+017F>s of
her Spirit, more than ever I had ob<U+017F>erv'd in my life. She
told me it was not rea<U+017F>onable I <U+017F>hould expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf on
her account, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>tay at home out of the danger;
but if I would needs undertake her defence, <U+017F>he was
re<U+017F>olv'd to run the ri<U+017F>que with me; that 'twas true <U+017F>he
was but a Woman, but as much a Woman as <U+017F>he was,
<U+017F>he believ'd <U+017F>he was able to beat Mr. <hi>Vedeau.</hi> I told her,
I hop'd there was no need of that, I would only have
her look to her <U+017F>elf after <U+017F>o much violence as had been
offer'd her; and be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was the Party <U+017F>o
much abus'd, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould keep the right of her <U+017F>ide;
and therefore I only de<U+017F>ir'd her to let me have one of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57806:182"/>
her Servants with me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in a de<U+017F>ign I had thought of. In
<U+017F>hort, I <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>everal friends I had in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to lend me the help of their Footmen; upon
which me<U+017F><U+017F>age they came away them<U+017F>elves, thinking I
had <U+017F>ome quarrel upon my hands; but I <U+017F>ent them all
back again, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould embroil them, they being all

they were forc'd to oblige me, or el<U+017F>e nothing would
have been done. Having 5 or 6 jolly fellows with me,
who did not value Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Vedeau,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known, neither to him nor his Servants; We put
our <U+017F>elves into a hunting po<U+017F>ture, and follow'd the
Cha<U+017F>e ju<U+017F>t to his very Gate: He was chief Ranger of
that part of the Country, and had Men for that purpo<U+017F>e
in mo<U+017F>t of the Villages about there; one of which
coming out, upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hot we made, to know if
we had leave from his Ma<U+017F>ter; we complimented him
with a good cudgelling, and bid him go and tell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur
<hi>Vedeau,</hi> that if he would plea<U+017F>e to come out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
we would be as civil to him; there came three one
after another on the <U+017F>ame errand, which put us to the
trouble of <U+017F>erving them all in the <U+017F>ame kind, and they
all run to the Ca<U+017F>tle; where tho they all told the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Vedeau</hi> did not think fit to venture
abroad; however he thought, if he could rai<U+017F>e the
Country, he <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>urround us; <U+017F>o he order'd
the Church Bell to ring out for an alarm, and gets
him<U+017F>elf up to a Garret Window to <U+017F>ee, by the help of
his Pro<U+017F>pective, if any of the Country people came to
his relief. All this did not hinder, but I kept beating
about the Fields for game, and made one <U+017F>hot ju<U+017F>t at
the Gate of his outer Court; and his blue Coat di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
him to me, I made as if I would <U+017F>hoot at him,
which he perceiving by the help of his Gla<U+017F>s, for he was
naturally pur-blind, he popt in his head in a great deal
of ha<U+017F>te, which I could not but laugh to <U+017F>ee; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was <U+017F>o far from being in danger, that a Fu<U+017F>ee
could not carry above half <U+017F>o far; but all that did not
prevent the fright he was in; by which I learnt, that a
man is never the le<U+017F>s a Coward for big Looks and great
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57806:183"/>
Whiskers. All this while the Alarm rung, and at la<U+017F>t
the neighbouring Pari<U+017F>hes beginning to make the <U+017F>ame
jangling with their Bells, I thought it was time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
Indeed, I found already the Pea<U+017F>ants began to
po<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves at the Lanes ends, and Defiles; but none
of them daring to <U+017F>tay my coming, I retir'd very well
pleas'd with my little Expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vedeau</hi> pre<U+017F>ently gue<U+017F>t this was <U+017F>ome of Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s
friends, but having no proof, he was enrag'd at the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
he had receiv'd; he endeavour'd to get <U+017F>ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and <U+017F>ome pretended to tell him who it was,
but it was all uncertain, for it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to have
contriv'd it better; none of us were known, and if any
had <U+017F>een me at Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s, they had not ventur'd to
come <U+017F>o near me, as to know me again. This affront
was <U+017F>oon follow'd with another. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Herve</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been inform'd of what had happen'd to his
Daughter, he made out a Decree again<U+017F>t his Men;
and having given it to one of the Prevo<U+017F>t's Officers, he
gave him power al<U+017F>o to put it in execution. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all fled, and when the Officer came, all he could
do was to make <U+017F>earch in their Hou<U+017F>es, where they
made <U+017F>trange havock, and <U+017F>earcht every hole and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou,</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Kin<U+017F>man had <U+017F>o many

to extricate him out of them all, advi<U+017F>es him
to a very <U+017F>ubtile trick. He made him pre<U+017F>ent a Petition
in the name of the<U+017F>e Runaways, in which he <U+017F>et forth,
that under pretence of <U+017F>earching for their per<U+017F>ons, they
had plunder'd their Hou<U+017F>es, and took away all they
had<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> This they had leave given them to prove, and
there was no want of <U+017F>ham evidence to <U+017F>wear it. Upon
which M. <hi>Vedeau</hi> got a Decree again<U+017F>t the Officer and
his A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants; who mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting nothing all the while,
and no body being <U+017F>o kind to tell him what had pa<U+017F>t,
was taken as he was <U+017F>itting peaceably in his own Hou<U+017F>e,
and carry'd Pri<U+017F>oner to <hi>Chatau-neuf</hi> in <hi>Thimerais;</hi> this

order'd him to be pro<U+017F>ecuted. 'Twas <U+017F>trange
that a Man who was oblig'd in con<U+017F>cience, and above all
by the obligation of his Office, to do ju<U+017F>tice to all men,
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer him<U+017F>elf to be led into <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to oppre<U+017F>s an innocent man, and that purely for
revenge; for all the crime they could lay on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
man was, that according to his Office, he
was at his Hou<U+017F>e to <U+017F>earch for tho<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t whom there
was a lawful Decree; and the pretence of his <U+017F>tealing
things was <U+017F>o frivolous, they might as well have charg'd
me with it who was not there. In the mean time the poor
man was ready to peri<U+017F>h, and the ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of <hi>Vedeau</hi> was
<U+017F>uch, that le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be reliev'd, by any body that
he thought might a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, he order'd it <U+017F>o, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Herve,</hi> nor Madam <hi>Salle</hi> heard a word of
it; all people who had any re<U+017F>pect for him, and that
knew not how he had contriv'd it, wonder'd they
<U+017F>hould for<U+017F>ake the Man in <U+017F>uch a manner, e<U+017F>pecially
<U+017F>ince he had brought him<U+017F>elf to this ruine on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and they had promis'd to bear him harmle<U+017F>s. At
la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome one of his friends, being apprehen<U+017F>ive of
<U+017F>ome further danger de<U+017F>ign'd, went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
Mr. <hi>Herve</hi> of the matter, who was extreamly
<U+017F>urpriz'd at the News, that being the fir<U+017F>t word he had
ever heard of it: He was too much a Gentleman not
to do his be<U+017F>t for the poor man, the very moment he
knew of it; wherefore putting all his Irons in the fire
immediately, he manag'd it <U+017F>o well, that he obtain'd an

was prohibited to proceed again<U+017F>t the Pri<U+017F>oner, and
that he <U+017F>hould be remov'd to the <hi>Conciergerie;</hi> and one
of the Officers of the Parliament was immediately di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
to carry this News to him; and indeed he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in good time, for the King's Sollicitor was ju<U+017F>t up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Sentence to have him hang'd; the be<U+017F>t he
was to expect, was to be branded with the <hi>Flower de
Lis,</hi> and whipt, or be <U+017F>ent to the Gallies. <hi>Vedeau</hi> was
very much troubled, that ju<U+017F>t when he was going to
make him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o famous in the Country, by <U+017F>uch a piece
of inju<U+017F>tice<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he mu<U+017F>t now go and give an account of his

rea<U+017F>ons to the Parliament, where the Father of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ary
had at lea<U+017F>t as much credit, as he and all his
Family; but being con<U+017F>train'd by nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, he came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and finding that it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to have all the
parties up, the thing being pro<U+017F>ecuted in other names,
they try'd all ways po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to make it up. Indeed, it
was a very di<U+017F>honourable <U+017F>trife, for both parties had
recour<U+017F>e to all the tricks and <U+017F>hifts of the Law, not to
<U+017F>ay inju<U+017F>tices, they could devi<U+017F>e; and the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and
<U+017F>pleen with which it was carry'd on, having made them
<U+017F>hut their Ears to all <U+017F>orts of Propo<U+017F>als, this was the
occa<U+017F>ion of opening the whole <U+017F>cene of the affair, and
why <hi>Vedeau</hi> <U+017F>ent his Servants to fi<U+017F>h in the Motes of
Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Salle</hi> it <U+017F>eems, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<hi>de Vedeau</hi> the u<U+017F>e of the Water of a River, that
belong'd to him, to water a Meadow of his, for which
he was re<U+017F>olv'd to be even with him; and to that end
he purcha<U+017F>es a Fief of about 5 or 6 thou<U+017F>and Francks,
in right whereof he pretended, that the River was not
only his, but that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Salle</hi> had no authority to
draw the Water thro his Motes. This affair could not
but require a long deci<U+017F>ion, con<U+017F>idering al<U+017F>o what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
between, and the ob<U+017F>tinacy of both parties; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on both <U+017F>ides throughly acquainted with all the nice
tricks of the Law. In the mean time the poor Officer
was the Sufferer; and tho he was no longer in the
Dungeon, yet he was to remain in Pri<U+017F>on till the truth
was made out; and to make his misfortune more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
the Parliament would not be Judges in a Ca<U+017F>e
that re<U+017F>pected <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>iderable per<U+017F>ons of their own
Members; and it took up a long time before they could
agree to name other Judges: At la<U+017F>t, they referr'd the
Ca<U+017F>e to the Determination of the <hi>Reque<U+017F>tes de l' Hotel,</hi>
and I having very good friends there, I joyn'd my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t
with Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Herve,</hi> which very much di<U+017F>pleas'd
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou</hi> and his Son-in-law; not that they
thought I had more credit there than their party, but
that they thought it was a bold thing in me, that was
but a mean per<U+017F>on to them, to oppo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
again<U+017F>t them. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou,</hi> who was a hot
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57806:184"/>
Man, <U+017F>poke to a friend of mine to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade me from
it; but I told him I had always been Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Herve</hi>'s
humble Servant, and be<U+017F>ides happening to be at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Salle</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e when the fir<U+017F>t in<U+017F>ult was given, I
could not avoid being of their <U+017F>ide. I let fall the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t
words, without con<U+017F>idering that his Son-in-law might
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me by that, to be the per<U+017F>on that had <U+017F>hot at his
outer gate. It had been excu<U+017F>able in a young man to
have <U+017F>poken thus ha<U+017F>tily, but I was of an age to have
had more wit: I <U+017F>aw immediately that I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a fault, but it being too late to remedy it, I let it
alone to take its own cour<U+017F>e, and never troubled my
<U+017F>elf about it. My friend having told Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou</hi>
what an<U+017F>wer I had given him, without thinking of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me any hurt, they pre<U+017F>ently concluded, it could be
no body but me, that had offer'd him that affront; and
to be more certain of it, Mr. <hi>Genou</hi> meeting me next day
at the entrance to the <hi>Reque<U+017F>tes de Hotel,</hi> where I was
<U+017F>olliciting, told me, Madam <hi>Salle</hi> was very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to me; that after I had expos'd my <U+017F>elf, as I had
done, in coming to in<U+017F>ult his Son-in-law at his very
doors, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till be <U+017F>o hot upon the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as at
all hours in the day to be <U+017F>olliciting for her: When he
had <U+017F>aid thus he <U+017F>eem'd to expect my an<U+017F>wer, and that
he might catch me at my words, I perceiv'd he had
plac'd two fellows ready, who making as if they took
notice of nothing, hearkned to what we <U+017F>aid, but they
all lo<U+017F>t their labour, for I was not to be catcht <U+017F>o; for
being aware of them, I <U+017F>aid nothing they could lay any
hold of; <U+017F>o they went away as wi<U+017F>e as they came. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Genou</hi> ow'd me a grudge in his heart,
and having found an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>how me his good
will, as I have related, he did it with a great deal of
plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
            <p>But to return to the <U+017F>tory, the <hi>Hotel</hi> having again
attempted to accommodate the matter with Mr. <hi>Herve,</hi>
but finding their inveteracy <U+017F>o great, that they would
hear of nothing, they di<U+017F>pos'd them<U+017F>elves to do ju<U+017F>tice<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
and to pa<U+017F>s Sentence: For the affair of the Officer
who was <U+017F>till in Pri<U+017F>on, they adjudg'd that he <U+017F>hould
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57806:185"/>
have liberty to follow the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in the Court till the
end of the Cau<U+017F>e, for they had not di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>t his Proce<U+017F>s,
tho they thought fit to allow him his liberty. In
the mean time this affair was like a heap of Snow,
which grows bigger and bigger by rowling to and
fro. There were <U+017F>o many Proceedings, that they had,
at lea<U+017F>t, forty or fifty bags of papers; and it co<U+017F>t
Mr. <hi>Herve</hi> an infinite deal of Money to carry it on, for
he bore all the charge of it, as well as the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of
the Officer; whom in this ca<U+017F>e 'twas but rea<U+017F>onable to
provide for. However, at la<U+017F>t the Proce<U+017F>s, after having
held, I know not how long, was concluded by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in favour of my friends; and <hi>Vedeau</hi> was <U+017F>o
vext, and a<U+017F>ham'd at it, that for fear he <U+017F>hould be
laught at in the Country where the quarrel began, he
would not go there for a long time. This was the end
of an affair <U+017F>o much talkt of in the world, and in which
they might have <U+017F>av'd a great deal of Labour and Money,
if they would have been rul'd by the advice of their
Friends; for tho Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Salle</hi> ca<U+017F>t his Adver<U+017F>ary in
the Charges of the Suit, yet it co<U+017F>t him at lea<U+017F>t two
thou<U+017F>and Crowns in other expences.</p>
            <p>The Proce<U+017F>s being at an end, I was at liberty to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
of my <U+017F>elf as I pleas'd, for I was not willing to
leave <hi>Paris</hi> till I had <U+017F>een the conclu<U+017F>ion of it. There was a
Gentleman who liv'd near <hi>Melun,</hi> had oft times invited
me to his Hou<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>ent him word it <U+017F>hould now be in a
few days: Be<U+017F>ides, I had a great mind to go into that
<U+017F>ide of the Country for more rea<U+017F>ons than one. In <U+017F>hort,
be<U+017F>ides that, I had a mind to divert my <U+017F>elf in hunting
with him; I had al<U+017F>o a great de<U+017F>ire to vi<U+017F>it Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
Charo<U+017F>t,</hi> who was at <hi>Vaux le Vicomte,</hi> where, as 'twas
<U+017F>aid, he went to take the Air; but that was a report
given out, to hide a <U+017F>mall accident that befel
him. The poor man was become a meer Child again,
and tho he was not <U+017F>o very old, his Spirits, which u<U+017F>e
to die la<U+017F>t in us, had <U+017F>o much for<U+017F>aken him, that to <U+017F>ee
him in the pre<U+017F>ent condition, one would never have
thought him <U+017F>o perfect a Courtier as he had been:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57806:185"/>
what I have <U+017F>aid of him before, is more than <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make one believe him <U+017F>uch. There were few
that rally'd more agreeably than he; I was witne<U+017F>s
of this once in my life, and tho it was on a <U+017F>ubject not
very plea<U+017F>ant to me, yet it did not hinder me, but I
laught as well as other people; this happen'd a little
after the Death of Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> my very good
Ma<U+017F>ter. I have <U+017F>aid, how it was reported that he was
pretty great with the Dutche<U+017F>s of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> his Niece, and
that they would needs have it at the <U+017F>ame time, that
the Duke <hi>de Richelieu</hi> was her Son. This Report which
was common enough while he was alive, was more
publickly di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>t of after his death, till at la<U+017F>t it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<U+017F>o common, that not only the ordinary people,
but the per<U+017F>ons of the fir<U+017F>t quality believ'd it: So that
a Court Lady, upon a quarrel with the Dutche<U+017F>s
<hi>de Aiguillon,</hi> reproacht her publickly, that <U+017F>he had been
the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of a Prie<U+017F>t, by whom <U+017F>he had had <U+017F>everal
Children. 'Tis without que<U+017F>tion, that <U+017F>ome things are
better conceal'd than divulg'd; but the Dutche<U+017F>s being
of the humour of mo<U+017F>t Women, to regard nothing <U+017F>o
<U+017F>he gratify'd her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, comes all in a fury, and
ca<U+017F>ting her <U+017F>elf at the Queen's feet, demanded Ju<U+017F>tice;
the Queen bid her ri<U+017F>e, and let her know what was the
matter. I was ju<U+017F>t then <U+017F>peaking with Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>t,</hi>
with whom I was going to the Hou<U+017F>e of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s;
but he, who had no kindne<U+017F>s for that Lady, with
whom he had had <U+017F>ome pique, left me, to go and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him<U+017F>elf of the particulars. She told the Queen,
that Madam <hi>de St. Chaumout</hi> had call'd her Whore, (for
<U+017F>he nam'd the word at length) and had openly told her,
<U+017F>he had had five or <U+017F>ix Children by her Uncle: When
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid this, it was thought the Queen would have
<U+017F>poke; but Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Charo<U+017F>t</hi> not giving her time,
<hi>Alack, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, (to the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>d' Aiguillon)
will you afflict your <U+017F>elf for <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>mall matter? Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you know that we mu<U+017F>t not believe above half of what is
<U+017F>aid at Court?</hi> He had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, but all who
were pre<U+017F>ent fell out a laughing; and the Queen, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every body laugh, laught too. This madded the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57806:186"/>
Dutche<U+017F>s extremely, who did not u<U+017F>e to take <U+017F>uch je<U+017F>ts;
but the time of her Reign being now at an end, and on
the other hand, the Queen hating her mortally, <U+017F>he
was fain to go away without any other redre<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>All people reproach the Unfortunate: This Lady
was no <U+017F>ooner out of the Queens pre<U+017F>ence, but <U+017F>he
found ten upon her in<U+017F>tead of one; who repeating the
word <hi>Whore,</hi> which <U+017F>he had call'd her <U+017F>elf, would taunt
her with the word; which if it was indecent in the
mouth of a Man, <U+017F>ure it became a Woman much wor<U+017F>e.
In <U+017F>hort, they condemn'd her from this; in<U+017F>omuch,
that if I had not known what I did, this would have
been enough to convince me. Indeed, this Woman,
who made all tremble under her in the days of her
Uncle, was not company good enough for Dogs, if I
may <U+017F>o <U+017F>ay, for having <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>hly expos'd her<U+017F>elf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any con<U+017F>ideration, as you have heard: And yet a
greater folly than this, tho it did not make <U+017F>o much
noi<U+017F>e, was that of one of the Queens Maids of Honour,
who<U+017F>e name was Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Guerchi,</hi> to whom fell
out this very unhappy adventure. I <U+017F>hould have told
you, that being with Child by the Duke <hi>de Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ruin'd her <U+017F>o unfortunately, by endeavouring to hide
her di<U+017F>grace with the Death of the Infant; and there
happen'd on this occa<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>o fal<U+017F>e a <U+017F>tep taken by her
<U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erv'd to have Stones thrown at her
more than Madam <hi>d' Aiguillon.</hi> The Queen lov'd her
above all the re<U+017F>t; and this happen'd to her at a time,
when the Queen being bu<U+017F>y about <U+017F>ome certain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
affairs, had plac'd her at the Clo<U+017F>et door, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to let no body come in, but <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>he had nam'd:
It happen'd as <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood here Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Vic</hi> came up to
the door, and making an offer to go in, and <U+017F>he not
knowing his face, he being newly come from the Army,
<U+017F>he ask'd him his Name, which he told her immediately.
Now there being but little difference in the <hi>French</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Name, and a certain thing which it is not very
decent to mention, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tept back in a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap><U+017F>ion, and flung
the Door again<U+017F>t him. The Queen, who by accident had
her Eyes that way, ob<U+017F>erving the di<U+017F>order <U+017F>he was in,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57806:186"/>
askt her what was the matter: But <U+017F>he being <U+017F>urpriz'd
only told her, that 'twas an in<U+017F>olent fellow, and that
<U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not tell her Maje<U+017F>ty what it was he <U+017F>aid. The
Queen wondring what <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>turb her, and
make her colour <U+017F>o red, call'd her to her, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
commanded her to tell her what it was; that
if it was a thing not fit to be <U+017F>poken in plains terms,
<U+017F>he might di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e it, but <U+017F>o as to let her know the
meaning of it; which would not be difficult to do, by
one that had <U+017F>o much wit as <U+017F>he had. Madamoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de

re<U+017F>olv'd to tell her, but did it with <U+017F>o ill a grace, that

Captain of the Queens Guards, who <U+017F>tood by, fell out
a laughing as if he would have bur<U+017F>t; and when he had
a little recover'd him<U+017F>elf, <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to the Queen,
<hi>I'm confident 'twas Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> de Vic <hi>who frighted this
Lady, for he came from</hi> Flanders <hi>but la<U+017F>t night;</hi> but the
be<U+017F>t of the je<U+017F>t was, that the Lady affirmed <U+017F>till <U+017F>he was
not mi<U+017F>taken, but that it was he that chang'd one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the name, tho <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>o to be deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who I went to vi<U+017F>it at <hi>Melun,</hi> was
call'd the Count <hi>de la Chapelle Gantier,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of a
great deal of honour, and who<U+017F>e Father was my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Friend; he was a <U+017F>worn Enemy to another
Gentleman that liv'd hard by, call'd the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de
Melun,</hi> or rather <hi>L' Arbatjete;</hi> for he did not belong
to the honourable Family of <hi>Melun,</hi> of whom the late
Con<U+017F>table <hi>de Melun,</hi> and the pre<U+017F>ent Princes <hi>d' E<U+017F>pinois</hi>
are de<U+017F>cended; he was far enough from <U+017F>uch a Noble
Original, having more Men of the Gown than of the
Sword in his Family; and yet if you would believe
him, <hi>Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs de Chatillon</hi> are not of a better De<U+017F>cent
than he. The Enmity between the<U+017F>e Gentleman began
upon this ground, that the Father of one had kill'd
the Father of the other, a quarrel <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable that no
body ever attempted to reconcile them: My Friend
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57806:187"/>
was the Party offended, it being his Father who had
the misfortune to be kill'd by the other, <U+017F>ince which if
he had but heard his name mention'd, he would have
turn'd pale, and <U+017F>hook from head to foot. A Per<U+017F>on
of Quality, to whom I am very much oblig'd, de<U+017F>ir'd
me, when I went from <hi>Paris,</hi> to attempt the mitiaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Hatred by making a Propo<U+017F>al of Marriage to
my Friend with <hi>Melun</hi>'s Si<U+017F>ter, but I de<U+017F>ir'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd,
for that this was to do a great injury to the Count
<hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> who I knew to be more of a Gentleman
than to marry the Daughter of his Father's Murtherer;
and that, in <U+017F>hort, I would never undertake <U+017F>uch an
Errand; for I knew if I <U+017F>hould, it would be to no
purpo<U+017F>e. The Count <hi>de Melun</hi> al<U+017F>o was a Man of <U+017F>o
much ill nature, that in<U+017F>tead of endeavouring by his
carriage to make my Friend forget the Grudge that
was between the Families, as he ought to have done,
he took all occa<U+017F>ions to increa<U+017F>e it: He was very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
drunk, and when he had a Gla<U+017F>s or two of
Wine in his head he was <U+017F>o abu<U+017F>ive to my Friend, that
if the Laws again<U+017F>t Quarrels and Duels had not been <U+017F>o
<U+017F>evere, he had been every day in danger of having his
Throat cut. This was a crime in any man, but much
more inexcu<U+017F>able in the Son of a man, who had already
imbru'd his hands in the blood of my Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Father;
be<U+017F>ides the King had done as much as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
prevent his being us'd in this manner, for he pardon'd
his Father but upon this condition, that neither he, nor
any of his after him, <U+017F>hould come into the Company,
or place, where any of the decea<U+017F>ed's Children <U+017F>hould
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; and that if at any time any of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould come
into Company where he was, or any of his Children,
they <U+017F>hould be oblig'd immediately to quit the place,
which command of the Kings every one allow'd to be
very ju<U+017F>t. But the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Melun,</hi> in<U+017F>tead of
conforming him<U+017F>elf to this Order, as his Father
had done, us'd him as I have been telling you:
In<U+017F>omuch, that the fir<U+017F>t thing my Friend told me of
at my coming to <U+017F>ee him was, that he could endure it
no longer; at the <U+017F>ame time, he told me at large the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57806:187"/>
grounds of his di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t, which I could not deny but to
be very rea<U+017F>onable. However, I endeavour'd to put
the be<U+017F>t face on them I could, becau<U+017F>e I would not
enflame him, who I perceiv'd was already di<U+017F>turb'd
enough; and at the <U+017F>ame time I told him, he could not
have the lea<U+017F>t quarrel with him without endangering
him<U+017F>elf extreamly; for the <U+017F>ame Order of the Kings,
which commanded <hi>Melun</hi> to keep out of his <U+017F>ight,
commanded him al<U+017F>o to bear his Adver<U+017F>ary no malice.
I told him, that he being the party aggriev'd every body
would conclude him to have been the Agre<U+017F><U+017F>or; that
in his circum<U+017F>tances he ought to u<U+017F>e more caution a
thou<U+017F>and times than another, having a good E<U+017F>tate to
lo<U+017F>e, and therefore ought to con<U+017F>ider very well before
he did any thing of that nature; that I did not deny,
but 'twas a very hard ca<U+017F>e for any Gentleman to be
forc'd to bear <U+017F>o much every day, but that the lea<U+017F>t evil is
always to be cho<U+017F>en; that there was <hi>Melun</hi> and his
Gang de<U+017F>ir'd nothing more than to have us take <U+017F>ome
wrong <U+017F>tep which they might take advantage of; and
in a word, that we had to do with a Prince that would
not be je<U+017F>ted with; and unle<U+017F>s his Ca<U+017F>e was as clear as
the day, I would advi<U+017F>e him not to meddle in it.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, who had at lea<U+017F>t 12 or 15 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Livres a year, and expected very much to encrea<U+017F>e
his E<U+017F>tate by marrying, being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible my rea<U+017F>ons had
<U+017F>ome weight, acknowledg'd him<U+017F>elf very much oblig'd
to me for my advice; for indeed, I believe if it had
not been for me, his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had run him upon <U+017F>ome
fooli<U+017F>h action or other in this matter. But having thus
calm'd him we minded nothing but our plea<U+017F>ure, he
and I together, either hunting or vi<U+017F>iting the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

               </gap>
unexpectedly there hapned a Ca<U+017F>e which put my friend
in a condition of giving him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall <U+017F>atisfaction
in the matter. One day while we were at Dinner, only
he and I, which was very <U+017F>trange, having generally <U+017F>ome
Company or other every day, we heard a noi<U+017F>e of Horns
<U+017F>ounding in the Park: This made him ri<U+017F>e from the
Table in a heat, and run into the Kitchen where he had
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57806:188"/>
<U+017F>ome Arms; I follow'd him immediately, and taking
each of us a Fu<U+017F>il, we made out to that part were we
thought the noi<U+017F>e came from; pre<U+017F>ently we <U+017F>aw a great
many Dogs running after a Hare, and that they had
come in by a breach in the Park. The Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>py'd the man who blew the
Horn, but he knew him by his Livery to be his Enemy's
Hunt<U+017F>man, and was ju<U+017F>t a going to kill him, for I <U+017F>aw
him pre<U+017F>ent his piece at him; but making reflection
upon it a little, he thought he <U+017F>hould revenge him<U+017F>elf
better upon his Ma<U+017F>ter if he kill'd <U+017F>ome of the Dogs,
upon which he fir'd three times one after another, and
kill'd every time; he call'd to me al<U+017F>o to do the like,
but I <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, would not di<U+017F>charge
my piece; for I thought if his Enemy, who I <U+017F>uppos'd
was not far off, <U+017F>hould appear, 'twould be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
one of us, at lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould be ready for him. In the
mean time the Hunt<U+017F>man, who had not blown his
Horn but to call off his Dogs, and who <U+017F>aw he was like
to meet with blows there, got him back by the <U+017F>ame
Gap he came in at, the Dogs following him, as if they
had known by in<U+017F>tinct the danger of <U+017F>taying. The
Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> <U+017F>eeing there was no body left for
him to vent his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon, would needs <U+017F>ally out to
<U+017F>ee if he could find his Enemy, the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Melun,</hi>
whom we concluded was not far off, for one might
hear the noi<U+017F>e of Hor<U+017F>es galloping up and down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Park Wall, which we knew mu<U+017F>t be he, or
<U+017F>ome of his Company. But I <U+017F>topt him, telling him
he had done enough, and ought to be <U+017F>atisfy'd with it,
that if <hi>Melun</hi> had done this action to draw him into
danger, he was very finely fitted; and therefore 'twas
for his Enemy to run, and not for him; that he had kill'd
his Dogs, and had this advantage be<U+017F>ides, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had tre<U+017F>pa<U+017F>s'd upon him, and he might make his
Complaint of it, and perhaps put him in Pri<U+017F>on; but
that if he follow'd him out of his own bounds the Ca<U+017F>e
would be quite alter'd: and therefore I advis'd him not
to do it, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>omething he <U+017F>hould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<U+017F>orry for. He was pre<U+017F>ently made <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57806:188"/>
my rea<U+017F>ons, and being both of us retreated into the
Hou<U+017F>e together, where we were hardly got, before
there came in a Gentleman of that Country one <hi>Chi<U+017F>i.</hi>
The Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> knew him to be an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this <hi>Melun,</hi> and <U+017F>o took it for granted he had
<U+017F>ent him. This man took no notice of any thing, but
<U+017F>ate down with us at Table, and di<U+017F>cours'd <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>metimes
of one thing, <U+017F>ometimes of another indifferently,
without <U+017F>peaking a word of what had happen'd; we
began then to think he came in by chance, and knew
nothing of the matter, and yet we could not but have
a <U+017F>hrewd <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion that he was of the party too, and
that he came for Spy to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>trong we were, and it
prov'd no le<U+017F>s; for a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever we had din'd, away
he goes to <hi>Melun,</hi> and informing him that we were
but two of us, in a quarter of an hour we had him at
the Gates with 5 or 6 Hor<U+017F>emen in his company. The
Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> <U+017F>pying them before they were
come up to the Draw-bridge, <U+017F>natcht up his Fu<U+017F>il
which he had at hand, at which I thought <U+017F>omething
was the matter, and I did the like. We marcht up to
the faces of them all, and plainly <U+017F>aw <hi>Melun</hi> at the
head of them, who dur<U+017F>t not venture to come upon the
Draw-bridge. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw us, he call'd to the
Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> and askt him for his Dogs; but
<U+017F>eeing him pre<U+017F>ent his piece at him, he did not think
fit to <U+017F>tay for an an<U+017F>wer: And he was in the right of it,
for had he <U+017F>tood a moment longer, 'twas very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this had been the la<U+017F>t affront he <U+017F>hould ever have
given my Friend, or any body el<U+017F>e. <hi>Chi<U+017F>i</hi> and the re<U+017F>t
did the like, and they made their retreat in very good
order, for no body pur<U+017F>u'd them.</p>
            <p>This bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s could not but make a great noi<U+017F>e in the
Country, e<U+017F>pecially happening among per<U+017F>ons of
<U+017F>ome condition. I advis'd my Friend to go immediately
and enter his complaint at the Court of the Deputies of
the Mare<U+017F>chals of <hi>France;</hi> and my rea<U+017F>on was, that
having made them acquainted with it, he might then be
excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from giving way to an Accommodation, which
I <U+017F>aw plainly the Gentlemen of the Country would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57806:189"/>
But he did not approve of my advice, whether
'twas that he was not acquainted with the Deputies,
or that he thought it would be better to apply to the
Mare<U+017F>chals of <hi>France</hi> them<U+017F>elves: But while he was
preparing to do this the Marquis <hi>de St. Heran,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> came to <U+017F>ee him, and de<U+017F>ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
him for his <U+017F>ake to <U+017F>top his intended Journey, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
he would take upon him, that he <U+017F>hould have
all the <U+017F>atisfaction he could de<U+017F>ire; and being an old
Courtier who had known me a long time, he turn'd to
me, and de<U+017F>ir'd me to u<U+017F>e my intere<U+017F>t with the Count
to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e. I told him, that truly I was his
Friend, but he had <U+017F>o much more intere<U+017F>t than I, that
if he could not prevail upon him, it was not likely I
<U+017F>hould. Indeed he had been an old acquaintance of
his Father as well as I, and be<U+017F>ides that, the Po<U+017F>t he
was in (he was the Head Ranger of that part of the
Country) gave him <U+017F>uch a particular authority, that
all the Gentlemen of the Country took care to keep in
with him. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> was perplext at
this new Propo<U+017F>al; for on one hand 'twas not Prudence
in him to make <U+017F>uch a man as he his Enemy, and on
the other hand the plea<U+017F>ure of revenging the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Father, urg'd him again<U+017F>t all manner of
accommodation. So in hopes to per<U+017F>wade the other to
de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t from his <U+017F>ollicitation, which to <U+017F>ay the truth, as
the Ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tood, was a little uncivil; he told him, that
if there had been no other quarrel, but that which
lately happen'd, between his Family and Mr. <hi>de Melun,</hi>
he <U+017F>hould have had <U+017F>o little occa<U+017F>ion to u<U+017F>e intreaties
with him, that he would have return'd him thanks for
concerning him<U+017F>elf in it; but his Quarrel to the Count
<hi>de Melun</hi> was upon another account, and of a nature
not to be forgot; that he would comply with any
thing for his <U+017F>ake, but he be<U+017F>ought him to reflect upon
the rea<U+017F>on he had to <U+017F>eek revenge, and what the world
would <U+017F>ay of him, when having <U+017F>o fair an occa<U+017F>ion, he
<U+017F>hould have had more regard to the Interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
Friends than the Blood of his Father; that he begg'd
of him to con<U+017F>ider, that what he de<U+017F>ir'd of him was
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57806:189"/>
again<U+017F>t the Law of Nature, and would be a blot upon
his Honour, of which he him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>hould be the Judge;
wherefore he did not que<U+017F>tion, but that in<U+017F>tead of
taking it ill, he would have the greater Friend<U+017F>hip for
him, tho in this point it was not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to grant
what he de<U+017F>ir'd.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e were the rea<U+017F>ons he oppos'd to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de
St Heran</hi>'s <U+017F>olicitations, which I leave to the judgment
of any, if they were not very ju<U+017F>t and equitable.
However Mr. <hi>de St Heran,</hi> not contented with this, <U+017F>trove
all he could to make him alter his mind, and with me
al<U+017F>o, to per<U+017F>wade him to it; but finding he gain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
neither upon one nor t'other, he told the Count
<hi>de la Chappelle</hi> that he would entertain no ill will
again<U+017F>t him for this denial, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
had got the a<U+017F>cendant over him <U+017F>o much, that he was
not at pre<U+017F>ent capable of taking the advice of his
Friends; that indeed he expected to find him pretty
warm, but that a little time perhaps would allay his
fury, and he would then be better di<U+017F>pos'd to take his
advice; that therefore he only de<U+017F>ir'd him to re<U+017F>olve
on no mea<U+017F>ures for 24 hours, during which time he
de<U+017F>ir'd him to remember, that God had commanded us
to forgive our Enemies, and that nothing procur'd
greater peace of mind, than to practice the Duty in
the very Letter of it; that he hop'd he would grant
him that <U+017F>mall reque<U+017F>t without any difficulty; and that
it might not be prejudicial to his intere<U+017F>t he gave him
his word, the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Melun</hi> <U+017F>hould do nothing
on his part.</p>
            <p>By this means the Marquis <hi>de St Heran,</hi> without
taking any notice, did the Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Melun</hi> the
greate<U+017F>t piece of <U+017F>ervice imaginable; for the Count <hi>de
la Chappelle</hi> could not refu<U+017F>e <U+017F>o fair a reque<U+017F>t, e<U+017F>pecially
on the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that his Enemy <U+017F>hould take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the delay: <U+017F>o he let it re<U+017F>t for two days; in
which time the Marquis <hi>de St Heran</hi> <U+017F>ent away to Court,
and informing the King of a quarrel in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and that it happen'd about matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Game, de<U+017F>ir'd power from the King to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57806:190"/>
hear and determine it, and, no body being by to <U+017F>peak
for the Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> ea<U+017F>ily obtain'd the Grant:
So that in<U+017F>tead of a Mediator, which he pretended
to be, he made him<U+017F>elf a Judge. My Friend was very
much <U+017F>urpriz'd at this <hi>Finene<U+017F>s;</hi> and very much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with it: But we <U+017F>aw there was no manner of
remedy, for now 'twas too late to apply to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>chals
of <hi>France,</hi> and 'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e to attempt
the Kings revoking his Order. My Friend was then
forc'd at la<U+017F>t to go to <hi>Fountain-bleau</hi> to <U+017F>ee what Ju<U+017F>tice
he would do him, which indeed was but very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The Vi<U+017F>count <hi>de Melun</hi> only askt his pardon for
what had happen'd, telling him that 'twas not by any
de<U+017F>ign of his that his Hounds had broke into his Park;
and if he had found his Hunt<U+017F>man there, 'twas only to
fetch them back; that it was an accident, that the
Hare took over his ground; and for his coming up to
the Draw-bridge of the Ca<U+017F>tle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>twas only to ask him
for his Dogs which were lo<U+017F>t, as he him<U+017F>elf could wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and not to offer him any affront: However, that
if he thought he would have been affronted at it, he
would never have done it; for he was <U+017F>o far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iring
any quarrel with him, that he <U+017F>hould be very
glad of any opportunity to <U+017F>how how much he was
his Friend; that in the mean time he promis'd him to
ob<U+017F>erve more <U+017F>trictly the conditions which the King
had oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their Families to; to which end, if ever
he was hunting, and the Game took the <U+017F>ame way that
his did, he would immediately call off his Hounds and
a great deal of this <U+017F>ort, which Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de le Chappelle</hi>
was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to be content with, and to tell him, that
<U+017F>ince he had made <U+017F>o much acknowledgment, he was
very <U+017F>orry he had kill'd any of his Dogs.</p>
            <p>This was the conclu<U+017F>ion of that affair, and 'twas a
long time before we could come to know, what it was
occa<U+017F>ion'd the Marquis <hi>de St Heran</hi> to be <U+017F>o indu<U+017F>trious
to oblige one rather than t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>other: But a Gentleman of
the Country, who was of neither party told us, it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Mr. <hi>de Be<U+017F>ons,</hi> whom <hi>Melun</hi> was related
to by Marriage. We could hardly believe it at fir<U+017F>t,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57806:190"/>
becau<U+017F>e that Match was made again<U+017F>t his con<U+017F>ent; but
we under<U+017F>tand by another hand that it was certainly
true, and quickly after we had po<U+017F>itive proof of it.
This Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Be<U+017F>ons</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of extraordinary
wit, and had by his rare Genius gain'd him<U+017F>elf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Friends; but the be<U+017F>t of them all was <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi>
the Chancellor, who procur'd for him the place of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> tho he had not been yet Ma<U+017F>ter
of Reque<U+017F>ts, which was not cu<U+017F>tomary; and he had
not only enjoy'd that Po<U+017F>t three years, as is u<U+017F>ual for the
Intendants of Ju<U+017F>tice in the Provinces, but had, by the
<U+017F>ame favour, been continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d there five or <U+017F>ix times. In
which time he had gain'd <U+017F>o much credit and re<U+017F>pect in
the Country, that the King him<U+017F>elf could not have
more; for indeed I have heard him <U+017F>ay, that the King
might publi<U+017F>h an Edict, but he mu<U+017F>t have his Warrant
to it, if he expected to have it punctually executed. I
have heard him <U+017F>ay one thing al<U+017F>o more extraordinary
than that, and I think I have ventur'd to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
'tis grown a Cu<U+017F>tom in tho<U+017F>e Provinces for the
Intendants to join their Warrants to every Order that

               </gap>m not
certain: I'le relate the <U+017F>tory as he told it me, which
was, that having receiv'd an Order to make out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
again<U+017F>t one <hi>Roule,</hi> who had been an Agent in the
Rebellion of <hi>Vivares,</hi> he caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d his Head to be <U+017F>et up
upon the Gate of <hi>Aubenas,</hi> but <U+017F>ome of the Relations
of the per<U+017F>on that was executed took it down in the
Night; upon which he publi<U+017F>ht an Order the next day,
that they who had taken down the Head <U+017F>hould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, carry it back to the <U+017F>ame place in 24 hours
time, which was obey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and the Head carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d back
accordingly. I don't know whether all people may be
of my mind, but I think it is very <U+017F>eldom a Governor
has influence enough to make him<U+017F>elf obey'd in <U+017F>uch
a ca<U+017F>e: But if it be ever <U+017F>o, it is by <U+017F>ome unu<U+017F>ual Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
rather than from the Love of the People. Yet
this I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay of him, that if he was fear'd he
was al<U+017F>o lov'd, e<U+017F>pecially by all tho<U+017F>e who lov'd
di<U+017F>patch in their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; for never had man a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57806:191"/>
greater Vivacity of Spirit, which made that Province
<U+017F>o much concern'd at his removal; and the more,
<U+017F>ince Mr. <hi>d' Ague<U+017F><U+017F>ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> who <U+017F>ucceeded him, was ju<U+017F>t in
the other extreme. I have <U+017F>een him dictate to three
Secretaries at once, and yet entertain me at the <U+017F>ame
time without any interruption: It was not for <U+017F>uch a
man to be long unpreferr'd. After he was call'd to
Court the King tru<U+017F>ted him in affairs of the greate<U+017F>t
Intricacy: And the Chancellor, as great a man as he
was, did not at all think it below him to take mea<U+017F>ures
from his advice. He had indeed the greate<U+017F>t Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Councellors of State; <U+017F>o that 'twas no
<U+017F>trange thing that Mr. <hi>de St Heran</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o willing
to oblige him, he being already in a condition to return
favours to any man, tho his Fortune was nothing yet
to what he hop'd it would be; and it was for what he
expected perhaps, rather than any gratitude for what
was pa<U+017F>t, that he appear'd <U+017F>o ready to <U+017F>erve the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
or any of his Family; for he con<U+017F>ider'd, that the
King having <U+017F>uch confidence in them, as he really had,
the only way to advance him<U+017F>elf was to gain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation:
And yet he was deceiv'd in this point,
for tho Mr. the Chancellor, and the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi>
his Son, gave him great Te<U+017F>timony of their friend<U+017F>hip
in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es, they fail'd him in one where he mo<U+017F>t
de<U+017F>ir'd it. At Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Colbert</hi>'s death, his Ambition
prompted him to no le<U+017F>s than to <U+017F>ucceed him in that
place, and no que<U+017F>tion but he was capable enough to
have di<U+017F>charg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it, but that favour being deny'd him,
and be<U+017F>tow'd upon another, the grief of it broke his
heart and kill'd him.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel that happen'd at the Count <hi>de la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle</hi>'s,
having detain'd me longer there than I intended,
I had opportunity to be acquainted with all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
for there was hardly a Gentleman that knew of
the affair but came to vi<U+017F>it him, and offer him their
<U+017F>ervice, and among<U+017F>t them <U+017F>ome of all <U+017F>orts, rich and
poor; and among the latter the Count <hi>de Kermeno,</hi>
who was not of that Country, as his Name will inform
you, but who happen'd to be thereabouts; drawn not
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57806:191"/>
by the Charms of a certain Lady (for I <U+017F>hould belye
her to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he had any) but <U+017F>he had been an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
which to him was in lieu of all other
Charms. I knew him well enough, the Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> had no need to tell me who he was, for I had
<U+017F>een him both at the Court, and in the Army, and he
was not one jot more e<U+017F>teem'd at the one than in the
other; not but that he was a very good Gentleman
born, but he made the meane<U+017F>t figure that ever was
<U+017F>een: He had taken up the Trade of a Soldier, which
did not become him at all. His Brother the Marquis <hi>du
Garrot</hi> had done the like, and both had found the
means to be very fairly ca<U+017F>heer'd, after they had run
out an E<U+017F>tate of about a Million of Livres.</p>
            <p>Having known all the<U+017F>e things before, it was the rea<U+017F>on
I took no great notice of him; which the Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> ob<U+017F>erving, askt me when he was gone what
that man was, <U+017F>ince he had never <U+017F>een him till he came
into tho<U+017F>e parts. I told him what I knew, in which I
can <U+017F>ay, I neither added nor dimini<U+017F>ht any thing from
the truth. I acquainted him al<U+017F>o of the adventure of
his Brother, of which <U+017F>omething was <U+017F>o odd, that
the like was hardly ever heard. The Marquis <hi>du
Garrot</hi> after having <U+017F>pent all his E<U+017F>tate, and not
knowing what cour<U+017F>e to take, bethought him<U+017F>elf of
an Expedient, by which he pretended to rai<U+017F>e at
lea<U+017F>t twelve or fifteen thou<U+017F>and Livres a year, for the
laying down of about a thou<U+017F>and Crowns in ready
Money. The Project he had for doing this, was to go
and publi<U+017F>h among the Herb Women, and <U+017F>uch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Market, that he would lend them Money at
the rate of a penny a day for every Crown, which was
the u<U+017F>ual Intere<U+017F>t among tho<U+017F>e people, and de<U+017F>ir'd them
to acquaint their friends of it, for that all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he had in the Bank <U+017F>hould be at their <U+017F>ervice; and
that his Office <U+017F>hould be open at <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>tant
hours, and a true Regi<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould be kept, as well
of Payment as Receipt. Such news as this <U+017F>oon <U+017F>pread
about, and brought multitudes to his Office; and he
gave his Money <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely to every body that came
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57806:192"/>
for it, that people thought he was be, divell'd. The
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary of that quarter hearing of it, goes to
the place, but could not come near for the Crowd,
till having made way thro the people, he comes in,
and there found the Marquis <hi>du Garrot</hi> him<U+017F>elf, who
endeavour'd to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, that he might not be
known, but coming up to him he demands of him what
he was a doing; the Marquis askt him what he had to do
to ask that que<U+017F>tion; adding that if he had a mind to
give his Money away to whom he pleas'd, he hop'd he
might have the liberty to do it, without his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
him<U+017F>elf to di<U+017F>turb him. The Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary not
us'd to <U+017F>uch rough An<U+017F>wers, and <U+017F>eeing what a <U+017F>orry
figure he made, was a going to carry him to Pri<U+017F>on;
and he, not being very willing to go, told him who
he was, hoping his Name would make <U+017F>ome amends
for his ill Mein; but finding he had to do with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that valu'd no body's quality, he was oblig'd to
mu<U+017F>ter up all his Titles, and tell him he had marry'd
Mr. <hi>de Courcelle</hi>'s Daughter, Councellor of the Grand
Chamber; at which the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary, who <U+017F>tood more
in fear of a Councellor than of a Marquis, begun to u<U+017F>e
him more civilly, and told him, that in re<U+017F>pect to his
Father-in-law he would not put that affront upon him,
but that he mu<U+017F>t lay down his new Trade, for it had
made too much noi<U+017F>e already to be continu'd; and
admitting no reply, made him <U+017F>hut up his Coffer and
his Regi<U+017F>ter. The Marquis <U+017F>eeing the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary in
earne<U+017F>t, askt him what he mu<U+017F>t do for all his Money
he had given out; to which he gave him this an<U+017F>wer,
that having <U+017F>o freely given about his Money to he did
not know who, it was for him to find out the way how
to get it again. In <U+017F>hort, he <U+017F>eem'd like the Man
who they <U+017F>ay, obtain'd a Grant of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
for a certain Tax upon all <U+017F>uch as had <U+017F>een a certain
Comet, that had appear'd a little before, for as he was
never the richer for it, becau<U+017F>e he could never make
it out who had <U+017F>een it, and who had not; <U+017F>o our
Marquis neither knew who they were that had taken
his Money, nor where they dwelt, nor whether they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57806:192"/>
had taken it in their own Names, or in others.</p>
            <p>At my return to <hi>Paris</hi> I fell <U+017F>ick of an Ague, which
I believe might come from my eating more freely tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
I us'd to do; for the Table was always <U+017F>pread at the
Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi>'s, and I, who had us'd my <U+017F>elf to
a very regular life, could not but be indi<U+017F>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d with <U+017F>o
unu<U+017F>ual a cu<U+017F>tom; for being oblig'd to do as others did,
I was ill <U+017F>everal times before I came away. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
to the ordinary remedies in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, of
Diet and Bleeding; but my Ague <U+017F>till encra<U+017F>ing
upon me, I was advis'd to change my Doctor, and
they directed me to an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Knight, who was mighty
famous for Cures of that kind. Indeed, there was no
<U+017F>ort of Agues or Feavors almo<U+017F>t but he could <U+017F>top them;
he cur'd all people that went to him, and there was no
doubt but I <U+017F>hould have had the <U+017F>ame benefit: But I
under<U+017F>tood, that almo<U+017F>t all the people that came to him
had their Di<U+017F>temper return'd upon them again in two
or three months, <U+017F>o I did not care for meddling with
him. But however to <U+017F>atisfy my friends I <U+017F>ent to him,
and de<U+017F>ir'd him to do me the favour to come and <U+017F>ee
me; which he did: And among other things he made
me laugh heartily at a <U+017F>tory he told me of the Marquis
<hi>de Hautefort,</hi> one of the Querries to the Queen, a man
of about a hundred thou<U+017F>and Livres a year E<U+017F>tate, but
<U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erably covetous, that tho he had neither Wife
nor Child to provide for, yet he was afraid of every body
that came near him. He was much in the <U+017F>ame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as I was, and <U+017F>ent to this Doctor to tell him, he
had occa<U+017F>ion to make u<U+017F>e of his Phy<U+017F>ick, and therefore
de<U+017F>ir'd him to come and <U+017F>ee him. When the Doctor
came to him he found him extraordinary bad; but
having felt his Pul<U+017F>e, lookt on his Tongue, and
the like, he bid him not be di<U+017F>courag'd, for he
did not que<U+017F>tion but with Gods ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing he <U+017F>hould
cure him, and that he would have him make u<U+017F>e
of his remedy. But the Marquis reply'd, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he meddled with it, he would know what the
price of it was, for he had been told by <U+017F>ome who had
to do with him, that he was a very dear man; that as
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57806:193"/>
               <hi>Moliere</hi> has it, he ought to be <U+017F>o con<U+017F>cionable in his
prices, that poor <U+017F>ick folks might live, who could not
el<U+017F>e afford to be <U+017F>ick. The Doctor was amaz'd, he <U+017F>aid,
to hear him talk at that rate, con<U+017F>idering too what an
E<U+017F>tate he had, and told him, he hop'd he was but in
je<U+017F>t to talk at that rate to one who was <U+017F>o much his
humble Servant; that he <U+017F>hould be very glad if he
could but cure him; he did not u<U+017F>e to talk of price to
per<U+017F>ons of his quality, and he <U+017F>hould do what he pleas'd
with him, as to that they would not differ; but all this
<U+017F>ignify'd nothing, he would have the price fixt, or he
would talk no further of it: The Doctor thinking he
ought to obey him, told him, that per<U+017F>ons of his figure
never us'd to offer him le<U+017F>s than 50 Pi<U+017F>toles, but that
as he had <U+017F>aid before, he <U+017F>hould do what he pleas'd with
him; at which words the Marquis roar'd out as if he
had been kill'd, that he was afraid the people of the
Hou<U+017F>e would have thought he had offer'd him <U+017F>ome
in<U+017F>olence; that <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he left him
to vent it by him<U+017F>elf; when after having rav'd for a
good while, he call'd for him again, and offer'd him
four Pi<U+017F>toles; but the Doctor telling him as before,
that he would leave it to him, he flew out in a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
again, and bid him get him out of his Hou<U+017F>e, he would
have nothing to do with him nor his Phy<U+017F>ick; upon
which the Doctor immediately <U+017F>how'd him his back,
and went away; but was no <U+017F>ooner got home,
but he was follow'd by a Lacquey from the Marquis to
offer him one Pi<U+017F>tole more; and <U+017F>o for four days <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ively
he <U+017F>ent the <U+017F>ame Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to chaffer with
him for his Phy<U+017F>ick, <U+017F>till off'ring him every day a
Pi<U+017F>tole more, till at la<U+017F>t he was pleas'd to dye before
the bargain was made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I gave the more faith to this <U+017F>tory, becau<U+017F>e I knew
a great many <U+017F>ordid tricks of his before, and had

the Marriage of the Dauphin, for I <U+017F>till endeavour'd
to live in the be<U+017F>t figure I could; and tho I had but a
<U+017F>mall E<U+017F>tate, yet I always follow'd the Court. In this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

I happen'd to lodge in the <U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e with this

caught the Marquis's Coachman <U+017F>tealing his Oats;
upon which he came to tell his Ma<U+017F>ter of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<U+017F>atisfaction.</hi> For what? <hi>reply'd the Marquis,</hi>
Why you <U+017F>ay your <U+017F>elf, that you only took him <U+017F>tealing your
Corn, and that you made him give it you back again. Yes
truly, <hi><U+017F>ays the good man,</hi> what I found upon him I made
him return, but I have lo<U+017F>t half the Oats that were in the
Che<U+017F>t; for I know how many were put in, and there are
not above half <U+017F>o many left now. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not this Witne<U+017F>s enough that I catcht him in the

you. More <U+017F>hame for thee, <hi>reply'd the Marquis;</hi> Don't

            <p>This was all the Ju<U+017F>tice the poor man could get of
him, and <U+017F>o he came to make his complaint to me,
of the wrong he had done him; but I could <U+017F>ay
nothing to it, but <U+017F>hrugging up my <U+017F>houlders told
him, there was no remedy but patience, which
he was forc'd to u<U+017F>e; and indeed he had more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
for that Vertue afterward: for when he went
away, he was <U+017F>o far from paying him for what
his men had <U+017F>poil'd, that he hardly paid him for their
Diet; or if he did, 'twas at <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>candalous price,

markt that Hou<U+017F>e as he had done the others. The

finding that he did not take much notice of that, he

writ to me to wait upon him from him. I went to him
to his fine Country Hou<U+017F>e in the <hi>I<U+017F>le de No<U+017F>tre Dame,</hi>
and the Porter telling me he was in his Chamber, I
went cro<U+017F>s the Court-yard to go up to him: I did not
know him in the lea<U+017F>t, whether he was old or young,
or what manner of man he was; however, I happen'd
to light on him, as I was going up the <U+017F>tairs, with a
wooden Candle<U+017F>tick in his hand, ju<U+017F>t as if he had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down into the Celler; I askt him which was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idents

my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to <U+017F>peak with him, I need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpriz'd with this <U+017F>udden reply, that I
<U+017F>tood like one that had been caught in <U+017F>ome ill fact, but
he very civilly helpt me out of my confu<U+017F>ion him<U+017F>elf,
asking me if there was any thing he could <U+017F>erve me in;
<U+017F>o that finding he was not affronted, I <U+017F>oon recover'd
my <U+017F>elf. One would infer from what I have <U+017F>aid, that

accident introduc'd me into his acquaintance, and was
the occa<U+017F>ion that we were afterwards very familiar;
and this I can <U+017F>ay of my own knowledge of him, that

a mi<U+017F>take, e<U+017F>pecially when a man is <U+017F>urpriz'd in any
figure below his character, of which I had a proof a
little before that in another ca<U+017F>e; going to <U+017F>ee a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of the Inque<U+017F>ts, call'd <hi>Machaut,</hi> who liv'd in
<hi>La Rue Michael de Comte,</hi> I had a little proce<U+017F>s before
him, and going by accident by his door, I took that
opportunity to ask him, if he would plea<U+017F>e to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
the trouble to examine it. He that open'd the
door told me he was at home, and de<U+017F>ir'd me to walk
in, and he would tell him there was one to <U+017F>peak with
him. I did <U+017F>o, and coming to a door that lookt into
the Garden I open'd it, and thro it I <U+017F>aw a man in his
Drawers, with a Night Cap on, hard at work till he
<U+017F>weat again: Who <U+017F>hould this be, but my Lawyer, who
was a mighty great Flori<U+017F>t, and one indeed that <U+017F>eem'd
fitter to <U+017F>et Tulips than to try Cau<U+017F>es. I lookt on him a
good while before he turn'd about, he was <U+017F>o intent upon
what he was a doing; but at la<U+017F>t being forc'd to rai<U+017F>e
him<U+017F>elf up to take breath a little, he <U+017F>py'd me, and
coming up briskly, askt me who I would <U+017F>peak with, I
told him with Mr. <hi>de Machaut,</hi> little thinking I <U+017F>poke
to him him<U+017F>elf; but he pre<U+017F>ently made me know it,
asking me more briskly than before, What I would
have with him; <hi>Give him a Brief,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, with a little
heat, not being very well pleas'd to be us'd <U+017F>o; <hi>Give it
me then,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, in the <U+017F>ame tone he began with, <hi>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57806:195"/>
that I did not much care which way it went, I did not
<U+017F>pare him at all; 'twould have made any body laugh
to hear us. However, tho I was now <U+017F>o much affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I gave him my Brief, and he vouch<U+017F>af'd to read it;
and he was no <U+017F>ooner come to my Name in it, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
changing both his countenance and his <U+017F>tile,
he askt me what Family I was of, and if I was not of
<U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch a Family, and a kin to <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch,
naming their qualities and offices, more than ever I
had heard of, tho I thought I knew perfectly all the
Preferments had belong'd to any of our Family; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I an<U+017F>wer'd yes to all, the <U+017F>ooner to be rid of his
enquiry; upon which he embrac'd me, and told me
that we were Relations, and began to reckon up our
Genealogy in <U+017F>uch a manner, that for my life I could
make nothing at all of it; however I confirm'd every
thing he de<U+017F>ir'd, and <U+017F>o from that time forward he
would needs call me Cou<U+017F>in; telling me tho, I
<U+017F>hould not mention to any body, that I had <U+017F>poken to
him before the judgment of my Suit, becau<U+017F>e if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
party <U+017F>hould hear of it, 'twere enough to make
them reflect on him. I told him, that he might be <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
I would not, and <U+017F>o we parted as good friends as
any in the world; and four or five days after he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
my Cau<U+017F>e, tho 'twas almo<U+017F>t a Proverb of him,
that to put a Cau<U+017F>e into his hands was the only way to
have it never ended.</p>
            <p>But in mentioning of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Hautefort,</hi> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
engag'd in <U+017F>tories which I had not de<U+017F>ign'd, and
am gone off from the <U+017F>tory of the Dauphins Marriage,
which I intended, and which perhaps may be as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
as any, to tho<U+017F>e who are pleas'd to hear of the
motions of great per<U+017F>ons, which is a humor much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hion
now. The Prince<U+017F>s being arriv'd at <hi>Sermai<U+017F>es,</hi> and
the King and the Dauphin at <hi>Chalons,</hi> 'twas re<U+017F>olv'd the

               </gap>way. In the

the Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Condom,</hi> who was the Dauphins<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to compliment her in the name of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
but withal to ob<U+017F>erve, if <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57806:195"/>
as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>aid to be, for there was <U+017F>ome who
had reported, that <U+017F>he was a Prince<U+017F>s not at all of a
humour agreeable to the Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nation,
who are the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant and obliging people in the
world; and de<U+017F>irous above all things, that the per<U+017F>ons
who they are oblig'd to obey <U+017F>hould agree with them in
humour and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. He had orders al<U+017F>o, in ca<U+017F>e he
found it <U+017F>o as was reported, to in<U+017F>inuate gently in his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
to her, that the manners of the <hi>French</hi> were quite
different from tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Germans;</hi> <U+017F>o if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to move her to comply with the <hi>French</hi> air as much
as <U+017F>he could, that <U+017F>he might not only oblige the King
and her Husband, but al<U+017F>o the whole Nation, among
whom <U+017F>he had already a very good character, by
what they had heard of her, as a Prince<U+017F>s of the
greate<U+017F>t Wit and Gallantry in <hi>Europe;</hi> but he brought
the King word, that <U+017F>he needed none of tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for excepting that <U+017F>he lov'd <U+017F>ometimes to be
private, there was nothing more civil or obliging in
the world. The King him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o when he came two
leagues from <hi>Chalons,</hi> had the fir<U+017F>t rencounter with her
to his infinite <U+017F>atisfaction. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the King appear'd,
and before he could come to <U+017F>alute her, <U+017F>he light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of her Coach; which when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and that <U+017F>he was coming towards him, he al<U+017F>o
alighted, follow'd by the Dauphin at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
as it had without doubt been all appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the King, who gave orders in all <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es
him<U+017F>elf. After the King had <U+017F>poke a few words to the
Prince<U+017F>s, who kneel'd at his feet, he pre<U+017F>ented the
Dauphin to her, and after that all the per<U+017F>ons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Train. This fir<U+017F>t Enterview was in the
open field, which being not a place to <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ceremonies of the Marriage were <U+017F>olemnized. In the
mean time, the King had plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the young Lady, and had taken her from the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57806:196"/>
Queen, whom <U+017F>he waited upon before, knowing her to
be the mo<U+017F>t capable per<U+017F>on in the Kingdom. It was
thought <U+017F>trange tho, that being Lady of Honour to the
Queen, <U+017F>he could be in no higher quality to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine<U+017F>s,
which <U+017F>eem'd rather to degrade, than advance
her. But <U+017F>he, who was a Lady of great Wit, did not
take it <U+017F>o, for <U+017F>he lookt more upon the confidence the
King plac'd in her, than the Title; and in endeavouring
to plea<U+017F>e her new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and in obliging al<U+017F>o the
King him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he let us know, that Di<U+017F>cretion
makes all things ea<U+017F>y to per<U+017F>ons who under<U+017F>tand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>The King made no <U+017F>tay at <hi>Chalons,</hi> the Queen
waiting for them at <hi>Villers Cotterets;</hi> and every hour
was a year to her, till <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the Lady who was to be
her Sons Wife; and the King al<U+017F>o, being willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to gratify her in <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t a de<U+017F>ire, lo<U+017F>t no time any
where till he came thither, where they had prepar'd
all manner of diver<U+017F>ions to entertain them with; Balls,
Mu<U+017F>ick, Comedies, and every thing they could devi<U+017F>e;
and tho it was in <hi>Lent,</hi> yet 'twas thought, no time
could di<U+017F>pence them from demon<U+017F>trating that joy which
every body was toucht with, to <U+017F>ee the Heir of <U+017F>o
mighty a Kingdom wedded to a Prince<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o great
merit. They <U+017F>tay'd here fifteen days; after which the
King went for <hi>Paris.</hi> I cannot forbear here to give an
account of my own folly, for I cannot give a better
name to that <U+017F>trong fancy I had to be always following
the Court. I <U+017F>taid at <hi>Villers Cotterets</hi> all the while the
King was there, tho with <U+017F>o little accommodation, that
I was fain to lye upon Straw. Indeed, the place not
being able to lodge the tenth part of the company,
<U+017F>ome were fain to go 2 or 3 leagues every night for a
Lodging; others encampt in the Fields. For my part,
I was <U+017F>o crippled with my hard Lodging, that when
I came to get a Hor<U+017F>eback I found my <U+017F>elf very
unea<U+017F>y. One of tho<U+017F>e who had danc'd at the Ball,
<U+017F>eeing me in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, told me, that if I would
lend him my Hor<U+017F>e, he would give me his place
in the Coach. I took him at his word, for nothing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57806:196"/>
could have pleas'd me better: But being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the company of all the great Dancers of the Town,
there was a parcel of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which was <U+017F>o far
from diverting me, that I was more unea<U+017F>y there than
I <U+017F>hould have been upon my Hor<U+017F>e; and the weather
too prov'd <U+017F>o bad, that we could take but very <U+017F>hort
Stages; and at la<U+017F>t, to make up all, the Coach over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and in <U+017F>o dirty a place, that it was half a
day before we could get out, for we were forc'd for
help to go to the neighbouring Villages; all this while
I <U+017F>torm'd, and call'd my <U+017F>elf a hundred fools for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my <U+017F>elf into this needle<U+017F>s trouble. We had <U+017F>et
out <U+017F>omething before the re<U+017F>t, that we might be at
<hi>S. Germain</hi> as <U+017F>oon as the King, but now we were like
to be left a long way behind. When the King pa<U+017F>t by
us, in that condition, he <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>ee who we were
that were in <U+017F>uch a pickle? and when he was told
it was the Dancers, he laught heartily, and <U+017F>aid, <hi>He
had rather it were they than any others, for they had the
be<U+017F>t Legs; but he doubted they would find it hard to dance
hand<U+017F>omely upon <U+017F>uch a Stage as that.</hi> This was told us
by a Gentleman of the Wardrobe, who had a relation
among us; and tho it is the cu<U+017F>tom to admire every
thing the King <U+017F>ays, we di<U+017F>penc'd with doing it now,
being too dull at our misfortune to laugh at any thing:
at la<U+017F>t, after a great deal of patience, we got out of
that ugly place, and were forc'd to get <U+017F>ix fre<U+017F>h Hor<U+017F>es
for the Coach. We were all <hi>French-men,</hi> and <U+017F>o natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
apt to forget our pa<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>chances; we thought of
them no more after we once got to <hi>Senlis;</hi> we talkt
of nothing there but making good cheer, and our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
finding the Wine very good, drank as much
as inclin'd them all to go to <U+017F>leep.</p>
            <p>The next day we reacht our Journeys end, and when
I came home found a man at my Lodgings that <U+017F>tay'd
for me, with whom I once took a longer Journey than
this, tho not <U+017F>o unplea<U+017F>ant. 'Twas while I was with the
Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu.</hi> He had <U+017F>ent me into <hi>Languedoc</hi>
to carry <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>patches to the Duke <hi>de Montmorenci,</hi>
Governour of that Province; and as I was riding po<U+017F>t
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57806:197"/>
back again, I met with <U+017F>uch a bad Hor<U+017F>e a little beyon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Peage</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> that I think if a man was to be
flea'd alive, he could not endure more than I did. I
had done better a thou<U+017F>and times, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this unlucky chance, to have got upon the Po<U+017F>t-boys
Hor<U+017F>e, or have gone on Foot; but thinking that
by <U+017F>purring and whipping I <U+017F>hould get him along, I
fatigu'd my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, as I think I never felt <U+017F>o much
pain in my life. In the mean time the Po<U+017F>t-boy, whom
I had <U+017F>wore at, and threatned hard enough, run away,
for fear I <U+017F>hould be as good as my word; <U+017F>o I was left
in the middle of a great Plain, like a Vagabond; then
I try'd to light and walk a foot, but that brought me
into another perplexity, for the Jade would not lead,
but hung back, till I was afraid <U+017F>he would have
lugg'd my Arm of. I thought I would cure that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<U+017F>o I turn'd her afore, and let her go loo<U+017F>e; but then
<U+017F>he would <U+017F>tand <U+017F>tock <U+017F>till till I came up to drive her;
and then in<U+017F>tead of going forward <U+017F>he would
do nothing, but go from one <U+017F>ide to the other;
<U+017F>o being <U+017F>oon tir'd with that <U+017F>port I got up again: but
then I was put to the torture again. I <U+017F>hort, I believe
I <U+017F>hould never have reacht the next Stage, if I had not
with the help of Whip and Spur overtook a Hor<U+017F>e Litter
going my way, where the per<U+017F>on who was in it, prov'd
the very Man, that, as I <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>taid for me at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with one of his Brothers. I askt them how far
it was to <hi>Peage,</hi> and the Man <U+017F>eeing what a <U+017F>orrowful
condition I was in, told me if I pleas'd I might come
into the Hor<U+017F>e Litter, and his Brother <U+017F>hould get up on
my Hor<U+017F>e, and then the way would not <U+017F>eem half <U+017F>o
long to me. He could not have offer'd me a greater
kindne<U+017F>s; then taking him at his word I got up pre<U+017F>ently,
and really I found him a Man of <U+017F>uch an excellent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that tho I was intollerable weary, yet I was
mightily pleas'd with his conver<U+017F>ation. Being arriv'd
at <hi>Peage</hi> we <U+017F>upp'd together, and the next day I made u<U+017F>e
of his Carriage to <hi>Vienne,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lyons,</hi>
where (being in no great ha<U+017F>te) I <U+017F>taid 3 or 4 days to
re<U+017F>t me. This Man came to <hi>Lyons</hi> to have a con<U+017F>ulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57806:197"/>
of Phy<U+017F>itians for an old Di<U+017F>temper which he had
had upon him a long time, and his Brother came with
him only to keep him company; but it was the plea<U+017F>ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
Con<U+017F>ultation, I believe, that ever was heard of; and
I can <U+017F>peak with the more certainty of it, becau<U+017F>e I was
there my <U+017F>elf. He told the Doctors, he did not come
to them to know if he <U+017F>hould recover his health, by
ob<U+017F>erving tho<U+017F>e forms and rules of living which they
generally impo<U+017F>e upon their Patients, but whether or
no he might be cur'd, and yet live on at his own old
rate; that he had always eat well, and drunk hard, and
lov'd a Woman, and intended to do <U+017F>o <U+017F>till; and if
they could undertake to cure him upon tho<U+017F>e terms well
and good. The Doctors <U+017F>tar'd upon one another,
hearing him talk at this rate, and all with one voice
condemn'd him to dye; <U+017F>ince he was re<U+017F>olv'd to live his
own way, in contempt of Science and their Rules. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould not altogether lo<U+017F>e his labour,
they told him, tho they could <U+017F>ay little to him, <U+017F>ince he
would not refrain from tho<U+017F>e Debauches; yet they
would give him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall thing to take, and order him
to bleed often. This was indeed the ready way to kill
the Man, and <U+017F>o it prov'd, for he dy'd the latter end of
that year. He had a Benefice of about a thou<U+017F>and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
a year, which is con<U+017F>iderable in that Country, and
when he dy'd became vacant. His Brother immediately

any intere<U+017F>t to get it for him. I had no great intere<U+017F>t
truly, but having the honour to belong to the Prime
Mini<U+017F>ter, made me have <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pect more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in the world: I went to the Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Valence,</hi>
in who<U+017F>e Gift it was, and he granted it me at the fir<U+017F>t
word; and ever <U+017F>ince the poor Man is <U+017F>o grateful to
me, that every year he <U+017F>ends me a Pre<U+017F>ent of <U+017F>ome
thing or other that's rare in the Country; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he comes to <hi>Paris,</hi> I am always the fir<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on he
makes a vi<U+017F>it to. He was come this time, about a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he had with the Marquis <hi>de Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Royal Regiment of <hi>Piemont,</hi> one of the Grand
Priors of the Order of <hi>St. Lazarus;</hi> and it was upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57806:198"/>
the account of this la<U+017F>t dignity of the Marquis, that he
came to have a di<U+017F>pute with him; for having <U+017F>ome
Dues, where the Marquis al<U+017F>o had a Claim, their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who liv'd there agreed <U+017F>o ill, that their Ma<U+017F>ters
were fain to be concern'd in it, and were now ju<U+017F>t on
the point of going to Law. I told him pre<U+017F>ently he
had better never begin it, if he could avoid it, becau<U+017F>e
he would have a very powerful Adver<U+017F>ary, not becau<U+017F>e
of the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who had no more friends
than other folks, but becau<U+017F>e of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
who mu<U+017F>t be a Party, as he was Vicar General of the
Order: he told me he was of my opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was come directly to me to beg my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance,
for that he thought he had heard me <U+017F>ay, I was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
acquainted with Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and
having had <U+017F>o much experience of my friend<U+017F>hip, he
did not que<U+017F>tion but I would a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him to the be<U+017F>t of
my power. I told him he was very much in the right,
for <U+017F>o I would, but that it was not in my power to do
him any <U+017F>ervice in this Ca<U+017F>e, for that on certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
which I could tell him, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
and I had fallen out, and I had no intere<U+017F>t in him at all.
Indeed Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of a thou<U+017F>and
good qualities; he was a very gentile man, and a man
of Wit and Bravery enough, but withal <U+017F>o very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
that he would quarrel with the be<U+017F>t friend he
had for the value of Six-pence; by which humour he
embroyl'd him<U+017F>elf in a multitude of brangles and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels:
But as this did not concern me, <U+017F>o I <U+017F>hould not
have toucht upon it, if he had but <U+017F>hown him<U+017F>elf a man
of honour, and kept his word with me. The difference I
had with him was on this account. Meeting him one day
at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> he came up to me and embrac'd me,
and after a croud of Care<U+017F><U+017F>es askt me, what I had done
for my Nephew. I told him I had plac'd him in the
Kings Regiment; for at that time he was in that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He told me, that if I would let him have him, he
would help him to a Company in his own Regiment, and
it <U+017F>hould not co<U+017F>t him a Farthing, for he had a Captain
who he did not like, and if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he would
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57806:198"/>
have him ca<U+017F>heer'd; and if I would joyn with him, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as ever 'twas done he would acquaint me with it, that
I might u<U+017F>e my intere<U+017F>t to get it; that he did not care
to ask it him<U+017F>elf, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be thought he had
pickt a quarrel with t'other on purpo<U+017F>e to oblige me;
but to be <U+017F>ure they at the Office would <U+017F>peak with him
before it was granted to any body, and then he would
do his part.</p>
            <p>There could be nothing more generous than <U+017F>uch a
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this; and therefore thinking my <U+017F>elf oblig'd
to acknowledge it, I took my Nephew along with me to
wait upon him, to whom al<U+017F>o he renew'd the <U+017F>ame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion
he had made to me; but he was never able to
bring it to pa<U+017F>s, and the Captain had <U+017F>o many friends,
that 'twas not in his power to turn him out, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
However, I thought my <U+017F>elf extreamly oblig'd to
him for what he had done; and as my Nephew was grown
weary of <U+017F>erving any longer in the Infantry, I advis'd
him to buy a Company in his Regiment; then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
if there was any Captain in that Regiment
di<U+017F>pos'd to <U+017F>ell, and I under<U+017F>tood the Baron <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>quiou</hi>
had an inclination to lay down. I went to the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and told him, that my Nephew
having <U+017F>o much experience of his Friend<U+017F>hip, was
re<U+017F>olv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to <U+017F>erve under him; and that there being no
Company to be got <hi>gratis,</hi> he was re<U+017F>olv'd to buy one;
that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Monte<U+017F>quiou</hi> was re<U+017F>olv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to part with
his; but before we treated with him I was willing to
acquaint him of it, and ask his advice. He told me, I
was to blame to be <U+017F>o forward, he was <U+017F>orry that my
Nephew had not patience to <U+017F>tay a little longer, that
certainly one or other would drop, which it might be
in his power to procure for him without paying for it;
but if he was <U+017F>o willing to part with his Money, he
thought him<U+017F>elf very much oblig'd to me for asking his
advice, and giving him an opportunity to <U+017F>erve him,
and he would endeavour he <U+017F>hould have no cau<U+017F>e
to repent it; that they would be Companions, and a
great many fine things he <U+017F>aid to me of this <U+017F>ort, and
made me <U+017F>tay and dine with him. The Marquis <hi>de

                  </gap>,</hi> din'd with us, they having
come together from <hi>Ave<U+017F>nes,</hi> where his Regiment was
in Garri<U+017F>on. We drank together all four in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
friend<U+017F>hip in the world; and there he told me a
<U+017F>tory how Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Teilons</hi> man dropt a Bag with
500 Pi<U+017F>toles in it as they came along, and going back
immediately, light of the man that found them. In
<U+017F>hort, I had all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to think my
<U+017F>elf oblig'd to him, and <U+017F>o had my Nephew, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made no more words of it, but went about our
Bargain with Mr. <hi>de Monte<U+017F>quiou;</hi> and I immediately
went to his Lodgings to <U+017F>peak with him. He was the
only Son, and Heir to an E<U+017F>tate of <U+017F>even or eight
thou<U+017F>and Livres a year, and the Inclination he had to go
and <U+017F>ee his E<U+017F>tate made him the ea<U+017F>ier to treat with, <U+017F>o
that our Bargain was <U+017F>oon concluded, and I went back
to acquaint Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who told me he was very
glad of it, and to te<U+017F>tify that he was indeed willing to
do us all the <U+017F>ervice he could, he told me he would
manage the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of the Office for us him<U+017F>elf, which
was ea<U+017F>y enough for him to do, by acquainting Mr. <hi>de
St. Pouange,</hi> that it was with his con<U+017F>ent my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
enter'd into his Regiment. That this was the be<U+017F>t
cour<U+017F>e, and if I pleas'd to be at <hi>St. Germains</hi> <U+017F>uch a
day, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee with my own eyes what pains he
would take to <U+017F>erve me.</p>
            <p>I had heard a great many people talk of this Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and of ill things done by him; but <U+017F>eeing
him <U+017F>o very gentile to us, I began to <U+017F>ay to my Friends
that he had certainly very hard mea<U+017F>ure, and that I
never met with an hone<U+017F>ter Gentleman in my Life.
Indeed, who would have thought otherwi<U+017F>e of a man,
from whom one had never receiv'd any thing but good
will; at lea<U+017F>t till <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e had appear'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
But it was not long before I had cau<U+017F>e enough
to alter my opinion; for coming to <hi>St. Germains</hi> at the
time appointed, and finding him out, he told me he
had heard <U+017F>ome News that very much <U+017F>urpriz'd him;
that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> having under<U+017F>tood that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57806:199"/>
               <hi>Monte<U+017F>quiou</hi> had a de<U+017F>ign to quit, had di<U+017F>pos'd of his
Company to the elde<U+017F>t Son of the Count <hi>de Grand Pre,</hi>
and he being Nephew to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Joyeu<U+017F>e,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General of the Army, he dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>peak again<U+017F>t
it for fear of breaking with him; that he was
mightily concern'd on my account, but the fir<U+017F>t Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that became vacant he would take <U+017F>uch mea<U+017F>ures,
that we <U+017F>hould not be di<U+017F>appointed again. I gue<U+017F>t
pre<U+017F>ently he had trickt me, and leaving him with <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
le<U+017F>s ceremony than I us'd to do, I met Mon<U+017F>ieur
<hi>de Monte<U+017F>quiou,</hi> who was come on purpo<U+017F>e to give his
con<U+017F>ent. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I had told him what had happen'd.
<hi>Ay,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>this is one of Mr.</hi> de Rivarolles <hi>u<U+017F>ual
tricks: I could have told you before, that he would put
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>ham or other upon you, when I <U+017F>aw you <U+017F>o confident
of his Friend<U+017F>hip; but I thought you would not be long before
you found him the wor<U+017F>t of Villains. This is ju<U+017F>t as he
<U+017F>erv'd poor</hi> Clau<U+017F>el, <hi>who was his Lieutenant, and who is
now a Captain in the Regiment call'd</hi> Chevelier Duc. <hi>It
is about two years ago that he got him leave him<U+017F>elf to
go home; but while he was there he wrote to him, in <U+017F>hort,
that he <U+017F>hould not trouble him<U+017F>elf to come again, but
to <U+017F>end him his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion (which by the way he had
<U+017F>old for a thou<U+017F>and Crowns) but</hi> Clau<U+017F>el <hi>baulkt him; for
having made the General acquainted with it, he was forc'd
to give him the Money, which</hi> Clau<U+017F>el <hi>had more mind to
than the Office, being not very willing to <U+017F>erve, under a Man,
that had <U+017F>hown him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e. But for my part,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
he, <hi>either your Nephew <U+017F>hall have my Company,
or no body <U+017F>hall have it. Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> de St. Pouange <hi>mu<U+017F>t
not think to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of it without my con<U+017F>ent; and I will
<U+017F>peak to the King about it if there be occa<U+017F>ion, who I don't
doubt will do me ju<U+017F>tice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was mighty glad to hear him talk thus; for I was <U+017F>o
vext at this wheadle of Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> that I was
very well pleas'd to think he <U+017F>hould meet with <U+017F>ome
little mortification, which made me prompt him the
more to it. I got him then to go directly to Mr. <hi>de St.
Pouange;</hi> whom he told, that he was <U+017F>urpriz'd to hear he
had given away his Company, <U+017F>ince he had always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57806:200"/>
<U+017F>erv'd the King, without <U+017F>o much as the lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in his duty; that <U+017F>ince he had been in the <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he had always kept his Company full, and in
good condition, and perhaps he could <U+017F>ay, the be<U+017F>t in
the Army; that if he had a de<U+017F>ign to quit, he hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d he
might have the <U+017F>ame priviledge as others had, who
were always allow'd to carry off a little Money; that
he had <U+017F>pent ten thou<U+017F>and Crowns of his own in the
<U+017F>ervice, and 'twas but rea<U+017F>onable he <U+017F>hould have the
advantage of reimbur<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf a little; that he had
treated with my Nephew by the Kings permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, at
a price both parties were content with; and if he
pleas'd to execute the Agreement, he was there ready to
make his Re<U+017F>ignation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f not; he would <U+017F>pend twice
as much more, before he would be bubbled by the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles.</hi> Mr. <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> was <U+017F>urpriz'd
at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, for Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had told him,
that <hi>Monte<U+017F>quiou</hi> was content, that the Marquis <hi>de Grand
Pre</hi> <U+017F>hould have his Company; however, being a friend
of Mr. <hi>de Joyeu<U+017F>e,</hi> who had <U+017F>poke in favour of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
he return'd, that he could <U+017F>ay nothing to it, but
that he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>poke <U+017F>ooner; the thing being now
done, it was pa<U+017F>t remedy, for the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion was
<U+017F>ealed, and wanted nothing but to be deliver'd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion lay upon the Table, and to put
it out of que<U+017F>tion he <U+017F>how'd it us. <hi>Monte<U+017F>quiou</hi> reply'd
re<U+017F>olutely, that its being di<U+017F>patcht or not <U+017F>ignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him; that it was upon the account of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no mind to <U+017F>erve any longer, that the King had
gratified Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Grand Pre;</hi> but now his mind
was alter'd, and he declar'd the contrary; and if it
mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o he would keep it him<U+017F>elf, and to convince
him, he would immediately return to Garri<U+017F>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Mr. <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> was not us'd to be talkt to at this
rate, and therefore was very much affronted, and fell
out in a violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, telling us, that <U+017F>ince he would
<U+017F>erve again, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Grand Pre</hi> <U+017F>hould not have his
Company, but that he would take care al<U+017F>o, that my
Nephew <U+017F>hould never have it, and that he <U+017F>hould
look that he did his Duty very well, for he
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57806:200"/>
would have an Eye upon his Conduct; bidding him
take notice, that if he receiv'd any affront, it
<U+017F>hould come from no body but him<U+017F>elf. With the<U+017F>e
words he took up the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and tearing it in
three or four pieces, threw it upon the ground, letting
us know by this action, what we had heard of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was true, that when he did e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>e any mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t
he did it with a great deal of warmth. We made
no que<U+017F>tion, but all this huff was upon the account of
Mr. <hi>de Joyeu<U+017F>e.</hi> In the mean time, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>quiou,</hi>
being oblig'd to keep his Company, gave us an
example, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to avoid our De<U+017F>tiny,
being kill'd the next Campaign in <hi>Germany.</hi> And this
obligation his Father had to Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> whom
he had <U+017F>erv'd in <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions to the utmo<U+017F>t; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
when he had his Leg <U+017F>hot off by a Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

Po<U+017F>t from <hi>Paris</hi> to demand <U+017F>atisfaction; and was
the occa<U+017F>ion of a very plea<U+017F>ant adventure. <hi>Madail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
at his arrival <U+017F>ent him a Challenge, without

found him in bed, as 'twas likely enough he <U+017F>hould, a

day; <U+017F>o that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he could go out; but the

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57806:201"/>
when he would <U+017F>end word where, and at what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
he would fight him. This an<U+017F>wer being carry'd to
<hi>Madaillan</hi> he was mighty glad, and waited the time
appointed with a great deal of impatience. He was
awake very early in the morning, when his Servants,
who knew nothing of the matter, came and told him,
there was a Man below would <U+017F>peak with him from
the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles.</hi> He made no que<U+017F>tion, but
it was to appoint the place, and manner of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as he had promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and <U+017F>o order'd them to bring
him in, and to leave them together. The man, as <U+017F>oon
as he was come in, in<U+017F>tead of going to the Bed-<U+017F>ide to
<U+017F>peak with him, as he expected, goes directly to the
Table, where he laid down <U+017F>ome things which he had
under his Coat; <hi>Madaillan</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n to laugh at the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and lifting him<U+017F>elf up to look what it was he laid
down, he was amaz'd to <U+017F>ee all the Table cover'd over
with surgeons In<U+017F>truments: But imagining that the
man might have made <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>take, he askt him, if
he was <U+017F>ure he was right? and if he had not <U+017F>aid he
came from the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles? No, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>ays the
man, <hi>it is no mi<U+017F>take, I did <U+017F>ay I came from him, and do
<U+017F>o <U+017F>till, for he <U+017F>ent me to de<U+017F>ire you to let me cut off one of
your Legs; for having <U+017F>ent him a Challenge to fight
to day, he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es you are more of a Gentleman than to
fight him at an advantage; and he has lo<U+017F>t one of his Legs
at</hi> Puicerda, <hi>of which he is not yet cur'd; and being not
<U+017F>uch a fool as to fight, maim'd as he is, again<U+017F>t
a man that has all his Limbs; he de<U+017F>ires you would
either go fir<U+017F>t and lo<U+017F>e one of your Legs as he did, or
if you have <U+017F>uch a mind to fight, to let me cut off one for
you, for 'tis my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.</hi> The man that made him
this compliment was really a Surgeon; and <hi>Madail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
for fear he <U+017F>hould be laught at if he abus'd him,
took no notice, but bid him take up his Tools and go
about his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but 'twas never a jot the more <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
for that, for the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> took care
to make it publick enough; and it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that to conceal the quarrel, the Deputies of the
Mare<U+017F>chals of <hi>France</hi> prohibited them fighting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made them friends.</p>

'Tis ea<U+017F>ie to judge from hence what a condition I

<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and he being a man of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, that knew I
had good will enough for him, knew I did not <U+017F>peak
to refu<U+017F>e him my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. He apply'd him<U+017F>elf el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and having found one who had more Intere<U+017F>t
in the Marquis than I, he de<U+017F>ir'd him to tell the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
that he had no inclination to go to Law unle<U+017F>s he
was forc'd to it, and therefore begg'd of him he would
do him ju<U+017F>tice; and if he would not be Judge in his

per<U+017F>on whom he him<U+017F>elf would choo<U+017F>e. But the
Marquis would be brought to no terms, nothing would
<U+017F>erve him but the relinqui<U+017F>hing all his Dues; which the
other being not willing to do, was forc'd to go to Law
with him: In the pro<U+017F>ecution of which, I endeavour'd,
with <U+017F>ome other of his friends, to <U+017F>erve him as well as
we could with the Judges. At la<U+017F>t there comes a
per<U+017F>on to him, who told him he <U+017F>hould not be afraid
to deal with him, for he <U+017F>hould not fail either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecution,
or in making Friends; and that the Marquis
him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>hould not make better; and in particular, he
would undertake that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> <U+017F>hould not
intere<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in his Cau<U+017F>e, and that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

at the <U+017F>ame time telling me that he knew not
who this man was, nor whence he came, nor would
he ever let him know him; but when he askt him who
he was, and told him 'twould be a greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>I was at a lo<U+017F>s, nor could I imagin for my life, who
it <U+017F>hould be that had <U+017F>ent him this me<U+017F><U+017F>age; for tho I

great many enemies, yet I could not gue<U+017F>s who it <U+017F>hould
be, that dur<U+017F>t undertake for <U+017F>uch a powerful protection:
If they had us'd more Mode<U+017F>ty, I <U+017F>hould have thought
it had been the Marquis <hi>de Carman,</hi> who had been
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57806:202"/>
Collonel of the Regiment of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and who had
more cau<U+017F>e to hate him than any body; and the Hi<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it will give a true character of the man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I <U+017F>hall give a di<U+017F>tinct account of it, in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances,
and yet as <U+017F>hort as I can. The Marquis
<hi>de Rivarolles</hi> fell in love with Madam <hi>de Carman,</hi> who
dwelt then at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Rou<U+017F>illon,</hi>
but made no advances in her favour; till at la<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding
by one of her Women, that <U+017F>he wanted
Money, he brings a hundred Pi<U+017F>toles with him in a
Pur<U+017F>e; with this he comes him<U+017F>elf, at a time when he
knew <U+017F>he was in Bed; whether it was, that he thought
at that time <U+017F>he would be mo<U+017F>t inclin'd to plea<U+017F>ure, or
that he thought he might oblige her to comply with
him with le<U+017F>s difficulty; and being admitted into her
Chamber, and after <U+017F>ome time having di<U+017F>cover'd his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he at the <U+017F>ame time pre<U+017F>ented her the Pur<U+017F>e,
which render'd his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e the more per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive;
the Lady making as if <U+017F>he had been yeilding, and yet,
that if <U+017F>he did, it was not for the <U+017F>ake of his Money,
bid him lay the Pur<U+017F>e upon the <hi>Toilette,</hi> thinking <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould get tho<U+017F>e hundred <hi>Louis d' Or</hi> very cheap; but
the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> after he had done what he
pleas'd, <U+017F>eeing the Pur<U+017F>e upon the <hi>Toilette</hi> as he went
out, caught it up again, and took it with him without
being <U+017F>een. When the Lady ro<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he went to plea<U+017F>e
her<U+017F>elf with what <U+017F>he thought her<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ure of, but was
<U+017F>trangely <U+017F>urpriz'd when <U+017F>he found 'twas gone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be in <U+017F>trange fears what <U+017F>hould become of her,
having heard often enough what kind of a Man the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> was, which indeed might be the
rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he would be paid before-hand; but this <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw
had not <U+017F>ucceeded. She conceal'd her re<U+017F>entment; but
took up the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olutions po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and <U+017F>uch, as
had <U+017F>he had power <U+017F>uitable to her courage, might have
had very ill effects. In the mean time, he, as if it had
not been enough to have abus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d her, made it as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as he could, and made <U+017F>port of it in all company.
Such a <U+017F>tory as this <U+017F>oon <U+017F>pread all over the Country,
which when <U+017F>he came to hear of it again, it is an ea<U+017F>y
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57806:202"/>
matter to imagin what condition <U+017F>he was in; <U+017F>he was
a thou<U+017F>and times about to have expos'd her<U+017F>elf to the
fir<U+017F>t that would revenge her upon him; but while <U+017F>he
thus meditated mi<U+017F>chief, <U+017F>he receiv'd a Letter from her
Husband, who by this time had heard of it too, which
bid her expect to live no longer than he <U+017F>hould return,
which joyn'd to her guilty Con<U+017F>cience put her into a
grievous fright; and as if <U+017F>he was not yet unhappy
enough, <U+017F>he finds that <U+017F>he was with Child by this fact,
which aggravated her grief to the la<U+017F>t extremity, and
made her take up a re<U+017F>olution which I cannot relate
without horror; for tho I did not know her, yet I had
the honour to be acquainted with her Father, who
was a u<U+017F>eful man, and very well in e<U+017F>teem with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> In <U+017F>hort, <U+017F>he poi<U+017F>on'd her<U+017F>elf, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as <U+017F>he knew her Husband was on his return from the
Army; <U+017F>o he was di<U+017F>appointed in his furious de<U+017F>ign,
which I think he ought rather to have vented upon
him who was the Author of his di<U+017F>grace. But tho
he was high enough in threatning his Wife, he had not
courage enough to revenge it upon the Adulterer; and
tho he came into his company a thou<U+017F>and times, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dur<U+017F>t take notice of it.</p>
            <p>All the world knew this <U+017F>tory, and that made me
think, that tho Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Carman</hi> dur<U+017F>t not openly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with him, yet he would have been glad to have <U+017F>ome
mi<U+017F>chief befal him, and <U+017F>o had <U+017F>ent privately to my friend
about his Suit; but a little after I alter'd my opinion,
and rather thought it might be the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi>
with whom he had <U+017F>ome difference but a little before.
However, he was not to blame in this affair; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my quarrel was at him, I mu<U+017F>t tell the truth, and
will do <U+017F>o. They had been at play together <U+017F>everal
times, and the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had lo<U+017F>t 3 or 400
Pi<U+017F>toles to him, which he had very hone<U+017F>tly paid him,
and having won back about one hundred and fifty,
could not get one penny of it; when at la<U+017F>t, having
askt him for the Money a great many times, and he
had made him a great many promi<U+017F>es, but never kept
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57806:203"/>
one, he goes away to his Tent and <U+017F>eizes upon his
Hor<U+017F>es, and one of his Grooms making <U+017F>ome oppo<U+017F>ition,
he Can'd him very hand<U+017F>omely. The Marquis <hi>de Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
being a per<U+017F>on of quality, <U+017F>uch an affront as
this went very near him; and tho there was afterwards
an Accommodation, yet 'twas thought he had <U+017F>till a
grudge in his mind again<U+017F>t him, at lea<U+017F>t I thought <U+017F>o;
and having told my friend this <U+017F>tory, we concluded
that it mu<U+017F>t be from him, and that if it was, his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s would certainly go well, for Mr. <hi>de Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
was a per<U+017F>on who had Relations and Friends of
very good credit; but that which gave me the greate<U+017F>t
hope was the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance he gave him, that Mr. <hi>de Louvois</hi>
<U+017F>hould not be again<U+017F>t him.</p>
            <p>However, to know whether this was a thing to be
tru<U+017F>ted to or not, I advis'd him to go and <U+017F>ee this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>ter,
and acquaint him, that Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
had forc'd him to a Proce<U+017F>s which was very cruel and
unju<U+017F>t, and that before he did any thing in it, he was
come to throw him<U+017F>elf and his concerns into his hands;
that as it was a thing which had <U+017F>ome relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t
of the Order of <hi>Saint Lazarus,</hi> he knew his duty
too well to do any thing before he had askt his leave;
that he de<U+017F>ir'd no better Judge than him<U+017F>elf, if he could
admit him<U+017F>elf from his more weighty affairs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it; and if not, he <U+017F>hould be infinitely oblig'd to
him, that he would appoint any fit per<U+017F>on to hear it.
Mr. <hi>de Louvois</hi> receiv'd him very kindly, and told him
he would leave it to the ordinary Judges, but promis'd
him he would not any way hinder him from having
ju<U+017F>tice done. So the Proceedings began, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who knew he was at a di<U+017F>tance from
home, made at fir<U+017F>t a great many <U+017F>hifts and tricks to
tire him out. In the mean time, the man who had
promis'd to <U+017F>ollicit for him was as good as his word,
and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him con<U+017F>iderably. However, <U+017F>eeing that
do whatever he could, and his friend too, the affair
went on very <U+017F>lowly, he began to be <U+017F>ick of the Town,
and very impatient; <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t, being overcome
with a violent de<U+017F>ire to return into the Country again,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57806:203"/>
and live in quiet, he offer'd the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
two hundred Pi<U+017F>toles to make an end of it. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
who <U+017F>aw the <U+017F>tream run again<U+017F>t him in the Court,
and that the King, who every year took the field,
was now preparing to form a Camp, whether
'twas very likely he <U+017F>hould be oblig'd to go, was
overjoy'd at the Propo<U+017F>al; e<U+017F>pecially for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <U+017F>o much ready Money too, which he had no
<U+017F>mall occa<U+017F>ion for.</p>
            <p>My Lodgings were in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germain.</hi> In
the morning it was my con<U+017F>tant employment to vi<U+017F>it
my friends, and after Dinner to divert my <U+017F>elf at play;
for tho I knew well enough, that Gaming is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Exerci<U+017F>e, yet being too old for the Ladies, there
was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>omething to pa<U+017F>s away the
time. One day a friend of mine carry'd me to a famous
Gaming Hou<U+017F>e, which was not far from my Lodging,
at the little <hi>Hotel deCrequi.</hi> A dangerous place it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but e<U+017F>pecially for young folks, who have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
experience in the world. In <U+017F>hort, 'twas a meer
publick cheat, and I wonder'd that in <U+017F>o orderly a City
as <hi>Paris,</hi> the Government did not take notice of it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
and above all, I admir'd the Duke <hi>de Crequi,</hi> under
who<U+017F>e name they kept it, and who had had a thou<U+017F>and
complaints made to him of it, <U+017F>hould never take any
notice of it. But he left the management to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his Guards, who<U+017F>e Fees it was<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> being <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
covetous, that tho he has a prodigious E<U+017F>tate,
and no Children to leave it to but an only Daughter;
yet rather than put him<U+017F>elf to any charge, he lets
them do what they will, not regarding the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
effect, <U+017F>o he can but <U+017F>ave the Sallaries of his
two wicked Officers. One of whom methinks he <U+017F>hould
not be fond to retain, con<U+017F>idering how little it is for his
credit to keep <U+017F>uch a fellow in his Hou<U+017F>e, who was
before only a <U+017F>orry Exempt, and us'd to be hir'd to
guard Malefactors to the place of Execution, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he <U+017F>hould have been carry'd him<U+017F>elf long before,
if he had had his due. For the other I can't <U+017F>ay
much, being of another <U+017F>ort, having never <U+017F>aw any
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57806:204"/>
great harm by him. He was a Cadet too, <U+017F>o it was more
pardonable for him to get Money by any method, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Ma<U+017F>ter practice it before him.</p>
            <p>Under the conduct of the<U+017F>e two Gentlemen, this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Tricks and Shams was manag'd, and the very
fir<U+017F>t day I went among them I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o many hanging
countenances, that I was afraid, in<U+017F>tead of bringing
me into a Hou<U+017F>e, he had brought me into a Wood to
be robb'd; my friend perceiving my concern told me,
the Rogues that us'd to frequent that place were fled;
for <U+017F>ome of the gang having been taken and <U+017F>everely
puni<U+017F>h'd but a little before, had frighted away the re<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>o I needed not be apprehen<U+017F>ive of any thing. Indeed
there had been two of them taken, who having lo<U+017F>t
all their Money, had took to the High-way, and
were broken upon the Wheel; one was the Count
<hi>de la Salle,</hi> and the other the Chevalier <hi>De<U+017F>pine,</hi> but
their Titles could not <U+017F>ave them. All this however
did not give me much <U+017F>atisfaction, no more than the
Guards of Mon<U+017F>. <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who were plac'd in the
Anti-Chamber, but I went with a great deal of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion
into the place where the Scene lay, and where my
friend pre<U+017F>enting me to the Directors as a man very fit
to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them in their affairs, I was complimented at a
great rate. However, all this did not plea<U+017F>e me,
and I believe, if it had been po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I had immediately
came out again, if I had not <U+017F>een the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi>
a Gentleman of <hi>Burgogndy,</hi> who was at play in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Room with one whom I did not know. I
knew him to be a very hone<U+017F>t Gentleman, and a Man
of a good E<U+017F>tate; <U+017F>o I went to <U+017F>eat my <U+017F>elf by him, but
there being no room, I was forc'd to <U+017F>it by him that plaid
with him. They were playing at <hi>Picquet,</hi> for no <U+017F>ort
of Game came ami<U+017F>s to them here, tho that which the
Directors lik'd be<U+017F>t was <hi>Lan<U+017F>quenet,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they got
mo<U+017F>t by it; but now they were at <hi>Picquet.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who plaid with the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> was one
of tho<U+017F>e Game<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, who have no better fortune than
others in an hone<U+017F>t way; but I am per<U+017F>waded he was
the fine<U+017F>t fellow in the world at cheating. I mu<U+017F>t have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57806:204"/>
been very incredulous indeed if I had not been of that
opinion, <U+017F>eeing him, as I did, perform a notable piece
of dexterity. I believe he was not very well pleas'd
with my <U+017F>itting <U+017F>o near him, which was the rea<U+017F>on,
that for <U+017F>ome time he dur<U+017F>t not play any of his tricks;
but fortune inclining to the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> made
him venture at all hazards, and <U+017F>eeing he was like to
lo<U+017F>e perhaps all he had in the world, he car'd not what
pranks he plaid to recover him<U+017F>elf. They were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now for the Set, the two games before he lo<U+017F>t; the
<U+017F>take I believe might be about four and twenty Pi<U+017F>toles,
and the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> who was elde<U+017F>t hand, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but fourteen of being up, and he nine. After di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding,
the Count <hi>de Rouvray</hi> found that he had got
the <hi>point,</hi> which being but five to him, he cou'd not
reckon up; the other cou'd, if he had three Queens in
his hand, but he had laid out one, yet perceiving the
game was lo<U+017F>t if the Count <hi>de Rouvray</hi> Dealt, who<U+017F>e
turn it was, he made bold to reckon them. I thought
this had been only a mi<U+017F>take, and was ju<U+017F>t a going to
tell him of it; but as I was ob<U+017F>erving very attentively
how this Comedy would end, a Ma<U+017F>ter Cheat who
lookt on, as well as I, and was of the gang, taking up
the Card that was laid out, and fooling with it in his
hand, at la<U+017F>t let it drop down. The other, in a great
deal of ha<U+017F>te, as if he had been afraid the Count <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>ee it, took it up, which was the Card he wanted, and
clapt down another in the room of it. He did this
with that <U+017F>light of hand, that I never was more <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
in my Life than I was to <U+017F>ee that Card in his
hand, which I had <U+017F>een him lay out. The name of one
of the<U+017F>e two Sparks was <hi>Guetart,</hi> and the other was
call'd the Chevalier <hi>de Lignerac,</hi> two famous Sharpers.
Tho I think all their Tricks made them never a jot the
richer; for the fir<U+017F>t, who had a good E<U+017F>tate of his own,
had <U+017F>pent it every Groat, tho he was not above five
and thirty; and the other, after having plaid his
Pranks with every body he could, was forc'd to <U+017F>culk
about in priviledg'd places, and Gentlemens hou<U+017F>es for
protection, for fear of a Goal.</p>

Any body may gue<U+017F>s what opinion I had of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t
place. The next morning, before I was up, came
a Man to my Lodgings, one I had never <U+017F>een in my
Life; but he told me he had <U+017F>een me in <U+017F>uch a place,
and believing me to be a Game<U+017F>ter, he waited on me to
acquaint me who under<U+017F>tood things, and who did
not: You mu<U+017F>t note, he meant by tho<U+017F>e that under<U+017F>tood
things, tho<U+017F>e that could cheat and trick, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd
them; and tho<U+017F>e who he term'd ignorant, were
<U+017F>uch as play'd fairly. He told me, if I pleas'd, he
would teach me all their Tricks; not that he thought
I would practice them, but that I might know them,
and prevent being put upon my <U+017F>elf. I thankt him for
his offer; and tho I did not think fit to make u<U+017F>e of
him, yet like the Lawyers, who expect their Fees tho
they do no bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, he askt me for <U+017F>omething, but
very mode<U+017F>tly truly; telling me he was a Gentleman,
that he did not u<U+017F>e to be in the condition he was now
in, and hop'd it would be <U+017F>oon otherwi<U+017F>e; and if I
would lend him but four Pi<U+017F>toles, he promis'd me on
the word of a Man of Honour to repay me. This being at
my own Lodgings, and not at <hi>L' Hotel de Crequi,</hi> I
thought I might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>tand this <U+017F>ort of an attack; but
he was <U+017F>o importunate, that whatever I could <U+017F>ay to
the point, I could not get off from him, tho I <U+017F>cap'd
cheaper than four Pi<U+017F>toles too; for <U+017F>eeing it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to bring me up <U+017F>o high he fell to three, and then to
two, and one, and at la<U+017F>t to half a Crown, which I
was glad to give away to be rid of him. He gave me
a thou<U+017F>and thanks; and was hardly gone out of doors,
but in comes another figure, who I knew no better
than I did the la<U+017F>t; and his Compliment was of
another <U+017F>ort, he came to invite me to Dinner; and
his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s it <U+017F>eems was, when he had lo<U+017F>t all
his own Money, to get people together to make a
Company at <hi>Lan<U+017F>quenet.</hi> Then he began to tell me
the Hi<U+017F>tory of his good fortune at play; that as mean
a condition as I <U+017F>aw him in now, he had kept his Coach
and Hor<U+017F>es, with four Footmen, and <U+017F>uch an Equipage,
as no Amba<U+017F><U+017F>ador had a greater; that he us'd to wear a
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57806:205"/>
different Suit of Cloaths every day, with his Sword-hilt
and Buttons of Ma<U+017F><U+017F>y Gold; and he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion
but to live to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf in the <U+017F>ame condition
again, for all this.</p>
            <p>After he had run on at this rate a while, he would
needs <U+017F>how me, what an Arti<U+017F>t he was at play; and
pulling a Pack of Cards out of his Pocket, he <U+017F>how'd
me the Tricks and Slights with which they u<U+017F>e to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their Game. I expected however, that the bottom
of all this would be only the <U+017F>ame with the t'other, a
Petition for <U+017F>ome Money; but it <U+017F>eems I had to do
with one now, that was not quite <U+017F>o low and nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
as the la<U+017F>t; and who<U+017F>e place it <U+017F>eems did bring
him in <U+017F>omething, for he had a quarter part of the
Profit of the Box Charges deducted; the other three
parts being divided between <hi>Dugas,</hi> Lieutenant of the
Guards to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Crequi; Du Four,</hi> an En<U+017F>ign of
the <U+017F>ame Guards; and one <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> a fellow that
was once in great credit for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of Gaming-Hou<U+017F>es:
But the King had prohibited him from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any <U+017F>uch Hou<U+017F>e any more, ever <U+017F>ince Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi>
a Councellor of the Parliament, and one that lo<U+017F>t
all his E<U+017F>tate at gaming, was kill'd at his Hou<U+017F>e. This
<hi>Bragalogne</hi> had in his time, all the per<U+017F>ons of quality in
the Court came to him; and the other hoping, that he
having <U+017F>uch a great acquaintance, would bring a great
deal of company to their Hou<U+017F>e, took him into their
Partner<U+017F>hip: But the Hou<U+017F>e was grown <U+017F>o infamous,
that people of quality would not come near it; and
be<U+017F>ides he had quite lo<U+017F>t his credit too, particularly in
a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s about the Abbot <hi>de Lignerac,</hi> Brother to the
<hi>Chevalier</hi> I mention'd before. This Abbot had a mind
to counterfeit a little hone<U+017F>ty, tho he lov'd it no better
than his Brother; and being much in the <U+017F>ame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances,
had the good Fortune, or rather the Art, to win
four or five hundred thou<U+017F>and Francs; for he under<U+017F>tood
things (to u<U+017F>e the Term my Gentleman taught me.)
At la<U+017F>t, having got a great deal of Money among
them, but not <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>tly but he was afraid he <U+017F>hould
be oblig'd to make re<U+017F>titution; meeting therefore one
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57806:206"/>
day with a Gentleman who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Erouard,</hi> of whom
he had got <U+017F>even or eight hundred Pi<U+017F>toles; he told him,
that if he would relea<U+017F>e him for three<U+017F>core Pi<U+017F>toles, of
what he might owe him, he would give him them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently.
<hi>Erouard,</hi> taking this for raillery, and that he
only jeer'd him, becau<U+017F>e he had won his Money, told
him, he demanded nothing of him, nor knew of any
thing he ow'd him. Upon which the Abbot pretending
to inform him, told him, that he had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>cruple
upon his mind about it; that he had taken the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his Age, which made him remi<U+017F>s, and not mind
his Play as he ought to have done; which made him
fear, that the Money he had won of him, when they
play'd together at <hi>Bregalogne</hi>'s, was not hone<U+017F>tly gain'd;
that 'tis true many people would not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous,
but for his part, rather than have any thing of that
kind lye upon his con<U+017F>cience, he cho<U+017F>e to make him
the re<U+017F>titution he had offer'd. <hi>Erouard,</hi> as old as he
was, yet under<U+017F>tood the meaning of all this, and <U+017F>eeing
it was better to have 60 Pi<U+017F>toles of his Money than
nothing, readily took them, and gave him a di<U+017F>charge.
The Abbot telling the Money out, told him al<U+017F>o, that
he <U+017F>hould go to <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> and if he manag'd him
rightly, he would make him refund too; that he had
always gone halves when they play'd together, and his
own guilt would make him comply. But it would
not take with <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> who was us'd to win, but
not to return it again; he told him plainly, the
Abbot <hi>de Lignerac</hi> might well make him <U+017F>uch a Pre<U+017F>ent,
becau<U+017F>e he had a very good E<U+017F>tate; but as for him, his
circum<U+017F>tances were not <U+017F>o well, and in <U+017F>hort, he had
neither Inclination nor Ability.</p>
            <p>Thus the<U+017F>e Gentlemen, not content to get all the
Game<U+017F>ters Money at the years end, by their Impo<U+017F>ition
and Tax upon Play, which they call'd by the name of
<hi>de Ronde;</hi> endeavour'd al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>ecure it by other means
more <U+017F>hort and expeditious. In fine, he that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
me thither the day before, coming in ju<U+017F>t as the
Man invited me to Dinner, they got me away in <U+017F>pight
of my re<U+017F>olution; where I <U+017F>aw Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Four</hi> was
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57806:206"/>
not far behind <hi>Bragalogne:</hi> he was at play with a young
Coxcomb newly come from Sea, and had <U+017F>et a Rogue
to look on his game, and give him notice by <U+017F>igns
what Cards he had in his hand. Every body <U+017F>aw it, as
well as I, and talkt of it publickly, the thing was <U+017F>o
plain. I askt them what this Cully's Name was, and
<U+017F>omebody telling me it was the Chevalier <hi>de Li<U+017F><U+017F>ac,</hi> I
enquir'd whence he came, for I remembred there was
once a Man of that Name that did me a particular
kindne<U+017F>s; they told me he was of the County of <hi>Foix,</hi>
and the party I meant being of tho<U+017F>e parts, I imagin'd
he might be of that Family; and being concern'd to
<U+017F>ee him there, I told him, if he would take my advice I
would have him play no more. <hi>Du Four</hi> was in <U+017F>ome
confu<U+017F>ion at my <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, imagining I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that I
had perceiv'd <U+017F>omething. However <hi>Li<U+017F><U+017F>ac</hi> would not
leave off; but <hi>du Four</hi> left off him<U+017F>elf, for fear, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I <U+017F>hould tell at la<U+017F>t what I had ob<U+017F>erv'd. In
<U+017F>hort, I took Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Li<U+017F><U+017F>ac</hi> a<U+017F>ide, and telling him
who I was, I convinc'd him how much he had been
abus'd; which put him into <U+017F>uch a rage as made him
almo<U+017F>t mad; for he not only ventur'd to quarrel with
him in the place, which was indeed a madne<U+017F>s, he
being in the mid<U+017F>t of his Guards and of his Gang, but
dar'd him to his very Teeth when he came out. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
there was no mi<U+017F>chief done then, becau<U+017F>e of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
being by, and I took him away with me, and told
him, that if he was well advis'd, he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>et
his foot within that Cut-throat place again; that as
for me, I'd tell him plainly, I would be content to be
hang'd if ever they catcht me there again, tho I
had come off without lo<U+017F>ing my Money, and I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to all this, for fear of making Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de

thus dealt with by a Ra<U+017F>cal, yet he was forc'd to
take it patiently. If this was a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible affront, it
prov'd however a good fortune to him, <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>av'd
his Money, which he had certainly lo<U+017F>t if he had <U+017F>tay'd,
for immediately after he had made up his Company,
he was oblig'd to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> and <U+017F>o avoided a ruine
which a great many young Gentlemen fell into. I
might be excus'd to <U+017F>eek in this manner to pa<U+017F>s away
the time, for 'tis the misfortune of men of my profe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
to have a great many idle hours lye upon our
hands; and tho I took all the ways I could to divert
my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ometimes reading, otherwhile gaming, and
<U+017F>ometimes walking abroad, yet putting all together,
I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge no condition is <U+017F>o unhappy as a
Gentleman's; if I had been religiou<U+017F>ly inclin'd it had
been a great happine<U+017F>s to me, having <U+017F>o much lei<U+017F>ure
for reflection; but indeed I had no manner of motion
that way, a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition conformable to the <U+017F>trictne<U+017F>s of
Religion is not given to every body, and I was one to
whom it was deny'd. I had a Relation of mine who
was marry'd, about 12 or 15 Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> on
<hi>Normandy</hi> <U+017F>ide, who had many times invited me to her
Hou<U+017F>e, and now I <U+017F>ent her word, if <U+017F>he would <U+017F>end her
Coach <U+017F>uch a day for me, as far as <hi>Pontoi<U+017F>e,</hi> I would
wait on her: She not only <U+017F>ent her Coach, as I de<U+017F>ir'd,
but came her <U+017F>elf too; and being arriv'd at the <hi>Great
Hart</hi> Inn pretty early, <U+017F>he walk'd out of the Town a
little, to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>he could meet the <hi>Roan</hi> Stage Coach, by
which I <U+017F>ent her word I <U+017F>hould come down. She was
no hand<U+017F>ome Woman, <U+017F>he would have been to blame
to pretend to it; but however, a good air which <U+017F>he
had, and the care <U+017F>he took to <U+017F>et her<U+017F>elf off, made her
well e<U+017F>teem'd, and <U+017F>everal Admirers <U+017F>he had. Among
the re<U+017F>t two Gentlemen, both Strangers to her, tho
they were both of that County, taking her for another
<U+017F>ort of Lady than <U+017F>he was, made their Court to her,
and behav'd them<U+017F>elves civilly enough at fir<U+017F>t; <U+017F>he did
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57806:207"/>
not refu<U+017F>e them her company. Her freedom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation
confirm'd them in their opinion of her; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, while <U+017F>he was at the Inn, they re<U+017F>olv'd to
pu<U+017F>h on the matter. If one may believe her<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he only
intended to banter them, and every body el<U+017F>e on that
account. However, <U+017F>he brought her<U+017F>elf into a broil
with them: For refu<U+017F>ing to con<U+017F>ent, and they pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
upon her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood upon her guard, and put her<U+017F>elf into a
po<U+017F>ture of defence, and the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was carry'd <U+017F>o high,
that her Corne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re off her head, and all the
Hou<U+017F>e was in an uproar about it, ju<U+017F>t when I came in.
A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I got out of the Coach, and had enquir'd
what the matter was, I was very much <U+017F>urpriz'd; and
running up to her Chamber, I found her upon the Bed,
and telling her how much I was concern'd at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
askt her, if <U+017F>he had order'd any cour<U+017F>e to be
taken with the per<U+017F>ons who had offer'd her this affront.
She told me, <U+017F>he had no body to advi<U+017F>e with about it,
or to direct her what was fit to be done, and therefore
<U+017F>he had done nothing at all; but that now I was come,
<U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd me to inform her, what I thought proper
for her to do. I blam'd her for having omitted it, and
telling her <U+017F>he ought to have given notice of it to the
Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice; I went immediately and did it for
her. The young Sparks, who had offer'd this violence
to her, found them<U+017F>elves in an ill ca<U+017F>e, when they <U+017F>aw
what mea<U+017F>ures we were going to take with them; and
e<U+017F>pecially perceiving they had to do with a per<U+017F>on of
quality, who wanted neither Money nor Friends to
pro<U+017F>ecute them; and <U+017F>ome body advis'd them to come
and ask pardon of the Lady; and accordingly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
was <U+017F>ent to know, if that would be accepted; but
I told the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, that would not <U+017F>erve their turn
for an action <U+017F>o notoriou<U+017F>ly foul as this was. 'Tis true,
I took a fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>tep in applying my <U+017F>elf to the ordinary
cour<U+017F>e of Ju<U+017F>tice; I <U+017F>hould rather have made my
Complaint before the Mare<U+017F>chals of <hi>France,</hi> where we
<U+017F>hould have had more ju<U+017F>tice, and been <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>patcht.
But my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion tran<U+017F>ported me <U+017F>o far, that I never
thought of that, till I had begun their proce<U+017F>s a little
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57806:208"/>
too ha<U+017F>tily; not con<U+017F>idering that we were bringing our
<U+017F>elves into a tedious Suit, that we could not
quit when we pleas'd. In <U+017F>hort, our Adver<U+017F>aries
taking advantage of this occa<U+017F>ion, got before us, and
made a Complaint there them<U+017F>elves; and tho they
could pretend nothing in that Court again<U+017F>t a Woman,
yet they <U+017F>o entangled things with their tricks and
turns, that they got an Arre<U+017F>t to <U+017F>top a Judgment
which we had obtain'd again<U+017F>t them in the other
Court.</p>
            <p>The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was then brought before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that Court not being in ha<U+017F>te to end mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this nature, took care to keep this alive, by
bringing up again<U+017F>t this Lady and her Husband, (who
was now made a party) every thing that could be
thought of in all the cour<U+017F>e of their lives, and a great
many invented things that had never been acted, that
they might, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, tire them into an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Gentleman and his Lady had one misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which is but too common in this age, their
Daughter had been a little too free with her Brothers
Tutor, and there was a Child in the ca<U+017F>e; the Father
was <U+017F>o enrag'd at it, that once he had like to have
<U+017F>tabb'd her, and I believe he had done it, if I had not
advis'd him to <U+017F>end her away to the Plantations in the
<hi>We<U+017F>t-Indies,</hi> and give out that <U+017F>he was dead; he lik'd
the propo<U+017F>al well enough, and <U+017F>o it was fir<U+017F>t told
abroad that his Daughter was very <U+017F>ick, and then that
<U+017F>he was dead, and a formal Funeral was made for her;
in the mean time <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ent away in the night to
<hi>Rochelle</hi> to be <U+017F>hipt off: however this could not be
done <U+017F>o privately, but <U+017F>ome whi<U+017F>perings of it got
abroad, and the<U+017F>e people got <U+017F>ome knowledge of it in
general, as that it was but a <U+017F>ham Funeral, upon which
they immediately <U+017F>uppos'd the Girl had been murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and entred a proce<U+017F>s for the di<U+017F>covery, requiring
to have the Coffin taken up again, and open'd in the
pre<U+017F>ence of the Magi<U+017F>trate; which being granted,
<U+017F>trangely perplext my Cou<U+017F>ins, and they try'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
tricks of the Law to avoid bringing an affair upon
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57806:208"/>
the <U+017F>tage <U+017F>o much to their di<U+017F>honour: and truly they
were got among <U+017F>uch a parcel of Lawyers both of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and <hi>Roan,</hi> that no tricks were to be plaid of that
kind, but they could have them done. However, all
<U+017F>ignified nothing, the Coffin was opened, and there
was found a Log of Wood, in<U+017F>tead of a Corps; and
Te<U+017F>tification of this being made, they had now the
Sollicitor General upon their backs, who demanded to
know what they had done with their Daughter. If it
was a Mortification to have the whole <U+017F>tory of this
brought before the Parliament, which the adver<U+017F>e
Lawyers did not fail to do with all the aggravations
they could, 'twas wor<U+017F>e to them to find out a way
how to give an account of the Girl her<U+017F>elf. For it
<U+017F>eems, in<U+017F>tead of going to the <hi>We<U+017F>t Indies,</hi> as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother thought <U+017F>he had done, truly <U+017F>he had
got another fellow, that falling in love with her,
had procured her liberty, on conditions much like
what <U+017F>he had formerly granted the Tutor. 'Twas a
hard Chapter to tell this to a Court of Ju<U+017F>tice, and
yet harder to prove it, if it was not believed. In
<U+017F>hort, the Court was not at all <U+017F>atisfy'd with it, but
they were order'd to produce the Young Woman, or to
an<U+017F>wer for her; at which, knowing not what either to
do, or <U+017F>ay, they <U+017F>tood as if they had been amaz'd;
which the Court taking as an effect of guilt, order'd
them both to be taken up, and put into the <hi>Conciergeric.</hi>
I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly afflicted when I heard this news, and the
more, becau<U+017F>e I was fooli<U+017F>hly the occa<U+017F>ion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
this unhappy proce<U+017F>s, and thinking my <U+017F>elf
obliged, whatever it co<U+017F>t me, to relieve them in this
di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, I enquir'd, as privately as I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, of
a certain <U+017F>ort of Women, who<U+017F>e Employment is not
very hone<U+017F>t, and which you may gue<U+017F>s at, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e,
without naming. I askt them, I <U+017F>ay, if they had not
among their Virgins, <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch a young Lady,
de<U+017F>cribing her as well as I could; the great reward I
promis'd them, made them be<U+017F>tir them<U+017F>elves a little
for the di<U+017F>covery: For indeed, I did not know who
el<U+017F>e to apply my <U+017F>elf to; imagining, and that as I
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:57806:209"/>
thought not without rea<U+017F>on, that a young Girl, ca<U+017F>t
off by her Father and Mother, and who had already
been that way given, would pre<U+017F>ently apply her<U+017F>elf
to <U+017F>uch people as tho<U+017F>e: tho 'twas really a hard ca<U+017F>e,
that any per<U+017F>on of quality <U+017F>hould be forc'd to <U+017F>uch a
<U+017F>earch, and that their misfortunes <U+017F>hould oblige them
to <U+017F>ave their Lives by the expo<U+017F>ing the di<U+017F>honour of
their Family upon Record. In the mean time, the<U+017F>e
good Women, taking no notice on what account it
was, procur'd me the <U+017F>ight of a great number of young
Ladies. I had always heard indeed, that <hi>Paris</hi> was full
of <U+017F>uch people, but I never thought it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible there
could be <U+017F>o many of them. It took me up at lea<U+017F>t a
month to vi<U+017F>it all the<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>es, and there was never le<U+017F>s
than ten or twelve at a place, and yet among them all
I could not find out her I wanted; but all I could learn
of her was, that <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>een at a certain Tire-womans
call'd <hi>La Marchand;</hi> that a Gentleman being
in love with her, had taken her a private Lodging, and
kept her, but no body could tell me who this man was,
nor where he liv'd; <U+017F>o that, in <U+017F>hort, one had as good
look a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, as the Proverb <U+017F>ays,
as to expect to find them out in <U+017F>uch a large place as
<hi>Paris:</hi> I put an end to my <U+017F>earch. However, <U+017F>ince I
knew this part of the <U+017F>tory was true, both by <U+017F>ome
circum<U+017F>tances, as al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>cover'd her<U+017F>elf to
a friend, who had told us of it. The Advocates, to
defer the Proceedings again<U+017F>t my Kin<U+017F>man and his
Wife, thought it proper to have her heard in Court, for
the Judges could not but know, that <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons as
we would not come to a di<U+017F>covery of that nature, if
there was nothing at all in it; but this Womans Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
becau<U+017F>e of her Infamy, not being allow'd for
lawful Witne<U+017F>s, all my labour was lo<U+017F>t, and I was
forc'd to take new mea<U+017F>ures.</p>
            <p>Our Adver<U+017F>aries triumpht at all this, and carry'd it
<U+017F>o in<U+017F>olently, that had we liv'd in other times, as old
as I was, I am <U+017F>ure I had handled them after another
manner. But the King, among a multitude of great
actions, like him<U+017F>elf, has done nothing <U+017F>o great, or <U+017F>o
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57806:209"/>
much to his glory, as the ab<U+017F>olute prohibiting of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;
which is <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere on that point, that he is certain
to ruine him<U+017F>elf that attempts it; and yet I had much
ado to refrain from it, when I <U+017F>aw them at the Palace;
but I could not pa<U+017F>s by them, without jo<U+017F>tling them,
tho they did not take notice of it; and that which
madded me wor<U+017F>t was, that they were a parcel of Ra<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
we had to do with. In the mean time nothing was
done, and the Judges told me plainly, that unle<U+017F>s we
could get <U+017F>ome better proofs, that the young Lady was
alive, her Father and Mother both was in great danger.
Upon this I went to the Dean of the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>du Chatelet,</hi> and pray'd them to publi<U+017F>h an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ement
to all their Officers, that when people came
to regi<U+017F>ter Lodgings and Chambers to lett, they <U+017F>hould
examine the Landlords and Landladies, whether they
had not <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on came to lodge with them; and I
promis'd a hundred Pi<U+017F>toles to whoever <U+017F>hould make
the di<U+017F>covery. This made them do their be<U+017F>t, and by
this means I came to under<U+017F>tand, that a young Lady,
<U+017F>omething like what I had de<U+017F>crib'd, lodg'd in <hi>la Rue
Calande,</hi> near <hi>la Place Maubert;</hi> and immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither and pretending to take Lodgings, I was
admitted up <U+017F>tairs, and there I found the party I lookt
for, but in <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>erable condition, that had I not
<U+017F>een her a great many times, it had been impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
have known her.</p>
            <p>She was <U+017F>urpriz'd at the <U+017F>ight of me, e<U+017F>pecially when
calling her by her name, I began to reproach her with
what <U+017F>he had done; and fancying <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily get
away from <U+017F>uch an old fellow as I was, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to
cry, but watcht an opportunity to give me the <U+017F>lip,
and get out of the door; but I had my Eyes about me,
and lookt <U+017F>o narrowly to her, as <U+017F>he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
do it; and having thus perceiv'd her de<U+017F>ign, I <U+017F>taid
with her till I had more company; and her Father and
Mother having got an Order for me to lay her fa<U+017F>t, if I
<U+017F>hould have the good fortune to find her; I made u<U+017F>e
of that Warrant, and carry'd her to the <hi>Madelonet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi>
a Pri<U+017F>on appointed for Women of ill fame. It was a
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57806:210"/>
<U+017F>ingular good fortune to us all, the finding out this
young Jilt, her Father and Mother being upon the very
point of being condemn'd; and I know not what
might have come of it, if this di<U+017F>covery had not been
made. But now their Daughter<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> being produc'd, all
the projects their Adver<U+017F>aries laid to ruin them were
vain, and their mea<U+017F>ures broken. They would have
<U+017F>till procur'd them to be detain'd, upon pretence of
having offer'd an abu<U+017F>e to the Ceremonies of the
Church, in making a <U+017F>olemn Burial for a Log of Wood,
and having the u<U+017F>ual Prayer <U+017F>aid over it, as if it had
been a Chri<U+017F>tian. In <U+017F>hort, they were fain to make
friends to get rid of this Accu<U+017F>ation; and yet they
could not come off without a Fine neither. However,
the Judges could not but <U+017F>ee, that all this was Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Malice; and tho they could not avoid the
Sentence which was pa<U+017F>t, yet a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as that was over,
they took into con<U+017F>ideration the Ca<U+017F>e of my Kin<U+017F>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and began to think of doing her <U+017F>ome Ju<U+017F>tice. In
<U+017F>hort, they condemn'd the two fellows, fir<U+017F>t to pay all
the charges of the Proce<U+017F>s, which was very con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and afterwards to be bani<U+017F>ht, which was a great
di<U+017F>honour to their Families, who made <U+017F>ome figure in
the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madame</hi> ... were <U+017F>atisfied with <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t
a Decree; and at their return home were congratulated
by their Friends and Relations upon the happy i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of
this trouble<U+017F>ome affair. They would needs have my
company down with them into the Country; where
they endeavour'd by the kinde<U+017F>t Treatment in the
world to make me amends, for all the pains I had
taken upon their account. <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> ... knowing that I
lov'd Hawking pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, <U+017F>hew'd me all the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible of that <U+017F>ott; <U+017F>o that in my life, I never pa<U+017F>t
any time more plea<U+017F>antly than I did a fortnight there:
and <U+017F>o obliging they were, that when I offer'd to take
my leave, they would by no means <U+017F>uffer me to <U+017F>tir. I
had no great bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>o was ea<U+017F>ily overcome
by their per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions. In <U+017F>hort, I continu'd there two
months longer; not that at fir<U+017F>t I had any thoughts of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57806:210"/>
<U+017F>taying, but was detain'd by a particular occa<U+017F>ion;
which was, that in my Doting Age I had like to have
committed a folly, from which all the re<U+017F>t of my days
I had believ'd my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecure enough. About five or <U+017F>ix
leagues from thence liv'd a young Lady, the Charms
of who<U+017F>e Beauty and Wit it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t,
who coming to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi> ... I <U+017F>aw, and
from the fir<U+017F>t moment felt my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly toucht,
that I could not have been more at five and twenty.
The two days <U+017F>he <U+017F>taid there, I pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ighing at her feet;
and <U+017F>he (who had little fortune of her own, and judg'd
of mine by the figure I made) treated me in <U+017F>uch a
manner, as gave me no cau<U+017F>e to de<U+017F>pair. We are all
naturally apt to flatter our <U+017F>elves: I had my <U+017F>hare of
this vanity, when I thought one of my years, gay and
vigorous enough to in<U+017F>pire Love in <U+017F>o young and
charming a Creature. I had promis'd to wait on her
in a few days, but before <U+017F>he could well be got half way
home, I was preparing to make my vi<U+017F>it. <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi>
and <hi>Madam</hi> ... rally'd me very heartily upon this; but
I, who could hearken to nothing but my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, took
Hor<U+017F>e immediately, and tho I engag'd not to <U+017F>tay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two days at farthe<U+017F>t, yet I <U+017F>taid there a fortnight:
And then return'd <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported, or rather <U+017F>o damn'd
fooli<U+017F>hly in Love, that when I but reflect on it now, it
puts me into extream confu<U+017F>ion. <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
... who knew nothing of my circum<U+017F>tances, but
imagin'd, becau<U+017F>e I had been formerly pretty well at
Court, that I mu<U+017F>t haye laid up <U+017F>omething con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
told me, that I ought to marry this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
and make her fortune; that <U+017F>he was a
per<U+017F>on of condition, and of great vertue; and it would
be much better to leave her what I had, than leave it
to tho<U+017F>e whom perhaps I did not care for; that as to
matter of E<U+017F>tate, I ought not to con<U+017F>ider it, at my
Age, when I was not likely to have many Children;
and the few I might have would be no great charge to
me, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>hould never live to <U+017F>ee 'em grown up. If
they had known all, they had not needed to have us'd
the<U+017F>e arguments with me, for I had before hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57806:211"/>
to gratify my inclinations at any rate; and tho
I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that marrying a Woman with my <U+017F>mall
fortune, was a certain way to bring her to mi<U+017F>ery;
yet all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations were not powerful enough
to reduce me to rea<U+017F>on. The only thing then that
<U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>tick with me was my Age, which I objected;
but they told me, I ought not to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon that,
<U+017F>ince I did not look to be above Forty; and <U+017F>o, in <U+017F>hort,
if I were di<U+017F>pos'd to it, they would <U+017F>erve me in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Match about. I made 'em no an<U+017F>wer; but
two or three days after, going to vi<U+017F>it the Lady again,
I propos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it to her my <U+017F>elf, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her, at the <U+017F>ame
time, that I would deal ingenuou<U+017F>ly with her. I told
her, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s it was my own fault I was not
richer, <U+017F>ince I had been a very bad Husband, and had
cho<U+017F>e to make other peoples fortune rather than my
own; that I had a Mother-in-law who had ruin'd me
by reviving the old Debts of the Family, and laying
her claim to them; by which means it happen'd, that
I could make an Offer of no great matter, when I
offer'd her my <U+017F>elf: That what I had now was an
Annuity for Life out of the Bank of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which had
been formerly a thou<U+017F>and Crowns a year, but was now
reduc'd to half of it. This Income, I told her, with
about 14 or 15 thou<U+017F>and Livres, which I had put into
the hands of <U+017F>ome particular friends, was my whole
E<U+017F>tate; and it was for her to con<U+017F>ider, whither <U+017F>he
would accept of a Man, who if he had 20 thou<U+017F>and a
year, lov'd her well enough to lay it all at her feet,
but who<U+017F>e misfortune it was to have a great deal le<U+017F>s.
For all the <U+017F>incerity I pretended to, you may <U+017F>ee; I
told her, I had more than what really I had, <U+017F>ince I
reckon'd into the account, the Money I gave Me<U+017F><U+017F>ieurs
<hi>de Saillant,</hi> and <hi>la Jonche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and purpo<U+017F>es. Yet I did not que<U+017F>tion, but to

               </gap>me off hand<U+017F>omely with her, and at la<U+017F>t to have
<U+017F>atisfy'd her, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have known all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances
of this misfortune. Thus had Love got the
a<U+017F>cendant over my Rea<U+017F>on, and made me act, as if I
had not been my <U+017F>elf.</p>

However, the young Lady lik'd my Propo<U+017F>als;
which compliance of hers <U+017F>o perfectly charm'd me, that
I thought I could never do enough for her. She had
dependance upon none but a Mother, with whom <U+017F>he
could do what <U+017F>he pleas'd, <U+017F>o that our Marriage was
<U+017F>oon concluded on, and the report of it <U+017F>preading
round the Country, we were complimented by all the
People of Quality thereabouts. She, who now began
to look upon me as her Husband, made no <U+017F>cruple to
allow me tho<U+017F>e Liberties that <U+017F>he might do with honour
enough, but which inflam'd and tran<U+017F>ported me <U+017F>o,
that <U+017F>ome things happen'd to me, which good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
oblige me to conceal. This effect, tho I may <U+017F>ay
they had, as to convince her, that I was not <U+017F>o old as
<U+017F>he took me to be; for <U+017F>uch Raptures I was in, that
no Young man, with all his vigour and inclination,
could have expre<U+017F>t more force of nature, or warmth
of imagination, than I did upon <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions. I
mention this to let you <U+017F>ee, that Women do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
declare what they think, for tho <U+017F>he had often
perceiv'd the <U+017F>ame thing, <U+017F>he never took the lea<U+017F>t no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, till one day <U+017F>he happen'd to di<U+017F>cover it, to
the good fortune of us both. We had been at <hi>Ve<U+017F>pers</hi>
together, but her Devotion not <U+017F>atisfy'd with that, <U+017F>he
would oblige me to <U+017F>tay the other <U+017F>ervice that follows
pre<U+017F>ently after. I was content, and when they
came to <U+017F>ing that Hymn, in which there is this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
<hi>Ne polluantur corpora,</hi> <U+017F>he jogg'd me, and at the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of tho<U+017F>e words bid me, that I <U+017F>hould take care I
was not guilty of that frailty any more. I was <U+017F>trangely
<U+017F>urpriz'd to find her <U+017F>o knowing, and askt her who it
was that had <U+017F>o well inform'd her, at which <U+017F>he only
blu<U+017F>ht, and was in an extreme confu<U+017F>ion. The more I
ob<U+017F>erv'd her confu<U+017F>ion, the more I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <U+017F>ome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery
in it; and not caring to have a young Woman too
knowing in tho<U+017F>e matters, e<U+017F>pecially one I de<U+017F>ign'd to
make my Wife, I told her plainly, and in <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too, that I would be <U+017F>atisfy'd how <U+017F>he came <U+017F>o well
in<U+017F>tructed. She told me then, with the greate<U+017F>t inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that being once at a Gentlemans, one

               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:57806:213"/>
that marry'd a Relation of hers, and whom <U+017F>he nam'd;
he came up one morning and caught her in Bed, where
he behav'd him<U+017F>elf with that Indecency, that <U+017F>he could
not but take notice of <U+017F>ome things, to which before
<U+017F>he had been a perfect <U+017F>tranger. This was enough to
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s me, that he lov'd her. He was a man of a very
good E<U+017F>tate, and one to whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>how'd a great deal
of re<U+017F>pect, which <U+017F>till I mi<U+017F>took, and imputed to a
quite different cau<U+017F>e than what <U+017F>he pretended; which
was, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, for fear of ever having an occa<U+017F>ion to
make proof of his genero<U+017F>ity. In fine, I grew jealous
of him as a Rival, or to <U+017F>peak more plainly, I thought
I <U+017F>hould have nothing but his Leavings; for which <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
I mu<U+017F>t humbly ask her pardon, and confe<U+017F>s I
wrong'd her, who<U+017F>e Vertue even exceeded her own
admirable Beauty. The wedding day was agreed on,
and all things provided; when under pretence of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
orders about <U+017F>omething that was to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
I took Hor<U+017F>e and left her, but not without
writing her a long and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Letter, in which
appear'd the conte<U+017F>t of my Love and Jealou<U+017F>y, each by
turns <U+017F>eeming to have got the better in my divided
heart; at la<U+017F>t, I concluded it with a thou<U+017F>and a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
that I <U+017F>hould ever love and honour her, tho I
could not think of her for a Wife. <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
—<U+017F>oon perceiv'd the e<U+017F>trangement, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not from whence it <U+017F>hould proceed, would have
endeavour'd to reconcile us; but be<U+017F>ides, that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment
would not <U+017F>uffer her to hearken to <U+017F>uch a
Propo<U+017F>al, I was too nice to offer it: I de<U+017F>ir'd 'em
therefore, not to give them<U+017F>elves any trouble, in an
affair which I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible would never <U+017F>ucceed. If I
had had to do with <U+017F>ome Women, I <U+017F>hould not have
e<U+017F>cap'd a Proce<U+017F>s for <U+017F>uch an abu<U+017F>e, and without doubt
<U+017F>hould have paid for it; but <U+017F>he carry'd her<U+017F>elf like a
true per<U+017F>on of honour, and not only di<U+017F>daining <U+017F>uch
mean cour<U+017F>es of revenge, but much more to be oblig'd
to me, return'd all the Pre<U+017F>ents I had ever made her,
At fir<U+017F>t, I would by no means take 'em, and told the
per<U+017F>on that brought 'em, that he mu<U+017F>t even carry back
<pb facs="tcp:57806:212"/>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:57806:212"/>
tho<U+017F>e trifles, which were given without condition to
the Woman I once lov'd above the world. Yet would
<U+017F>he not accept of them, tho they were of the value of
2 or 300 Pi<U+017F>toles, but <U+017F>ent them back again with orders
to leave them with <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—if I
<U+017F>hould per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t to refu<U+017F>e them.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this affair, which I <U+017F>hould have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a thou<U+017F>and times that I mi<U+017F>t, if I had an E<U+017F>tate to
have made that Woman happy. But Rea<U+017F>on coming
to the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of my Jealou<U+017F>y, (which my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
might perhaps have conquer'd in time) I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly on the con<U+017F>equences of <U+017F>uch a Marriage,
and the mi<U+017F>erable condition I mu<U+017F>t have left a Wife
and Children in, after my death. Upon all which I
concluded, that it was infinitely the be<U+017F>t as it was, and
that <U+017F>he had e<U+017F>cap'd a misfortune, which it had been a
pity a per<U+017F>on of her merit <U+017F>hould have ever prov'd: I
had no de<U+017F>ign to live all my days at <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieurs</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
—<U+017F>o that now I thought it was high time to
take my leave: But they, who <U+017F>till continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their
civility, would keep me, tho it was by meer force. I
made all the pretences po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and told them, that I
had bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of moment at <hi>Paris,</hi> which I mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily
attend, but all in vain, for they took them all
for Excu<U+017F>es, and caus'd the Saddles of my Hor<U+017F>es to
be laid out of the way; that when I in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted upon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
'em, and was ju<U+017F>t a going, the Saddles were no
where to be found. I perceiv'd the con<U+017F>equence, and
that it would be in vain to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t their kindne<U+017F>s, I told
'em then, I would con<U+017F>ent to <U+017F>tay, if they would fix
the time how long, and after that would not <U+017F>top me.
They nam'd eight days; in which time, as if they had
known what <U+017F>hould happen, or had re<U+017F>olv'd I <U+017F>hould
be at a Wedding, tho not my own, fell out the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of their Daughter; who, after all that I have
mention'd of her, was yet <U+017F>o fortunate, as to meet with
a Husband of a very plentiful fortune, and one who
not only loves, but dotes on her, and admires her.
My time was ju<U+017F>t expiring, when the very day before
I was to go, about 3 or 4 a Clock in the afternoon,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57806:214"/>
               <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—had word brought them,
that there was a <U+017F>trange Gentleman without, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd
to <U+017F>peak with them: The Servants had order to
pray him to walk in; and immediately there enters the
Room a man of a very good Mien, but whom I gue<U+017F>t,
the fir<U+017F>t minute, to be a Foreigner by his Dre<U+017F>s. I was
not mi<U+017F>taken it <U+017F>eems, for he was a <hi>Swi<U+017F>s;</hi> and that
we all knew well enough a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he began to <U+017F>peak.
He told <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in a language half
<hi>French</hi> and half gibberi<U+017F>h, that he was their mo<U+017F>t hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Servant before ever he <U+017F>aw them, and that upon the
account of their good character; but now, <U+017F>ince he
had the honour to ki<U+017F>s their hands, he de<U+017F>ign'd him<U+017F>elf
a far greater honour, if they pleas'd to permit him to
render them his mo<U+017F>t humble Services. This Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was a little <U+017F>train'd I fancy'd, but yet he deliver'd
it with <U+017F>omething of that air, as made me have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion of him, than I had of tho<U+017F>e Countrymen of
his, who took <hi>Biroche</hi>'s Puppets for young Devils;
and for his <U+017F>ake I might have been induc'd to believe,
that there were <U+017F>ome men of. Wit among<U+017F>t the <hi>Swi<U+017F>s,</hi>
as among<U+017F>t other Nations, if it had not been for what

               </gap>d afterwards, which chang'd my mind, or at
lea<U+017F>t made me conclude, that if they had wit, 'twas

               </gap>er their own fa<U+017F>hion, and was not attended with
very much honour. For after the Compliment I told
you of, he de<U+017F>ir'd to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in
private, where he told them, that having <U+017F>een <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoi<U+017F>elle</hi>
their Daughter, he was fallen de<U+017F>perately in
love with her, and that if they would give con<U+017F>ent to
his marrying of her, he <U+017F>hould be extreamly oblig'd to
them; that he might perhaps have done this without
asking them leave, but he knew his duty better than
that came to, tho he was a Foreigner; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the re<U+017F>pect which was due to per<U+017F>ons of their
rank and merit: That he did not ask what they would

which was as good to him as an E<U+017F>tate, and 50000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
be<U+017F>ides he had in ready Money: That tho 'twas true,
he met with her in a place, from whence others might
make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>cruple of taking a Wife; yet he was not
apt to believe ill of any, and <U+017F>o it could never enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his head, that <U+017F>ome reports he had heard of her were
any thing but calumnies: That if there <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>omething true in them, he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible a poor young
Girl was naturally weak, and a failure in one of them
was not minded in his Country; tho a marry'd Woman,
who tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>t the Rules of Honour, was infinitely
blam'd, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had a Husband to <U+017F>upply all her
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities; and a Gallant upon that account was into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
In fine, that there were <U+017F>ome cen<U+017F>orious
people in the world, whom he could not approve, who
becau<U+017F>e a Woman had committed a fault once, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
had been <U+017F>een to u<U+017F>e a little gaiety more than
ordinary in mens company, concluded pre<U+017F>ently, that
<U+017F>he was lewd, and abandon'd; and Lewdne<U+017F>s indeed
was never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>He added a great deal more of this nature, to prove
that what ever a woman did before Marriage <U+017F>igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
nothing, and urg'd it from the practice of <U+017F>everal

and was in favour with the King, who had conferr'd <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Honours upon him; that tho at fir<U+017F>t Madam
<hi>Stoup</hi>'s reputation was a little call'd in que<U+017F>tion, yet
now <U+017F>he was no le<U+017F>s re<U+017F>pected, than if <U+017F>he had never
kept company with any, but Dutche<U+017F><U+017F>es and Ladies of
the fir<U+017F>t quality: That Madam <hi>Renold,</hi> Wife to a
Captain in the <hi>Swi<U+017F>s</hi> Guards, was one of the <U+017F>ame
Character, which <U+017F>he tok care to publi<U+017F>h her <U+017F>elf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Marriage; <U+017F>o that in <U+017F>hort, all things con<U+017F>ider'd,
too much a nicety in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, was ridiculous and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit for Coxcombs to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—could not choo<U+017F>e but be
pleas'd to hear him talk at this rate, and from <U+017F>uch
ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>oning, and <U+017F>o moving a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; thought if he
<U+017F>hould ever have the misfortue to be ca<U+017F>hier'd, that he
was <U+017F>ufficiently qualified with Retorick to make a very
able Pleader. Having no mind therefore to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a
Son-in-law, they were not long in giving their con<U+017F>ent,
and that without any further enquiry who he was,
than upon his own word and honour. This was <U+017F>o
great a favour, that the thanks he return'd 'em, were
enough to convince 'em how highly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible he was
of it. However there aro<U+017F>e a little difficulty; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd
that before all was concluded on, his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
might be brought home, that he might marry her in a
more honourable place than where he found her. But
this they excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as well as they could, looking upon
it as a pretence to leave her on their hands: All had
like to have been ruin'd by this means, till commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
to me this matter; I put 'em in a way
which I was <U+017F>ure would leave 'em no room to doubt
of his <U+017F>incerity. I advis'd 'em then to oblige him to
buy an E<U+017F>tate near them, which if he did, it was a
certain <U+017F>ign he meant 'em no foul play. I thought I
had propos'd an admirable expedient, but was an<U+017F>wer'd,
that they had rather while they liv'd, pay their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Annuity, than be troubled with <U+017F>uch neighbours.
That they had better purcha<U+017F>e near the Count <hi>du
Bourg</hi> 15 or 20 leagues off, who was as <U+017F>candalous as
them<U+017F>elves, and <U+017F>o might be <U+017F>uppos'd to agree well
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57806:215"/>
enough together. When I <U+017F>aw this I told 'em plainly,
they were to blame to trifle in this matter; that there
was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to ri<U+017F>que <U+017F>omething on that occa<U+017F>ion,
and tho their fears <U+017F>hould prove ju<U+017F>t, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was not <U+017F>o great but it might be remedy'd;
for if they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>end for their Daughter home,
and the man <U+017F>hould go back from his word, at wor<U+017F>t,
it was but putting her into her Convent again. And
<U+017F>o I advis'd em upon <U+017F>o groundle<U+017F>s a fear, not to
let <U+017F>lip <U+017F>uch an advantageous offer, which they would
repent of before they dy'd, if they did not embrace:
When indeed at any rate they ought to di<U+017F>charge
them<U+017F>elves of one that was a burden and di<U+017F>grace to
the Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—had not a word to <U+017F>ay
to this, but yeilded to my rea<U+017F>ons, yet told me <U+017F>ince
it was at my per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions, that they re<U+017F>olv'd to make
this Venture, I <U+017F>hould not leave 'em till the affair
was perfectly concluded. I had a great mind, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s,
to <U+017F>ee how our <hi>Swi<U+017F>s</hi> would behave him<U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
all the Kindred, that was to be there upon
this occa<U+017F>ion; and whether the next Morning he
would appear as well <U+017F>atisfy'd with the Bride, as
the day before his Wedding. Upon this account
therefore, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—that
I was at their <U+017F>ervice, and they might command me
what they pleas'd. The next thing then to be done,
was to go to <hi>Paris</hi> and find out the Bride; where
they carry'd me in their own Coach. She, who
was very de<U+017F>irous to get out of her Convent, and was
now more in hopes than ever, had taken a world of
pains to make her<U+017F>elf look fair; <U+017F>o that we found her
very agreeable when we came there. Our Lover di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
us upon the Road with a hundred <U+017F>uch like
<U+017F>tories as he had told <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in
private, which were <U+017F>o very <U+017F>imple, that tho I had
<U+017F>ome little knowledge of his Countrymen, I <U+017F>hould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have believ'd from any bodys mouth but his. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
all this, to give us the la<U+017F>t proof of his <U+017F>incerity,
he de<U+017F>ir'd before we lite any where, to carry him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57806:216"/>
to his Inn, where begging the favour of his
Father and Mother-in-law to go up with him; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a little Box, and took out a Bill for 50000
Livres upon the Bankers, which he <U+017F>hew'd 'em for
their <U+017F>atisfaction: He would needs that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee
it too, and brings it to me in the Coach where I was,
being taken <U+017F>uddenly ill with a pain <U+017F>omething like
the Gout, that I was not able to <U+017F>tir, but which
however the next day I got rid off.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>tay'd eight days at <hi>Paris,</hi> before we return'd to
conclude this Marriage; in which time <hi>Madamoi<U+017F>elle</hi>—receiv'd
a great many pre<U+017F>ents from her Lover. I
could not <U+017F>ufficiently admire her good fortune,
when I con<U+017F>ider'd that an hone<U+017F>ter woman perhaps,
could not have got <U+017F>uch luck in a Husband. He was
not above eight or nine and twenty, and for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the Guards, which he <U+017F>aid indeed, was as
good as an E<U+017F>tate in Land, brought him in one year
with another four and twenty thou<U+017F>and Livres. When
I found he was a man of that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, I began to
pity him: His condition tho I knew was happy,
while he was ignorant, and it came into my head to
do him a piece of <U+017F>ignal <U+017F>ervice. He had repeated a
thou<U+017F>and times how that he <U+017F>hould never have the
wor<U+017F>e opinion of his Wife, for finding her in <U+017F>uch a
a <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious place. To continue him therefore in the<U+017F>e
good <U+017F>entiments, I bethought my <U+017F>elf of the Pomatum
I found in the Lodgings of the Queens Maids of
Honour, which I told you of: I endeavoured all I
could to get <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ort, to make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
of it to his Lady; but as fortune would have it,
when I did not want it, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tumble upon
it, <U+017F>o now I could meet with none when I had <U+017F>o
great an occa<U+017F>ion for it. But <hi>Madamoi<U+017F>elle de</hi>—God
be thanked, had been long enough in too good
a School, to be ignorant of any of tho<U+017F>e kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
if <U+017F>he knew not that <U+017F>ecret, <U+017F>he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with another, that did the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s as well; for
with the white of Eggs as <U+017F>he manag'd them, <U+017F>he
rectify'd all di<U+017F>orders in the ca<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57806:216"/>
the good Husband, that he got up early the
next morning, and came tran<U+017F>ported to tell us, that
it was not without rea<U+017F>on that he could a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us now
of what he had <U+017F>o often told us. We gave him joy of
his good fortune, whil<U+017F>t he was <U+017F>o charm'd with his
Spou<U+017F>e, that he forgot no fondne<U+017F>s or complai<U+017F>ance for
her, which made us all conclude, that if there are <U+017F>uch
things as good Husbands in the world, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
to be found among the <hi>Swi<U+017F>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Country was <U+017F>urpriz'd at this Marriage,
knowing the hi<U+017F>tory of the young Lady, which was
too publick to be conceal'd; and every body, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of congratulating the new marry'd couple, came
to <U+017F>ee them, to ob<U+017F>erve how the Bridegroom lookt,
but they could not perceive, but that a Cuckold looks
ju<U+017F>t like other folks. As for the Bride, <U+017F>he told tho<U+017F>e
with whom <U+017F>he was intimate, that they <U+017F>hould not
wonder her Husband appear'd <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfy'd, for the
people of his Country were not troubled with too
much Wit, and that he was but too happy for a <hi>Swi<U+017F>s;</hi>
many a Woman, I don't que<U+017F>tion, who had as much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
for <U+017F>uch a well-meaning Husband as <U+017F>he had, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
her happine<U+017F>s, e<U+017F>pecially when they <U+017F>aw her ride
in her Coach with an Equipage and every thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>werable.
The young Lady that I was like to have
marry'd was not here all this while, tho <U+017F>he was very
well acquainted in the Family, and I heard <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi>
and <hi>Madam</hi>—often <U+017F>aying, they wondred at it;
but for my part, I did not wonder at it at all, for I
gue<U+017F>t at the rea<U+017F>on of it. Indeed, <U+017F>he hearing, that I
was not only at the Wedding, but that I <U+017F>tay'd <U+017F>till at
the Hou<U+017F>e, had never <U+017F>et her foot within the door,
while I <U+017F>taid there, if a per<U+017F>on of quality of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
had not trepann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d her thither, without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her know where <U+017F>he was: <U+017F>he found the Coach
ju<U+017F>t going in at the Ca<U+017F>tle gate, before <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover'd
at what place <U+017F>he was got, <U+017F>he appear'd very much
di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfy'd; but the Lady making her the be<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>es
<U+017F>he could, <U+017F>he was oblig'd to go in with her. I was
never <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpriz'd in my life as when I <U+017F>aw her, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57806:217"/>
being very well acquainted with her humour, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
gue<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome violence had been offer'd her, and
my old Wounds were not <U+017F>o well cur'd, but that they
began to bleed afre<U+017F>h. I could not ca<U+017F>t my eyes on a
per<U+017F>on I had <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately lov'd, and whom perhaps
I lov'd <U+017F>till, as well as ever I did, without <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in my <U+017F>oul: I wi<U+017F>ht a thou<U+017F>and times I had been a
<hi>Swi<U+017F>s,</hi> that I might not have been <U+017F>o nice; and in <U+017F>hort,
I was <U+017F>o near being overcome, that had any body but
prompted me in the lea<U+017F>t to the thing, I had fallen
under the temptation, and run into all the pa<U+017F>t follies
again; but <U+017F>ome body having <U+017F>o little di<U+017F>cretion, as to
<U+017F>peak of that affair before her, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up, and with a
<U+017F>cornful countenance, giving them a hearty frown,
turn'd out of the room without <U+017F>peaking a word, and
went into the Garden; which being perceiv'd, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
after that offer'd to open their mouths about it,
and <U+017F>he going away the <U+017F>ame day, put a <U+017F>top to the
di<U+017F>order that it procur'd to us both.</p>
            <p>The Wedding being over I return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
like tho<U+017F>e Ladies of plea<U+017F>ure, who never lodge three
months in a place, I took a Lodging now at a Barbers
near <hi>St. Pauls;</hi> my Landlord was a little brisk man,
and fit for any thing, but <U+017F>o lewd a Rake, that he had
not his fellow, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely addicted to gaming,
that he would lo<U+017F>e in an hour more than he could get
in a month. I laid great part of the fault to his
Wife, who in<U+017F>tead of winning him by <U+017F>oft and gentle
methods, did nothing but <U+017F>cold, and rail, and make
<U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e at him, as made him <U+017F>o unea<U+017F>ie at home,
that he would never be there any more than needs
mu<U+017F>t. I knew him fir<U+017F>t when he was Servant
to <hi>Dupin,</hi> who liv'd in the <hi>Rue St. Antoine,</hi> who
was of the <U+017F>ame Trade, and where I had lodg'd at
lea<U+017F>t five or <U+017F>ix years at times; <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons
of quality lodg'd at his Hou<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ame time,
and while I <U+017F>taid there, there happen'd an adventure
which had <U+017F>omething in it <U+017F>urprizing enough, as the
Reader will acknowledge, if he plea<U+017F>e to give credit to
the relation; <hi>Dupin</hi> is <U+017F>till alive, and the people I am
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57806:217"/>
going to tell of, belong to per<U+017F>ons of <U+017F>uch quality, that
their names are not unknown even to <U+017F>trangers, and it
is ea<U+017F>y to know of them, whether the <U+017F>tory I tell be true
or no: However, I <U+017F>hall blame no bodies incredulity,
till they have made <U+017F>ome enquiry, for the thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<U+017F>o extraordinary, that I could hardly believe my
own eyes. There were two men of quality who
were very intimate friends, one was the Marquis <hi>de
Rambouillet,</hi> elde<U+017F>t Brother to the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tau<U+017F>ier,</hi>
and the other was the Marquis <hi>de Preci,</hi> the
elde<U+017F>t Son of the Family of <hi>Nantouillet;</hi> one of whom
had been Chancellor of the Kingdom, and in <U+017F>o great
favour in the Reign of one of our Kings, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
his Ma<U+017F>ter, while he govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'s Cap. The<U+017F>e
two Gentlemen went both into the Army, as all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of quality do in <hi>France</hi> fir<U+017F>t or la<U+017F>t, and falling into
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the world to come, after <U+017F>everal di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es,
by which they di<U+017F>cover'd they did not very
well under<U+017F>tand what they talkt of, they made a <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
promi<U+017F>e to one another, that the fir<U+017F>t that dy'd
of them two, <U+017F>hould come and bring an account of
tho<U+017F>e things he <U+017F>aw to his friend, and having <U+017F>hook
hands upon it, in te<U+017F>timony that they really intended,
and re<U+017F>olv'd if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to perform it, they fell
into other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s <U+017F>erious. Two or three months
pa<U+017F>t after this, without perhaps either of them <U+017F>o much
as thinking on this agreement, and the time for the
opening of the Campaign coming on, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de

he might <U+017F>ay what he would, we were of the <U+017F>ame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and <U+017F>o continu'd till the Po<U+017F>t came in from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
which bringing an account that the Marquis was
really kill'd, we began to look upon one another, and
to think there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>omething in it, e<U+017F>pecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with the particulars he had told us. The
News of this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age being <U+017F>pread about the Town,
folks took it for a made <U+017F>tory; but others, de<U+017F>irous to
know the truth of it, came to the hou<U+017F>e to enquire:
I believe I had a hundred Notes <U+017F>ent to me about it,
and as many Vi<U+017F>iters; for my acquaintance knowing I
lodg'd in the hou<U+017F>e, thought to have a more particular
account of it from me: But for all I could <U+017F>ay, they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57806:218"/>
could hardly be per<U+017F>waded to believe it, and the truth
of it all <U+017F>eem'd to depend upon what the Apparition
had told <hi>Preci</hi> <U+017F>hould befal him, that he <U+017F>hould
be kill'd in the fir<U+017F>t action he was engag'd in;
and <U+017F>o people had their eyes upon that, as the
effectual proof of the <U+017F>tory<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and as a convincing
argument that what we hear from the Pulpit of
tho<U+017F>e things, is not all Prie<U+017F>tcraft, as our Modern
Athei<U+017F>ts would have us believe; which the event <U+017F>oon
confirm'd it. The Civil War being begun, he would
needs go to the Battel of <hi>St. Antoine,</hi> tho his Father
and his Mother begg'd of him as it were on their knees
not to go, being afraid of the Prophe<U+017F>ie the Spectre
had left of him; but he would go, and was kill'd, to
the great regret of all his Relations, who had much
more hopes of his advancing their Family than he who
was to <U+017F>ucceed him, who had marry'd a Wife of a mean
Birth and no Fortune, and one that had none of the
be<U+017F>t Characters be<U+017F>ides. But 'tis the fate of
good Families <U+017F>ometimes to have di<U+017F>honour reflected
on them by <U+017F>ome of the unworthy members, and he is
not the fir<U+017F>t that has plaid the Fool; tho that does not
excu<U+017F>e him.</p>
            <p>But to return to my new Landlord: His Wife ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her complaints to me of his gaming, I made bold,
one time when he was trimming me to tell him of it;
but in<U+017F>tead of giving heed to what I <U+017F>aid, tho I thought
I knew enough of the world to be able to advi<U+017F>e him,
he told me he got as much by it as he lo<U+017F>t; that he
play'd at nothing but Tennis, which was a game he
under<U+017F>tood as well as any body; that he did not drink,
<U+017F>o he might very well allow him<U+017F>elf this diver<U+017F>ion.
I told him this <U+017F>ort of talk was well enough for a man
of ten thou<U+017F>and Livres a year E<U+017F>tate, but for him who
had a Family to maintain, and nothing to live upon
but his Trade, 'twas a very ill cour<U+017F>e of life; that if he
did not lo<U+017F>e his money, yet he always lo<U+017F>t his time
which was not a thing of <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>equence to a man
in his circum<U+017F>tances, to whom diligence in his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
was more proper, and without which he could never
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57806:219"/>
expect to make any thing of it; that what I <U+017F>poke
to him was in good will, and for his benefit, <U+017F>ince

continuing his old trade, his Wife came to me one
day in a <U+017F>ad condition, begging me to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

on her; that her Husband was at play at
an hou<U+017F>e hard by, where he was <U+017F>quandring away
his Money; and if I would be <U+017F>o kind to go to
him, and per<U+017F>wade him to leave off, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ave
him lo<U+017F>ing a great deal of Money. I did not care to
go to <U+017F>uch places, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince I was too old for
tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of diver<U+017F>ions, I had lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

formerly, but I was part it now. However, the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Court, being as it were next door to us, I went
thither as if I had come in by accident; where I <U+017F>aw a
man who play'd <U+017F>o ill, that tho I had not handled a
Racket in twenty year, I dur<U+017F>t have given him odds
and plaid with him. I did then what his Wife de<U+017F>ir'd
me, and he not daring to contradict me, I brought
him home along with me. The next morning he
came to wait on me at my Levee, and when I told him
that I wonder'd how he could have the confidence to
commend his play, when, by what I <U+017F>aw of it, I would
lay him a Wager, as old as I was, if I would give my
<U+017F>elf the trouble, I would beat him. He told me
he would give me fifteen if I dur<U+017F>t venture to play
with him; and having a great mind to let him <U+017F>ee
what a Coxcomb he was, I took him at his word, and
went away immediately in my Gown as I was; but as
I told him, I would not play for a <U+017F>mall Summ, <U+017F>o I
made him car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with him. We play'd at ten Pi<U+017F>toles every eight
games; and I <U+017F>o far ma<U+017F>ter'd him, that I never let
him get but when I pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me at fifteen; but I told him no, I was able enough to
deal with him, and if he would play upon the <U+017F>quare
I'd hold him; he was glad at the offer, and <U+017F>taking
down 20 Pi<U+017F>toles, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

done the others. He was <U+017F>urpriz'd to find him<U+017F>elf in

for thirty Pi<U+017F>toles <U+017F>o quickly; but having <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome
left, he askt me if I would play for the re<U+017F>t, I told
him with all my heart, and I would give him fifteen;
he fancy'd by this I had no mind to go away with his
Money, and being mighty glad to have to do with one
that was <U+017F>o generous, he cut <U+017F>everal Capers for joy, at
which he was more dexterous than at Tennis; but his
joy la<U+017F>ted but a <U+017F>hort while, for I minded my play <U+017F>o
that I might not fateigue my <U+017F>elf, and having beat him
again, I broke him of three<U+017F>core Pi<U+017F>toles, and left him
in the greate<U+017F>t confu<U+017F>ion imaginable.</p>
            <p>He pray'd me to <U+017F>ay nothing to his Wife, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd

had a mind <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have the plea<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>colding at

I added, that I did not de<U+017F>ign to make u<U+017F>e of the
advantage I had got, but had done it to let him <U+017F>ee,
that he was but a Novice at play, and to beat him off
of it; that I would give her the Pi<U+017F>toles, but <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould not <U+017F>peak a word to him of it, till I gave her
leave; <U+017F>he thankt me, as indeed I de<U+017F>erv'd; and yet
the di<U+017F>order the fir<U+017F>t part of my <U+017F>tory put her in, could
not be <U+017F>topt, till <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the effect of my words by the

and told me, that <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ee him reduc'd to the

would take to maintain his Children, of which he had
a great many, now he had thrown away his Money;
and <U+017F>he kept her word <U+017F>o punctually with him, that

upon the old <U+017F>ubject, and the mi<U+017F>ery he was reduc'd to
made him a little more tractable than he was before,
but the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue was but a dull compliment to me, and in
which I had mo<U+017F>t need of <U+017F>chooling; for upon the
whole he de<U+017F>ir'd me to lend him ten Pi<U+017F>toles, and I
like a Fool could not refu<U+017F>e him, having but ju<U+017F>t before
won <U+017F>ixty of him, unle<U+017F>s I would have told him, that
I had given them all to his Wife, which I was not
willing to do; a little while after he came for ten
more, and I being in already, and be<U+017F>ides being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
it was for the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his Family, let him have it
again, for I thought, that having given his Wife all
the Money before, I <U+017F>hould have it again at any time,
when I thought fit to acquaint him with what I had
done. In <U+017F>hort, he got forty <hi>Louis d' Ors</hi> of me at four
<U+017F>everal times, and all I had to <U+017F>how for it was a
Note under his hand. In the mean time, he promis'd
me every day to be wi<U+017F>er for the future; and indeed
he did take up a little, whether 'twas that having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
of me made him di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, becau<U+017F>e he would
not di<U+017F>oblige me, or that the lo<U+017F>s he had met with had
<U+017F>till <U+017F>ome effect upon him; but his Wife found <U+017F>uch a
change in him, that <U+017F>he thankt me for it every day
with a great many acknowledgments of her obligation
to me. At la<U+017F>t, I told her of the Money I had let him
have, letting her know how it was for the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of
their Family, to which <U+017F>he made me no an<U+017F>wer, but
that I was too kind to him.</p>
            <p>'Tis no <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange thing in <hi>Paris</hi> for a man not to

this by accident, and only told my man he would pa<U+017F>te a

pulls out a piece of paper, and goes to work on

I kept to undre<U+017F>s me, and being ju<U+017F>t going into bed, my
man came home; I askt him where he had been, and
why he <U+017F>taid out <U+017F>o late? he askt my pardon, and told
me, that an acquaintance of his had come to invite
him to Supper, and not thinking I would come home

he would take care not to let it be <U+017F>o any more, I <U+017F>aid
little to him; for I ever was an ill Ma<U+017F>ter to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,

that had broke my Window, taking this opportunity,

Chimney, and the re<U+017F>t run away over the tops of the
Hou<U+017F>es; his Ma<U+017F>ter had po<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elf half a <U+017F>core
<U+017F>teps out of his door, to be ready as there <U+017F>hould be
occa<U+017F>ion; but finding his project had fail'd, retreated
into his Chamber, very much di<U+017F>turb'd for fear of his
man, who was got into my Chamber. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I had
wak'd my man, I bid him go to the door, and <U+017F>ee who
it was, for I was <U+017F>o far from apprehending the danger
I was in, that I <U+017F>till thought it was <U+017F>ome of my friends;
my man being got up, open'd the door, and telling
me there was no body there, went back again to bed,
and I went to <U+017F>leep again; as for him, when I had thus
wak'd him, it pleas'd God he could not go to <U+017F>leep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<U+017F>o that when the fellow, who had hid him<U+017F>elf in
the Chamber, attempted to get out again he heard
him, and being frighted, gets under the Bed, and cry'd
out to me to have a care of my <U+017F>elf, for there were
Thieves in the room. This indeed made me afraid,
remembring what had happen'd before I went to <U+017F>leep,
and taking hold of my Sword, which I always had at
hand, I askt him what it was? By this time my man
was got to the Window, and finding it open, <U+017F>py'd
the board that was laid cro<U+017F>s, by which the fellow had
got in: He threw it down into the Court, le<U+017F>t any
more Rogues <U+017F>hould get in there, and come behind
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57806:221"/>
him, and then told me what he had done, and that
for certain the Thieves came in that way, and he was
<U+017F>ure there was <U+017F>ome body in the Chamber <U+017F>till; for
which rea<U+017F>on he de<U+017F>ir'd me to defend the Door, and he
wou'd guard the Window. I leave the Reader to
gue<U+017F>s what condition the fellow was in all this while,
who was in the Chamber; he had made his retreat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
the Chimney again as <U+017F>oftly as 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but that
was of no u<U+017F>e to him but only to hide him a little: I
bid my man cry Thieves, and he, being at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
pre<U+017F>ently gave the alarm to the whole Hou<U+017F>e:
The Rogue, perceiving that he mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be
taken, came out of the Chimney, re<U+017F>olving to be kill'd
rather than to be brought to the light; but as we
made pa<U+017F><U+017F>es with our Swords every way at random,
my man happen'd to give him a wound in the Thigh;
and thinking he had light upon <U+017F>ome body, he call'd to
me to have a care of my <U+017F>elf for he had wounded
<U+017F>ome body he believ'd. The Thief not at all terrify'd,
<U+017F>ought more than before to throw him<U+017F>elf upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and receiv'd another thru<U+017F>t in the body, which
however did not hinder him from clo<U+017F>ing in with my
man, with whom by this time he began to be warmly
engag'd; I was too near them not to know how it was
with them, but dur<U+017F>t not in the dark make u<U+017F>e of my
Sword, not knowing which was which, <U+017F>o that all I
could do was to encourage my man, telling him the
people of the hou<U+017F>e were coming, and we <U+017F>hould have
help immediately: Indeed I heard them up, and the
noi<U+017F>e they heard in my Chamber made them make the
more ha<U+017F>te; however I thought it very long, and my
Valet had a great deal of difficulty to ma<U+017F>ter that
wretch, who fought with the utmo<U+017F>t fury of a man in
de<U+017F>pair; but at la<U+017F>t he eas'd my mind, by telling me he
was <U+017F>ure now he could not e<U+017F>cape him, for he had got
him fa<U+017F>t by the Throat; and indeed he needed not have
told me <U+017F>o, for I could hear him draw his breath as if
he were almo<U+017F>t throttled, which was what he was in a
fair way to be in reality; in the interim, the Barber
and his Wife came up with a Light, and knockt at the
door, and being very well <U+017F>atisfy'd it was they, I let
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57806:222"/>
them in, and then going to <U+017F>ee who it was my man
had got hold of, I was <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee it was one of
the hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o was the Barber and his Wife: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, my <hi>Valet</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t concern'd, who but
ju<U+017F>t before came from the Tavern with him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not valuing the letting me know what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from me before, <hi>O you Dog!</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>was it to
rob my Ma<U+017F>ter then that you carry'd me to the Tavern to
night, and did all you could to make me drunk; you thought,
I warrant you, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>leep <U+017F>o <U+017F>oundly, I <U+017F>hould not be in
a condition to help him.</hi> The<U+017F>e words made me plainly
<U+017F>ee what I had e<U+017F>cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, e<U+017F>pecially when I was inform'd
al<U+017F>o that 'twas he broke the Square of Gla<U+017F>s in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and that it was a premeditated de<U+017F>ign: I had
certainly run my Sword immediately through him, if
I had been le<U+017F>s amazed; but my a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>truck
me <U+017F>encele<U+017F>s, therefore I only turn'd to the Barber and
his Wife, and askt them if they could have believ'd
it? they <U+017F>hook their heads at it; and examining the
fellow, I heard him two or three times over <U+017F>ay very
<U+017F>oftly to him<U+017F>elf, <hi>Ah! Dogs, one half hour <U+017F>ooner and it
had been done.</hi> I askt him what he meant, but he would
not explain him<U+017F>elf; and all I could gather from it,
was, that he had appointed his Comrades to come
<U+017F>ooner than they did, they I mean, who had made
their e<U+017F>cape over the Tiles, where we could <U+017F>ee their
foot<U+017F>teps in a Guttur, by which they got away; all this
while the fellows blood run about the Chamber, as if
one had kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an Ox; and being afraid he <U+017F>hould die
in our hands before he was examin'd, I bid them <U+017F>end
for the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>air; they told me, if I would have it <U+017F>o,
they would do it; but they pray'd me to con<U+017F>ider, and
take heed, I did not bring my <U+017F>elf into an affair which
might co<U+017F>t me a great deal of Money; that I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wounded nor robb'd, and that if I <U+017F>hou'd hang
that wretch it wou'd do me no good: I did not di<U+017F>like
the advice, and the rather, becau<U+017F>e the fellow had no
Weapons about him; and, to ju<U+017F>tifie him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>aid he
came only to have <U+017F>atisfaction of my man, with whom
he had quarrell'd at the Tavern. Indeed, he being a
cunning fellow, had <U+017F>ome words with him before they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57806:222"/>
went out; to the end, if he was taken, he might have
that for his excu<U+017F>e: but the Gla<U+017F>s, which had been
broke at lea<U+017F>t three days before that, <U+017F>hew'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
and if I had carry'd him before the Judges, he
mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ung another Song. In <U+017F>hort, I <U+017F>uffer'd my
<U+017F>elf to be prevail'd on by the intreaties of the Barber
and his Wife, who begg'd hard for him; which they
were <U+017F>orry for afterwards, having been cheated by his
Ma<U+017F>ter, who they di<U+017F>cover'd to be in the plot with him.</p>
            <p>The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s being over in this manner, I began to
think of leaving a hou<U+017F>e, where I had been in <U+017F>o much
danger; and having <U+017F>ent my things to a place where I
had formerly lodg'd in the <hi>Fauxbourg Saint Germain,</hi>
I askt the Barber to make up accounts with me; he told
me the account was very ea<U+017F>ie to make up, but that to
give me any Money, truly he had none, and therefore
de<U+017F>ir'd me to have patience; I told him <U+017F>miling, that I
wou'd, but that I wou'd not <U+017F>tay long; and that I
had given his Wife the <U+017F>ixty Pi<U+017F>toles I had won of him;
and if we had not told him of it, 'twas only that he
might <U+017F>uffer a little for his folly, and make
him out of love with play: He gave me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
thanks, and I dare <U+017F>wear with all his heart, and
immediately call'd his Wife to pay me what he ow'd
me; but truly <U+017F>he told him, <U+017F>he had nothing to do
with his debt, for <U+017F>he was by her<U+017F>elf, and all the
things in the hou<U+017F>e belong'd to her.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he was in earne<U+017F>t, which indeed <U+017F>urpriz'd me,
con<U+017F>idering how I had oblig'd her, wherefore I bid her
think on it a little, for if <U+017F>he us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hou'd give
her <U+017F>uch a character, that no body wou'd come near
her Hou<U+017F>e; that <U+017F>he knew in her own Con<U+017F>cience the
Money I had given her was in compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to <U+017F>upply her nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities; and that I had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
told her <U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he might not plead Ignorance:
that this was far enough from acknowledging my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
which I did not <U+017F>ay to reproach her, but <U+017F>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>d <U+017F>o generou<U+017F>ly as I had us'd her;
and I askt no more than the forty Pi<U+017F>toles I had lent
him; however, <U+017F>ay what I could I was not able to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57806:223"/>
per<U+017F>wade her to pay me; and her Husband, tho he was
in a violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, could do no more good with her
than I; I mu<U+017F>t do him this ju<U+017F>tice, that I believe he
did his be<U+017F>t, for he not only <U+017F>torm'd at her, but bang'd
her too; and if I had not parted them I believe it might
have come to a <U+017F>et battle, for <U+017F>he did not take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
at all, but gave him as good as he brought, and
any body but I, would have given his Money for <U+017F>uch
a <U+017F>ight: her Husband finding I would not let him
handle her as he had begun to do, told me, he was
mightily troubled, that his Wife was <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e to him,
and <U+017F>o unrea<U+017F>onable to me, but that I <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by him, and that as fa<U+017F>t as Money came in he
would bring it me. I was forc'd to be contented with
his fair words, and went my way, but to promi<U+017F>e and
perform is always two things, and <U+017F>o 'twas with him,
for he not only took no care to perform, but would
always avoid me if he <U+017F>aw me in the <U+017F>treet. I <U+017F>ent to
him two or three times to put him in mind, that an
hone<U+017F>t man is always as good as his word; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
'twas that he took no care about it, or that he was
really not able, he always put the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger off with
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>illy excu<U+017F>es, that I <U+017F>aw 'twas to no purpo<U+017F>e to
expect any thing of him; but the plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t je<U+017F>t was,
that his Wife one day, when one of my Servants had
been there for Money, bid him get out of doors, or
<U+017F>he would claw his eyes out, that 'twas long of his
Ma<U+017F>ter that no body came to their hou<U+017F>e, and that
<U+017F>ince that damn'd bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of his, every body <U+017F>hunn'd
her hou<U+017F>e, as if they <U+017F>hould have their throats cut
there.</p>
            <p>I did not <U+017F>tay long at my new Lodgings at <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
a friend of mine that was newly marry'd in the
Country, having <U+017F>ent for me, I went down to <U+017F>ee him,
where I found a great deal of good company. The
Gentleman I went to <U+017F>ee was not only very rich, but
was one that de<U+017F>ign'd to continue <U+017F>o too; to which end
he had taken up a certain re<U+017F>olution, which is <U+017F>ince
grown very much in fa<U+017F>hion among per<U+017F>ons of quality,
which was to treat very generou<U+017F>ly all his friends, but
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57806:223"/>
never to entertain either Servants or Hor<U+017F>es; and that
his friends might not pretend a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to intrude
upon him, and break his new cu<U+017F>tom for lack of a
place of entertainment, he built a good large Inn about
200 yards from his Hou<U+017F>e, which be<U+017F>ides the profit of
of it, rid him of the company of tho<U+017F>e poorer <U+017F>ort
of Gentry which are numerous; for they having not
always Money in their Pockets to defray the charge of
their Equipage, cho<U+017F>e rather to live as they could them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
than to pay for their good chear at <U+017F>o dear a
rate; they grumbled, and made <U+017F>ome reflections, but
they were not worth taking notice of; for Gentlemen
of any quality lik'd the way very well, and found it
much for their convenience. I am <U+017F>ure I made no
<U+017F>cruple of it, but <U+017F>ent my Hor<U+017F>es and my Servants thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as other people did, and went away to <U+017F>ee my
friend. I never was better pleas'd in any company in
my life, for we had all manner of diver<U+017F>ions, and
which was better than all of it, I won four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pi<U+017F>toles at play. They <U+017F>ay Fortune never <U+017F>ides
with old age, and <U+017F>ome folks will believe no other;
and yet as old as I was, I had no rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> <U+017F>o,
for if I had kept account of the lo<U+017F>s and gain I had
made at play, I am <U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould find I had clear'd
a thou<U+017F>and Pi<U+017F>toles. And now, that I might put my
<U+017F>elf out of a condition to lo<U+017F>e it back again, I re<U+017F>olv'd
to put it out to the Bankers, knowing that then there
was no danger; to which purpo<U+017F>e, a Gentleman
going to <hi>Paris,</hi> I de<U+017F>ir'd him to take me with him in
the Coach, re<U+017F>olving to come back again a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I had
done my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and therefore took but only a Boy
with me, leaving my Lacquay at the Inn with my
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> giving them order however to meet
me at a certain time and place, but they having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
to rob me, as-it afterward appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, march'd
quite away, <U+017F>o that when I came to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
there was neither Hor<U+017F>e nor Men, nor no
news to be had of them: I could not imagin what
<U+017F>hould hinder them, and never dreamt of what really
was the cau<U+017F>e. I fancy'd <U+017F>ome accident had happen'd
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57806:224"/>
to my Equipage, or that <U+017F>ome hunting match having
been made in the Country, my friend might make
bold with my Hor<U+017F>es, having not enough in his Stable
for all the company.</p>
            <p>Thus I thought with my <U+017F>elf, tho with very little
rea<U+017F>on, for I might have con<U+017F>ider'd, if my friend had
had never <U+017F>o much occa<U+017F>ion, he would not have taken
my Hor<U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e I was to come back on them; and
then as to any accident befalling my Equipage, they
would be <U+017F>ure to have <U+017F>ent me word, and <U+017F>end me
other Hor<U+017F>es. However, as we are often mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
in deceiving our <U+017F>elves, I pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d my <U+017F>elf
with the<U+017F>e imaginations till the next morning,
and from thence to night again; but hearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then, I began to mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief was
in it. Indeed I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay it was my own fault, for
I had known enough by that <hi>Valet</hi> of mine to give me
cau<U+017F>e of mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, if I had but taken notice of it. He
was one of the impudente<U+017F>t Rogues alive; and as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood
<U+017F>ince I catcht him, us'd to take his time, and
go upon the Pad, and <U+017F>trip People upon the Road.
Indeed, the behaving him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o well in that accident,
which, as I have told you, befel me in my Chamber,
made me the more confident in him, but I never
thought he had been <U+017F>uch a Ra<U+017F>cal. Having waited
thus till my patience was quite worn out, I di<U+017F>patcht
away a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to the Inn where I left them, and he
brought me word, they had been gone five days afore
to meet me, as they <U+017F>aid. This was enough to put me
out of my pain, I pre<U+017F>ently then concluded what was
befallen me, and away I went back again to <hi>Paris,</hi> to
advi<U+017F>e what was be<U+017F>t to be done in the ca<U+017F>e. In the
interim, my Lacquay having a Brother who liv'd in
the <hi>Fauxboug St. Antoine,</hi> I went to him, and de<U+017F>ir'd
him to give me notice if his Brother came to <U+017F>ee him,
and that I would pardon him upon his di<U+017F>covering the
other, for I knew it was no contrivance of his, but
that he was wheedled and drawn in by the t'other,
who I knew was a Ra<U+017F>cal; that I was very <U+017F>orry he
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o led a<U+017F>ide, having a great kindne<U+017F>s for the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57806:224"/>
young man; I bid him tell him all this, and withal
that 'twas the only way to <U+017F>ave his life, to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
upon my kindne<U+017F>s, that he had liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d five or <U+017F>ix years
with me, and he knew I was a man of my word; and
that if he did not, he would be in a great deal of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>I told him indeed nothing but the truth, for I
never had a prettier Servant, nor one that was more
faithful, and I think the other Rogue bewitcht
him, or he would never have plaid this extravagant
prank. In a fit of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s which he had, not above
five or <U+017F>ix months before, I had taken as much care of
him, as if he had been my own Child; and fancying
if he was brought to recollect all my kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>hew'd
to him, it might work upon him, and the more too,
when he <U+017F>hould know how ea<U+017F>y I was to forgive him,
if he had been led to commit this folly only out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
of Wine. This cour<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I took, and the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s was
an<U+017F>werable, tho I dare <U+017F>ay, it would not have <U+017F>ucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<U+017F>o well to a great many others; for certainly there
are few people u<U+017F>e a Servant <U+017F>o gently as I, but every
body does in that as <U+017F>uits with their humour; and the
method mo<U+017F>t us'd is not always the be<U+017F>t, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in the confidence the fellow put in my promi<U+017F>e;
for coming to <U+017F>ee his Brother, and hearing what I had
<U+017F>aid, and that I, would forgive him, he comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to find me out, and asking my pardon, told me,
he was drawn into the fact by ill coun<U+017F>el, and he knew
no way to convince me of it better, than by coming
to throw him<U+017F>elf at my feet, as he now did; that he
knew his life was in my hand, and he acknowledg'd
he had de<U+017F>erv'd death, but hop'd, <U+017F>ince I had given my
word to his Brother, I would not be <U+017F>evere upon him.
I told him he <U+017F>hould fear nothing, provided he would
do but what I de<U+017F>ir'd him; that I believ'd my <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> had debauch'd him, and if he expected any
favour from me, he mu<U+017F>t find him for me, for unle<U+017F>s I
could take him, he had as good do nothing. Then I
askt him where he was, and what they had done with
my Hor<U+017F>es? He told me, that for the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecurity
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57806:225"/>
they had taken their opportunity to come to Town the
evening before me, and <U+017F>o knowing I was out of the
way, had carry'd them to Market publickly, and
<U+017F>old one to a Hor<U+017F>e-Cour<U+017F>er in <hi>La Rue St. Martin,</hi> a
little below <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> in the Fields, and the t'other
two were in <hi>la Cimitiere St. Jean,</hi> in an Inn where they
had taken up their Lodging.</p>
            <p>This account pleas'd me <U+017F>o well, that I confirm'd
my promi<U+017F>e to pardon him, but I order'd him to go
back again to his Comrade, that he might not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
any thing, being re<U+017F>olv'd to take him the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Bed; to which purpo<U+017F>e I order'd him to
come to me by break of day, to a certain place which
I nam'd to him; if there was no danger of being <U+017F>een
in the Hou<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o I got ready the Provo<U+017F>ts men over
night, and po<U+017F>ting them in the mid way, I would
needs go my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee him taken. Being come to the
place, my Footman came exactly as I appointed him,
but told me, that he did not lodge at home that night,
and de<U+017F>ir'd me to take great care le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een,
for if the lea<U+017F>t notice <U+017F>hould be taken of my de<U+017F>ign, I
<U+017F>hould never catch him. I approv'd what he <U+017F>aid well
enough, and therefore <U+017F>ending the Provo<U+017F>ts men away
to a Tavern, I re<U+017F>ted upon his care in the matter. I
fancy'd the fellow would certainly come in two or
three hours, but the Rogue having got the Money in his
Pocket that he made of my Hor<U+017F>e, was re<U+017F>olv'd to live
well while it la<U+017F>ted; and noon being pa<U+017F>t without any
di<U+017F>covery, I began to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect my Footman had been
fal<U+017F>e to me, and had given him notice; and when he
came to me, as he did every now and then, for fear I
<U+017F>hould be impatient, I told him plainly what I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
of him, and withal, that if he had trickt me, I
<U+017F>hould find it out fir<U+017F>t or la<U+017F>t, and then I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>how
him no mercy; but he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me of his fidelity with
<U+017F>uch prote<U+017F>tations, as fully <U+017F>atisfy'd me, and I
re<U+017F>olv'd to wait till night; but 'twas all one, the fellow
lik'd his <U+017F>port too well where he was, and there he
<U+017F>tay'd all the next day, all which time I was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>y
with waiting. Then it was that I concluded the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57806:225"/>
Lacquay had without doubt deluded me, and the very
thought of it put me in <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that I was ju<U+017F>t
upon the point of arre<U+017F>ting him: but he told me, he
was content I <U+017F>hould hang him if I found it <U+017F>o; that
he began to think him<U+017F>elf, the fellow was fled,
but at the <U+017F>ame time he could not imagin, how he
<U+017F>hould get any notice of our de<U+017F>ign. Indeed, I was
<U+017F>o far <U+017F>atisfy'd, that I went to the Inn my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>eize
upon my Hor<U+017F>es, and as I was ordering them <U+017F>ome
Corn before I took them away, they came running in
to me to ask me if my Valet had not <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort of a
Belt on, for they <U+017F>aw a fellow coming a good way off
that lookt like him, as I had de<U+017F>crib'd him; I <U+017F>ent my
Lacquay, who was ordering the Hor<U+017F>es, to <U+017F>ee if it was
the right, and order'd him to go and acco<U+017F>t him, that
they might not be mi<U+017F>taken, for that was the <U+017F>ign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on. In <U+017F>hort, being <U+017F>atisfy'd it was he, he comes
up to him, and tells him, how if he had come a little
<U+017F>ooner, he had met with <U+017F>ome Cu<U+017F>tomers for the Hor<U+017F>es.
While he kept him thus in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, the Provo<U+017F>ts men
<U+017F>eized upon him, and he <U+017F>truggling to clear him<U+017F>elf
from them, the noi<U+017F>e brought me out, thinking they
might want help; before he <U+017F>aw me he laid about him
with all his might, but when I appear'd he made no
more re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; <U+017F>o true it is, that the Face of the man
one has really injur'd, di<U+017F>pirits the mind, and the reproach
of a mans con<U+017F>cience takes away all his re<U+017F>olution;
therefore putting him<U+017F>elf in a po<U+017F>ture of <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
<hi>Ah<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Ma<U+017F>ter, Ma<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>I beg your pardon heartily.</hi>
I forgot to tell you, that with my Hor<U+017F>es he had carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
away all my Clothes, and my Linnen, all which he
either <U+017F>old or pawn'd. Having <U+017F>ecur'd my man, I
had him to a Magi<U+017F>trate of my acquaintance, where,
when I had brought him, I told him, that it was now
in my power to pro<U+017F>ecute, and perhaps to hang him;
but however, that I would be <U+017F>o kind to <U+017F>pare him,
provided he would re<U+017F>tore the things he had <U+017F>tole from
me; that he <U+017F>hould tell me where my things were, and
carry the man his Money again who had bought my
Hor<U+017F>e, that when I <U+017F>hould oblige him to re<U+017F>tore the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57806:226"/>
Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap><U+017F>e, he <U+017F>hould not oblige me to pro<U+017F>ecute him. This
was without que<U+017F>tion a very kind propo<U+017F>al on my part,
but the poor fellow unhappily had met with a <U+017F>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
accident: In the little time he had been gone, he
had gotten into a gang of <U+017F>harping Pick Pocket Rogues,
who had drawn him into play, and had cheated him
of all his Money; <U+017F>o that in<U+017F>tead of refunding the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the Hor<U+017F>e, he had not one Farthing in his
Pocket; he dur<U+017F>t not tell me how it was, and begun to
make excu<U+017F>es; but <U+017F>eeing how it was, and giving no
credit to his pretences, I let him go to Pri<U+017F>on, In the
mean time, that I might get my Hor<U+017F>e, without being
oblig'd to pro<U+017F>ecute the fellow, I went to the man who
had bought him, and pretending to buy a Hor<U+017F>e,
among the re<U+017F>t he <U+017F>how'd me my own. I made no
great difficulty of agreeing to his price, knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
what he co<U+017F>t him, I bid him profit enough, and
we <U+017F>oon agreed, <U+017F>o I de<U+017F>ir'd him to <U+017F>end him to my
Lodging, and come and fetch his Money; but when
he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me to be paid, I told him how it was, that it was
my own Hor<U+017F>e, and that he had been <U+017F>tolen from me,
and that he who was a Jocky by Trade, ought to know
a little better who he bought Hor<U+017F>es of. The Man
was very much <U+017F>upriz'd, for he was an hone<U+017F>t Man,
and knew nothing of the matter. However, he told
me I was a <U+017F>tranger to him, and he de<U+017F>ir'd to be <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
that what I alledg'd was true. I told him 'twas
ea<U+017F>y enough for me to <U+017F>atisfy him of that, for the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that <U+017F>tole him from me, and <U+017F>old him to him, was
now actually in the <hi>Cha<U+017F>telet,</hi> and if he pleas'd, I
would go along with him, and <U+017F>how him the Man,
who was my <hi>Valet de Chambre;</hi> he agreed, and we
went directly to the Pri<U+017F>on, where he had the <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of <U+017F>eeing that it was even <U+017F>o, and that he could
have no more claim to the Hor<U+017F>e. However, after this,
<U+017F>ome Attorney having advis'd him to pre<U+017F>ent a Petition,
in which he made his complaint, that I came and
took the Hor<U+017F>e away by main force, he got leave
to <U+017F>eize him again, and <U+017F>ent an Officer at a time,
when he knew I was not at home: he that came de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57806:226"/>
to <U+017F>ee him out, under pretence of carrying him to
a place where goods are attacht, but indeed to give the
Hor<U+017F>e Merchant po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, after which I had no remedy
but again<U+017F>t the poor Stable-keeper, who<U+017F>e Wife it may be
would have paid me with a <U+017F>ham of her being a <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sole,</hi> as the Barbers Wife had done; but my Landlord
would not <U+017F>uffer that, and cho<U+017F>e rather to be the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre,
and to take it into his keeping. This Proceeding of
the Jockeys brought me into a Suit at Law, which I
would have willingly declin'd, and going to Council
about it, they advis'd me to demand a Warrant. I
went then to the new <hi>Chatellet</hi> in the <hi>Fauxbourg St.
Germain,</hi> where I lodg'd, and Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Girardin</hi> being
Chief in that Court of Judicature, I needed not go
twice to him to be heard, for he is a per<U+017F>on always very
obliging to per<U+017F>ons of any quality. My Cau<U+017F>e was <U+017F>o
clear, that he granted what I askt at fir<U+017F>t word; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to give <U+017F>ecurity till the Proce<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould

the Sollicitor General at the Kings Suit, for one
of my friends, who under<U+017F>tood tho<U+017F>e things better than
I, had taken care to order that for me, telling me the
King was better able to bear the Charges than I was;
by which he <U+017F>av'd me three or four hundred Franks
in my pocket, and I was very much oblig'd to him
for it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I brought a Citizen of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
to be Security, and having entred into a
Recognizance to the Regi<U+017F>try, I thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t all was over;
but it prov'd a <U+017F>trange Suit for me. My <hi>Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
before he came to me, belong'd to the Marquis <hi>de
l' Aigle,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y'd the
Marquis <hi>de Rarcy</hi>'s Daughter, a Gentleman of but a
mean quality, but being ally'd to a Family of good
Repute, and of great per<U+017F>onal Merit, he liv'd all his
days in a great deal of Credit; I was acquainted with
him, and his Daughter, who had <U+017F>een me <U+017F>everal times
at his Hou<U+017F>e<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and knew I was the fellows Ma<U+017F>ter, who
had formerly liv'd with her Husband, came to me to
<U+017F>peak in his behalf, and pray'd me to be favourable to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57806:227"/>
him, and <U+017F>he would <U+017F>o order it, that I <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it, <U+017F>he would give me her word for it; I told
her I de<U+017F>ir'd no more, and before <U+017F>he came to me, I
had offer'd <U+017F>o much to the Pri<U+017F>oner; that I was <U+017F>orry
<U+017F>he had no Reque<U+017F>t of greater con<U+017F>equence to make to
me, that I might have the honour to oblige her; that
I was an old friend of her Fathers, and <U+017F>o much hers
al<U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he might depend upon any thing which lay
in my pow'r to be done: however, I told her, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
there might be <U+017F>ome difficulty now in the
thing; that the Man being put into the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice,
<U+017F>he could not take him out when <U+017F>he would,
and we ought to take advice of tho<U+017F>e who under<U+017F>tood
tho<U+017F>e things, what was to be done; <U+017F>he approv'd of
what I <U+017F>aid, and taking me into her Coach, we went
to the Regi<U+017F>ter, who was a friend of hers. He told us
indeed, 'twould be a hard matter to bring the fellow
off now; that if I had not committed him it might
have been done, but however he would try; he <U+017F>aid
the thing depended on the Depo<U+017F>ition of the Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es
who <U+017F>hould come in again<U+017F>t him, and they having not
been examin'd yet, it lay in my power to direct them
what they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de l' Aigle</hi> was mighty glad of this expedient,
telling me, that now it was all in my power, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
her promi<U+017F>es as <U+017F>he had before, that I <U+017F>hould
lo<U+017F>e nothing, I parted from her, upon condition <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould come forthwith and perform them; but two
or three days after <U+017F>he came to me again, and told me,
<U+017F>he was extreamly troubled, that <U+017F>he had promis'd me
what <U+017F>he could not perform; that what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid,
was upon Propo<U+017F>als made to her by the Pri<U+017F>oner; and
that now when it was come to the point, he could not
find Money but ju<U+017F>t to <U+017F>atisfie the Hor<U+017F>e Merchant, and
that if I was not inclin'd to <U+017F>how him <U+017F>ome pity, he was
a dead man. This pretty fetch <U+017F>urpriz'd me extreamly,
e<U+017F>pecially coming from <U+017F>uch a Woman as <U+017F>he, who
ought to have had all her mea<U+017F>ures ready-before hand,
and be<U+017F>ides I thought indeed, <U+017F>he had intended to have
done <U+017F>o much for the poor fellow her<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o I told
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57806:227"/>
her; upon which <U+017F>he reply'd, <U+017F>he had done more for
him than I thought of, that 'twas <U+017F>he helpt him to the
Money to pay the Hor<U+017F>e Cour<U+017F>er, and that <U+017F>he could
not do any more, and begg'd me to bear a little of the
lo<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ave a poor Wretch from the Gallows. I prote<U+017F>t,
I was very unwilling to do any thing, after her having
broke the promi<U+017F>es <U+017F>he made me at fir<U+017F>t, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
that I <U+017F>hould not be much the better for hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a poor fellow, I told her I would do any thing
for her <U+017F>ake, and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he would have it <U+017F>o, it was
granted. So we parted, after her giving me a great
many thanks for my genero<U+017F>ity, and the like. Things
being i<U+017F><U+017F>ued thus far, I thought I might venture to go
a <U+017F>mall Journey into the Country, which I had deferr'd
for <U+017F>ome time upon this account. I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that I had my Arm put out of joynt, going to
<U+017F>ee Father <hi>d' Aviano;</hi> and that falling into the
hands of an ignorant Surgeon, I was forc'd to go to the
Hangman of <hi>Ruremond,</hi> who had given me ea<U+017F>e; but
whether it was that he had not perfectly cur'd it, or
that <U+017F>uch accidents as tho<U+017F>e generally leave pains and
aches which are felt when one comes to be old, I have
had <U+017F>ince that, every now and then, a pain there, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
again<U+017F>t the change of weather. I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted
with the whole College of Phy<U+017F>itians, and with
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Saint Come,</hi> and they all advis'd me to go to
<hi>Barbottans,</hi> near the <hi>Pyrennees,</hi> a place nam'd from the
Baths that are there, which are different from all Baths,
for they are not of clear water, but very muddy;
yet of <U+017F>uch virtue, that <U+017F>trange cures are done by them,
upon <U+017F>uch as are troubled with weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es in the
Nerves and Joynts, or the remains of any di<U+017F>located
part, as mine was. Before I went away I took my leave
of Madam <hi>de l' Aigle,</hi> and told her, my going out of
Town <U+017F>hould not hinder the doing what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd,
that I would leave order for the Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es to come to
her for directions before they were examin'd; and
<U+017F>ince the Regi<U+017F>ter had told us, that all depended upon
their depo<U+017F>itions, <U+017F>he might be <U+017F>atisfy'd the thing
would be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:57806:228"/>
Upon this I went my way, re<U+017F>ting upon her promi<U+017F>e,
not dreaming in the lea<U+017F>t, that a Woman of her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and who I had dealt <U+017F>o fairly with, could be <U+017F>o
ba<U+017F>e as to break her word a <U+017F>econd time; but <U+017F>he had
marry'd a <hi>Norman,</hi> the Maxim of who<U+017F>e Country
it is, that a Man ought not to be a Slave to his Word.
She had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een me clear of <hi>Paris,</hi> but <U+017F>he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
that <U+017F>he had al<U+017F>o marry'd the Manners and
Cu<U+017F>toms of the <hi>Normans;</hi> for after <U+017F>he had order'd
every thing as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd it, with the Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the orders I had left, in<U+017F>tead of performing
her agreement with me, <U+017F>he goes to the Pri<U+017F>oner, and
tells him <U+017F>he would bring him off well enough, that he
<U+017F>hould now <U+017F>tand in his own ju<U+017F>tification, and tell the
Court, that in<U+017F>tead of robbing his Ma<U+017F>ter, he had done
nothing but what he order'd him; that having not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <U+017F>end him to defray the charges of my Hor<U+017F>es
and Servants, I had left him a verbal order to <U+017F>ell my
Equipage and Cloaths if I wanted; and if he had <U+017F>old
one Hor<U+017F>e at <hi>Paris,</hi> it was only to pay for the keeping
of the other two, having not found me at <hi>Paris</hi> as I
appointed. If I had been upon the <U+017F>pot, it had been an
ea<U+017F>y matter for me to have confuted all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ham <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but my Sollicitor, and the Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es too, having
had orders from me to <U+017F>peak nothing of him but what
<U+017F>he directed, I could not blame them if they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to clear him; and <U+017F>he, in<U+017F>tead of bearing me
harmle<U+017F>s, left me in the lurch, to be ca<U+017F>t in the Co<U+017F>t
and Damages of the Tryal, and to pay to the Hor<U+017F>e
Merchant the <U+017F>umm of four hundred and fifty Livres,
which was the price of the Hor<U+017F>e, with intere<U+017F>t from
the time I bought him. 'Twas certainly as <U+017F>trange a thing
as ever befel a man, in <U+017F>o plain a ca<U+017F>e as mine was,
and a great cau<U+017F>e of triumph to a Ra<U+017F>cal who ought to
have been hang'd; and yet all this was nothing to
what follow'd. The Hor<U+017F>e Cour<U+017F>er having gotten judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
again<U+017F>t me, and I not being to be found, he gave
notice to the Man who was <U+017F>ecurity for me, to prepare
to pay the Money in my room; and this demand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, ju<U+017F>t at a time when he had a great man
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57806:228"/>
Bills to pay, and at the <U+017F>ame time one came to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ted
for non-payment, the Man was quite ruin'd,
having neither Money nor Friends to <U+017F>tand by him at
<U+017F>uch a pinch. I confe<U+017F>s, I cannot <U+017F>peak of this part of
the <U+017F>tory without being mov'd at Madam <hi>de l' Aigle,</hi>
who<U+017F>e ba<U+017F>e dealing was the occa<U+017F>ion of all this
confu<U+017F>ion; and had it been a Man, I <U+017F>hould not
have fail'd to have reveng'd it, when I fir<U+017F>t heard
of it, one way or t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>other. But to go on with the <U+017F>tory
of this Ra<U+017F>cal, which was, I think, the wor<U+017F>t that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen'd to me in my life, tho I have had a pretty
many trouble<U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es too. Within two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
notice given to my Security, as before, they <U+017F>eiz'd
his Goods, and he having no body to redeem them,
they carry'd them off, and expos'd them to <U+017F>ale in the
place appointed for Sale of Goods <U+017F>eiz'd in Execution.
I leave it to any body to judge, what a fraction this
made in the affairs of a Shop-keeper; all the remedy he
had, was to <U+017F>ummon me to <U+017F>top the Proceedings, and
for default of appearing, to prote<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t me for all
the Co<U+017F>ts, Damages and Intere<U+017F>ts.</p>
            <p>I was upon the road when all this happen'd, going
to the Bath, and not imagining any <U+017F>uch thing could
befal me, I had not left directions to write to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came to my Journeys end, <U+017F>o that tho a great
many Letters were <U+017F>ent to places where it was probable
I might come, yet having no notice of any <U+017F>uch thing,
I met with none of them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Twas very <U+017F>trange, I
thought, that among <U+017F>uch a multitude of people, that
u<U+017F>e to call them<U+017F>elves my Friends, and humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
there was not one to be found would lay down
fifty Pi<U+017F>toles for me in my ab<U+017F>ence, to have <U+017F>topt all
this Villany, and above all, to <U+017F>ave the poor Man that
was bound for me, who was but in a very ill ca<U+017F>e; for
<U+017F>uch people who live by Trade, are never without a
number of Creditors, and the<U+017F>e came all upon him,
hearing what had happen'd, and believing he was pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
remedy, <U+017F>eeing he could not <U+017F>top <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>mall thing as
that, <U+017F>o falling in with the Hor<U+017F>e Cour<U+017F>er they pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Sale of the Goods, and the poor Man lo<U+017F>t all

that ever he had in one days time, and <U+017F>poil'd his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
too, which was wor<U+017F>e than all the re<U+017F>t. However,
as I was really innocent of all that had happen'd, all
my anger was bent again<U+017F>t Madam <hi>de l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Aigle.</hi> I will
not pretend to de<U+017F>cribe what a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I was in at her,
for indeed 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; you mu<U+017F>t think I thought of
nothing but revenge, and I was very deeply toucht to
do what I did. I had not undertaken <U+017F>uch a long
Journey, as I <U+017F>aid before, but in hopes of recovering
my health; now I was upon the <U+017F>pot, and ought to
expect the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, yet upon the news of this I made
back again immediately, re<U+017F>olving to do my utmo<U+017F>t
rather than to be thus fool'd. I have given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
already how I had been inform'd, that my <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> had us'd to rob on the High-way. I now
made enquiry to find out what proof I could have of it,
and finding I had too plain proof to fail bringing him
to the Gallows, I had nothing to do then but to find
him out, which as it happen'd was not <U+017F>o difficult as I
thought it was: having given order to one of my Boys
to put off his Livery, and go to the Marquis <hi>de l' Aigle</hi>'s,
upon pretence of getting a place, he pre<U+017F>ently learnt,
that the fellow was got into his <U+017F>ervice again; this
<hi>Norman</hi> not mattering wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were his Servants, <U+017F>o he
could but get them for little or no Wages. In <U+017F>hort,
he took him on that very <U+017F>core, for he was a Man that
never mi<U+017F>t his advantage, if he had an opportunity.</p>
            <p>Having learnt where this Rogue had hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him<U+017F>elf,
I got a Decree again<U+017F>t him, and re<U+017F>olv'd not only to
take him, but to take him out of his new Ma<U+017F>ters
Hou<U+017F>e, that the affront might be the greater to him; to
which end I got every thing ready, and taking no le<U+017F>s
than a Gang of thirty Provo<U+017F>ts Men, that I might be
provided in ca<U+017F>e of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, we went to the Hou<U+017F>e
betimes in the morning, and the Door being open'd,
we took the Rogue out of his Bed. The Marquis <hi>de
l' Aigle</hi> hearing a great noi<U+017F>e, got up to <U+017F>ee what was
the matter, and <U+017F>o did his Lady, and hufft at the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
theatning them for daring to enter the Hou<U+017F>e of
a per<U+017F>on of their quality: but <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of people don't

neither, and the <U+017F>he had like to have found to her co<U+017F>t,
one or two of them having offer'd the butt end of their
pieces at her, and perhaps had done her a mi<U+017F>chief,
but that the Magi<U+017F>trate who was at the head of them
prevented it; but at the <U+017F>ame time the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary
(for there is not much difference between one of tho<U+017F>e
Magi<U+017F>trates, and one of their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

better than to threaten tho<U+017F>e that came to execute
the Law; and if <U+017F>he had any thing to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he might
make her complaint where <U+017F>he ought. This was a
great mortification to a Woman of her <U+017F>pirit, but <U+017F>he
was forc'd to bear it, and al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omething more, which
I had in<U+017F>tructed one of the Officers to <U+017F>ay to her, if <U+017F>he
appear'd, that made her pre<U+017F>ently know it was I had
brought this about, and thereupon <U+017F>he and her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
began to contrive, which way to defeat me again,
(for they were both as excellent at tricking as Lawyers)
thinking it was all on the old bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. 'Tis true, as
to the crime, a Man could not be tried twice for the
<U+017F>ame fact, nor would further Evidence <U+017F>ignify any
thing, and this was what they built upon, and <U+017F>o
making it a point of honour, away they went in their
Coach to <U+017F>each the Jaylors Book of the Pri<U+017F>oners Names,
but they were <U+017F>ent back again with a vengeance, when
they under<U+017F>tood there was more in it than they had
heard of; and as great as they were they dur<U+017F>t not
meddle with it, nor <U+017F>o much as appear, when they heard
of a High-way Robbery in the ca<U+017F>e; they did what they
could, indeed, by their friends, and underhand, but
all was to no purpo<U+017F>e, nor much to their credit neither,
for all would not do to <U+017F>ave a Rogue, who<U+017F>e crime was
as plain as the Sun at noon day; but he was condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be broken upon the Wheel, and all they could do for
him was, that in<U+017F>tead of being broken alive, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd,
(for he had been an A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inate too) he had the
favour to be <U+017F>trangled fir<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>This however, did not hinder me from endeavouring
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57806:230"/>
to make up the matter with the Man that had been
bound for me, and had <U+017F>uffer'd <U+017F>o deeply for it. He had
prote<U+017F>ted, as before, again<U+017F>t me, for the Charges, Damages,
and Intere<U+017F>ts, and it was but ju<U+017F>t indeed that I <U+017F>hould
give him <U+017F>omething, and that con<U+017F>iderable too: indeed
tho I was not the cau<U+017F>e of his Creditors coming upon
him, yet I was of the confu<U+017F>ion of his affairs, which
brought them upon him, and in con<U+017F>ideration of this I
offer'd him 2000 Franks, and after that 1000 Crowns,
but he flew out at me as if I had done him <U+017F>ome great
injury, telling me <U+017F>ix times as much would not make him
<U+017F>atisfaction; that on my account his Goods had been <U+017F>old
for half the value, and that I was oblig'd to bear the lo<U+017F>s,
which was at lea<U+017F>t 4000 Crowns; that be<U+017F>ides, I had
been the occa<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>hutting up his Shop, where he
got his Livelihood, and I ought to give him a con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for that; that it would require a great deal of time
before he could <U+017F>et up again, and get into credit as he
was before, and the like, and the<U+017F>e he call'd his Damages
and Intere<U+017F>ts; and he hop'd I would not <U+017F>ee his Wife and
Children turn'd into the <U+017F>treet a begging for his good
will in doing me a kindne<U+017F>s. But indeed he would have
<U+017F>ent me a begging if I <U+017F>hould have done as he de<U+017F>ir'd;
<U+017F>o I was forc'd to go to Law with him, his Demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o extravagant, which ended <U+017F>o much to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that in<U+017F>tead of 1000 Crowns, which I had offer'd
him, I was awarded to pay him ju<U+017F>t half the <U+017F>umm;
but becau<U+017F>e I would be generous, he having really <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on my account, I gave him the thou<U+017F>and Crowns

            <p>And thus ended this affair, which I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till
