         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Hereupon I clapt <U+017F>purrs to my Hor<U+017F>e, but could not <U+017F>tir one foot, for this <U+017F>turdy Rogue had fa<U+017F>t hold of my bridle Reins. Now did I think he would have hinder'd me from ever telling Fortunes more, but I was <U+017F>oon convinced to the contrary, when I <U+017F>aw in what humble manner he be<U+017F>eeched me to <U+017F>tay, that he might have a little time to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e with me: I granted his reque<U+017F>t, and did <U+017F>o far prevail with me, as to lie that night at an hou<U+017F>e of his appointment.</p>
                     <p>Without much ceremony in taking leave of one the other, on I rid to the place appointed for our meeting, it being not many miles di<U+017F>tant from the place where I met with this ragged crue of Tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demallions, I got in four hours before Sun<U+017F>et: I might have been there <U+017F>ooner had it not been for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57215:9"/>the ob<U+017F>curity of the place on which this <U+017F>tately Maunding Man<U+017F>ion, this Begging Dormitory <U+017F>tood, which I found out more by the de<U+017F>cription my Captain Gyp<U+017F>ie gave me of it, than any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I met with by the way.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at the hou<U+017F>e, with what tokens I brought with me, my reception was as kind as they could make it; and preparations were in<U+017F>tantly made, not onely for my <U+017F>ake, but for the welcome of the Strolers they expected.</p>
                     <p>The hou<U+017F>e was not very <U+017F>plendid you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, yet large enough to contain three times tha Company. Whil<U+017F>t I was pen<U+017F>ively <U+017F>itting, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what I had <U+017F>een, and <U+017F>tudying how I might divert my <U+017F>elf till their coming, my Ho<U+017F>ts daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought me <U+017F>ome Ale, of which I had no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ta<U+017F>ted, but I was forced to commend the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of it.</p>
                     <p>She was homely, yet cleanly clad, and very tall. The Father and Mother, what with age and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial means they heretofore u<U+017F>ed to di<U+017F>colour their faces, look'd like the twins of a lecherous He-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, begotten on an overgrown age-ridden Lapland Witch; for it <U+017F>eems this pair of Hou<U+017F>e-keepers had formerly u<U+017F>ed the trade of <U+017F>troling and telling fortunes, but growing old and unable to travel, had by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Brotherhood, erected this Fabrick for their reception.</p>
                     <p>The goodne<U+017F>s of the Ale made me drink freely of it, and the liberty I took to indulge my appetite, made me as freely talk. This per<U+017F>waded my Ho<U+017F>t and Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s that they might take <U+017F>ome freedom to, nor was the daughter therein a jot behind us; I might now properly <U+017F>ay, we were as merry as <U+017F>o many Beggars: and that I might not want Mu<U+017F>ick to increa<U+017F>e my mirth, the Father, Mother, and

The <U+017F>ongs which they <U+017F>ung in Canting I have added to this treati<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>I drank to <U+017F>o high a pitch, that I was forced to for<U+017F>ake my Company and betake my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>leep, tru<U+017F>ting them to do with me as they plea<U+017F>ed, but awaking after two hours, and con<U+017F>idering how fooli<U+017F>hly I had done, I examined my pockets but found nothing mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, then turning my <U+017F>elf about, there lay my untouch'd Bed-fellow, the Ho<U+017F>ts daughter by my <U+017F>ide, who tired with expectation was fallen a<U+017F>leep, it was unkindly done of me to <U+017F>light the pre<U+017F>ent my loving Landlady had <U+017F>ent me, and I could not but be troubled at the di<U+017F><U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I read in the eyes and face of the poor fool'd and cheated Girl.</p>
                     <p>By that time, I got up, in came the Egyptian Prince, according to his hour, with his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines children and the re<U+017F>t of his retinue, who were in<U+017F>tantly conducted into the large<U+017F>t room in the hou<U+017F>e, commonly called the Hall, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one being <U+017F>eated, and <U+017F>tore of booz and fogus, (Drink and Tobacco) brought them, I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their arrival, and of his Higne<U+017F>s de<U+017F>ire to have <U+017F>ome conference with me.</p>

There was a Clock in the hou<U+017F>e, which I watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully told and ob<U+017F>erved, and when it <U+017F>truck twelve (which was the fatal hour appointed) out I got and met full-but with my Comrade, who was as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent as my <U+017F>elf to let them in, they being ready without, enter'd and leaving us two Sentinels at Door, they mounted the Stairs, and in a trice had <U+017F>ecured all that were in the hou<U+017F>e by Gagging and binding them; ju<U+017F>t as they were within ken of their booty; the Gentleman of the hou<U+017F>e (who had been at play and had quarrell'd with <U+017F>ome Gentlemen,) came home attended by <U+017F>everal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and guarded with a Con<U+017F>table and <U+017F>trong watch, but wondred to <U+017F>ee two young Sentinels at his door; as <U+017F>oon as we <U+017F>aw him we betook our <U+017F>elves to our heels, having no time left to acquaint the re<U+017F>t with the pre<U+017F>ent danger; the Con<U+017F>table <U+017F>eeing us run, let loo<U+017F>e a couple of his Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, and <U+017F>tay'd our farther progre<U+017F>s; in the mean time the Gentleman enter'd his hou<U+017F>e; they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57215:20"/>within finding them<U+017F>elves di<U+017F>covered, drew, and attempted to cut their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through; but the Con<U+017F>table hearing a great noi<U+017F>e with cla<U+017F>hing of <U+017F>words, <U+017F>ecuring me and my comrade, pre<U+017F>ently ran to their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and to be <U+017F>hort <U+017F>ecured them all, with whom we were <U+017F>ent to bear them Company in the Counter that night: in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being carried before the Ju<U+017F>tice, there was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, and proof enough to <U+017F>end us to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate;</hi> being tryed at Se<U+017F><U+017F>ions, we were all found guilty of Burglary and accordingly received <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, which was executed accordingly, onely I and my Comrade being very young, had the benefit of Tran<U+017F>portation.</p>
                     <p>Seven years in our exile, we did what our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters commanded us and our time being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, we re<U+017F>olv'd to return for <hi>England,</hi> but death put an end to my Comrades Voyage, however I alter'd not my re<U+017F>olution, but <U+017F>ail'd for <hi>England,</hi> where in <U+017F>everal places I made trials to live hone<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but could not, <hi>For what is bred in the bone will never out of the fle<U+017F>h.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now knowing that if ever I was taken again on any Fellonious account, I <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly be hang'd; and being <U+017F>o lazy that I hated the thought of working, I re<U+017F>olved to follow the life of a <U+017F>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Gyp<U+017F>ie,</hi> into which Society I was joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: I grew <U+017F>o good a proficient in the my<U+017F>teries of this trade, that with a joint con<U+017F>ent I was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en at a <U+017F>olemn meeting, their Prince or King; and for the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons; Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e I was young and well proportion'd; Secondly, becau<U+017F>e I was lu<U+017F>tier and <U+017F>tronger than the re<U+017F>t; And La<U+017F>tly, becau<U+017F>e I had more than common learning, and more wit than they had, put them altogether.</p>
                     <p>Now the rea<U+017F>ons inducing me to follow this life,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57215:21"/>were the<U+017F>e; Fir<U+017F>t, a lazy di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; Secondly, a lecherous inclination; And La<U+017F>tly, profit. As to the fir<U+017F>t, we do nothing for a livelyhood but walk up and down in Summer time, which is rather a pa<U+017F>time than pain; and in Winter, retire to <U+017F>uch quarters as are <U+017F>uitable to the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, not <U+017F>tirring thence till <U+017F>pring. As to the <U+017F>econd, our females are all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us, and though their skins be di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, they have as good fle<U+017F>h as can be coveted by an youthful appetite. And la<U+017F>tly, as to profit; It is incredible to think how much we get by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling, among the ignorant, the poor wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being ready to pawn their Petticoats to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us money, to tell them how fruitful they <U+017F>hall be, when Married; or whether <hi>William</hi> or <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> loveth them or not: But the greate<U+017F>t profit we reap is from our By-blows, the<U+017F>e Children our Morts carry at their backs are all of them Ba<U+017F>tards, and mo<U+017F>t of them none of their own begetting; for when young Gentlewomen have trod awry, and the Fathers are not to be di<U+017F>graced, the Bantlings for a good round <U+017F>um are <U+017F>ent to us to be nur<U+017F>ed, where they are never like to come to the knowledge of their true Parents. Here he made an end, if you <U+017F>hall approve of what is already written, I wil <U+017F>hortly inlarge my <U+017F>elf on this <U+017F>ubject.</p>

                     <p>I have heard of <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e <hi>Priggers of Prancers</hi> that have been <U+017F>uch notable Arti<U+017F>ts, as that they could change the colour of an Hor<U+017F>es Cote, or make an artificial <U+017F>tar in an Hor<U+017F>es forehead, which <U+017F>hould la<U+017F>t a con<U+017F>iderable while, by which means the eyes of the right Owner have been <U+017F>o blinded, that he knew not his own Hor<U+017F>e when he <U+017F>aw him: Nay, when they have been confident that they have found their <U+017F>toln Hor<U+017F>e, and by <U+017F>everal remarkable tokens are a<U+017F><U+017F>ured thereof; yet the artificial <U+017F>tar in the forehead hath immediately <U+017F>poiled that belief; and <U+017F>o have <U+017F>een their own Hor<U+017F>es <U+017F>old before their own faces and toled, having always <U+017F>ome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rogue as him<U+017F>elf to vouch for him. This puts me in mind of a notable Story of a Serving-man,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57215:41"/>who was pickt up by a pack of Rogues in the <U+017F>tteets and drilled into a Tavern, where having drank ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, they all took an opportunity to leave the Serving man for the Reckoning; this poor man finding him<U+017F>elf pawn'd. and not having <U+017F>o much money to di<U+017F>charge the reckoning, watcht his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and <U+017F>o gave the hou<U+017F>e the <U+017F>lip al<U+017F>o; three days after his Ma<U+017F>ter appointed a dinner at this very Tavern, his man u<U+017F>ed all the argument he could for to divert him from it, alledging there was bad Wine, ill Attendance, and the like; but all would not prevail, but that thither he went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the appointed time; Dinner being on the Table, the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Hou<U+017F>e was invited up for the <U+017F>ake of his good company, being a very jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and facetious man, at who<U+017F>e approach the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man knew not what to do. and had but one <U+017F>lender <U+017F>hift to keep him from being di<U+017F>covered, which he did by <U+017F>hutting one of his eyes as if he had been blind, and <U+017F>o continued keeping it <U+017F>hut whil<U+017F>t he <U+017F>erv'd at table; the Vintner <U+017F>tared him <U+017F>o much in the face that his Ma<U+017F>ter took notice thereof, and askt him why he gazed <U+017F>o much on his man; your pardon Sir, <U+017F>aid the Vintner, if I <U+017F>ay that your man is as like a fellow that cheated me of an eighteen <U+017F>hilling reckoning as ever I <U+017F>aw in my life, and I would <U+017F>wear that he is the <U+017F>ame but that this wants an eye, and the other had his <U+017F>ight perfect. At this the Ma<U+017F>ter askt his man how he came to be thus <U+017F>uddenly blind, having lo<U+017F>t an eye in le<U+017F>s than an hours time; at which the man replied, being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table crafty fellow, that if his Ma<U+017F>ter would be plea<U+017F>ed to forgive him, he would tell him the whole truth; his Ma<U+017F>ter granted it, and hereupon the Serving-man inform'd him, how he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by a pack of Knaves, and how to <U+017F>ecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57215:41"/>was forced to make his e<U+017F>cape; that to conceal him<U+017F>elf from the Vintners knowledg he had found out that <U+017F>tratagem of winking with one eye; the Ma<U+017F>ter was <U+017F>o well plea<U+017F>ed with the <U+017F>tory, that he pay'd the Vintner what was left to pay, and the Vintner was <U+017F>o well plea<U+017F>ed to have reocived a debt <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate, that he gave the Serving-man a crown, to help to open his eye again.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Tradewel</hi> heard the<U+017F>e Complaints with no <U+017F>mall confu<U+017F>ion and trouble of mind, but however to gratifie her own as well as her Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented to do herein what <U+017F>he would advi<U+017F>e her to. All that I reque<U+017F>t you to do, <U+017F>aid <hi>Su<U+017F>an,</hi> is to acquaint her Husband how ba<U+017F>ely your Husband hath abu<U+017F>ed his Bed, but make him <U+017F>wear he will not di<U+017F>cover one tittle you do relate to him; aggravate every circum<U+017F>tance in <U+017F>uch manner, that you may make his jealou<U+017F>ie <U+017F>well beyond all <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and rea<U+017F>on. This will put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>trange extravagant abu<U+017F>es at fir<U+017F>t, each of which will be a tickling plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and this in a little time al<U+017F>o will be the means to rid your <U+017F>elf of a Rival lodg'd within the bowels of all your concerns.</p>
                     <p>This advice was <U+017F>o well liked of by Mrs. <hi>Tradewel,</hi> that <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he had acquainted Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> with this <U+017F>ecret, which in effect was

Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> when he heard it was ready to run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracted, and could hardly be per<U+017F>waded but that he would either lay violently hands on him<U+017F>elf or Wife immediately; but being qualified by his own rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>uch as Mrs. <hi>Tradewel</hi> produced, he deferr'd his revenge till another time <hi>Su<U+017F>an</hi> thinking <U+017F>he had done as mueh mi<U+017F>chief as <U+017F>he could, re<U+017F>olv'd to be packing, and therein follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the example of the Rats (according to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) which will fly from a falling hou<U+017F>e: She took her opportunity, and getting together <U+017F>ome of her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es choice implements of gawdry, as a gold Watch, Pendents, Rings, a Neck-lace of Pearl, with other things of value, <U+017F>he tript off un<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, &amp; ab<U+017F>conded her <U+017F>elf for a while. Not long after Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> confe<U+017F>t a Judgment, or Warrant of Attorney to a <U+017F>pecial friend of his, for more by much than his own <U+017F>tock or Partners Mr. <hi>Tradewels</hi> would amount to; which was his fir<U+017F>t revenge on his di<U+017F>loyal Friend, what reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries he inflicted on his Wife, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, only you may imagine what an abu<U+017F>ed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will do in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, when prompted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by jealou<U+017F>ie and Revenge.</p>
