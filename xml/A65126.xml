            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Novel throws it <U+017F>elf at your Feet, and pays you Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as its Ma<U+017F>ter's Repre<U+017F>entative:</p>
            <p>It has been the product of <U+017F>ome lei<U+017F>ure hours, and will I hope do me this <U+017F>econd kindne<U+017F>s, to divert you in the Reading, as it did me in the Making. I need not, as others, give any rea<U+017F>on for the Dedication; <U+017F>ince to be made by me, is <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to entitle it yours:</p>
            <p>But that is not the only claim it can lay to your Favour; for in de<U+017F>cribing the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44408:3"/>
of this Novel, I borrow from you, not only her Name, but <U+017F>ome of the chief Beauties I adorn her with:</p>
            <p>Though you may imagine <U+017F>he had no mean ones of her own, <U+017F>ince (being but a private Gentlewoman) <U+017F>he could by their help alone make <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden a Conque<U+017F>t over the Heart of a Prince, who had certainly (in <U+017F>o many Courts as he had been in) <U+017F>een very agreeable Faces, <U+017F>et off with the additional Splendor of Quality, yet none of them had that effect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, which hers gained without tho<U+017F>e advantages. Be<U+017F>ides, her true Character <U+017F>uits very well with you:</p>
            <p>She was an Innocent Country Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ignorant of the Intrigues and Tricks of the Court Ladies; her Vertue, like yours, untainted and undecayed, needed none of their Artificial Embelli<U+017F>hments to guild it over; and that Innocence which appears eminently in both of you, as little wants the<U+017F>e Ladies Artifices to <U+017F>et it off, as you do their <hi>Fucus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44408:3"/>
for your Faces; <U+017F>ince true Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is as far beyond Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as your Colour is beyond all the Paint of the Town; in both of the<U+017F>e you give Nature as <U+017F>ignal a Triumph over Art, as ever <U+017F>he had in any two things what<U+017F>oever. I wi<U+017F>h I could liken you to her in one thing more; that is, That your Servant were of as high Quality as hers; but this wi<U+017F>h is made meerly for your <U+017F>ake:</p>
            <p>For to me, as you are more precious than a Crown, <U+017F>o is the Title of a Prince inferiour to that Glorious one, of being the</p>

            <p>THe Dutche<U+017F>s of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining once at her Table the Bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> <U+017F>ate fir<U+017F>t by the Duke her Husband, but the Duke removing her thence, <U+017F>he went and <U+017F>ate by the Bi<U+017F>hop, <U+017F>aying, That <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>it by him <U+017F>he loved be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he would next him <U+017F>he loved wor<U+017F>t:</p>
            <p>So dear dogged Reader, from writing an Epi<U+017F>tle to her I love be<U+017F>t, like the Dutche<U+017F>s, I change and remove to you whom I love wor<U+017F>t: for Writers hate none <U+017F>o much as Ill-natured Readers:</p>
            <p>Perhaps you'll ask, why then this Epi<U+017F>tle to you whom I hate, and not rather to the Good-natured? Why for the <U+017F>ame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that the Dutche<U+017F>s <U+017F>ate by <hi>Bonner,</hi> meerly to pa<U+017F>s my Je<U+017F>t on you; though another may be given, which is, That <U+017F>ince Prefaces were partly de<U+017F>igned to make the Reader Indulgent and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb facs="tcp:44408:4"/>
to the Book he is going to read, there's no need of a Preface to others, <U+017F>ince the Good-Natured will be kind to it of them<U+017F>elves; but 'tis you, that put us to the trouble of Prefacing. Therefore to indear it the more to you know, that the main Story is true, I heard of a Gentleman who was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Iri<U+017F>h</hi> Prince<U+017F>s, and knew all the Intrigue, and having from him <U+017F>o faithful a Relation of it, I made the Scene the very <U+017F>ame where it was tran<U+017F>acted, the time the <U+017F>ame, going on all the way with the Truth, as far as conveniency would permit; I only added <U+017F>ome few Circum<U+017F>tances, and interlined it with two or three other Stories, for variety <U+017F>ake, which is as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the <U+017F>etting off the true Relation, and making it plea<U+017F>ant, e<U+017F>pecially to you nice Readers, as Sauces are to the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing up a Di<U+017F>h of Meat, to provoke the <U+017F>ickly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite it is de<U+017F>ign'd for. I Printed it for the ea<U+017F>e of her whom it was made for; if you like it, much good
<pb facs="tcp:44408:5"/>
may do you; if you will not believe it, you have Liberty of Con<U+017F>cience; but whether you believe, or disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, like, or di<U+017F>like, is indifferent to me, <U+017F>ince in <U+017F>uch a trivial thing as this, I no more fear di<U+017F>credit by writing a bad one, than I could hope for Fame in writing it well. But I believe you are eager to <U+017F>ee what is in the Book, and therefore I'll detain you no longer.</p>

               <p>The States-man will tell you it is cau<U+017F>ed by want of Ambition; the Merchant for want of Self-Intere<U+017F>t; the Souldier for want of Action, and a thir<U+017F>t after Honour; and the Scholar will prove to you, that 'tis gotten by Idlene<U+017F>s:</p>

               <p>The Story that I am going

to relate will be an excellent proof of this, being an In<U+017F>tance of an extraordinary <U+017F>ort:</p>
               <p>It makes Love triumphant at once over two of the<U+017F>e his greate<U+017F>t Enemies, the Noi<U+017F>e of War, and the Vanity of Ambition; and <U+017F>hows you a Prince of great Valour, guarded equally by both of the<U+017F>e, could not defend him<U+017F>elf from the Powerful Eyes of a Forreigner, and one as far beneath him in Quality, as Love afterwards placed her above him, when he lay at her Feet imploring her Mercy.

in State through the Streets, at the head of a Party, more numerous than your Highne<U+017F>s's body of Souldiers; they huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za'd all the way, as if the King were going by; and methought I went in great Pomp, only my Triumph was after the <hi>Roman</hi> fa<U+017F>hion, with the Lictor behind me, who every now and then threat'ned me with Bridewell, the Stocks, and the Gibbet:</p>
               <p>In this manner I marched near half a mile to the Ju<U+017F>tice's, barefooted all the way, which I think of it <U+017F>elf was <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent pennance for my la<U+017F>t nights Debauch:</p>

You, Madam, if you have any <U+017F>uch thing as pity in you, will excu<U+017F>e me, and think that the <U+017F>hame, the lo<U+017F>s, and the cold I <U+017F>uffered might be <U+017F>ufficient cau<U+017F>e to make me angry with you, whil<U+017F>t I thought you one of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices.

drank of it as he de<U+017F>ired, but <U+017F>well'd with it as the others did, and dyed <U+017F>oon after in great torment. When the Well had grown famous by the exemplary deaths of the Perjured Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate Citizen, the Prince<U+017F>s declared <U+017F>he would drink of it too; and that the clearing of her <U+017F>elf might be as publick as her accu<U+017F>ation was, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent up to the King, who was then at <hi>Cork,</hi> to de<U+017F>ire that her Uncle him<U+017F>elf might be pre<U+017F>ent when <U+017F>he drank, to witne<U+017F>s her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; he excu<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, and would not go, but a great many of the Court coming thither to <U+017F>ee the Prince<U+017F>s clear her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he went in <U+017F>olemn Proce<U+017F><U+017F>ion barefoot, from the City to the Well; and taking up a gla<U+017F>s full of the Water, <U+017F>he prote<U+017F>ted her Innocence, and u<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ame imprecation with the others, if <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>peak the truth, drank it off; but in<U+017F>tead of working the <U+017F>ame effect on her, it in a little time cured her of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had, recovered her Health, and with it brought her <U+017F>o much Beauty, that all the neighbouring Princes were Rivals for her:</p>
               <p>She had de<U+017F>ign'd to build a Nunnery by that Well, but her Father dying left her the cares of a Crown, which diverted her from it:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44408:29"/>
But the Well was long after reverenced, and for the quality it had of di<U+017F>covering Uncha<U+017F>tity, it was much re<U+017F>orted to; for the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> (how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <U+017F>oever the partial Chronicles of other Nation report 'em) were too nice in Amour to take a polluted Wife to their Bed, as long as this Well would <U+017F>hew them which was a cha<U+017F>t one; but the wickedne<U+017F>s of after times grew too guilty to bear with <U+017F>uch Tryals; thence by difu<U+017F>e this Well lo<U+017F>t its Fame, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps its Vertue. And now I will no longer tell <U+017F>uch Tales, but leave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Lover to take his Lot as it comes. Pretty near this Well the Prince lay down, and being plea<U+017F>ed with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of its Stream running down a de<U+017F>cent of the Hill, that, and his want of Sleep the night before, tempted him to take it now; <hi>Morpheus</hi> was ready at his call, and waving his Leaden Rod o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, lull'd all his Sen<U+017F>es, till a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power than he re<U+017F>cued him from <U+017F>leep, to Charm him in a more prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling manner; for as he waked he heard one hemm, and found it was in order to Sing, for pre<U+017F>ently the unknown, with a ravi<U+017F>hing Air, began this Song.</p>

The Prince, methought, in my ab<U+017F>ence, had hidden him<U+017F>elf in my Bed-chamber, and, when I came in, <U+017F>tarted out upon me:</p>
               <p>He had on one <U+017F>ide of him a little wing'd Archer, who bent his Bow, and aimed at me <U+017F>everal times; but ju<U+017F>t by me there <U+017F>tarted up a great Gigantick form, with no other Arms but a Shield, and he, methought, <U+017F>till interpo<U+017F>ed that, and with it kept off the Arrows of the other; at length, methought, the Prince <U+017F>poke <U+017F>omething which tempted my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender over to his <U+017F>ide, and left me to the Mercy of the young Archer, who <U+017F>hot me through and through; and at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant the Prince came and catched me in his Arms, and told me I was his Pri<U+017F>oner, at which, methought, I <U+017F>wooned away with a plea<U+017F>ing pain, and at the fright of it I awaked. People <U+017F>ay Dreams are <U+017F>ignificant, if they are, tell me what you think is the meaning of this? Why truly, <hi>(<U+017F>aid the other)</hi> any one who <U+017F>hould hear you tell this, might gue<U+017F>s, without any great skill in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling, that you are in Love:</p>
               <p>If (<hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Marinda) I did think a little the day before upon the Prince, which might have been the cau<U+017F>e <hi>(as you <U+017F>ay)</hi> of this Dream, yet tho<U+017F>e thoughts were too

<U+017F>lightly grounded to be of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and I was in hopes in a day or two to have clearly rooted them out; and the next Afternoon one of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came to de<U+017F>ire my Company to a Ball, I was ready enough to accept of the proffer, becau<U+017F>e I imagined that the Mu<U+017F>ick and the Company would cure me of my thoughtfulne<U+017F>s; but (as my ill Fate would have it) it was clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for whom <U+017F>hould I meet at the Ball but the Prince; you were there, and <U+017F>aw how I was clearly put out of my Dance, with the confu<U+017F>ion his pre<U+017F>ence put me in:</p>
               <p>He <U+017F>ate down with me, and made me <U+017F>ome few Compliments, which tho', perhaps, were coveted by <U+017F>ome of the Company, yet had tho<U+017F>e Ladies <U+017F>een my in<U+017F>ide, as well as they did my out<U+017F>ide, they would rather have pitied, than envied me; 'twas he that <U+017F>ung under my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow la<U+017F>t night, and though you mi<U+017F>took him for your Servant, yet I knew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Voice too well:</p>
               <p>His words were <U+017F>o pathetical, and the Tune <U+017F>o moving, that though he had skill enough at the Guittar, which he plaid on, yet that kept not time with his Voice truer than my Pul<U+017F>e and Heart did. Have a care <hi>Marinda (<U+017F>aid the other)</hi> that you do

not engage too far with one who is <U+017F>o much above you; 'tis not <U+017F>afe Intriguing with Per<U+017F>ons of his Quality; Inferiour Lovers may be je<U+017F>ted with as long as we plea<U+017F>e, and thrown off at will, but <U+017F>uch as he <U+017F>eldom leave us without carrying away our Vertue, or at lea<U+017F>t our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</p>
               <p>And you will too late cur<U+017F>e your own Charms when they have expo<U+017F>ed you to be ruined (like a young Conjurer) by rai<U+017F>ing a Spirit which you are not able to lay. I fear (<hi>reply'd</hi> Marinda) he has <U+017F>py'd <U+017F>omething in my behaviour that (he fancied) favoured him, as Mens conceitedne<U+017F>s makes them too apt to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <U+017F>uch things; I am <U+017F>orry for it, if I did di<U+017F>cover any weakne<U+017F>s in my <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>hould encourage him to <U+017F>uch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:</p>

though I had been in his heart, for they were <U+017F>o different, that he <U+017F>carce knew what to make of them him<U+017F>elf:</p>
               <p>He cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had need of a great pre<U+017F>ence of mind, to re<U+017F>olve upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden what to do, whether to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf, or no:</p>

               <p>The Prince lay a while mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing on what he had heard, and then went home; he related it all to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and asked his advice what u<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould make of it: <hi>Celadon</hi> told him it was not the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t way to extort a confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love from her, by letting her know he had over-heard her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e that might make her angry at his hearkening, and <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>covery might be too violent for a Maiden Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>ty, and <U+017F>o nice a one as hers <U+017F>eemed

to be; he de<U+017F>ired him rather to continue his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o bring her by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a voluntary <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion; that this was the more natural and the <U+017F>urer way; that twice or thrice more being in her Company would en<U+017F>ure his Conque<U+017F>t over her; and what need was there to hazard her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, by forcing her to confe<U+017F>s <U+017F>he loved him, when he was well enough <U+017F>atisfied of it already? The Prince con<U+017F>ented to this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived this way to <U+017F>ee her; he knew the Town was <U+017F>o full of Souldiers, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hou<U+017F>e had <U+017F>ome of them in it, he thought hers quartered <U+017F>ome Officers, and enquiring out who they were, he told <hi>Celadon</hi> that he would go and <U+017F>ee them at their Lodgings:</p>

               <p>But we rarely found any <U+017F>uch want, for there being an irreconcileable Enmity, fir<U+017F>t between us and the <hi>Incas,</hi> and then

with tho<U+017F>e <hi>Indians</hi> who took part with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> we had <U+017F>o frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, they to extend their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and we to defend our own, that <U+017F>carce a day happened, but brought us in <U+017F>ome new Pri<U+017F>oners; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a great Colony at <hi>Cozco,</hi> and from thence they every now and then <U+017F>ent Parties far into our Countrey to take Booties, and make di<U+017F>coveries of the Land, in order to a farther Conque<U+017F>t:</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e Parties were commonly made up of <hi>Indians,</hi> with <hi>Spaniards</hi> to head them, becau<U+017F>e they would willingly <U+017F>pare their own Nation, and Conquer ours at the Natives expence.

               <p>On each <U+017F>ide of the River there was a con<U+017F>iderable Town, of which, the one was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by their Party, the other by ours; and though <U+017F>ometimes our Fi<U+017F>hermen would meet by chance and kill, or take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet we never gave one another a trouble<U+017F>ome vi<U+017F>it on <U+017F>hore, by rea<U+017F>on that

               <p>I <U+017F>treight leapt off my Quilt, and ran into my Father's Room, for when by the cry I knew our Enemies to be entered, I expected to lo<U+017F>e my Life, and therefore cho<U+017F>e to lay it down by him who gave it me:</p>
               <p>I found him in a great Con<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and hanging about his Neck, I expected the coming of our Enemies<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> The fir<U+017F>t who entered the Room was a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> for though I had never <U+017F>een one before, I knew him to be one by his Dre<U+017F>s, and a Helmet which he had on as <U+017F>oon as he entered, I left my Father, and fell at his Feet to beg both our Lives; and while I was in that po<U+017F>ture, he bade his Souldiers <U+017F>tay back; but one of them cryed out, <hi>This is the Cupay,</hi> (that is the Devil, or Conjurer) and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before the re<U+017F>t, ran at my Father with his Spear; the Commander imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately broke out of my Arms, which were cla<U+017F>ped about his Knees, and, draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Within an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came back, and pulling a Box out of his Pocket, he took a Plai<U+017F>ter out of it, and put it on my Father's wound, and bad me fear nothing; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring me, that he did not come to de<U+017F>troy us, but to reduce us to a better Government; and as for me, he told me, that if I plea<U+017F>ed, he would make me <U+017F>o happy, that I need not fear any danger, either of Poverty, or Captivity, from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of my condition:</p>

               <p>The noi<U+017F>e grew louder and louder, as it drew nearer, when looking out of the Window, we perceived the <hi>Antian</hi> party driving the <hi>Peruvians</hi> before them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could re<U+017F>olve what to do, they were killing his own Souldiers at the Door; he with a great deal of Courage leaped forward, and after all his men were kill'd defended the Door alone; and with his Spear laid the bolde<U+017F>t of them dead at his Feet:</p>

When I came to my <U+017F>elf, I was very glad to <U+017F>ee the poor Man delivered from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death, though it co<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's blood, but it almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tracted me, to think what a <U+017F>hort reprieve I had for him, only till the next day; his Fate was now at its Cri<U+017F>is, and within twenty four hours I mu<U+017F>t either <U+017F>ee him free, or mangled to pieces; all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hopes lay in deferring the time till another Guard came, which perhaps I could have bribed off, or till my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's mind was altered; but his Anger continued <U+017F>till; and becau<U+017F>e he found the Captain of the Guard as violent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as him<U+017F>elf, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to continue in the <U+017F>ame Po<U+017F>t, till all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Sacrificed:</p>
               <p>My poor Pri<U+017F>oner's Lot was come, and he to dye the next day, and I had not yet thought on any way that could prevent it:</p>
               <p>After having wracked my Invention a great while, for a way to free him, at la<U+017F>t I lighted on this:</p>
               <p>There were two of my Father's Servants, whom I <U+017F>ent formerly to row my Pri<U+017F>oner over the River; I knew they wi<U+017F>hed well to him, becau<U+017F>e when he enter'd our Hou<U+017F>e as an Enemy, he had <U+017F>aved their Lives; the<U+017F>e

two I acquainted with my de<U+017F>ign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea<U+017F>e him:</p>
               <p>I gave them a large Pot full of plea<U+017F>ant Liquor, made of our Sacred Plant the <hi>Coca,</hi> and bade them towards Night to bring that to the Guard-hou<U+017F>e, as a pre<U+017F>ent from my Father:</p>
               <p>Our Guard con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of a hundred Men, for the pre<U+017F>ervation of the Temple, and the Trea<U+017F>ures of it, and the Pri<U+017F>oners who belonged to it; <U+017F>o that all the<U+017F>e things might well require the care of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men:</p>
               <p>We had near twice the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Indian</hi> Pri<U+017F>oners, be<U+017F>ides the nine <hi>Spaniards,</hi> only they were Armed, the<U+017F>e were naked and tied:</p>
               <p>Out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I had got Arms enough for them all, and conveyed them into a Room hard by, to be ready upon occa<U+017F>ion; when the two Servants came with the Liquor, all the Souldiers crowded into the Guard-hou<U+017F>e, only two who <U+017F>tood to their Arms at the Pri<U+017F>on Door; when the Servants <U+017F>aw them all engaged about the drink, they left the Guard, and came to give me notice; upon which I took <U+017F>ome Daggers (which our Souldiers had taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and hung up in the Temple as Trophies) the<U+017F>e I hid under my Gown, (for the Women of our Nation had thin <U+017F>ilk Gowns to wear

               <p>When I came in I <U+017F>aw my Pri<U+017F>oner a<U+017F>leep, I cut the Cords of his Hands and Legs, and as I cut them he awaked and found him<U+017F>elf loo<U+017F>e; thence I went to another, and <U+017F>till as I loo<U+017F>ened them I put a Dagger in their Hands:</p>
               <p>I told them I was come to give them all Liberty, if they would <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves Men, and Conquer an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whom they would find <U+017F>urprized, and not ready to oppo<U+017F>e them. <q rend="inline italic">And my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tolfo (<U+017F>aid I)</hi> I have done all this for your <U+017F>ake, yet I will rather <U+017F>tay behind you, and undergo all the puni<U+017F>hments that an angry Father, or incen<U+017F>ed Town could inflict upon me, than fly with you, unle<U+017F>s you are as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive me, as I to go.</q> Several of the <hi>Indians</hi> wept for Joy, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> for all their Gravity, could <U+017F>carce forbear it:</p>
               <p>My Pri<U+017F>oner <U+017F>aid, that he was more glad of my Love, than of the <U+017F>aving his Life, and would have told me abundance of the like nature, had he not been interrupted; for one of the Centinels, not liking my long <U+017F>tay, came to <U+017F>ee what was the matter, and no <U+017F>ooner came in but he was <U+017F>tabb'd by one of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> my two Servants had

               <p>Some of the Guard, hearing a noi<U+017F>e, chanced to come out, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting <U+017F>omething more than ordinary alarm'd the re<U+017F>t, but they came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the late<U+017F>t, for we had as many Armed as they; they began a very bloody Engagement, and a great many were killed on both <U+017F>ides, but our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber increa<U+017F>ing we over-powered them, and they fled every way for <U+017F>afety. My Pri<U+017F>oner had given me in charge to <U+017F>ome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, and they kept me in Rear till the Guard fled:</p>

and there being abundance of Canoes, and the Enemy coming after us, you may gue<U+017F>s we did not <U+017F>tand to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who <U+017F>hould take Boat fir<U+017F>t:</p>
               <p>The eight <hi>Spaniards, A<U+017F>tolfo,</hi> the two <hi>Indians</hi> and my <U+017F>elf, took the <U+017F>ame Canoe:</p>
               <p>We put off altogether as fa<U+017F>t as we could, but in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time we were parted from the re<U+017F>t, the night being <U+017F>o dark that we knew not which way we went, though the Wind blew <U+017F>o hard from the other <U+017F>ide, that we were afraid 'twould force us on our Enemies Coa<U+017F>t, to our ruin:</p>
               <p>Two of our <hi>Spaniards</hi> tugg'd again<U+017F>t it as hard as they could, till one of them broke his Oar, and then we gave over <U+017F>triving, and let the Boat go down which way the River would carry it; the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we would have made for Shore, but having but one Oar the Wind beat us off, and carried us down all that day and the next night with the Stream.

               <p>I began to reflect on my former actions, and to think this a ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment for my undutiful leaving

The farther we Sailed the River <U+017F>till grew wider and wider; on one <U+017F>ide we could not Land, becau<U+017F>e the Wind would not let us, on the other <U+017F>ide we dur<U+017F>t not, becau<U+017F>e 'twas inhabited by tho<U+017F>e Nations who are mortal Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> We were now come down a great way, and the River had turned <U+017F>o, that the Wind, which before was again<U+017F>t us, now was for us; we made towards the Land with the greate<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te that a violent Hunger could make; as we came near the Shore we di<U+017F>covered a Boat lying under a Rock, we made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and <U+017F>aw only one Man in it, and he was a<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>o that we were upon him before he awaked; he would have re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, but finding it in vain for one Man to fight with eleven, he yielded up him<U+017F>elf and his Boat; in it we found <U+017F>tore of Victuals (the riche<U+017F>t prize we could have wi<U+017F>hed for at that time) and you may think we fell on to <U+017F>ome purpo<U+017F>e:</p>
               <p>We examined the Fellow, and he <U+017F>aid he belonged to a Ship which lay about

               <p>We <U+017F>tept into his Boat, and going down the River, in eight days time we came within <U+017F>ight of the Ship; then having got out of the Man what intelligence we thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary, we threw him over-board, and made up to the <U+017F>ide of the Pinnace; it being duski<U+017F>h, and they knowing their own Boat again, they mi<U+017F>took us for their own Men; <U+017F>o that half the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> entered, and had killed all that were above Deck, before they mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted any thing; the re<U+017F>t they took Pri<U+017F>oners, and (throwing all the Wounded Men into the Sea) becau<U+017F>e we had not Provi<U+017F>ions <U+017F>ufficient to la<U+017F>t us all, they <U+017F>et their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oners on Shore, and <U+017F>o came down the River merrily in a Ship of our own:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> fell to <U+017F>earching, and found <U+017F>ome Bullion in her, be<U+017F>ides a va<U+017F>t deal of ready money, which, after a ju<U+017F>t divi<U+017F>ion between us ten, we computed

               <p>The Man of War being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Captain <U+017F>aid he would re<U+017F>erve <hi>A<U+017F>tolfo</hi> and his eight Country-men to be tryed on Shore, and condemned to the Gallies:</p>

contrived to have it thought about Town, that <hi>Celadon</hi> had fallen into the Prince's di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; the Prince <U+017F>hewed the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>igns of it in Hou<U+017F>e, and they of the Hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>oon reported it abroad; <hi>Celadon,</hi> with a <U+017F>eeming di<U+017F>content, left the Prince, and went to Lodge with one of the Officers, at <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's:</p>
               <p>There was a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Cou<U+017F>in of <hi>Marinda</hi>'s, and her chief Confident, the <U+017F>ame whom the Prince had heard talking with her at the Well, the only comfort of her Parents, who were worth above ten thou<U+017F>and Ducats, of which, their Deaths would leave her the entire Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>our; <U+017F>he was withal very Witty, and good Humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but Nature and Fortune, who not often agree to be over-kind to the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on, had here followed their u<U+017F>ual Cu<U+017F>tom, making her want in Beauty, what <U+017F>he had in Riches:</p>
               <p>And as her Wit was keen, and <U+017F>harp, upon all that came into her Company, <U+017F>o Nature had given you an exact Copy of her in<U+017F>ide, by her out-<U+017F>ide; for her Face had as much of Satyr in it, as her Tongue; the Chin of it was <U+017F>harp and long, the No<U+017F>e tucked up, as if it fled from her Mouth, which was <U+017F>o wide, as if Nature
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44408:65"/>
had de<U+017F>igned it for <U+017F>ome Cormorant Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</p>
               <p>Her Face was all over <U+017F>tudded with Freckles, which, like the Stars in the milky way, lay <U+017F>o thick, that you would have thought it one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued yellowne<U+017F>s; only her Cheeks, which had a red Colour, but <U+017F>uch a tawny one, as that of bla<U+017F>ted Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries. This Gentlewoman was then in Town with <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Mother, who was her Aunt, and <U+017F>he was an excellent help to her Cou<U+017F>in, both diverting her from Melancholly with her Company, and helping her with her Advice:</p>
               <p>When <hi>Celadon</hi> came to Lodge there, he became acquainted with her; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that he once had <U+017F>ome di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e with her, while the Prince was entertaining her Cou<U+017F>in, he call'd to mind, how Witty and Plea<U+017F>ant he that time found her Conver<U+017F>ation:</p>
               <p>Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e, made them often in one anothers Company, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time they grew to a great Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Celadon,</hi> hearing what a con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fortune <U+017F>he had, made his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her in earne<U+017F>t, but found her <U+017F>till grow <U+017F>trange, when he <U+017F>poke to her of that, and therefore thought that <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary was the cau<U+017F>e of it:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44408:65"/>
in the mean time the Prince grew recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and as their falling out, was only a pretence for <hi>Celadon</hi>'s leaving him to Lodge there, <U+017F>o the Prince now made u<U+017F>e of that priviledge to his own advantage; for now <hi>Marinda</hi> could no longer avoid him; and though <U+017F>he did as often as <U+017F>he could, yet he came <U+017F>o often thither, that <U+017F>ometimes he lighted on her before <U+017F>he was aware: <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Chamber was on the <U+017F>ame floor with hers, and nothing but a <U+017F>mall Gallery divided them; her Chamber was ju<U+017F>t at the Stair-head, and the Prince would <U+017F>ometimes, as he came up Stairs, find her Door open, and then force him<U+017F>elf into her Company:</p>
               <p>He this way had frequent acce<U+017F>s to her, yet could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gain from her the lea<U+017F>t word in his Favour:</p>
               <p>In this po<U+017F>ture his Amour was, when an Expre<U+017F>s came to him, that the King had <U+017F>et out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> on his March to <hi>Limerick;</hi> the Prince gave the Officers notice to have all the Souldiers in Arms the next day to receive him:</p>
               <p>He went <U+017F>treight to <U+017F>ee <hi>Marinda,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he did not know but the King might take him along with him, as he came through the Town, and <U+017F>o not give him time to take his leave of her:</p>
               <p>He came into her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44408:66"/>
and being u<U+017F>ed to go often thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Celadon,</hi> went up Stairs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <U+017F>peaking to any body; not <U+017F>eeing her below, he went into her Room, but not finding here there, and <U+017F>eeing her Clo<U+017F>et-door open, and a Pen and Ink on the Table, he pulled the Door clo<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>at down to write a <hi>Billet Deux,</hi> which he intended to leave for her:</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Marinda</hi> came into the Room, and this Cou<U+017F>in with her, and <U+017F>itting down, they carried on a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the fir<U+017F>t words of which the Prince did not hear, but the following were to this purpo<U+017F>e:</p>
               <p>I tell you, <hi>Marinda, (<U+017F>aid the Stranger)</hi> 'tis in a happy hour for you, that the King is coming down, for he will take the<U+017F>e Souldiers with him, and this Prince, who is <U+017F>o ungentile to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ruin of a Gentlewoman:</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>carce blame him (<hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Marinda) for why <U+017F>hould a Man be blamed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecuting the way to his own happine<U+017F>s? Nor am I <U+017F>o conceited, as to aim at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; for what private Gentlewoman could nouri<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch vain hopes as tho<U+017F>e, of being rai<U+017F>ed to a Prince<U+017F>s? 'Tis more than a bare Prodigy, for Earthquakes, Inundations, and tho<U+017F>e wonders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do <U+017F>ometimes happen; but that a

               <p>But what <U+017F>hall I do with my Lovers? They are both going to the Camp, and will expect that I give them <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfactory an<U+017F>wer; and I do not know which way to incline; the one is a Captain of Hor<U+017F>e, he is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by my Father, but di<U+017F>liked by my Mother and me, becau<U+017F>e he is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<U+017F>t, and I have another cau<U+017F>e of aver<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him, that is, that he is a Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I don't fear that all his Country Jealou<U+017F>ie can make him <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious of <U+017F>uch a Face as mine; but tho<U+017F>e on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent make <U+017F>uch <U+017F>aucy domineering Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,

Then her pert Cou<U+017F>in took me up, telling me much the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tory that you over-heard her in, and de<U+017F>ired to know which of the<U+017F>e Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have:</p>
               <p>Your Highne<U+017F>s may imagine I gave the Verdict on my own <U+017F>ide:</p>
               <p>And after threatning her with all the ill fortune, that can be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Servant, I promi<U+017F>ed her as much happine<U+017F>s in my <U+017F>elf; and was <U+017F>o large in my own prai<U+017F>es, that it made me blu<U+017F>h, under my Veil, while I uttered them. She proffered me a reward for what Advice I gave her, yet would not tell me whether <U+017F>he would take it or no. But when I had parted with them, and thought the Joke was over, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ante<U+017F>t part of it was to come; for at the Door I met a pretty young Lady, who was come to pay a vi<U+017F>it to <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> I was at the Ball <hi>(<U+017F>ays <U+017F>he)</hi> when you profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed the faculty you have, in fore-telling Events, and now I have met you in a private Hou<U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t needs make tryal of it; <U+017F>aying this, <U+017F>he took me a<U+017F>ide, and having conjured me Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he told me, that <U+017F>he lived in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:44408:71"/>
and was ardently <U+017F>ollicited by one <hi>K—k,</hi> a great Officer in the Army; that he made her va<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>es of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and everla<U+017F>ting Affection; and <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to know whether he would prove Con<U+017F>tant, if <U+017F>he tru<U+017F>ted him:</p>
               <p>After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving looked fixedly on her Face, and the palms of her Hands, and u<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e impertinent Formalities, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fortune-tellers do, I bade her never doubt it, my Life for it he would prove true. She could not conceal the Joy <U+017F>he conceived, at my favourable an<U+017F>wer; and for my good news, and to bribe me to Secrecy, <U+017F>he clapp'd a <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> into my Hand. I hope your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s will not blame me, for cozening the poor Maid, for I thought it might prove my own ca<U+017F>e another time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire one to have the <U+017F>ame good Opinion of me, and therefore I thought I ought to do, as I would be done by. In the Street I was <U+017F>topped again, by a <U+017F>pruce Servant Maid, who making a low Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie or two, de<U+017F>ired me to look in her Hand, and give her a proof of my Skill; <U+017F>he brought me into a Kitchen, to a light, and <U+017F>hewed me her Hand, but begg'd me to be <U+017F>ecret, becau<U+017F>e it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned her Reputation:</p>
               <p>I told her, <U+017F>he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44408:72"/>
might <U+017F>peak freely to one who knew not her Name, nor was ever likely to <U+017F>ee her again. I am Courted <hi>(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he)</hi> by an Old Man, who is very Rich; I love a Young one, who as very poor:</p>
               <p>The Young one I dare not marry, for fear of Beggery; the Old one I mu<U+017F>t not, becau<U+017F>e I cannot endure him:</p>
               <p>In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty I would live as I am, were it not that the young Man took his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on me in the Critical minute; and now I mu<U+017F>t make choice of one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for fear of being with Child, and for ever di<U+017F>graced; tell me, in this ca<U+017F>e, which will thrive be<U+017F>t with me. I remember'd I was <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>till, for all my Habit, and therefore con<U+017F>idering the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities of tho<U+017F>e Youths, who<U+017F>e niggardly Fortune would not let them Marry, and the Dotage of feeble old Age, that will needs be Lovers, when their <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on's pa<U+017F>t, I advi<U+017F>ed her to Marry the Old Man, and keep the Young one; that way <hi>(<U+017F>aid I)</hi> you will enjoy the Love of the one, and the Riches of the other. Her Ma<U+017F>ter coming in at that time, and asking what I was, the Maid told him, I was a Fortune-teller:</p>
               <p>Go thy ways, Girl, <hi>(<U+017F>aid he)</hi> and leave me to <U+017F>peak a word to her:</p>
               <p>When <U+017F>he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44408:72"/>
was gone, he pulled out a Silver Groat, telling me, I <U+017F>hould have that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve him a que<U+017F>tion. Sir, <hi>(<U+017F>aid I)</hi> though I <U+017F>ometimes tell the Poor their Fortunes for nothing, yet I never do it to the Rich under half a piece. I am not one of your ignorant rambling Gyp<U+017F>ies; I'll tell you your Fortune, as it <U+017F>hall fall out to a Hair:</p>
               <p>Well, here's half a Piece for you, <hi>(<U+017F>aid he)</hi> if you tell it <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, for 'tis a thing of moment:</p>
               <p>I am about to marry a hand<U+017F>ome Girl; the only <U+017F>cruple I have again<U+017F>t it, is, that the<U+017F>e young Jigglets are <U+017F>o wild, that I fear 'twill be hard to keep her con<U+017F>tant; tell me therefore, whether <U+017F>he will be true to me, or no? What Age are you of, <hi>(<U+017F>aid I)?</hi> But three<U+017F>core and eight, <hi>(<U+017F>aid he):</hi> I looked in his Hand, and took his Gold, and told him, that the Virgin would prove as hone<U+017F>t to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marriage, as <U+017F>he was to her Vertue, before he Weds her. This was a true an<U+017F>wer, for I fancied it was his own Maid that he meant, and how hone<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was, I knew by her own Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I went away laughing at the folly of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous old Age, that would throw more Money away, towards the <U+017F>atisfying an impotent de<U+017F>ire, than he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44408:73"/>
have given a Phy<U+017F>ician, for the <U+017F>aving his Life. The Prince laugh'd at the plea<U+017F>ant u<U+017F>e which <hi>Celadon</hi> had made of his di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e; and they two debated for a while which was the greater weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, that of the Old Man, to tru<U+017F>t his Honour to a Young Woman's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; or that of the Maiden, to tru<U+017F>t hers to the Con<U+017F>tancy of an Officer. The Prince placed his own Folly in the fir<U+017F>t rank; and <U+017F>aid, it was greater than the other two, to tru<U+017F>t all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e and quiet of his Life, to the rigour of a di<U+017F>dainful Woman; to cringe to one that was beneath him, and <U+017F>ubmit him<U+017F>elf to one, who could not pretend to a higher Match, than one of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants:</p>
               <p>But when Love tock her part, it made him recant all the<U+017F>e Reflections, clad the meanne<U+017F>s of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in a lovelier dre<U+017F>s, and made it <U+017F>eem, either no fault at all, or one of the lea<U+017F>t, the mo<U+017F>t pardonable of his Life. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Celadon</hi>'s di<U+017F>cretion, in indulging her the hopes of Marrying him, for fear her Vertue <U+017F>hould otherwi<U+017F>e have made her <U+017F>hun him. The next morning word was brought to the Prince, that the King was near the Town:</p>
               <p>He drew up all his Men, in order to receive his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44408:73"/>
and after having ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his Hand, and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed with him, concerning the preparations requi<U+017F>ite to the Siege, the Prince came home to put all things in readine<U+017F>s for his next days March:</p>
               <p>But that which he accounted the chief, was to take his leave of <hi>Marinda.</hi> He found her alone in her Room; and though <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed unea<U+017F>ie, yet he con<U+017F>trained her to <U+017F>tay, and hear a long <U+017F>tory of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; which he <U+017F>et forth in the mo<U+017F>t prevailing words, accompanied with the mo<U+017F>t winning Carriage, that Art and Nature, joyned together, could invent. At la<U+017F>t he gain'd <U+017F>o much upon her, as that <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented to receive a Letter from him, while he was in the Camp. He came back to <hi>Celadon</hi> with a mixture of Gladne<U+017F>s and Sorrow; Gladne<U+017F>s at the favour <U+017F>he had granted him, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Writing to her; and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to think that he mu<U+017F>t purcha<U+017F>e that <U+017F>atisfaction at <U+017F>o dear a rate, as the lo<U+017F>s of her Company, as long as the Siege <U+017F>hould continue. I will not <U+017F>et down how many of the<U+017F>e Fits of Joy and Grief he had, whil<U+017F>t he was in the Camp; neither will I Romance <U+017F>o much, as to white down all the thoughts he had of her, and all the many wi<U+017F>e Dialogues
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44408:74"/>
he had with him<U+017F>elf about her; tho<U+017F>e the Reader can better imagine, than the Author tell; at lea<U+017F>t, if he has any of the <U+017F>ame Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion the Prince was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with:</p>
               <p>That will make him <U+017F>ympathize exactly with his Highne<U+017F>s's thoughts, as two Clocks, well made, keep time with one another. Thus much I know, that they were <U+017F>o impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with him, that they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be lull'd a<U+017F>leep, by the <U+017F>tillne<U+017F>s of the Night, nor diverted by the terrors of the Day:</p>
               <p>They kept him company continually, followed him even into the Enemies Trenches, and when Shot of all <U+017F>orts flew thicke<U+017F>t about his Ears, they were neither <U+017F>till'd by the noi<U+017F>e of the greater, nor frighten'd away by the <U+017F>mall. Among all the<U+017F>e thoughts, he did not forget tho<U+017F>e of writing to her; nor had he been three Weeks away, when calling to him one of his tru<U+017F>tie<U+017F>t Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he ordered him to take Hor<U+017F>e for <hi>Clonmell,</hi> and, with all the privacy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, deliver her this Letter.</p>

               <p>But Fortune had otherwi<U+017F>e ordered it, for <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> with an unu<U+017F>ual Bravery, marched with a <U+017F>mall Body of Hor<U+017F>e, farther into that part of the Country which was Subjected to the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Power, than they <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected he dur<U+017F>t; <U+017F>urprized the Convoy, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to pieces, burnt them, their Carriages and Provi<U+017F>ions, (which they brought for the Army) to a<U+017F>hes; <U+017F>ome of the Carriages he nailed up, and bur<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t; and the Army wanting them to batter the walls, and the ha<U+017F>ty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Winter, not giving them time to <U+017F>end for others, they rai<U+017F>ed the Siege; his Maje<U+017F>ty went for <hi>England;</hi> his Forces retired to their winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and our Prince to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.

               <p>Our Prince did not pretend to impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible Exploits, but as far as pure Natural Force, and Courage could go; he might have been ranked in the fir<U+017F>t File of the Army; he was not a<U+017F>hamed, that he could not do impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, but came back to <hi>Clonmell</hi> with as brisk a Look, and as glad a Heart, as if he had Routed <hi>Sarsfeild,</hi> and laid <hi>Limerick</hi> in A<U+017F>hes. The place where he Lodg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was made ready for him, but he had other de<U+017F>igns, and therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented <U+017F>ome of the other Officers with tho<U+017F>e Quarters, and cho<U+017F>e <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s Mothers for his.

               <p>The Prince rode up, and commanded them to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and let him know what was the cau<U+017F>e of their Quarrel; one of them gave him a <U+017F>hort An<U+017F>wer in <hi>Iri<U+017F>h,</hi> and at the <U+017F>ame time made a thru<U+017F>t at him with his Pitch-fork, which by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's <U+017F>udden <U+017F>purring his Hor<U+017F>e mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, and ran the Bea<U+017F>t into the belly, the Prince drawing out a Pi<U+017F>tol, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Iri<U+017F>hman</hi>'s Complement with a <U+017F>hot, and laid him dead at his Hor<U+017F>e's feet; he had done the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ervice with his other Pi<U+017F>tol, but that the Bea<U+017F>t en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the double wound which <hi>Teague</hi>'s weapon had given him, kick'd and flung <U+017F>o, that the Prince was forced to alight; the Man which waited on his Highne<U+017F>s, did more Execution with his Pi<U+017F>tols, and having with them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one, and wounded another, he alighted and drew his Sword to Fight by his Ma<U+017F>ter, who by this time had di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd two more, not without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great wound, which one of them with a half-pike had given him in the <U+017F>ide; the Prince enrag'd at that, fell
