         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THIS Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeds from a
weakne<U+017F>s and confu<U+017F>ion of the
Spirits, and is not only very
frequent, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
various, that it re<U+017F>embles almo<U+017F>t all
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es Mankind is <U+017F>ubject to: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hard Labour, or <U+017F>ome great di<U+017F>turbance
of the Mind, it occa<U+017F>ions an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> which
ends in a <hi>Pal<U+017F>ie</hi> of half the Body. Sometimes
it produces violent <hi>Convul<U+017F>ions</hi> very like
the <hi>Falling-Sickne<U+017F>s,</hi> and the<U+017F>e are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd <hi>Mother-fits.</hi> Sometimes it po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
the outward part of the head, cau<U+017F>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63569:8"/>
violent pain continually fixt in one part,
which may be cover'd with the top of the
Thumb, and violent Vomiting accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
this pain. It al<U+017F>o occa<U+017F>ions <U+017F>ometimes
a great Palpitation of the Heart, and
<U+017F>ometimes the Woman coughs without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termi<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
but <U+017F>pits up nothing. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ru<U+017F>hing violently upon the region
under the Heart, it cau<U+017F>es violent pain
much like the twi<U+017F>ting of the Guts, and
the Woman Vomits exceedingly, and ca<U+017F>ts
up a green Matter, and <U+017F>ometimes Matter
of an unu<U+017F>ual Colour; and often after the
Sick have been almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>troy'd by the <U+017F>aid
pain, and the reachings to Vomit, it is at
length carried off by the <hi>Jaundice</hi> tinctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <U+017F>urface of the Body like Saffron.
The Sick is much dejected, and De<U+017F>pair as
certainly accompanies this kind of Hy<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as the Pain and Vomiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd. When this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e falls
upon one of the Kidnies, it plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents
by the pain it cau<U+017F>es there a fit of the
<hi>Stone;</hi> and it is difficult to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it
from the <hi>Stone,</hi> unle<U+017F>s perchance <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
accident di<U+017F>turbing the Womans
mind a little before <U+017F>he was taken ill, <U+017F>hews
that it was an Hy<U+017F>teric Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Nor is
the Bladder free from this fal<U+017F>e Symptom;
for it does not only cau<U+017F>e pain there, but
it al<U+017F>o <U+017F>tops the Urin. Sometimes falling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63569:8"/>
upon the Stomach it cau<U+017F>es continual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
and <U+017F>ometimes a Loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s when it
is <U+017F>ettled upon the Guts, but no pain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
either of the<U+017F>e Symptoms.</p>
               <p>And as this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e afflicts almo<U+017F>t all the
inward parts, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ometimes it <U+017F>eizes all the
outward parts, occa<U+017F>ioning pain, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Swelling in the Jaws, Shoulders,
Hands, Thighs, Legs; but the Swelling of
the Legs is plainer <U+017F>een than the re<U+017F>t, and
contrary to Swellings in the Drop<U+017F>ie, is
mo<U+017F>t in the Morning; nor being pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
does it leave a pit, and mo<U+017F>t commonly it
<U+017F>wells only one of the Legs. Nor can
the Teeth free them<U+017F>elves from the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults
of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, tho they are not hollow;
and tho there is no apparent Defluction,
that may occa<U+017F>ion the pain, yet it is no
whit gentler nor <U+017F>horter nor ea<U+017F>ier Cured.
But the pain of the Back is mo<U+017F>t common,
which mo<U+017F>t certainly all feel, how little
<U+017F>oever they are afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.
Moreover this is common to the fore<U+017F>aid
pains, that the place whereon they were,
is tender and akes as if it were <U+017F>oundly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but this tenderne<U+017F>s goes off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
And this is worth ob<U+017F>erving, that
often a notable coldne<U+017F>s of the outward
parts makes way for the<U+017F>e Symptoms,
which for the mo<U+017F>t part does not go off
till the fit ends; which coldne<U+017F>s is almo<U+017F>t
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63569:9"/>
like that wherewith a Carca<U+017F>s grows <U+017F>tiff,
yet the Pul<U+017F>e is good. Moreover all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teric
Women complain of a dejection
and <U+017F>inking of the Spirits, and <U+017F>ometimes
laugh exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively, and at other times cry
as much, without any real cau<U+017F>e for either.
But the mo<U+017F>t proper and almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Symptom, is a Urin as clear as Rock-water.
Sometimes ill fumes are belched
up, and <U+017F>ometimes the Wind that comes
from the Stomach is <U+017F>ower ju<U+017F>t like Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
But their Minds are more affected
than their Bodies; for an incurable De<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is mixt with the very nature of the
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>A day would <U+017F>carce be <U+017F>ufficient to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up all the Symptoms belonging to this
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and I think <hi>Demetrius</hi> reckn'd
pretty right, tho he mi<U+017F>took the cau<U+017F>e of
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, when he <U+017F>aid, in an Epi<U+017F>tle
to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that the Womb was the
cau<U+017F>e of Six hundred Mi<U+017F>eries and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Calamities. The external cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e are either violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Body, or which is much oftner,
vehement di<U+017F>turbances of the Mind; to
the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>orders of the Mind which are u<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the occa<U+017F>ion of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, is to be
added emptine<U+017F>s of the Stomach by rea<U+017F>on
of long fa<U+017F>ting, inmmoderate Bleeding, a
Vomit or Purge that works too much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63569:9"/>
In order to the cure, I order that eight
Ounces of Blood be taken from the right
Arm, and that the following Plai<U+017F>ter be
apply'd to the Navel.</p>
               <p>Take of Galbanum di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in Tincture of
Ca<U+017F>tor and <U+017F>train'd three Drachms, of Tacama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haca
two Drams, mix them, make a Plai<U+017F>ter.</p>
               <p>The next Morning let her u<U+017F>e the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pills.</p>
               <p>Take of the Pill Coch-major two Scruples,
of Ca<U+017F>tor powder'd two Grains, of Peruvian
Bal<U+017F>am four drops, make four Pills; let her
take them at five in the Morning, and <U+017F>leep
after; repeat them twice or thrice, every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or every other Morning, according to the
Womans <U+017F>trength, and as they work.</p>
               <p>Take of the Waters of Black-Cherries, Rhue,
and Compound Briony, each three Ounces; of
Ca<U+017F>tor ty'd up in a rag, and hanged in the Viol
half a Dram; of Fine Sugar a Sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
make a Julep, whereof let her take four
or five Spoonfulls when <U+017F>he is faint, dropping
into the fir<U+017F>t do<U+017F>e, if the fit is violent, twenty
drops of the Spirit of Harts-horn.</p>
               <p>After the Purging Pills ju<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cribed are
taken, let her u<U+017F>e the following.</p>
               <p>Take of the filings of Steel eight Grains,
with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of extract of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
make two Pills, let her take them early
in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon,
for Thirty days, drinking upon them a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63569:10"/>
draught of Wormwood Wine. Or if <U+017F>he like a
Bolus better;</p>
               <p>Take of the Con<U+017F>erves of Roman Wormwood,
and of the yellow peel of Oranges each one
Ounce, of Angelica and Nutmegs candied and
of Venice Treacle each half an Ounce, of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Ginger two Drachms, make an electuary
with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges.</p>
               <p>Take of this electuary one Drachm and an
half, of the filings of Steel well rub'd eight
Grains, make a Bolus with a <U+017F>ufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Syrup of Oranges, to be taken in the
Morning, and at five in the Evening, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it a Gla<U+017F>s of Wormwood-wine.</p>
               <p>Take of choice Myrrh and Galbanum each
one Drachm and an half, of Ca<U+017F>tor fifteen
Grains, with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Bal<U+017F>am
Peru, make twelve Pills of every Drachm; let her
take three every Night, and drink upon them
three or four Spoonfuls of Compound Briony
Water through the whole cour<U+017F>e of this proce<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>But if the<U+017F>e Pills move the Body, which
<U+017F>ometimes they do in Bodies that are very
ea<U+017F>ily purged, the following may be u<U+017F>ed
in<U+017F>tead of them.</p>
               <p>Take of Ca<U+017F>tor one Drachm, of Volatile Salt
of Amber half a Drachm, with a <U+017F>ufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of extract of Rue, make twenty-four
<U+017F>mall Pills, let her take three every Night.</p>
               <p>But Steel Medicines, which mu<U+017F>t be noted,
occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ometimes in Women great di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63569:10"/>
both of Body and Mind, and not
only on the fir<U+017F>t days, which is u<U+017F>ual almo<U+017F>t
in every body, but al<U+017F>o all the time they
are taken: In this ca<U+017F>e the u<U+017F>e of Steel mu<U+017F>t
not pre<U+017F>ently be interrupted, but Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
mu<U+017F>t be given every night for <U+017F>ome
time in <U+017F>ome Hy<U+017F>teric water that they may
the better bear it.</p>
               <p>But when the Symptoms are mild, and
it <U+017F>eems the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Steel, I think it <U+017F>ufficient to Bleed and
to Purge three or four times, and then to
give the altering Hy<U+017F>teric Pills above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
morning and evening for ten days,
which method <U+017F>eldom fails, when the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e
is not violent, yea the Pills alone
Bleeding and Purging being omitted, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a great deal of good.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>ome Women can't bear Hy<U+017F>teric
Medicines, and are much injured thereby,
therefore they mu<U+017F>t not be given to <U+017F>uch.</p>
               <p>If the Blood is <U+017F>o very feeble, and the
confu<U+017F>ion of the Spirits <U+017F>o great, that Steel
ordered to be u<U+017F>ed according to the method
pre<U+017F>cribed is not <U+017F>ufficient to cure the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e,
the Sick mu<U+017F>t drink <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters
or the like, for they cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
than any preparation of Iron; but
if in drinking of them any Sickne<U+017F>s happen
that belongs to Hy<U+017F>teric Symptoms, the
Sick mu<U+017F>t forbear drinking them a day or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63569:11"/>
two, till that Symptom that hindred their
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is quite gon. And it is to be noted,
that Purging mu<U+017F>t be avoided all the time
the Woman drinks the<U+017F>e waters. But if
this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e does not yeild to Steel-waters,
the Sick mu<U+017F>t go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and when <U+017F>he
has u<U+017F>ed the waters of it three mornings
following, the next day let her go into the
<hi>Bath,</hi> and the day following let her drink
them again, and <U+017F>o let her do by turns for
two months, for in the<U+017F>e and others of what
kind <U+017F>oever they are, the Patient mu<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
in the u<U+017F>e of them till <U+017F>he is quite well:
<hi>Venice-treacle</hi> u<U+017F>ed often and a long time is
a great remedy in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Spani<U+017F>h-wine,
with Gentian, Angelica, Worm-wood,
Centory, and other <U+017F>trengthening
things infus'd in it, does a great deal of good,
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>poonfuls of it being taken thrice a
day, if the Woman be not thin and of a
cholerick habit of Body. And truly a large
draught of Spani<U+017F>h-wine taken by it <U+017F>elf at
bed-time for <U+017F>ome nights has been very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to <U+017F>ome Women. Je<U+017F>uits-powder
al<U+017F>o wonderfully comforts and invigorates
the Blood and Spirits, a Scruple of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken morning and evening for <U+017F>ome
weeks.</p>
               <p>But if the Remedies above-mentioned
don't well agree, which often happens in
thin and choleric Con<U+017F>titutions, then a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63569:11"/>
Milk-dyet may be u<U+017F>ed, for <U+017F>ome Women
(which one would wonder at at fir<U+017F>t) that
have been a long while afflicted with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teric
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and could be relieved no
other way, have been recovered by Diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them<U+017F>elves for <U+017F>ome time only with
Milk; and e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e that Labour
with an Hy<U+017F>teric Cholick, which can't be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>ed
by any thing but Opiates, to which
repeated Women are much accu<U+017F>tom'd,
the pains returning as <U+017F>oon as the vertue
of the Opiate fades. But riding on Hor<U+017F>e
back or in a Coach every day for a long
while is the be<U+017F>t remedy.</p>
               <p>This is the general way of Curing this
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which is apply'd to the original
cau<U+017F>e, namely, the weak con<U+017F>titution of
the Blood, and <U+017F>o is to be u<U+017F>ed only when
the Fit is off, therefore as often as the Fit
comes join'd with any one of the fore-<U+017F>aid
Symptoms, if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>o great
an one that it will not bear a Truce till it
may be cured by Medicines that <U+017F>trengthen
the Blood and Spirits, we mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently
make u<U+017F>e of Hy<U+017F>teric Medicines, which
by their <U+017F>trong and offen<U+017F>ive <U+017F>mell, recall
the di<U+017F>orderly and de<U+017F>erting Spirits to their

inwardly or <U+017F>melt to, or outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<U+017F>uch are A<U+017F><U+017F>a-faetida, Galbanum, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63569:12"/>
has a very ungrateful and offen<U+017F>ive <U+017F>mell.</p>
               <p>In the next place you mu<U+017F>t take notice,
that if <U+017F>ome intollerable pain accompanied
the fit, or violent Vomiting, or a Loo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
then be<U+017F>ides the Hy<U+017F>terics above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
Laudanum is to be u<U+017F>ed, which
is only able to re<U+017F>train the<U+017F>e Symptomes.
But in quieting the pains which Vomiting
occa<U+017F>ion we mu<U+017F>t take great care that they
are not mitigated either by Laudanum or
any other Opiat before due evacuations
have been made, unle<U+017F>s they exceed almo<U+017F>t
all humane patience. Therefore in lu<U+017F>ty
Women and <U+017F>uch as abound with Blood a
Vein mu<U+017F>t be opened, and the Body purged,
e<U+017F>pecially if they have been lately <U+017F>eized
with the fit. But if weak Women and tho<U+017F>e
of a quite contrary Con<U+017F>titution labour with
<U+017F>uch a fit and pain, and have been afflicted
with it not long ago, it will be <U+017F>ufficient to
clean<U+017F>e their Stomachs with a gallon of Po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>et
drink taken in and ejected by Vomiting,
and then to give a large Do<U+017F>e of Venice-Treacle,
and a few <U+017F>poonfuls of <U+017F>ome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
Liquor, that is plea<U+017F>ing to the ta<U+017F>te,
with a few drops of Liquid Laudanum, to
be taken pre<U+017F>ently after. But if the Sick
has Vomited a great while, and there is
danger le<U+017F>t by a further provocation by
Vomits the Spirits <U+017F>hould be put into a rage,
and the Sick too much weakened, in this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63569:12"/>
ca<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t give Laudanum without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and <U+017F>uch a Do<U+017F>e that is <U+017F>ufficient to
vanqui<U+017F>h it.</p>
               <p>But here two things are to be chiefly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
fir<U+017F>t that when you have once begun
to u<U+017F>e Laudanum after due and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
evacuations, it mu<U+017F>t be taken in the <U+017F>ame
Do<U+017F>e, and mu<U+017F>t be often repeated till the
Symptom is quite conquered: only <U+017F>uch a
<U+017F>pace mu<U+017F>t be betwixt each Do<U+017F>e, that we
may know what the former has done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we give another: and then when we
treat the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e with Laudanum, we mu<U+017F>t
do nothing el<U+017F>e, and nothing mu<U+017F>t be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,
for the gentle<U+017F>t Gli<U+017F>ter of milk and
<U+017F>ugar is <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>poil whatever has
been repaired by the Laudanum, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
a return of the Vomiting and pain.
But though the Pains above mentioned are
apt to overcome the vertue of the Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
yet violent Vomiting indicats the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t
Do<U+017F>e of it, and that it <U+017F>hould be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated, for by rea<U+017F>on of the Vomiting,
the Laudanum is ca<U+017F>t up before it can do
any good, unle<U+017F>s it be given afre<U+017F>h after
every time the Sick Vomits, and chiefly in
a <U+017F>olid form, and if it be given in a liquor
the quantity mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall that it mu<U+017F>t
but ju<U+017F>t wet the Stomach, <U+017F>o that by rea<U+017F>on
of the <U+017F>mall quantity of the matter it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ca<U+017F>t up, for in<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>ome drops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63569:13"/>
of Liquid Laudanum in one <U+017F>poonful of
<U+017F>trong Cinnamon-water, or the like; and the
Sick mu<U+017F>t be admoni<U+017F>hed to keep her <U+017F>elf
quiet pre<U+017F>ently after taking the Laudanum,
and that <U+017F>he keep her Head as much as is
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible immoveable, for the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Head provokes Vomiting more
than any thing el<U+017F>e; and when the Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cea<U+017F>es, and is as it were tam'd, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to give a Do<U+017F>e of Laudanum morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening to prevent a relap<U+017F>e, which
al<U+017F>o ought to be ob<U+017F>erved after a Loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s,
or Hy<U+017F>teric pains.</p>
               <p>And becau<U+017F>e frequent mention has been
made of Liquid Laudanum in this Chapter,
and it is much u<U+017F>ed in other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

the be<U+017F>t way of making it.</p>
               <p>Take of Spani<U+017F>h-wine one pint, of Opium two
ounces, of Saffron one ounce, of the Powders of
Cinnamon and Cloves each one Drachm; let them
be infu<U+017F>ed together in a Bath for two or three
days, till the liquor comes to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of a

               <p>If this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceed from an hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies

<U+017F>ome great di<U+017F>turbance happening when the
Cour<U+017F>es are near flowing; it comes al<U+017F>o
from Ob<U+017F>tructions of the Womb, or by
rea<U+017F>on of violent Pains, and great Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
of the upper Parts, al<U+017F>o from the weakne<U+017F>s
of them, when the VVomb and lower Parts
are <U+017F>trong; for the weak Parts always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what the <U+017F>tronger put upon them.
It al<U+017F>o comes from <U+017F>ome external Cau<U+017F>e,
as by drinking cold Water un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably,

Cour<U+017F>es are near.</p>
               <p>The Scope of the Cure is Two-fold,
the Fir<U+017F>t is the Evacuation of the Blood
abounding, the other is the Recalling of it
to the lower Parts, which is chiefly done
by Cooling the upper Parts, and by Heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Moi<U+017F>tning, and Opening, the lower
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63569:17"/>
Parts; but both may be well an<U+017F>wered by
Bleeding in the Foot three or four days
before the Blood flows, and by applying
Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to the Thighs Legs and
Hips, <U+017F>ometimes Dry, but mo<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with Scarification, and al<U+017F>o by
provoking the Hemorrhoids, by Frictions,
by Walking, by hot Baths natural or

But if it proceed from a Vice of the whole

a peculiar Cure, and is a Symptom of the

either becau<U+017F>e it is hindred by the ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or a gro<U+017F>s Humour that Ob<U+017F>tructs.
The Cau<U+017F>es therefore are the<U+017F>e three, which

Cour<U+017F>es, <hi>viz.</hi> the weakne<U+017F>s of the Faculty,
the fault of the Humours, and the dulne<U+017F>s
of the Sen<U+017F>e. The impotence of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is occa<U+017F>ioned by the frigidity, or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
of the Temperament, or by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Figure of the In<U+017F>trument; the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is faulty upon the account of its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>iccity and clammine<U+017F>s: The Sen<U+017F>e
is rendred dull mo<U+017F>t commonly by moi<U+017F>ture
abounding. The weak Faculty by rea<U+017F>on
of Frigidity, is known by the Womans
perceiving a weight and di<U+017F>turbance after
the time of the coming of her Cour<U+017F>es is
pa<U+017F>t. The fault of the In<U+017F>trument may be
known by what went before, as by hard
labour, a tumour, cicatrix, leaping or a
fall, whereby the Womb, or a part <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervient
to it is di<U+017F>placed, or the figure of
it deformed. The fault of the Humour
may be known by tho<U+017F>e things that are
evacuated by the Blood, as if it be whiti<U+017F>h
it may be <U+017F>een, if it be gro<U+017F>s and clammy,
a <U+017F>edentary life, and a gro<U+017F>s and flegmatic
Diet went before; the Woman is of a <U+017F>oft,
pale and leaden habit of body, and is fat;
and by the Bloods flowing <U+017F>lowly, and by the
long continuance of the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>ometimes,
and by their ending in a <U+017F>lime. If when
they <U+017F>tay a long time before they come,
the Woman does not perceive any di<U+017F>turb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Womb and neighbouring Parts,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63569:20"/>
the Sen<U+017F>e is dull. If the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e ari<U+017F>e from
a thick and clammy Humour, as it does
mo<U+017F>t commonly, it mu<U+017F>t be cured accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fir<U+017F>t, by a thin and heating Diet, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate

Secondly, by attenuating and heating Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>THere is <U+017F>carce any thing that does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb
Phy<U+017F>icians more, and which
makes them err <U+017F>o much, as the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Cour<U+017F>es with Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and
this happens chiefly <U+017F>ix ways. Fir<U+017F>t, When
a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e happens ju<U+017F>t when the Cour<U+017F>es are
about to come. Secondly, If by rea<U+017F>on of
the inva<U+017F>ion of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, the Cour<U+017F>es come
before their due time. Thirdly, If the
time of the Cour<U+017F>es and of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
are complicated, <U+017F>o that they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Fourthly, If the Cour<U+017F>es being <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
delayed or le<U+017F><U+017F>ened, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
comes upon them upon an other account.
Fifthly, If by rea<U+017F>on of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>ting,
a <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion or delay of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
is the cau<U+017F>e of the increa<U+017F>e of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
and its Symptoms. Sixthly, If when
there is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, the Cour<U+017F>es flow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63569:22"/>
If therefore the Cour<U+017F>es are ju<U+017F>t about
to flow, when the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is beginning, or
in the proce<U+017F>s of it, we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider
whether the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be one of tho<U+017F>e, which
is occa<U+017F>ioned by the Womb, in which ca<U+017F>e
if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e requires bleeding without
any delay, we mu<U+017F>t draw it from the foot,
that it may be let out by a convenient
way, that the Womb may be evacuated,
and the cau<U+017F>e expelled. But if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
ari<U+017F>es from the whole Body, or from
<U+017F>ome principal member of it; that Vein
of the Arm (mo<U+017F>t affirm) mu<U+017F>t be opened,
which chiefly re<U+017F>pects the part affected:
but this opinion, if it be generally received,
<U+017F>eems to me injurious, and we ought rather
to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h concerning the number of
the days, the acutene<U+017F>s of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and
the plenitude of the Body; for if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
be not acute, Blood ought to be
drawn from the Foot, and e<U+017F>pecially, if the
Woman be within three or four days of
her Cour<U+017F>es, and in this ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he ought to
be blooded in the Foot, although the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
be acute, and this both rea<U+017F>on and
experience confirms; for Nature is to
be evacuated that way <U+017F>he tends, if it be a
convenient place; for if the Woman be
blooded in the upper parts, we often <U+017F>ee
that <U+017F>he becomes delirious, and that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<U+017F>leepy Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63569:23"/>
and at length Death it <U+017F>elf follow. But
if there be eight days, or thereabouts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of the Cour<U+017F>es, and there is a
great plenitude, and the Woman cannot
be <U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficiently evacuated by the Foot,
as the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e requires, then all agree that
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be blooded in the Arm, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be acute; but purging
Medicines, Vomits, and Sudori<U+017F>icks mu<U+017F>t
be deferred till the Cour<U+017F>es are over, or
you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that are very gentle,
le<U+017F>t Nature <U+017F>hould be hindred, or divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for if <U+017F>o, the Blood may be un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
detained, or may ru<U+017F>h upon <U+017F>ome
principal part, or increa<U+017F>e the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.
But if it happen that the Womans Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
are procra<U+017F>tinated, it is lawful to
Purge; for <U+017F>ometimes we <U+017F>ee that Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brings the Cour<U+017F>es. If the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be
Chronical, it is be<U+017F>t to Purge eight days
after the Cour<U+017F>es are gon off.</p>
               <p>But if the Cour<U+017F>es come before their
due time in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, which is the <U+017F>econd
way of complication, nothing in curing
Womens Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es is <U+017F>o difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
e<U+017F>pecially at the beginning of the
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, before univer<U+017F>al Remedies have
been given; for at other times if we do
nothing, there is the le<U+017F>s perplexity; but if
at the beginning you Bleed or Purge, you
hinder the men<U+017F>truous Purgation, and if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63569:23"/>
you do neither, the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e increa<U+017F>es.
Tho<U+017F>e things that are proper for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>top the Cour<U+017F>es; and if they flow,
they do not relieve the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e
they are then Symptomatical; for <U+017F>uch
an evacuation, is almo<U+017F>t always pernicious
at the beginning of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at that time <U+017F>eldom promotes any
u<U+017F>eful evacuation; wherefore we mu<U+017F>t
diligently con<U+017F>ider what good or hurt
comes from it, and from what cau<U+017F>e the
anticipation of the Cour<U+017F>es in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
proceeds; for in the beginning and in the
increa<U+017F>e, as we <U+017F>aid, it is full of danger,
but in the <U+017F>tate and declination, the crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Cour<U+017F>es, if they flow ea<U+017F>ily, is
wont to be advantageous, by rea<U+017F>on of the
fitne<U+017F>s of the Sea<U+017F>on for evacuation, if it
be not complicated with <U+017F>ome other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
of Nature. The Anticipation of
the Cour<U+017F>es proceeds from many cau<U+017F>es:
but from whatever cau<U+017F>e it come, if there
be a plenitude, the Cure mu<U+017F>t be begun
by bleeding in the Foot. But if the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
flow at their accu<U+017F>tomed time, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to come at the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
you mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t wait on Nature, and
if after twelve hours the Flux is not, or is
not like to be <U+017F>ufficient, you mu<U+017F>t bleed
in the Foot, to compleat the natural eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
of the Woman; and moreover,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63569:24"/>
you mu<U+017F>t take away <U+017F>o much Blood, as
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e requires, for we mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>pect
Cu<U+017F>tom and the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e too, and this may
be under<U+017F>tood of violent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; yet it is
chiefly to be u<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>mall ones; and
therefore that they <U+017F>hould not grow to be
violent, you mu<U+017F>t incourage the Cour<U+017F>es
by all means, by Ligatures, Frictions, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itories,
Gli<U+017F>ters, and other things, which
are <U+017F>ufficient to provoke the parts near the
Womb; and if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e ari<U+017F>e from a
cold cau<U+017F>e, you mu<U+017F>t give <U+017F>uch Medicines
as promote the Cour<U+017F>es, and al<U+017F>o re<U+017F>pect
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: But if a Purge be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary,
you mu<U+017F>t defer it till the Cour<U+017F>es are over,
le<U+017F>t the Blood being moved and di<U+017F>turbed
thereby, greater mi<U+017F>chief <U+017F>hould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ioned.</p>
               <p>But if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be one of the greate<U+017F>t,
as a Quin<U+017F>ey, Fren<U+017F>y, Pluri<U+017F>ie, or an acute
Fever, you mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t bleed in the Foot,
afterwards the <U+017F>ame day, you mu<U+017F>t bleed
in the Arm; but in the mean while you
mu<U+017F>t apply Ligatures to the Legs whil<U+017F>t
the Blood flows, and this is good Practice;
for the Indication of the mo<U+017F>t violent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
is always to be re<U+017F>pected before that
Indication which is taken from the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
and in the <U+017F>ame manner you mu<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the other Sea<U+017F>ons of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
wherein you ought to defer Purging, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63569:24"/>
and Sweat, if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e requires
them, till the Cour<U+017F>es are gone off; for the
Indication of the Cour<U+017F>es is greater than
the Indications of the<U+017F>e helps, unle<U+017F>s a
Sanies flow beyond the appointed time,
which is not to be accounted at that time
to proceed from fulne<U+017F>s, and in this ca<U+017F>e,
an Indication for purging being urgent,
you may Purge.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Ca<U+017F>e was, when upon the
Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>topt a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e came. In this ca<U+017F>e
we mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider whether the Cour<U+017F>es
are but now <U+017F>topt, or whether they have
been <U+017F>topt a long while; and moreover,
whether the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeds from this
<U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for if it ari<U+017F>e from hence, you
mu<U+017F>t without doubt bleed in the Foot fir<U+017F>t,
nor mu<U+017F>t we Purge, Vomit, or Sweat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and afterwards in the Arm, if the
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e require it, e<U+017F>pecially if it be four
days pa<U+017F>t the accu<U+017F>tomed time of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.
But if the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion be new, and
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e not urgent, before you u<U+017F>e
other means, you mu<U+017F>t expect a while the
flowing of the Cour<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially if you
do not under<U+017F>tand rightly the nature of
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; for it is more <U+017F>ecure, the
Cour<U+017F>es being <U+017F>topt to bleed in the Foot
than to Purge, Vomit, or Sweat. But if
notwith<U+017F>tanding bleeding in the Foot, the
Cour<U+017F>es flow but <U+017F>lowly, you ought to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63569:25"/>
give <U+017F>uch Medicines as move them; and it
will be proper to give them before they
begin, if you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that Nature will not
do the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s throughly her <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>But if the Cour<U+017F>es delay, and the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
grows wor<U+017F>e thereby, mo<U+017F>t affirm that the
Cure mu<U+017F>t be begun by tho<U+017F>e helps, which
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e and its Cau<U+017F>e require, without
re<U+017F>pect to bleeding in the Foot. But I am
not of the <U+017F>ame Opinion; for in <U+017F>light Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es,
and in <U+017F>uch as will bear a Truce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has taught me that it is be<U+017F>t to
bleed in the Foot; for the indication from
the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>topt is more to be minded than
a <U+017F>mall Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and therefore they ought
to be provoked, fir<U+017F>t by Ligatures, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,
Frictions, and Medicines, and
afterwards you mu<U+017F>t provide for the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e:
But if the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be violent, as a
Quin<U+017F>ie, Pleuri<U+017F>ie, or the like; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
tho<U+017F>e Remedies mu<U+017F>t be given which
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e requires, without con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Veins of the Foot.</p>
               <p>But when the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould come at the
time of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and are <U+017F>topt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e and its Cau<U+017F>e, without
doubt we ought to bleed in the Foot, and
to take away <U+017F>o much Blood, as the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Womb requires, or till the
Cour<U+017F>es flow, and if there be occa<U+017F>ion we
may Purge gently, and not divert the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63569:25"/>
Cour<U+017F>e of Nature. La<U+017F>tly, if when the
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is pre<U+017F>ent, the Cour<U+017F>es flow by drops
before their time, you mu<U+017F>t proceed as in
the <U+017F>econd Ca<U+017F>e concerning the Anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Cour<U+017F>es in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: Or, if it
happen at their due time, you mu<U+017F>t treat
them as in the third Ca<U+017F>e when the Cour<U+017F>es
happen with the Sea<U+017F>ons of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e;
only the dropping of the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>ignifies
a greater oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requires larger bleeding.</p>

               <p>THis Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is like a Dy<U+017F>ury or adifficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

with the Cour<U+017F>es; the Blood comes by
drops and is attended with violent Pain.
This Symptom comes upon an Ob<U+017F>truction
of the Cour<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ometimes upon Solution
of the Continuum, an Ulcer, Ero<U+017F>ion, and
painful di<U+017F>orders in the neighbouring parts,
The Cour<U+017F>es, as was <U+017F>aid before, come <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F>orderly.</p>
               <p>It is mo<U+017F>t commonly occa<U+017F>ioned by the
<U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>es from whence a <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
the Cour<U+017F>es proceeds, but gentler; for there
is not a total Suppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but an unequal
Ob<U+017F>truction of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Womb,
by rea<U+017F>on of thick clotted, and feculent
blood, which <U+017F>tretches the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
violently endeavouing to Evacuate it,
a gro<U+017F>s wind ari<U+017F>es, which di<U+017F>tending the

the violent pain, which continues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the clods are ejected. Sometimes the
Blood flows plentifully, yet the Cour<U+017F>es are
counted difficult and le<U+017F><U+017F>ened; becau<U+017F>e tho
a great quantity is evacuated, yet it is not
an<U+017F>werable to the plenitude. The <U+017F>econd
Cau<U+017F>e is an Ulcer, or <U+017F>ome preternatural
Tumour in the Womb or neighbouring
parts, which are provoked and hurt by the
commotion of the Blood. The third is the
acrimony of the Humours. This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
is known by a pain in the Head, a pain in
the Stomach, Re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, pains in the Loins,
and of the lower Belly, ju<U+017F>t like the pains
of Child-bearing, coming with the Cour<U+017F>es,
or eight days before. There is often al<U+017F>o
fainting and convul<U+017F>ions, and a palpitation
of the Heart; and by the<U+017F>e you may know,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63569:26"/>
that the Blood is clotted or thick, and a
<U+017F>mall <U+017F>welling is <U+017F>ometimes perceived in
one or both of the Groins, by rea<U+017F>on of
clotted Blood contained in it; and ju<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the evacuation of the clotted Blood,
the pain is mo<U+017F>t violent, and at the <U+017F>ame
time if wind be joined with it, it breaks
from the Womb or backwards with a noi<U+017F>e,
and there are wandring pains about the

Sanies or Pus is mixed with the Blood, and
the Cour<U+017F>es flow always with a fixed pain.
This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e afflicts Virgins and tho<U+017F>e that

is wont to be in three places, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
mouth of the Womb, in the neck of it, and
in the Privities. It is occa<U+017F>ioned either in
the fir<U+017F>t Formation when a Membrance co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Orifice of the Womb, or its Neck,
or by a Wound, or Ulcer preceding,
which growing together <U+017F>tops the Neck of
the Womb, or joins the Lips, or it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ioned

If the Clo<U+017F>ure be in the Privities, it may
be ea<U+017F>ily known, but if it be in the Neck,
or Orifice of the Womb, it is not found
out till the Cour<U+017F>es begin to flow, or till
Women are Married; for at the time of the
men<U+017F>truous Purgation, Pains and Gripes are
perceived in the region of the Womb at
certain times, with a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of weight, yet
no Flux follows. Moreover, you may gue<U+017F>s

But if the Neck of the Womb be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
it may be known in the fir<U+017F>t Copualti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

La<U+017F>tly, if the Orifice of the Womb
be <U+017F>hut, it is difficultly known, but it may
be found out by the hand of a Skilful Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.</p>
               <p>As to the progno<U+017F>tick, if the Clo<U+017F>ure be

Cured by a <U+017F>mall Section: But if it be in the
inner Parts, the Cure is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
               <p>When a Membrane <U+017F>huts the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, it
is ea<U+017F>ily Cured, but when the Clo<U+017F>ure is from

The Clo<U+017F>ure of the inner Orifice of the

cannot work upon it.</p>
               <p>If the Clo<U+017F>ure of the Womb be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

an Ulcer, as it often happens in the French-Pox;
we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, whether it be an

may be cut off by that In<U+017F>trument that is
u<U+017F>ed for extirpating a Polipus. But if the
Neck of the Womb be wholly <U+017F>hut, we mu<U+017F>t
endeavour to renew the Ulcer, and to take
off the <U+017F>uperfluous Fle<U+017F>h by the fore<U+017F>aid

A Suppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Cour<U+017F>es is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,

               <p>The Cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be varied

Veins about the time the Woman u<U+017F>ed

that every wa<U+017F>ting of the Body does

               <p>As to the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Cour<U+017F>es
which happens by a prepo<U+017F>terous motion
of the Blood, when it is evacuated by
bleeding at No<U+017F>e, by Vomiting, Spitting,
or Hemorrhoids, and other parts, the
Cure of it is perform'd by repelling the
Blood from the parts through which it
flows contrary to Nature, and by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it back to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Womb.
The fir<U+017F>t is performed when the Blood
ru<U+017F>hes out of the upper parts, by wa<U+017F>hing
the Arms, Head, and Face, with cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and by forbearing the exerci<U+017F>e of
tho<U+017F>e parts, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>inging and <U+017F>peaking
aloud. The <U+017F>econd is perform'd by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lower Veins, three or Four days
before the Blood breaks out, and by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es
applied to the Thighs and
Legs <U+017F>ometimes with, <U+017F>ometimes without
Scarification, by provoking the Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids,
by Running, by Walking, Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and Baths made of opening Herbs;
but the Bath water is e<U+017F>pecially commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Sick mu<U+017F>t bath in them often
a good while after Meals, but the water

mu<U+017F>t not ri<U+017F>e above the Navel, and at the
<U+017F>ame time the upper parts be cool'd by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them.</p>
               <p>If the Blood flow by the Hemorrhoids,
the Cure is very difficult; for if you u<U+017F>e
things to draw downwards, they bring
them al<U+017F>o to the Fundament, and if you
u<U+017F>e a<U+017F>tringent things to it, they by near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the parts, repell what <U+017F>hould be

the Mans Yard, or at lea<U+017F>t not without

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63569:34"/>
for in elderly Virgins the Genital parts

the Seed is not retained upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

chiefly happens by rea<U+017F>on of mi<U+017F>carriage

Womb and its inner Orifice are torn, but

under this Fat. Its Office is to <U+017F>traighten
the Orifice of the Sheath. The Nymphs
and the Clitoris appear when the Lips are
drawn a little a<U+017F>ide: The Nymphs <U+017F>tand next
the Urine, as it <U+017F>pouts out from the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and keeps the Lips from being wet;
they are placed on each <U+017F>ide, ju<U+017F>t within the
Lips, they are two fle<U+017F>hy and <U+017F>oft Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
beginning at the upper part of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
where they make that wrinkled
membranous Production, which cloaths the
Clitoris like a Fore-skin: They are in <U+017F>hape
and colour like the Thrils that hang under
a Cocks Throat, they have a red <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
partly Fle<U+017F>hy, partly Membranous; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Soft and Spongy, compo<U+017F>ed loo<U+017F>ly of
<U+017F>mall Membranes and Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, <U+017F>o that they
are very ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tended by the influx of the
Animal Spirits and Arterial Blood. They
are larger in grown Maids than in Young,
and grow larger upon the u<U+017F>e of Venery,
and after the Bearing of Children; their u<U+017F>e
is to defend the inner Parts, and to cover
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Urine, and a good part
of the Orifice of the Sheath in the upper
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63569:37"/>
part of the Privity. Betwixt the Nymphs
is placed the Clitoris; it an<U+017F>wers to a Man's
Yard, in <U+017F>hape, <U+017F>ituation, <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and differs from it only in length and
bigne<U+017F>s. Tho<U+017F>e that are called Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites
have it <U+017F>o long and big, as to be
able to Conver<U+017F>e with Women in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Men. They are not of two Sexs as
is commonly reported, only their Stones
are placed in the Lips of the Privities, and
their Clitoris is preternaturally extended:
But in mo<U+017F>t it does not appear unle<U+017F>s the
Lips are drawn a<U+017F>ide: It is a little, long and
round Body, it lies under the fat of the
hill of <hi>Venus,</hi> and puffs up in Venery, and
<U+017F>traightening the Orifice of the Sheath
makes it embrace the Virile Member the
more clo<U+017F>ely: Its outward end is like the
Glans of a Men's Yard, and as the Glans
in Men is the <U+017F>eat of the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure
in Copulation; <U+017F>o is this in Women:
There is as it were a hole in it, tho indeed
there is really no <U+017F>uch thing, mo<U+017F>t of it is
covered with a thin Membrane from the
Conjunction of the Nymphs: It has two
pair of Mu<U+017F>cles, the upper are round and
<U+017F>pring from the bones of the Hip; the<U+017F>e by
<U+017F>traitening the roots of the Nervous Bodies,
that ari<U+017F>e on each <U+017F>ide from the bunching of
the Os I<U+017F>chium detain the Blood and Spirits
in them, and <U+017F>o erect the Clitoris, even as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63569:38"/>
tho<U+017F>e in Men do the Virile Member; the
other ri<U+017F>e from the Sphincter of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the<U+017F>e <U+017F>erve to <U+017F>traiten and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Orifice of the Sheath: It has Veins,
and Arteries, and Nerves, which are <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large. In <U+017F>ome <hi>Ea<U+017F>tern</hi> Countries the
Clitoris is wont to be <U+017F>o large, that for its
deformity, and the hindrance it cau<U+017F>es in
Copulation, they u<U+017F>ed to cut it quite out,
or to <U+017F>ear it, to hinder its growth.</p>
               <p>The Sheath is <U+017F>o call'd becau<U+017F>e it receives
the Virile Member like a <U+017F>heath, it is <U+017F>oft
and loo<U+017F>e, uneven and wrinkly, of a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
but <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>pongy Sub<U+017F>tance,
which is puft up in Copulation to embrace
the Yard the better: Its about <U+017F>even fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth long, and as wide as the
<U+017F>trait Gut; but the length and width
differ in re<U+017F>pect of Age, and as the Woman
is more or le<U+017F>s provoked to Copulation:
The wrinkles are much more numerous and
clo<U+017F>e in Virgins, than in tho<U+017F>e that have
Born many Children, and in Whores that
u<U+017F>e frequent Copulation, and in Women
that have had the Whites a long while.</p>
               <p>It has very many Arteries and Veins,
<U+017F>ome whereof ino<U+017F>culate one with another,
and others not. By the Arteries that open
into it, the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>ometimes flow in
Women with Child, that are full of Blood.
The<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els bring plenty of Blood to it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63569:38"/>
in Copulation, which by heating and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
up the Sheath increa<U+017F>es the plea<U+017F>ure,
and hinders the Man's Seed from cooling,
before it is conveyed to the Womb. All
along the Sheath there are abundance of
Pores, from whence a thin Humour always
flows, e<U+017F>pecially in Copulation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>es
the plea<U+017F>ure of the Woman, and is
that which is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be her Seed. Near
its outer end, under the Nymphs, in its
upper part, it receives the Neck of the
Bladder. In Virgins its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is <U+017F>o narrow,
that at their fir<U+017F>t Conver<U+017F>ation with a Man,
they have commonly more pain than plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,
by rea<U+017F>on of the exten<U+017F>ion of it by the
Virile Member, which breaks <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, from whence Blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ues.</p>
               <p>The Hymen is a thin nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
interwoven with fle<U+017F>hy Fibres, and
endowed with many little Arteries, and
Veins, behind the in<U+017F>ertion of the Neck of
the Bladder, with a hole in the mid<U+017F>t, that
will admit the top of ones little finger,
whereby the Cour<U+017F>es flow, it is al<U+017F>o called
the Girdle of Cha<U+017F>tity. But it is broken
and bleeds at the fir<U+017F>t Copulation, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
clo<U+017F>es again. But tho' a Man when
he finds the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns of Virginity, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conclude he has Married a Maid;
yet if they are wanting, it does not nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily
follow that Virginity is wanting;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63569:39"/>
for the Hymen may be corroded by <U+017F>harp
Humours flowing through it with the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
and from other Cau<U+017F>es; or, if a Maid
be <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creet as to become a Bride while
her Cour<U+017F>es flow, or within a Day after,
then the Hymen and the wrinkled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
of the Sheath are <U+017F>o relaxed, that the
Virile Member may enter without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction,
and <U+017F>o give <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tity,
when there is really no occa<U+017F>ion for
it. Sometimes in old Maids the Hymen is
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trong that it cannot be penetrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty; and in <U+017F>ome it is naturally
quite clo<U+017F>ed up, and <U+017F>o their Cour<U+017F>es are
<U+017F>topt, which much endangers their Life; if
it be not opened with a Chirurgical In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Myrtle-berry Caruncles lie clo<U+017F>e to
the Hymen, the large<U+017F>t of 'em is uppermo<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>tanding ju<U+017F>t at the Mouth of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age
of the Urine, which it <U+017F>huts after making
water; oppo<U+017F>ite to this at the bottom of
the Sheath there is another, and in each <U+017F>ide
one. But of the<U+017F>e, there is only the fir<U+017F>t in
Maids, the other three being made by the
broken Hymen. The<U+017F>e three when the
Sheath is extended di<U+017F>appear in Labour, and
cannot be <U+017F>een till the Sheath is contracted
to its natural <U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>The Sheath near its outer Orifice, has a
Sphincter Mu<U+017F>cle about three fingers broad
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63569:39"/>
that contracts it as the ca<U+017F>e requires; and
therefore Men and Women need not doubt
but that their Genitals will be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for the Sheath is <U+017F>o artificially made,
that it can <U+017F>uit with every Penis.</p>
               <p>The Womb is <U+017F>eated in the lowe<U+017F>t part of
the Belly, betwixt the Bladder and <U+017F>traight
Gut, its hindmo<U+017F>t part is loo<U+017F>e, that it
may be extended as the Child increa<U+017F>es, but
its <U+017F>ides are tied fa<U+017F>t by two pair of Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is whiti<U+017F>h, nervous,
and compact in Virgins, but a little <U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and <U+017F>oft in Women with Child. It has
two Membranes, the outer is <U+017F>trong and
double ari<U+017F>ing from the Peritoneum, the
inner being proper is Fibrous and more
Porous. Betwixt the<U+017F>e Membranes, there
is a certain fle<U+017F>hy and fibrous contexture,
which in Women with Child, together
with the <U+017F>aid Membranes, imbibes <U+017F>o much
of the nutritious Humours, that then flow
thither, that the more the Child increa<U+017F>es,
the more fle<U+017F>hy, fibrous, and thick does the
Womb grow, <U+017F>o that in the la<U+017F>t months it
is an inch thick, and <U+017F>ome times two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth, tho' it be extended to <U+017F>o much
greater compa<U+017F>s, than it has when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is not with Child, and yet within three
weeks after Delivery it is as thin as before,
and contracts <U+017F>o wonderfully, that it may
be held in ones hand. In Virgins it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63569:40"/>
two fingers breadth broad, and three
long; in tho<U+017F>e that have Copulated, it is
a little bigger, it is like a Pear, only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
flatti<U+017F>h above and below, but in Women
with Child it becomes more round. In
Maids its cavity is <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contain a large Hazel-nut; it is divided
be a Line that goes length-ways, much like
that in a Man's Cod. Its Arteries <U+017F>pring
partly from the Spermatick and Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trick;
they run along the Womb, bending
and winding, that they may be extended
without danger of breaking, when the
Womb is <U+017F>tretched with the Child. The
monthly Cour<U+017F>es flow by the<U+017F>e Arteries in
greate<U+017F>t quantity into the Womb it <U+017F>elf:
But in le<U+017F>s quantity by the Branches that
open into the Neck of the Womb, and a
<U+017F>mall quantity of the Cour<U+017F>es come out of
the Sheath. It is much di<U+017F>puted what is the
rea<U+017F>on of the Cour<U+017F>es, whether they flow
by rea<U+017F>on of too great quantity of Blood,
or whether at <U+017F>et times; there is al<U+017F>o a
fermentation of the Blood, which opens the
orifices of the Arteries: But it is mo<U+017F>t
probable that it proceeds from a fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at appointed times, for if a Woman
feeds high and <U+017F>o breeds much Blood, the
Cour<U+017F>es flow never the <U+017F>ooner, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they may be in a greater quantity; and
if <U+017F>he u<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>tinence and <U+017F>pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63569:40"/>
of Diet, they will not be the longer
before they come, <U+017F>o that when through
<U+017F>uch effervency the Blood flows plentifully
into the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Womb, and the Veins
of the Womb are not able to carry it all
back again by Circulation, it flows out of
the extremities of the Arteries <U+017F>o long, till
the too great quantity of the Blood is le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ened,
and the fermentation cea<U+017F>es, which it
does u<U+017F>ually after three or four days. The
Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>eldom flow in Women with Child,
and the wanting of them is their fir<U+017F>t item
of having Conceived.</p>
               <p>The Veins <U+017F>pring from the Preparantes,
and from the Epiga<U+017F>trick, the Nerves from
the greate<U+017F>t plexus of the me<U+017F>entery of the
Interco<U+017F>tal Pair, and from the lowe<U+017F>t plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
of the <U+017F>ame, and al<U+017F>o from the Nerves
of the Os Sacrum, and the <U+017F>ame run al<U+017F>o to
the Te<U+017F>tes or Ovaria. The<U+017F>e plexus of
Nerves are chiefly affected in Hy<U+017F>terick Fits,
and are Convul<U+017F>ive, and often happen when
the Womb is not at all in fault; and the
Ball that <U+017F>eems to ri<U+017F>e from the bottom of
the Belly in the<U+017F>e Fits, and to beat <U+017F>trongly
about the Navel, which is u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
to be the ri<U+017F>ing of the Womb, is nothing
but a Convul<U+017F>ion of the<U+017F>e Nerves; for <U+017F>ome

The u<U+017F>e of the Womb is to receive into
its capacity the principals of the formation
of the Fetus, to afford it nouri<U+017F>hment, and
to pre<U+017F>erve it from injuries, and at length
to expel it.</p>
               <p>The neck of the Womb <U+017F>eems to be a
part of the Fundus, only it is much more
narrower, for its cavity is no wider in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
than a <U+017F>mall Quill, and in Women
with Child its inner orifice does either quite
clo<U+017F>e its <U+017F>ides together, or is daubed up with
a <U+017F>limy yellowi<U+017F>h Humour, <U+017F>o that nothing

               <p>Womens Te<U+017F>ticles differ much from

differ in bigne<U+017F>s, according to Age; in

when this cover is removed, their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance

               <p>The Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are of two <U+017F>orts;
Arteries and Veins; the Arteries are two

Men, but with much twirling and winding
among the Veins, with which they have
no ino<U+017F>culation, as has been generally <U+017F>aid.
But for all their Winding, when they
are <U+017F>tretched out to their full length, they
are not <U+017F>o long as tho<U+017F>e of Men. The
Veins are two, ari<U+017F>ing as in Men, the right
from the Trunk of the Cava, a little below
the Emulgent, and the left from the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

than in Men; both the Arteries and Veins
as they pa<U+017F>s down are covered with one
common Coat from the Peritoneum, and
near the Te<U+017F>tes they are divided into two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63569:42"/>
Branches, the upper whereof is implanted
into the Te<U+017F>ticle by a Triple-root, and
the other is <U+017F>ubdivided below the Te<U+017F>tes
into three twigs, one of which goes to
the bottom of the Womb, another to the
Tuba and round ligament, the third creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the <U+017F>ide of the Womb, under its
common Membrane ends in its Neck,
where it is Woven with the Hypoga<U+017F>trick
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els like a net. By this way it is that
the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>ometimes flow in Women
with Child, for the fir<U+017F>t Months, and not
out of the inner Cavity of the Womb.</p>

the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Fetus, and of the

               <p>The carrying Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that go <U+017F>traight
from the Te<U+017F>tes to the bottom of the

Seed from the Stones into the bottom of
the Womb, are accounted by <hi>de Graef</hi> only
Ligaments of the Te<U+017F>ticles to keep them
in their place; for they come not to the
Inner Cavity of the VVomb. The Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian

Ducts, nervous and white, ari<U+017F>ing from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63569:43"/>
the horns or <U+017F>ides of the VVomb, and at
a little di<U+017F>tance from it they become lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

till nearer their end, where cea<U+017F>ing their

and has a large Foramen, which lies
clo<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e jaggs fall together,
but it being opened, they are like the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t

amplitude, perforation, likene<U+017F>s, and
al<U+017F>o Office. The capacity of the<U+017F>e Ducts
varies very much; for in the beginning, as
it goes out of the VVomb, it only admits
a Bri<U+017F>tle, but in its progre<U+017F>s, where it is
large<U+017F>t, it will receive ones little finger;
but in the outmo<U+017F>t extremity, where it is
divided into jaggs, it is but about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>o wide. They are very uncertain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
in their length, for from four or five
they <U+017F>ometimes increa<U+017F>e to eight or nine
fingers breadth long. Their u<U+017F>e is in a
fruitful Copulation to grant a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to

them, which Eggs, one or more being by
that means fecundated, and dropping off

There are two <U+017F>orts of Conception, the

               <p>Conception may be known by the more

whereby we may know the difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both Children were begotten at once,
or <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively one after another. Supefoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

Conception, when a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already with Child conceives again the
<U+017F>econd time. That which makes many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there can be no Superfoetation
is, becau<U+017F>e as <U+017F>oon as a Woman has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
her Womb clo<U+017F>es, and is exactly
firm, <U+017F>o that the Seed of the Man, ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to Conception, finding no place
nor entry, cannot, as they <U+017F>ay, be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor contained in it: But it may be
an<U+017F>wered, that tho' the Womb be u<U+017F>ually

much delighted in the act of Copulation.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63569:46"/>
But this <U+017F>econd Conception is very rare;
for we mu<U+017F>t not imagine, that when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brings forth two or more Children
at once, there is a Superfoetation; becau<U+017F>e
they are almo<U+017F>t always begot in the <U+017F>ame
act, by the reception of abundance of Seed
into the Womb.</p>
               <p>When a Woman brings forth one or
more Children at a Birth, begotten at
once, which are u<U+017F>ually called Twins, it is
known by their being both almo<U+017F>t of an

But if there are <U+017F>everal Children,
and a Superfoetation, they will not have a
common burthen, nor will they be of an

               <p>To conclude, Of a hundred Women that

VVhen there is but one Child in the Womb,

and then it pre<U+017F>ently thereby <U+017F>ticks to

the twelfth or thirteenth Week, till

having no Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

But when it grows bigger, and
begins to want nouri<U+017F>hment, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els begin to grow
out of the Navel by little and little, and
are extended towards the Womb-cake, that
they may draw out of it a more nouri<U+017F>hing
juice, and carry it to the Infant, as Plants
do from the Earth by their roots. It has
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the Womb and from the
Chorion; the former are of four kinds,
Arteries, Veins, Nerves, and Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts;
all which tho' they be very large,
and vi<U+017F>ible in the Womb, and al<U+017F>o where

<U+017F>end the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Capilaries to the Womb
it <U+017F>elf. Tho<U+017F>e that come from the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion

tho<U+017F>e that come from the Chorion are the

Womb-Cake after it is joyned to the

Months, as unripe Fruit does to the Tree,
but as the Infant becomes bigger and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and nearer to the Birth, by <U+017F>o much
the more ea<U+017F>ily will it part from the
Womb, and at length it falls out of the
Womb, and makes part of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</p>
               <p>Next to the Womb-Cake follow the two
Membranes, <hi>viz.</hi> Chorion the outer, and
Amnios the inner, wherein the Child is
wrapt: Betwixt the<U+017F>e two after the Child
is perfectly formed, there is a third, <hi>viz.</hi>
Allantois. The Chorion is pretty thick,

unequal and rough, and in that part of it
which <U+017F>ticks to the Womb-cake, and by it

which <U+017F>pring from the Womb it <U+017F>elf and
the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Twins are both
inclo<U+017F>ed in one Chorion, but have each a
particular Amnios; it inve<U+017F>ts the Egg or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally,
which Egg being brought to the
Womb, and becoming a Conception, this
Membrane imbibes the moi<U+017F>ture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63569:48"/>
the Womb plentifully at that time.
This Liquor that it imbibes, is thought
to be the Nutritious Juice that ouzes out of
the Capilary Orifices of the Hypoga<U+017F>trick
and Spermatick Arteries, and is of the
<U+017F>ame nature with that which afterward is
<U+017F>eparated in the Womb-cake, and carried
to the Infant by the Umbilical Vein; and
with that al<U+017F>o which abounds in the Amnios
even till the Birth.</p>
               <p>The Amnios is the inmo<U+017F>t Membrane
that immediately contains the Child; it is
not knit to the Chorion in any place <U+017F>ave
where the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els pa<U+017F>s through
them both into the Womb-cake; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thin, <U+017F>oft, <U+017F>mooth, and pellucid, and
encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es the Infant very loo<U+017F>ly, it has
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the <U+017F>ame Origins as the Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
From a limpid Liquor contained in
this Membrane, the fir<U+017F>t lineaments of the
Embrio are drawn. But becau<U+017F>e this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is <U+017F>o very little, there <U+017F>weats through
this Membrane pre<U+017F>ently part of that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
Albugineous Humour that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Chorion, which it had imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
out of the Womb, and by the addition
of this Humour to the undi<U+017F>cernible Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the Embrio, it receives its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e.
But tho' the Amnios have its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Nutricious Liquor at fir<U+017F>t only by
Tran<U+017F>udation, yet when the Umbilical
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63569:49"/>
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the Womb-cakes are formed, it
receives it after another manner, for then
being <U+017F>eparated from the Mothers Arteries
by the Placenta, and imbibed by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
Veins of the Infant pa<U+017F><U+017F>es directly to
its Heart, from whence being driven a
great part of it down the Aorta, it is <U+017F>ent
forth again by the Umbilical Arteries, out
of who<U+017F>e Capillaries di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed plentifully
through the Amnios, it i<U+017F><U+017F>ues into its cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A third Membrane which inve<U+017F>ts the
whole Infant is the Allantoides; it has the
<U+017F>ame Figure as the Chorion and Amnios,
betwixt which it is placed in their whole
circumference. Now, tho' it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
that this as well as the other two is
originally in the Egg, yet there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it, till after the Umbilical
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and the Womb-cake are formed,
and the albugineous Liquor cea<U+017F>es to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
by the Chorion out of the Uterus; but
as <U+017F>oon as the Infant begins to be nouri<U+017F>hed
by the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the Urachus is
permeable, then pre<U+017F>ently this Membrane
begins to <U+017F>hew it <U+017F>elf, containing a very
thin Liquor, which is the Urine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
brought into it by the Urachus, and
wherewith it is filled daily more and more
till the Birth: It may be known from the
Chorion and Amnios by this, that they have
numerous Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed through them;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63569:49"/>
but this has not the lea<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>ible Vein or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
it is very hard to <U+017F>eparate the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion

the Serum from the Blood, for otherwi<U+017F>e
it would be affected with an An<U+017F>arca; I
<U+017F>ay, the Serum is <U+017F>eparated in the Kidneys,
and glides down from thence into the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
wherein there is a pretty large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
when the Infant is five or <U+017F>ix months
old: Now it flows not out of the Bladder by
its orifice, becau<U+017F>e at that time the Sphincter
is too contracted and narrow, and if it
<U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s that way, it would mix with
the nouri<U+017F>hing juice wherein the Infant
<U+017F>wims in the Amnios, and wherewith by
taking it in by its mouth, it is partly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed,
and <U+017F>o would defile and corrupt it.
Nature therefore has provided it another
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age by the Urachus in<U+017F>erted into the
bottom of the Bladder, which tho it grows
<U+017F>olid like a Ligament after the Child is
Born, as the umbilical Vein does, yet
while the Infant is in the Womb, it is open
and conveighs the Urine into the Allantoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63569:50"/>
that is placed betwixt the Chorion
and Amnios, where it is collected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
till the Birth.</p>
               <p>The Naval-<U+017F>tring is membraneous, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
and unequal, and ari<U+017F>es from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
it reaches to the Womb-cake; it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half an Ell long, and a finger thick,
The Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els contained in this <U+017F>tring, and
covered with the common coat called Funi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus
are four, one Vein, two Arteries,
and the Urachus; the Vein is larger than the
Aretries, and ari<U+017F>es from the Liver of the
Infant at the trunk of the Vena porta, and
from thence pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out of the Navel it
runs along the Funiculus to the Womb-cake,
into which it is implanted by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Roots; but before it reaches it,
it <U+017F>ends <U+017F>ome little twigs into the Amnios.
The umbilical Vein <U+017F>erves for conveying to
the Infant the nutricious juice <U+017F>eparated in
the Womb-cake from the Mothers Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but together with this juice returns
<U+017F>o much of the Arterial blood, that comes
from the Infant, as is not <U+017F>pent upon the
nouri<U+017F>hment of the Womb-cake, or of the
Chorion and Amnios.</p>
               <p>In the Funiculus are included al<U+017F>o two
Arteries, which are not both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<U+017F>o big as the Vein; they <U+017F>pring out
of the inner Iliacal branches of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the <U+017F>ides of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63569:50"/>
they ri<U+017F>e up to the Navel, out of
which they are conducted to the Womb-cake,
in the <U+017F>ame common cover with the
Vein and Urachus wherewith they are twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and wreathed like a Rope. Spirituous
blood is driven from the Infant by the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of its Heart to the Womb-cake, and
the Membranes, for nouri<U+017F>hment, from
which, what Blood remains circulates back
again to the umbilical Vein together with
nutricious juice, imbibed afre<U+017F>h by its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaries
di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed in the Womb-cake. But
be<U+017F>ides Arterial Blood, there flows out of
the Navel by them part of the Nutricious
juice, that was imported by the umbilical
Vein, I <U+017F>ay flows out by the<U+017F>e Arteries, which
by their branches, that are di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed
through the Amnios, di<U+017F>charge it by their
little mouths into it. The fourth Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el is the Urachus, or Urinary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
it is a <U+017F>mall, membranous, round Pipe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a <U+017F>traight cavity ari<U+017F>ing from the
bottom of the Bladder up to the Navel;
out of which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es along within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cover and opens into the Allantoides.
The<U+017F>e four Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as has been <U+017F>aid above,
have one common cover, which al<U+017F>o keeps
each of them from touching the other; it is
called Funiculus; it is membranous, round
and hollow, indifferent thick, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of
a double coat, the inner from the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63569:51"/>
and the outer from the Paniculus
carno<U+017F>us. It has <U+017F>everal knots, which Dr.
<hi>Wharton</hi> thinks are little Glands, through
which the nutricious juice di<U+017F>tills out of the
capacity of the Funiculus into the cavity of
the Amnios.</p>
               <p>Midwives gue<U+017F>s by their number how
many more Children the Mother <U+017F>hall have,
but without rea<U+017F>on. When the Infant is
Born, its Navel-rope is wont to be tyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one or two fingers breadth from the
Navel, with a <U+017F>trong Thread ca<U+017F>t about it
<U+017F>everal times, and then about two or three
fingers breadth beyond the Ligature to be
cut off; what is not cut off is <U+017F>uffered
to remain till it drop off of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>As to the way how the Infant is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed
there has been great Di<U+017F>putes, <U+017F>ome
affirm by Blood only, and that received by
the Umbilical Vein, others by Chile only
received in by the Mouth; but indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different degrees of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that an Egg pa<U+017F><U+017F>es from Conception to
an Infant ready for the Birth, it is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed
variou<U+017F>ly. For, Fir<U+017F>t, As <U+017F>oon as an
Egg Impregnated de<U+017F>cends into the Womb,
it pre<U+017F>ently imbibes through its outer
Membrane <U+017F>ome of that albugineous Liquor,
that at this time plentifully bedews the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Superfices of the Womb, <U+017F>o that as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63569:51"/>
<U+017F>oon as the fir<U+017F>t Lineaments of an Embryo
begin to be drawn, out of that Humour
contained in the Amnios, they pre<U+017F>ently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
increa<U+017F>e by the appo<U+017F>ition of the
<U+017F>aid Liquor filtrated out of the Chorion
through the Amnios into its cavity; and
this <U+017F>ame Liquor, that thus increa<U+017F>es the
fir<U+017F>t rudiments of the Embryo, Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>
calls Coliquamentum. But when the parts
of the Embryo begin to be a little more
perfect, and the Chorion becomes <U+017F>o den<U+017F>e,
that not any more of the <U+017F>aid Liquor is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
by it, the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els begin to
be formed, and to extend to the <U+017F>ide of the
Amnios which they penetrate, and both
the Vein and Arteries pa<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o through the
Allantois and Chorion, and are implanted
into the Womb-Cake, that at this time,
fir<U+017F>t gathering upon the Chorion joins it
to the Womb; and now the Hypoga<U+017F>trick
and Spermatick Arteries, that before ca<U+017F>t
the nutricious Juice into the cavity of the
Womb, open by the orifices into the
Womb-cake, where they depo<U+017F>ite the <U+017F>aid
juice, which is ab<U+017F>orded by the Umbilical
Vein, and by it conveyed, fir<U+017F>t to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
then to the Heart of the Infant, where
the thinner and the more <U+017F>pirituous part of
it is turn'd into Blood; but the more gro<U+017F>s
and earthy part of it de<U+017F>cending by the
Aorta enters the Umbilical Arteries, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63569:52"/>
by tho<U+017F>e branches of them, that run
through the Amnios, is di<U+017F>charged into
its cavity.</p>
               <p>The gro<U+017F><U+017F>er nutricious Juice being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited
by the Umbilical Arteries in the Amni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
as <U+017F>oon as the Mouth, Gullet, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and the like are formed <U+017F>o perfectly,
that the Foetus can <U+017F>wallow, it <U+017F>ucks in <U+017F>ome
of the <U+017F>aid Juice, which de<U+017F>cending into
the Stomach and Inte<U+017F>tines, is received by
the Lacteal Veins, as in grown Per<U+017F>ons.
The Infant therefore is nouri<U+017F>hed three <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, but only by one Humour: Fir<U+017F>t,
by appo<U+017F>ition of it, while it is yet an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Embrio, and has not the Umbilical
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els formed: But after the<U+017F>e are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it then receives the <U+017F>ame nutricious
Juice by the Umbilical Vein, the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
and thin part whereof it changes
into Blood, and <U+017F>ends forth the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er part
by the Umbilical Artery into the Amnios,
which the Infant <U+017F>ucks in at its Mouth,
and undergoing a new Concoction in its
<U+017F>tomach, is received out of the Inte<U+017F>tines
by the Lacteal Veins, as is done after the
birth.</p>
               <p>A Child in the Womb differs from an
adult Per<U+017F>on in many parts, the parts are
le<U+017F>s, the colour of the whole reddi<U+017F>h, the
Bones <U+017F>oft, and many of them gri<U+017F>tly and
flexible in the Head: There are <U+017F>everal
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63569:52"/>
differences: Fir<U+017F>t, the Head, in re<U+017F>pect to
the proportion of the re<U+017F>t of the Body,
is bigger, the Crown is not covered with
Bone, but only with a Membrane; the
Bone of the Forehead is divided, as al<U+017F>o
of the under Jaw, and the Os Cuneiforme
is divided into four. The Bone of the
hinder part of the Head is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
into three, four or five Bones. The Brain
is <U+017F>ofter, and more fluid, and the Nerves
very <U+017F>oft. The Bones that <U+017F>erve the Sen<U+017F>e
of Hearing are wonderfully hard and big;
the Teeth lie hid in the little holes of
the Jaw-bone; the Dugs <U+017F>well, and out of
them in Infants new born, whether Male
or Female, a <U+017F>erous Milk i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth
<U+017F>ometimes of its own accord, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a gentle pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure: The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae
of the Back want their <U+017F>pinous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and each of them made of three
di<U+017F>tinct Bones: The Heart is remarkably
big, and its Auriculae large: There are
two Unions of the greater Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that are
not con<U+017F>picuous in grown Per<U+017F>ons: Fir<U+017F>t,
the Foramen ovale, by which there is a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
open, out of the Cava into the Vein
of the Lungs, ju<U+017F>t as each of them are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
the fir<U+017F>t into the right Ventricle,
and the latter into the left Ventricle of the
Heart, and this Foramen, ju<U+017F>t as it opens
into the Vein of the Lungs has a Valve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63569:53"/>
that hinders any thing from returning out
of the <U+017F>aid Vein into the Foramen: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Arterial Channel, which two
fingers breadth from the Ba<U+017F>is of the Heart
joyns the Artery of the Lungs to the Aorta;
it has a pretty lage Cavity, and a<U+017F>cends a
little obliquely from the <U+017F>aid Artery to
the Aorta, into which it conveys the
Blood, that was driven into the Artery of
the Lungs, out of the right Ventricle of
the Heart, <U+017F>o that it never comes into the
left Ventricle, as the Blood that is <U+017F>ent
out of the left Venticle into the Aorta ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came in the right, except a little that
is returned from the nutrition of the Lungs,
but pa<U+017F>t immediately into it out of the
Vena Cava by the Foramen ovale, <U+017F>o that
the Blood pa<U+017F><U+017F>es not through both the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles,
as it does after the Child is born.
You may know whether Infants killed by
Whores, and which they commonly affirm
were <U+017F>till-born, were really <U+017F>o or no, by
putting the Lungs of the Infant in Water;
for if they were <U+017F>till-born the Lungs will
<U+017F>ink, if alive, <U+017F>o as to breath never <U+017F>o lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while, they will <U+017F>wim. The Gland
Thymus is very large, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts as it
were of three Glands; the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
go out of the Abdomen; the Stomach
is narrower, but pretty full of a whiti<U+017F>h
liquor: The Caul is <U+017F>carce vi<U+017F>ible, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63569:53"/>
Guts are <U+017F>eventimes longer than the Body;
the Excrements in the <U+017F>mall Guts are fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
and yellow, but in the thick <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard and blacki<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ometimes green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h;
the Caecum is larger than u<U+017F>ual, and
often fill'd with Faeces: the Liver is very
large, and extends it <U+017F>elf into the left <U+017F>ide,
and covers all the upper part of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
it has a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, which is not in
grown Per<U+017F>ons, called the Veiny Channel,
which ari<U+017F>ing out of the Sinus of the Porta,
carries the greate<U+017F>t part of what is brought
by the Umbilical Vein directly, and in a
full <U+017F>tream into the Cava above the Liver:
But this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age pre<U+017F>ently clo<U+017F>es, as <U+017F>oon
as the Infant is born, and turns to a liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as doth the Urachus and the two
Umbilical Arteries. The Spleen is <U+017F>mall;
the Gall-bladder is full of yellow or green
Choler; the Sweet-bread is very large and
white; the Kidneys are bigger and unequal
in their Superficies; the Renes Succentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riati
are exceeding large; the Ureters

which it holds to the Temple or Ear, the
other to the Cheek, where there are white
<U+017F>pots on the Skin, as if it had been rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
upon; the Back-bone turns round,
the Head hanging down towards its Knees,
its Face commonly towards the Mothers
Back; but near the birth, <U+017F>ometimes a
VVeek or two before, it alters its <U+017F>ituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and tumbles down with its Head to
the Neck of the VVomb, and its Feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
then the VVomb al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ettles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and its Orifice relaxes, and opens;
and the Infant moving up and down tears
the Membrans wherein it is included, and the
waters flowing into the Sheath; but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Membranes come forth whole; at
the <U+017F>ame time the neighbouring parts are
loo<U+017F>ened and become fit for di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion, and
the Bones near are <U+017F>o much relaxed in their
Joynts, that they make way for the Infant,
and the motion of it <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>turbs the
VVomb, that the Fibres of it and the Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Belly contract altogether to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

Child.</head>
               <p>THE Woman ought to be kept in a
good moderate and clear Air, and <U+017F>he
mu<U+017F>t Eat what <U+017F>he likes be<U+017F>t, and be <U+017F>ure
not to Fa<U+017F>t too long; only <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve
not to eat too much at a time; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the Stomach, which is always weak in
this condition, <U+017F>he may Drink a little
Wine, or for want of it <U+017F>trong Beer at
Meals. As to Sleep, a Woman with Child
requires more <U+017F>leep than <U+017F>he does at other
times. As to Exerci<U+017F>e and Re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t
order her <U+017F>elf according to the different
times; for at the beginning <U+017F>he ought to
keep her <U+017F>elf quiet, and not to u<U+017F>e Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Riding on Hor<U+017F>e-back, or in a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
or indeed in a Coach is not <U+017F>afe at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time of her being with Child, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when <U+017F>he is near her time, for <U+017F>uch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>es
often cau<U+017F>e Mi<U+017F>carriage. But <U+017F>he
may Walk gently, or be carried in a Chair.
She mu<U+017F>t not carry or lift heavy Burdens,
or lift up her Arms too high, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to dre<U+017F>s her own Head. Let
her Exerci<U+017F>e be gentle walking in low-heel'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63569:55"/>
Shoes; but <U+017F>he had better Re<U+017F>t too much
than Exerci<U+017F>e too much, for more hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are occa<U+017F>ioned by violent Exerci<U+017F>e
than by any other thing. Moreover, it is
convenient that the Woman <U+017F>hould ab<U+017F>tain
from Copulation the la<U+017F>t two months, for
the Body is very much moved, and the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the action, which cau<U+017F>es
the Child to take a wrong po<U+017F>ture.</p>
               <p>If the Belly be bound, as it is often at
this time, Prunes <U+017F>tewed, or Veal Broath
may be often u<U+017F>ed, or the following Gli<U+017F>ter
may be u<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>Boyl an Handful of Mallow Leaves, in
three quarters of a Pint of Milk, let the Milk
ju<U+017F>t boyl up, add to it two Ounces of brown
Sugar, and a little fre<U+017F>h Butter, <U+017F>train it for
u<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>She mu<U+017F>t moderate her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and great
care mu<U+017F>t be taken that <U+017F>he be not Frighted,
and that Melancholy News be not <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told her, but you mu<U+017F>t endeavour to
keep her as chearful as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, the
<U+017F>udden <U+017F>urprizes of joy mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

The Cloaths of a Woman with
Child <U+017F>hould <U+017F>it ea<U+017F>ie, for any immoderate
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure is apt to make the Child deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and hurts the Brea<U+017F>ts, and very often
cau<U+017F>es mi<U+017F>carriage. Unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Bleeding
mu<U+017F>t be avoided, <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t all <U+017F>trong Purges
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63569:55"/>
but if Purging is requi<U+017F>ite, only <U+017F>uch things
as Purge gently mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed, as Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia,
Rubarb, and Manna. The Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia is be<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ucked out of the Canes, the Rubarb may
be chewed, and an Ounce and a half or
two Ounces of Manna may be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in
Po<U+017F><U+017F>et-drink, and u<U+017F>ed upon occa<U+017F>ion in the
Morning.</p>
               <p>Vomiting often afflicts Women with
Child, but if it be moderate and at the
beginning and without great <U+017F>training it is
beneficial; if it continues longer than the
third or fourth Month it ought to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;
in order to which let the Woman
u<U+017F>e good food, and a little at a time, and
let her u<U+017F>e with her meat the juice of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<U+017F>he may eat now and then Broth mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the yolk of an Egg, for it's very
nouri<U+017F>hing and of ea<U+017F>ie dige<U+017F>tion, and after
meals let her eat a little Marmalade of
Quinces, and <U+017F>he may drink a Gla<U+017F>s of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t forbear fat meat and Sauces,
and <U+017F>weet and <U+017F>ugar'd Sauces. But if the
Vomiting continues notwith<U+017F>tanding this
regular Diet till the Woman is above half
gon, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t take the following Purge.</p>
               <p>Take of Tamarinds half an Ounce, of Sena
one Dram, of Rubarb one Dram and an half,
boyl them in a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of water, in
three Ounces of the <U+017F>trained Liquor di<U+017F><U+017F>olve an
Ounce of Manna, and an Ounce of Syrup of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63569:56"/>
Succory with Rubarb; make a purging potion
to be taken in the Morning. It may be repeated
once or oftener upon occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>And it may be proper for the Woman in
the Winter time to were a Lambskin or
the like upon her Stomach and Belly.</p>
               <p>If pains of the Back, Reins and Hips are
violent, the Woman mu<U+017F>t be blooded, and
take at bed-time <U+017F>ixteen drops of the Liquid
Laudanum mentioned at the latter end of
the Chapter of Hy<U+017F>teric Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es in a gla<U+017F>s
of Canary Wine, or in any thing el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
likes, and <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t keep her Bed till the
pain abates; if the pain is continual, the
Belly mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>upported with a Swaith fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>If after the third or fourth Month the
Brea<U+017F>ts are very painful, 'tis convenient
the Woman <U+017F>hou'd bleed in the Arm, if
<U+017F>he be full of blood, and u<U+017F>e a Diet that is
moderately cooling and nouri<U+017F>hing; but if
the pain comes at the beginning, we ought
to leave the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to nature, only
the Woman mu<U+017F>t have a care that <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no blows on tho<U+017F>e parts, nor mu<U+017F>t
<U+017F>he be <U+017F>trait laced, for fear the Brea<U+017F>ts
<U+017F>hou'd impo<U+017F>tumate.</p>
               <p>If incontinence or difficulty of Urin be
occa<U+017F>ion'd by the weight and bigne<U+017F>s of the
Belly, the Woman may remedy it, and
ea<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, if when <U+017F>he wou'd make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63569:56"/>
<U+017F>he lift up with both her hands the
bottom of her Belly, or <U+017F>he may wear a
large Swaith fitted for this u<U+017F>e, to bear up
the Belly, but the be<U+017F>t way is to keep her
in Bed.</p>
               <p>If a <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of Urin cau<U+017F>es an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
on the Neck of the Bladder, it may
be appea<U+017F>ed by a regular cooling Diet, and
emul<U+017F>ions of the cold Seeds u<U+017F>ed Morning
and Evening.</p>
               <p>Take of blanched Almonds number twelve,
of the four greater cold Seeds each one Dram
and an half, of the Seeds of Lettice and white
Poppies each half a Dram, beat them in a
Marble Mortar, and pour on them gently three
quarters of a pint of Poppy Water, make an
emul<U+017F>ion for two do<U+017F>es, add one Ounce of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Violets and half a Dram of Sal Prunella.</p>
               <p>If the Inflammation and Sharpne<U+017F>s of
Urine be not removed by the things above-mention'd,
a little Blood may be taken
from the Arm, and the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may be bathed with the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
with Flannels dipt in it and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
out.</p>
               <p>Take of the roots of Mar<U+017F>h-mallows one
Ounce, of the Leaves of Mallows, Mar<U+017F>h-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
Pellitory, and Violets, each one handful,
of the Flowers of Melilote one handful, of the
Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek each two Drams,
boyl them in a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Water to a
pint and half.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:63569:57"/>
But if the Woman notwith<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>he
ob<U+017F>erves the<U+017F>e directions cannot make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it mu<U+017F>t be drawn out with a Catheter

               <p>If the Woman be troubled with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Cough <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be blooded in the Arm
at any time of her being with Child, for
this is apt to occa<U+017F>ion mi<U+017F>carriage, and all
<U+017F>alted and <U+017F>piced meat and <U+017F>harp things
mu<U+017F>t be forborn. She may now and then
u<U+017F>e juice of Liquori<U+017F>h, Sugar Candy, and
Syrup of Violets, and if the Body be bound
a Gli<U+017F>ter of Milk and Sugar may be inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The following Syrup is very proper
in this ca<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Take half a pint of Claret Wine, one Dram

               <p>The Woman mu<U+017F>t go loo<U+017F>e in her

Opium five Grains, beat them well together in
a Mortar, and anoint the Piles with it twice or
thrice a day.</p>
               <p>But if the Inflammation and the <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Bed.</p>
               <p>If the Piles bleed of them<U+017F>elves immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately

if Blood begins to come away, Frictions

by intervals, an<U+017F>wer in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

Blood is much heated by the continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the Woman to bring forth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63569:67"/>
the Child, as al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e that during the<U+017F>e
<U+017F>trong Throws, her re<U+017F>piration is ever
intercepted, for which rea<U+017F>on much Blood
hath recour<U+017F>e to the Face, her Privy
Parts are <U+017F>welled, becau<U+017F>e the Infants
head often thru<U+017F>ts, and cau<U+017F>es the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Parts to di<U+017F>tend outwards; upon
which account they appear <U+017F>well'd in this
manner; <U+017F>he is often <U+017F>ubject to vomiting,
which makes many believe, who know
not the cau<U+017F>e of it, that the Women are
for this rea<U+017F>on in danger: But it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the <U+017F>ign of a <U+017F>peedy delivery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the good pains are then excited and
redoubled every moment, until the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
is fini<U+017F>hed.</p>
               <p>When the Birth is very near, Women
are troubled with an univer<U+017F>al trembling,
and chiefly of the Legs and Thighs, with
the heat of the whole Body and Humours,
which then flow from the Womb, and they
are often di<U+017F>coloured with Blood, which
with the <U+017F>igns above mentioned is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<U+017F>ign of the nearne<U+017F>s of the Birth.
This the Women u<U+017F>ually call <U+017F>hows, and
if one then puts up their Finger into the
Neck of the Womb, they will find the
inner Orifice dilated, at the opening
whereof, the Membranes of the Infant
containing the Waters pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves,
and are <U+017F>trongly forc'd downwards with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63569:67"/>
every pain the Woman has, at which
time one may perceive them to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the
Finger, more or le<U+017F>s as the pains are
<U+017F>tronger or weaker. The<U+017F>e Membranes
with the Waters in them, when gathered
(that is, when they are advanced before
the head of the Child, which makes the
Midwives call it the gathering of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
pre<U+017F>enting them<U+017F>elves at this inward
Orifice, do then re<U+017F>emble very well to the
touch of the Finger, abortive Eggs which
have yet no <U+017F>hell, but are only covered
with a <U+017F>imple Membrane. After this
the pains redoubling continually, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
are broken by the <U+017F>trong impul<U+017F>e
of the Waters, which incontinently flow
away, and then the head of the Child is
ea<U+017F>ily felt naked, and pre<U+017F>ented at the
opening of the inward Orifice of the
Womb: now all the<U+017F>e or the greate<U+017F>t part
of them meeting together, at what time
<U+017F>oever of a VVomans going with Child
it be, whether at the full time or no, one
may be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <U+017F>he will <U+017F>oon be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But great care mu<U+017F>t be taken not to
ha<U+017F>ten her Labour before the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of
it be known by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns; for that
would but torment the VVoman and Child
in vain, and put them both in danger of
their lives:</p>

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63569:68"/>
Labour contrary to nature is when the
Child comes in an ill Figure and Situation,
as when it pre<U+017F>ents any otherwi<U+017F>e than
the Head fir<U+017F>t; as al<U+017F>o when the Waters
flow away a long time before it is born;
al<U+017F>o when the After-burthen comes fir<U+017F>t.
The Labour is al<U+017F>o grievous when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Fever, or any other con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which may de<U+017F>troy the Child
in the Womb; al<U+017F>o when pains are <U+017F>mall
and come <U+017F>low with long intervals and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
profit, upon which account the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is extreamly tired; but the wrong
po<U+017F>ture of the Infant is mo<U+017F>t commonly
the cau<U+017F>e of difficult Labour. As <U+017F>oon as
it is known that the Woman is certainly
in labour by the <U+017F>igns above mentioned,
then mu<U+017F>t all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to comfort
the Woman in her Labour be got ready,
and the better to help her, care mu<U+017F>t be
taken that <U+017F>he be not <U+017F>trait laced; a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<U+017F>trong Gli<U+017F>ter may be given her, or
more than one, if there be occa<U+017F>ion, which
mu<U+017F>t be done at the beginning, before the
Child be too forwards, for afterwards it
is very difficult for her to receive them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
in the mean while all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for
her Labour <U+017F>hould be put in order, as well
for the Woman as the Child; her Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes
Stool, or rather a Pallet-bed girted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63569:68"/>
placed clo<U+017F>e by the Fire, if the Sea<U+017F>on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; the Pallet ought to be <U+017F>o placed,
as to be turned round about when there
is occa<U+017F>ion, the better to help the Woman.
If the Woman be full of Blood, it may be
convenient to Bleed her a little, for by
this means her Brea<U+017F>ts being di<U+017F>ingaged,
and her Re<U+017F>piration free, <U+017F>he will have
more <U+017F>trength to bear down her pains,
which may be done without danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the Child being about that time rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be born, hath no more need of
the Mothers Blood for its nouri<U+017F>hment,
which has been often practi<U+017F>ed with good
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. Be<U+017F>ides, this Evacuation often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
her having a Fever after delivery,
and to pre<U+017F>erve her <U+017F>trength, it will be
convenient to give her <U+017F>ome good Gelly
Broaths, new laid Eggs, or <U+017F>ome Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of burnt Wine from time to time,
or a Toa<U+017F>t dipt in Wine, avoiding <U+017F>olid
Food. Above all <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be per<U+017F>waded
to hold out her pains, bearing them down
as much as <U+017F>he can, at the in<U+017F>tant when
they take her. The Midwife mu<U+017F>t from time
to time touch the inward Orifice with her
Finger, to know whether the Waters are
ready to break, and whether the Birth
will follow <U+017F>oon after; <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
all the bearing place with emollient
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63569:69"/>
Oyls, Hogs grea<U+017F>e or fre<U+017F>h Butter, if <U+017F>he
perceive it can hardly be dilated; and
all the while <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be near her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to ob<U+017F>erve her ge<U+017F>tures diligently,
her complaints and pains; for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he may
gue<U+017F>s pretty well how the Labour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
without being obliged to touch
her Body <U+017F>o often. The Woman may by
intervals re<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf on the Bed to refre<U+017F>h
her <U+017F>elf, but not too long, e<U+017F>pecially if <U+017F>he
be a little <U+017F>hort thick Woman, for they
have always wor<U+017F>t Labours, if they lie
much on their Beds in their Travail, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of their fir<U+017F>t Children, than when
they are prevailed with to walk about
the Chamber; (but they mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under the Arms, if it be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary)
for by this means the weight of the Child
cau<U+017F>es the inward Orifice to dilate <U+017F>ooner
than in Bed. When the Waters of the
Child are ready and gather'd, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
ought to let them break of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
for the breaking of them before
the Infant be wholly in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
the Labour; for by the too ha<U+017F>ty
breaking of the<U+017F>e Waters, which ought
to help the Child to <U+017F>lide forth with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ea<U+017F>e, he remains dry, which hinders
afterwards the Pains and Throws, <U+017F>o that
they cannot be <U+017F>o effectual in excluding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63569:69"/>
the Child, as otherwi<U+017F>e they would have
been: It is therefore better to let them
break of them<U+017F>elves, and then the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
may ea<U+017F>ily find the Child bare by the
part which fir<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ents, and <U+017F>o judge
certainly whether it comes right, that is
with the Head, which <U+017F>he will find hard,
big, round, and equal; but if it be any
other part, <U+017F>he will perceive <U+017F>omething
unequal and rugged, and hard or <U+017F>oft,
more or le<U+017F>s according to the parts; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
let her di<U+017F>patch to deliver her
Woman, if <U+017F>he be not already, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t

               <p>After the Waters be broke of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
as above-<U+017F>aid, let the Woman be
pre<U+017F>ently placed on the Pallate provided
for her to this purpo<U+017F>e, near the Fire,
or <U+017F>he may, if <U+017F>he like it better, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

lying upon a Quilt in the mid<U+017F>t of the

of Delivery is in Bed, to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63569:70"/>
and trouble of being carried
thither afterwards, in which ca<U+017F>e it ought

and other filth, which is voided in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The Bed mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o made, that
the Woman being ready to be delivered,
<U+017F>hould lie on her back upon it, with her
Head and Brea<U+017F>t a little rai<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>o as that
<U+017F>he be neither lying nor <U+017F>etting; for in
this manner <U+017F>he breaths be<U+017F>t, and will
have more <U+017F>trength to help her pains,
than if <U+017F>he <U+017F>unk down into her Bed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this po<U+017F>ture <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>pread her
Thighs abroad, folding her Legs a little
towards her Buttocks, <U+017F>omewhat rai<U+017F>ed
by a <U+017F>mall Pillow underneath, and her Feet
mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>taid again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome firm thing;
moreover let her hold <U+017F>ome By-<U+017F>tanders
with her Hands, that <U+017F>he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>tay her <U+017F>elf during her pains. Being
thus placed near the <U+017F>ide of her Bed,
with her Midwife by to help upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t take courage, and further
her pains the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>he can, bearing them
down, when they take her, which <U+017F>he may
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63569:70"/>
do by holding her Breath, and forcing
her <U+017F>elf all <U+017F>he can, ju<U+017F>t as when <U+017F>he goes
to <U+017F>tool. In the mean while the Midwife
mu<U+017F>t comfort her, and per<U+017F>uade her to
endure her Labour bravely, and put her
in hopes of a <U+017F>peedy delivery. The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
with her Hand anointed with Oyl
or fre<U+017F>h Butter, may gently dilate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Orifice of the Womb, putting her
Fingers ends into its entry, and <U+017F>tretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them one from another, and thru<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by little and little the <U+017F>ides of the
Orifice towards the hinder part of the
Childs Head, anointing the<U+017F>e parts al<U+017F>o
with fre<U+017F>h Butter. When the Infants
Head begins to advance to the inward
Orifice, it is commonly <U+017F>aid it is crown'd,
and when it is come <U+017F>o far, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
begins to appear manife<U+017F>tly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the privy Parts, it is then <U+017F>aid that
the Child is in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Travail imagins, tho it is no
<U+017F>uch thing, that her Midwife hurts her
with her Fingers, finding her <U+017F>elf as it
were <U+017F>cratched, and pricked with Pins in
tho<U+017F>e parts, by rea<U+017F>on of the violent di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>ion,
which the bigne<U+017F>s of the Childs
Head cau<U+017F>es there.</p>
               <p>When things are in this po<U+017F>ture, the
Midwife mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eat her <U+017F>elf conveniently
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63569:71"/>
to receive the Child, which will <U+017F>oon
come, and with her Fingers ends, her
Nails being clo<U+017F>e paired, endeavour to
thru<U+017F>t, as above-<U+017F>aid, this crowning of
the Womb, back off over the Head of the
Child; and as <U+017F>oon as it is advanced as
far as the Ears, or thereabouts, <U+017F>he may
take hold of the two Sides with her two
Hands, that when a good pain comes, <U+017F>he
may quickly draw forth the Child, taking
care that the Navel-<U+017F>tring be not then
intangled about the Neck, or any other
part, le<U+017F>t thereby the After-burthen be
pulled with violence, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly the
Womb al<U+017F>o, whereunto it is fa<U+017F>tened, and
<U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e Flooding, or el<U+017F>e break the <U+017F>tring,
whereby the Woman may come to be
more difficultly delivered. It mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o
be ob<U+017F>erved, that the Head be not drawn
forth <U+017F>traight, but <U+017F>haking it a little from
one <U+017F>ide to the other, that the Shoulders
may <U+017F>ooner and ea<U+017F>ier take place, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after it is pa<U+017F>t, which mu<U+017F>t be
done without lo<U+017F>ing any time, le<U+017F>t the
Head being pa<U+017F>t, the Child be <U+017F>topt there
by the largene<U+017F>s of the Shoulders, and be
in danger of being <U+017F>uffocated in the pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age:
But as <U+017F>oon as the head is born,
if there be need, the Midwife may <U+017F>lide
in her Finger under the Arm-pits, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63569:71"/>
the re<U+017F>t of the Body will follow without
any difficulty. As <U+017F>oon as the Midwife
has in this manner drawn forth the Child,
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t put it on one <U+017F>ide, le<U+017F>t the Blood
and Waters, which follow immediately
after <U+017F>hould choak it; afterwards let her
be very careful to examin that there be
no more Children in the Womb, which
<U+017F>he may know, if putting her hand up the
entry, <U+017F>he finds there another Water gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have a care not
to go about to fetch the After-burthen,
till the Woman be delivered of all her
Children; wherefore the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tring mu<U+017F>t
be cut, being fir<U+017F>t tied with a Thred
three or four double, and the other end
mu<U+017F>t be fa<U+017F>tened with a <U+017F>tring to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Thigh.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the Child is born, before
the Navel-<U+017F>tring is tied or cut, the Woman
mu<U+017F>t be freed of the After-burthen. To
perform this, the Midwife having taken
the <U+017F>tring mu<U+017F>t wind it once or twice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one or two of her Fingers of her
left hand joined together, the better to
hold it, wherewith <U+017F>he may then draw
it moderately, and with the right Hand,
<U+017F>he may only take a <U+017F>ingle hold of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the left near the Privities, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewi<U+017F>e with that very gently, re<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63569:72"/>
the Fore-finger of the <U+017F>ame Hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and <U+017F>tretched forth along the
<U+017F>tring towards the entry of the Sheath,
always ob<U+017F>erving to draw it from the
<U+017F>ide, where the burthen cleaves lea<U+017F>t.
Above all things care mu<U+017F>t be taken, that
it be not drawn forth with too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
le<U+017F>t by breaking the <U+017F>tring, you
are obliged to put the whole Hand into
the Womb to deliver the Woman, or
the Womb be drawn down forth with
it; al<U+017F>o by drawing it out with too much
violence, a great flooding may thereby
happen. To facilitate the expul<U+017F>ion, the
Woman may blow <U+017F>trongly into her
Hands <U+017F>hut, or <U+017F>he may put her Finger
into her Throat, as if <U+017F>he would provoke
Vomiting, or <U+017F>he may <U+017F>trive as if <U+017F>he
were going to <U+017F>tool, bearing always down,
and holding her breath. When all the<U+017F>e
circum<U+017F>tances have been ob<U+017F>erved, if you
meet with difficulty, you may, if need
be, after that you know on which <U+017F>ide
the After-birth is <U+017F>ituated, command an
experienced Nur<U+017F>e-keeper to pre<U+017F>s the
Belly lightly with the flat of her Hand,
directing it gently downwards by way of
Friction; above all being careful not to
do it too violently; but if all this be in
vain, then mu<U+017F>t the Hand be directed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63569:72"/>
into the VVomb to loo<U+017F>en and <U+017F>eparate
it.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the VVoman is delivered of
both Child and Burthen, it mu<U+017F>t then be
con<U+017F>idered whether there be all, and care
had, that not the lea<U+017F>t part of it remain
behind, not <U+017F>o much as the skirts or clods
of Blood, which ought all to be brought
away with the fir<U+017F>t; for otherwi<U+017F>e, being
retained, they cau<U+017F>e great pains. When
the Woman has two Children, you mu<U+017F>t
not fetch the Burthen, as was <U+017F>aid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
till both the Children are born, and
then it may be done without danger, <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and drawing it always gently <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by one <U+017F>tring, <U+017F>ometimes by the
other, and <U+017F>ometimes by both together,
and <U+017F>o by turns till all is come. When
the Infant comes right and naturally, the
Woman is brought to Bed, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with little help, for which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
Midwifes are capable, and oft-times
for want of them, a <U+017F>imple Nur<U+017F>ekeeper
may <U+017F>upply the place. But when it is a
wrong Labour there is a great My<U+017F>tery
belongs to it; for then the skill and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Surgeon is for the mo<U+017F>t part
requi<U+017F>ite.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Woman is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and the Burthen come away, care
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63569:73"/>
mu<U+017F>t be taken that the loo<U+017F>ening of it be
not followed with a Flooding; if it be
not, a <U+017F>oft clo<U+017F>ure mu<U+017F>t be immediately
applied to the Womb, five or <U+017F>ix times
double, to prevent the cold Air entring
in and <U+017F>topping the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, whereby the
Womb <U+017F>hould clean<U+017F>e by degrees when the
VVomb is <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ed: If the VVoman was
not delivered upon her ordinary Bed, let
her pre<U+017F>ently be carried into it by <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>trong Body or more if there be need,
rather than to let her walk thither; which
Bed mu<U+017F>t be ready warmed and prepared,
as is requi<U+017F>ite for the clean<U+017F>ings. But if
<U+017F>he were delivered on it, which is be<U+017F>t and
<U+017F>afe<U+017F>t to prevent the danger and trouble
of carrying her to it, then all the <U+017F>oul
Linnen and other things put there for
receiving the Bloud, VVaters, and other
filth, which comes away in Labour, mu<U+017F>t
be removed, and <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be placed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
in it for her ea<U+017F>e and re<U+017F>t,
which <U+017F>he much wants to recover her of
the Pains and Labour <U+017F>he endured in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be placed with her Head
and Body a little rai<U+017F>ed for to breath the
freer, and to clean<U+017F>e the better, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that Blood which then comes away,
that <U+017F>o it may not clod, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
cau<U+017F>es very great pains. All this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63569:73"/>
will happen if they have not liberty to come
freely by this convenient Situation, in
which <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t put down her Legs and
Thighs clo<U+017F>e together having a <U+017F>mall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
for her greater ea<U+017F>e, if <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ire it
under her Hams, upon which they may
re<U+017F>t a little. Being <U+017F>o put to Bed, let
her lie neither on one <U+017F>ide nor the other,
but ju<U+017F>t on the middle of her Back, that
<U+017F>o the VVomb may repo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s its natural
and proper place.</p>
               <p>It is an ordinary cu<U+017F>tom to give the
VVoman, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he is delivered, two
Ounces of Oyl of Sweet Almonds, and as
much Syrup of Maiden-hair, which is
good to <U+017F>weeten and temper the in<U+017F>ide of
the Throat, which was heated, and hoar<U+017F>e
by her continual cryes, and holding her
breath, to bear down her Throws during
her Labour; it is al<U+017F>o good to prevent
the Grips; but this Potion goes <U+017F>o much
again<U+017F>t the Stomachs of <U+017F>ome VVomen,
that being forced to take it with an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
it may do them more hurt than
good; therefore let none have it, but
tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ire it and have no aver<U+017F>ion
for it: But good Broath taken after <U+017F>he
is a little <U+017F>etled may be more beneficial.</p>
               <p>Having thus accommodated her, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for her Belly, Brea<U+017F>ts, and lower
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63569:74"/>
parts, leave her to re<U+017F>t and <U+017F>leep if <U+017F>he
can, making no noi<U+017F>e, the Bed-Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
being clo<U+017F>e drawn, and the Doors
and VVindows of her Chamber <U+017F>hut, that
<U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing no light, <U+017F>he may the <U+017F>ooner
fall a<U+017F>leep.</p>
               <p>As <U+017F>oon as the Bed is clean<U+017F>ed from
the foul Linnen and other impurities of
the Labour, and the Woman therein pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
let there be outwardly applied all
over the bottom of her Belly and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
the following anodyne Pulti<U+017F>s
made of two Ounces of <U+017F>weet Almonds
with two or three new laid Eggs yolks and
whites, <U+017F>tirring them together in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Pipkin over hot Embers till it comes
to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of a Pulti<U+017F>s, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>pread upon Cloath, mu<U+017F>t be applyed
to tho<U+017F>e parts indifferently warm, having
fir<U+017F>t taken away the Clo<U+017F>ures which were
put to her, pre<U+017F>ently after her Delivery,
and likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch clods of Blood as were
there left. This is a very fit Remedy to
appea<U+017F>e the Pains which Women common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>uffer in tho<U+017F>e Parts, by rea<U+017F>on of the
violence then endured by the Infants Birth;
it mu<U+017F>t lie on five or <U+017F>ix hours, and then be
renewed a <U+017F>econd time, if there be occa<U+017F>ion.
Afterwards make a Decoction of Barly,
Lin<U+017F>eed, and Chervil, or with Mar<U+017F>h-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63569:74"/>
and Violet Leaves, adding to a Pint
of it an Ounce of Honey of Ro<U+017F>es, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
being luke-warm, Foment three or
four times a-day, for the fir<U+017F>t five or <U+017F>ix
days of Child-bed, the bearing place,
clean<U+017F>ing it very well from the Clods of
Blood and other Excrements which are
there emptied. Some Per<U+017F>ons only u<U+017F>e
for this purpo<U+017F>e luke-warm Milk, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Women only Barly-water. Great care
mu<U+017F>t be taken at the beginning that no <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thing be given to hinder the clean<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but when ten or twelve Days are
pa<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>he has clean<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ufficiently,
Remedies may then be u<U+017F>ed to fortifie the
Parts, for which purpo<U+017F>e a Decoction is
very proper made of Province Ro<U+017F>es,
Leaves and Roots of Plantain and Smiths
water, and when <U+017F>he has <U+017F>ufficiently and
fully done Clean<U+017F>ing, which is u<U+017F>ually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the eighteenth or twentieth Day, there
may be made for tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ire it, a
very <U+017F>trong a<U+017F>tringent Lotion to fortifie
and <U+017F>ettle tho<U+017F>e parts which have been
much relaxed, as well by the great exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
they received, as by the Humours,
wherewith they have been <U+017F>o long time
<U+017F>oak'd; this Remedy may be compo<U+017F>ed
with an Ounce and an half of Pomgranat
Peel, an Ounce of Cypre<U+017F>s Nuts, half an
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63569:75"/>
Ounce of Accorns, an Ounce of <U+017F>eal'd
Earth, an Handful of Provence Ro<U+017F>es,
and two Drachms of Roch-allom, all
which being infu<U+017F>ed in a Quart and half
a Pint of <U+017F>trong Red-wine, or that it
may not be too <U+017F>harp, <U+017F>ome Smiths water
may be mixed with the Wine, afterwards
boil it to a Quart, then <U+017F>train it, <U+017F>queez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it <U+017F>trongly; and with this Decoction
Foment the inferior parts Night and
Morning to <U+017F>trengthen and confirm them.
But they will never be reduced to the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>tate they were in, before the Woman
had Children. A <U+017F>mall Plai<U+017F>ter of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
with a little Civit in the middle may
be al<U+017F>o applyed to the Womans Navel.
As for Swaiths they need not be u<U+017F>ed the
fir<U+017F>t Day, or at lea<U+017F>t very loo<U+017F>ly, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if there has been hard Labour, becau<U+017F>e
the lea<U+017F>t compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Womans Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which is then very <U+017F>ore, as the Womb
al<U+017F>o is, proves a great inconvenience to
her; wherefore let her not be <U+017F>waithed
until the <U+017F>econd Day, and that very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the beginning. The u<U+017F>e of Swaiths
and of a good large <U+017F>quare Bol<U+017F>ter over
the whole Belly may be continued the fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>even or eight Days to keep it a little <U+017F>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but they mu<U+017F>t be taken off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
often to anoint the Womans Belly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63569:75"/>
all over, if it be <U+017F>ore, and if <U+017F>he has After-Pains,
with Oils of <U+017F>weet Almonds and
St. Johns-wort mixed together, which
may be done every Day. But after that
time they may be degrees begin to <U+017F>waith
her <U+017F>traiter, to contract and gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the parts which are greatly extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
during her going with Child, which
may be then <U+017F>afely done, becau<U+017F>e the
Womb by the<U+017F>e former clean<U+017F>ings is <U+017F>o
dimini<U+017F>hed, that it cannot be too much
compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Swaiths.</p>
               <p>Proper Remedies may be applied to the

able to overcome them, cannot make the
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Evacuation of them, which has
been the Death of many. The Woman
ought always to keep her Body open with
Gli<U+017F>ters, taking one once in two Days,
which not only evacuate the gro<U+017F>s Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

which is good to Purge the Stomach

               <p>Women in their fir<U+017F>t Labours have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

is laid, if there be only <U+017F>imple contu<U+017F>ions

the Urine from cau<U+017F>ing pain and <U+017F>marting.
Sometimes the brui<U+017F>es are <U+017F>o great, that
the Bearing-place is inflamed, and a very

<U+017F>uch as is difficultly concocted and binds

The un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable motion of the

<hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> was cut out
of his Mothers Womb, and therefore was
called Cae<U+017F>ar. This Cae<U+017F>arian Section is
thought to be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, when the Mother
and the Child are <U+017F>o weak, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be pre<U+017F>erved any other way. The
u<U+017F>e of it is twofold, one, that a living
Child may be extracted; the other, that
the Mother may be pre<U+017F>erved alive; and
tho' it is very hazardous, yet in a de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
ca<U+017F>e it is better to do <U+017F>omething
than nothing; e<U+017F>pecially when a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
is like to be broken by the death
of a Wife; or when a Family is like to
be extingui<U+017F>hed; or <U+017F>ome Kingdom or
Principality is like to be lo<U+017F>t. In this
manner we find in the Annals of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63569:82"/>
the King of <hi>Navar</hi> was pre<U+017F>erved; for his
Mother being wounded in the Belly by
the <hi>Saracens,</hi> as <U+017F>he was Hunting, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man coming to her help, <U+017F>aw the Child
put its hand out of the Wound, and
drew it forth, and educated it privately;
and afterwards, when the Nobility was
contending about the Election of a Prince,
he brought out the young King, and <U+017F>o
the Controver<U+017F>ie ended.</p>
               <p>The cau<U+017F>es which require this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are, a too great Child, or Twins,
or more that endeavour to be born to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
or if a fle<U+017F>hy Mole join to the
Child, the ill po<U+017F>ture of it, and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reduced to a better, either by its
own help, or the help of others; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it is dead, or <U+017F>o much <U+017F>well'd by
a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, that the Naturall pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is too
narrow: But in this ca<U+017F>e, it is be<U+017F>t to
take it away peece-meal. The cau<U+017F>es on
the Mothers part are the narrowne<U+017F>s of
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, either naturally, by rea<U+017F>on
<U+017F>he is too young, or too old; or becau<U+017F>e
the VVomb is <U+017F>hut, either by a Cicatrix
or a Callous. Moreover many tumours
in the Womb, or the Mouth of it may be
the cau<U+017F>e: In the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, tho it be very
dangerous, yet it is very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to u<U+017F>e
Section, and the operation may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63569:83"/>
performed, as may appear by <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Experiments to him that reads
<hi>Rou<U+017F>el.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before you enter upon this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, whether the
Child can be Extracted any other way
that is <U+017F>afer and ea<U+017F>ier. You mu<U+017F>t more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
con<U+017F>ider whether there are Signs of
Death, and if <U+017F>o, you mu<U+017F>t not enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Operation, le<U+017F>t the Womans Death
be laid upon the Section, and your ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:
But when you have througly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things, if the Woman be of a
<U+017F>trong Nature, tho by rea<U+017F>on of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<U+017F>he is weak, you may venture upon
the Operation.</p>
               <p>Mo<U+017F>t Authors would have it made on
the left <U+017F>ide of the Belly, becau<U+017F>e it is more
free from the Liver; but I, <U+017F>ays <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau,</hi>
think it will be better and more
skilfully made ju<U+017F>t in the middle of the
Belly between the two right Mu<U+017F>cles: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
in this place there is only the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and the white line to cut. To di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
then with more ea<U+017F>e and <U+017F>peed, the
Chyrugeon having placed the Woman <U+017F>o,
that the Belly may be a little rai<U+017F>ed; let
him take a good <U+017F>harp inci<U+017F>ion Knife,
very <U+017F>harp on one <U+017F>ide, with which he
mu<U+017F>t quickly make an Inci<U+017F>ion, ju<U+017F>t in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63569:83"/>
middle of the Belly between the two
right Mu<U+017F>cles unto the Peritoneum, of the
length and extent of the Womb, or
thereabouts; after that he mu<U+017F>t only
peirce the Peritoneum with the point of
his Knife, to make an Orifice for one or
two of the Fingers of his left hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which he mu<U+017F>t immediately thru<U+017F>t them
to cut it, lifting it up with them, and
conducting the In<U+017F>trument for fear of
pricking the Guts, in proportion to the
fir<U+017F>t inci<U+017F>ion of the coverings, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, the Womb will <U+017F>oon appear,
into which he mu<U+017F>t make an Inci<U+017F>ion in
the <U+017F>ame manner, as he did in the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneum,
being careful not to thru<U+017F>t his
In<U+017F>trument at once too far in; having
then <U+017F>o opened the VVomb, he mu<U+017F>t like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
make an inci<U+017F>ion in the Infants Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;
taking care not to wound it with
the In<U+017F>trument, and then he will <U+017F>oon <U+017F>ee
it, and mu<U+017F>t immediatly take it out of
the burthen, which he mu<U+017F>t nimbly <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the bottom of the VVomb,
and finding it to be yet living, let him
prai<U+017F>e God for having <U+017F>o ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed and pro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
his Operation. But the Children
<U+017F>o delivered are u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>o weak, if not
quite dead, as it often happens, that it is
hard to know, whether it is alive or dead;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63569:84"/>
yet one may be confident the Child is
living, if by touching the Navel-<U+017F>tring,
the Umbilical Arteries are perceived to
move, as al<U+017F>o the Heart, by laying the
Hand on the Brea<U+017F>t, and if it prove <U+017F>o,
means mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed to fetch it to it self,
by <U+017F>pouting <U+017F>ome VVine into the No<U+017F>e
and Mouth, and by warming it, until it
begins to <U+017F>tir of it <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, that <hi>Mauriceau</hi>
much di<U+017F>approves this cruel Operation, and
<U+017F>ays it ought not to be performed until
the VVoman is dead, for that the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

and when it is not, the Life of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

by the too great thickne<U+017F>s of the Coats,

               <p>It is ea<U+017F>ie to know when the Secundine is

               <p>But the be<U+017F>t way to drive away the

               <p>Milk is the occa<U+017F>ion of many tumours
of divers kinds: The differences may be
thus enumerated; if the Ferment of the
Brea<U+017F>t be over active, it <U+017F>eparates the
Milk with too great violence, cau<U+017F>ing
thereby an over Fermentation in the
part, which u<U+017F>ually produces a Tumor
called a Phlegmon, if the Serum be hot,
or partakes much of Blood; otherwi<U+017F>e it
rai<U+017F>es a Tumor called an Oedema; or if

Species of Tumors generally repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ari<U+017F>e from Milk, and either of
them may degenerate into a Scirrhus,
and that Scirrhus into a Cancer. The
Signs are Vi<U+017F>ible; if the fir<U+017F>t happen,
there are all the Symptoms of a Phlegmon,
Heat, Redne<U+017F>s, Ten<U+017F>ion, Pul<U+017F>ation, and
the like; if the Second, large di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:63569:94"/>
Swellings made by the over eagerne<U+017F>s
of the milky Ferment go ea<U+017F>ily off, if
no other Symptom attend them. Sucking
and drawing the Brea<U+017F>t for the mo<U+017F>t part
di<U+017F>charges the Milk, as fa<U+017F>t as it can be
generated, and then all goes off well.
But if the Fermentation produce any di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the Blood, there is more or le<U+017F>s
danger according to the quality of the
Tumor produced, <hi>viz.</hi> A Phlegmon is
apt to occa<U+017F>ion a Fever, Oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
are apt to grow Ulcers, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Scrophulous, and Scirrhous, and
require a long time for their Cure. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it frequently happens to Women in

Milk, which flows into them, and occa<U+017F>ions

Endive, Succory, Smallage, and the like,
the Seeds of wild Rue, Cummin, Ba<U+017F>il
powdered and given to the quantity of

the Milk, as Authors write.</p>
               <p>The Milk is u<U+017F>ually drawn out of the
Brea<U+017F>ts by the Infants <U+017F>ucking them: But
if the Child be <U+017F>o weak, it cannot <U+017F>uck,
or does not di<U+017F>charge them enough, <U+017F>ome
body el<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t do it, or young Whelps

               <p>The <U+017F>welling made by the Milk is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained

that the Milk may be drawn forth whil<U+017F>t
the Medicines lye on.</p>
               <p>But it is be<U+017F>t to prevent <U+017F>uch Swellings

               <p>THE cau<U+017F>e of want of Milk is a Vice
of the Blood, the weakne<U+017F>s of the
Body, or of the Child, the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of

by the No<U+017F>trils, or by the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids,
by immoderate Cold, ill Diet,

               <p>The whole Cure in a manner con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts
in Diet. If therefore it be occa<U+017F>ioned for
want of Blood, or by a dry Intemperies,
from whence it chiefly proceeds, it mu<U+017F>t
be cured by a hot and moi<U+017F>t Diet, and
the Air mu<U+017F>t be moi<U+017F>t and moderately
warm. Sleep is better than immoderate
Watching. The Bread mu<U+017F>t be Wheaten
and well fermented. Goats or Sheeps
Milk boil'd with Yolks of Eggs, and
<U+017F>weetned is good; <U+017F>o is Rice boild with
Milk and Honey, Potched Eggs, Chicken
Broath, Mutton or Veal Broath, or Broath
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63569:97"/>
of Phe<U+017F>ants, or the Fle<U+017F>h of them with a
Sauce made of Rocket and Honey; the
Udders of Animals are al<U+017F>o good. Of
Fi<U+017F>hes, a Trout, Mullet, a Salmon, Soles,
Place, Pikes, and the like are good; and
for the <U+017F>econd Cour<U+017F>e, Sweet Almonds,
Rai<U+017F>ins of the Sun, Pi<U+017F>taches, Pine Nuts,
Rocket, Par<U+017F>nips roa<U+017F>ted under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
or prepared with Honey. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>corides</hi>
and <hi>Avicenna</hi> commend Fennel
and Smalage; Lettice is al<U+017F>o good, <U+017F>o
are Cabbage, Wild Thime, Leeks, Rocket,
Fennel. Let her drink be <U+017F>weet Wine,
or White-wine, or Barley water with the
Seeds of Fennel, or Ale; wherein if you
boyl Butter, Sugar, and Bread, you'll
Scarce find a better Diet for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.
The German Women u<U+017F>e this for
their Meat and Drink almo<U+017F>t all the time
they give <U+017F>uck. All things that are acid,
acrid, bitter and very hot mu<U+017F>t be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But if this defect proceed from heat
or choler, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e cooling things,
and the Body mu<U+017F>t be purged according
to the Nature of the Humour: But if the
Blood be Flegmatick, and the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed,
you mu<U+017F>t open the Ob<U+017F>tructions
and attenuate the Blood; therefore you
mu<U+017F>t give hot things, as Smallage, Dill,
Penny-royal with Wine: But you mu<U+017F>t be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63569:97"/>
careful not to give things that are too hot;
for they dry up the Milk. And as tho<U+017F>e
things which Moderately provoke the
Cour<U+017F>es breed Milk, <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
force them le<U+017F><U+017F>en it.</p>
               <p>Blood is never to be drawn, nor are
<U+017F>trong Purges to be u<U+017F>ed: But if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to u<U+017F>e Purging by rea<U+017F>on of the
fault of the Humours, the Nur<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t

the Milk, and <U+017F>uch Medicines mu<U+017F>t
be given as increa<U+017F>e the Milk. As</p>
               <p>Take of thee Seeds of Fennel, of Leeks, and
Rocket, each two Drams, of Mace one Dram,
of the Leaves of Mallows half a handful, boyl

               <p>But if the want of Milk proceeds from

with a Decoction of Fenugreek, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile

good, you mu<U+017F>t chu<U+017F>e another Nur<U+017F>e; but
you mu<U+017F>t try all things fir<U+017F>t, for change of

               <p>THE Mothers Milk is fitte<U+017F>t for the
Child, becau<U+017F>e it is mo<U+017F>t agreeable to
it Nature: Be<U+017F>ides the Mother will be
more vigilant and careful than a hired
Nur<U+017F>e; for none can love, the Child <U+017F>o
well as the own Mother, who upon the
account of her affection is unwearied in
the attending of the Child, and thinks
<U+017F>he never does enough for it, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
awaked by its crying; whereas
mercenary Nur<U+017F>es often overlay Children
and <U+017F>uffocate them. Moreover the Body,
and the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Mind are more
framed by the Milk and Nouri<U+017F>hment,
than by the nature of the Seed; and as
you often ob<U+017F>erve that the Child is purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the Nur<U+017F>e is Purged; <U+017F>o the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Humours are in a manner the
<U+017F>ame with hers, as Trees partake of the
nature of the Soil they are planted in. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
it is the duty of a Mother to nur<U+017F>e
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63569:98"/>
her own Child; for tho<U+017F>e that do not are
but half Mothers, and to be <U+017F>ure cannot
love them <U+017F>o well as tho<U+017F>e that do. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account a <hi>Roman</hi> Youth of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> returning Rich and
Victorious from the Wars, being met by
his Mother and his Nur<U+017F>e, gave his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Silver Ring, and his Nur<U+017F>e a
Gold Chain; whereat his Mother being
offended; You, <U+017F>aid he, nouri<U+017F>hed me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nine Months in the Womb, and then
rejected me, this Woman received me
into her Arms, and <U+017F>uckled me two Years,
and taught me to be orderly. The Water
nouri<U+017F>hes what is bred in the Water, and
the Earth nouri<U+017F>hes what is bred in the
Earth: Nor is there any Bea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o cruel,
as not to nouri<U+017F>h its young ones. Tygers,
Lions, and Vipers take care of their
young ones, and only Man makes Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of his: Oh! incredible and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Villany, what can be more cruel,
than to expo<U+017F>e a tender Infant that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
his Mothers help, as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
<U+017F>he can get rid of it? But God in
his Providence often puni<U+017F>hes their Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
for their Milk often curdles in
their Brea<U+017F>t, and occa<U+017F>ions dreadful pains,
<U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e Brea<U+017F>ts, which were denied
their Children are forced to be <U+017F>uckt by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63569:99"/>
Puppies; nor is this all, for their Brea<U+017F>ts
are often Inflamed and Suppurated, and
mu<U+017F>t be cut with Knives, or burnt with
red hot Irons, or becoming Cancerous,
the rotten Fle<U+017F>h drops from them piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal.
But <U+017F>ome will object in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e,
that they are either too young or too
weak, yet without doubt if they are able
to Conceive, they may Suckle too; for
God never gave them Brea<U+017F>ts full of Milk
to no purpo<U+017F>e. But if they have not
Milk enough, which is the only real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e,
a Nur<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be cho<U+017F>en, who ought
to be of an age betwixt twenty and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<U+017F>he ought to be of a <U+017F>trong Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
well Coloured, not too Fat, nor
too Lean; <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not have rotten Teeth,

with Scabs, Ulcers, the French-Pox,
Gout, Con<U+017F>umption, or any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.
Thirdly, Her Manners are to be
con<U+017F>idered; for the Child <U+017F>ucks them in
with the Milk; whereof the Nur<U+017F>e ought
to be good tempered; <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not be
<U+017F>ubject to violent Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, nor wholly
without Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, nor of a weak Judgment;
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>quint eyed, le<U+017F>t the
Child <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o; <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be Cha<U+017F>t,
and not have Conver<U+017F>ation with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
le<U+017F>t her Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould flow, or the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63569:99"/>
Blood be di<U+017F>turbed, and con<U+017F>equently the
Milk; or be with Child, whereby the
Milk would be le<U+017F><U+017F>ened, and become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious:
but <U+017F>ome think that the Cour<U+017F>es
flowing moderately does not vitiate the
Milk, but rather clean<U+017F>es the re<U+017F>t of the
Blood. Fourthly, we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider the
time from Delivery; for <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not
give <U+017F>uck too near Delivery, nor too long
from the time of it. She mu<U+017F>t not give
<U+017F>uck until <U+017F>he be free of the Child-bed
Purgations; the time mo<U+017F>t approved of,
is from the Second Month to the Sixth,
and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have Nur<U+017F>ed a Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Fifthly, The Brea<U+017F>ts are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered,
which ought to be moderately
full, not loo<U+017F>e and hanging down; but
<U+017F>olid and firm, of a moderate bigne<U+017F>s
and hardne<U+017F>s, and the Veins of them
<U+017F>hould look blew, and di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<U+017F>treams, moderately elevated, that
they may contain the more Milk; for if
they are den<U+017F>e, and the Milk is bound
up in them, and as it were <U+017F>uffocated,
the Child can <U+017F>carce draw it, and <U+017F>o
either takes a di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>te, or if it <U+017F>uck on,
the No<U+017F>e is flattened by the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure.
Sixthly, The Paps mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort
as that the Child cannot take hold of
them with his Lips, nor <U+017F>o long and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63569:100"/>
thick, as to fill the Infants Mouth, <U+017F>o that
it cannot readily u<U+017F>e its Tongue to <U+017F>uck
or <U+017F>wallow. Seventhly, The nature of
the Milk mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
the clearne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of it,
which are the fir<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>its, mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o
<U+017F>weet-<U+017F>ented, not too thick nor too thin,
which may be tried by dipping a hair in
the Milk, hanging it up, if the Milk <U+017F>lide
off, it is naught, but if it compa<U+017F>s the
whole hair it is good. Eightly, chu<U+017F>e a
Nur<U+017F>e which was la<U+017F>t delivered of a Male
child. Ninethly, Such an one as is not
wont to mi<U+017F>carry. Tenthly, She mu<U+017F>t not
be with Child. The Nur<U+017F>e <U+017F>o de<U+017F>cribed
on the fir<U+017F>t days <U+017F>he begins to <U+017F>uckle mu<U+017F>t
u<U+017F>e a <U+017F>imple Diet, le<U+017F>t too much Milk
<U+017F>hould overwhelm the tender Infant. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
let her have good Meats: She
mu<U+017F>t not Drink exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain
from Wine, and from <U+017F>alt, <U+017F>harp,
and a <U+017F>tringent Meats, and Leeks, Onions,
Garlick, Rocket and Spices. She mu<U+017F>t
avoid all perturbations of Mind, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation;
let her moderately exerci<U+017F>e
her Arms and upper Parts. La<U+017F>tly, Her
Diet mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch, as the Nature and
Con<U+017F>titution of the Infant requires; if
the Child be of a hot Con<U+017F>titution, <U+017F>he
mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e a cooling Diet; but if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63569:100"/>
be of a cold Con<U+017F>titution, a little
Wine and Spices mu<U+017F>t be allowed, and
<U+017F>tronger exerci<U+017F>e, and if the Nur<U+017F>e be not
well, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be purged, and Diet mu<U+017F>t
be ordered according to the faults of the

Thighs joyned together to prevent the
falling of it out again. But the be<U+017F>t way
is to put up a Pe<U+017F><U+017F>ary into the Neck of
the Womb to keep it firm.</p>
               <p>Take of Oak Bark two Ounces, boyl it in
two Quarts of Fountain Water, add at the
latter end an Ounce of Pomgranat-peel brui<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Red Ro<U+017F>es, Pomgranat Flowers, each two
handfuls, and then add half a Pint of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine;
<U+017F>train it, and bath the part affected

               <head type="sub">Of a Drop<U+017F>ie and Inflation of the
Womb.</head>
               <p>THE Inflation and Drop<U+017F>ie are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
by almo<U+017F>t all Authors; but
they are to be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed; for there is
a certain Inflation of the Womb
which ought not to be called a Drop<U+017F>ie,
<hi>Viz.</hi> When the Womb is Inflated, and
<U+017F>tretched <U+017F>uddenly by Wind ru<U+017F>hing in;
upon which account a violent Pain is
occa<U+017F>ioned; this often happens in Hy<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Wherefore a Drop<U+017F>ie of the
Womb is two-fold, one from Wind,
which is like a Tympany; another from
a watery Humour, which is like a Drop<U+017F>ie
of the Belly.</p>
               <p>As to the Diagno<U+017F>tick of the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
many things are to be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, How they may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
from an univer<U+017F>al Drop<U+017F>ie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How the Species of it may be
known, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it proceeds from
Wind, Water, or Flegm<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:63569:109"/>
Thirdly, If it ari<U+017F>e primarily from the
Womb, or be occa<U+017F>ioned by the fault
of <U+017F>ome other part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be contained in the Cavity of the
Womb, or within the Membranes of it,
or in Bladders.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, How it may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
from other Tumours of the Womb.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, How it may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
from being with Child.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, How it may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
from a Mola.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, It is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al
Drop<U+017F>ie, for that in a Drop<U+017F>ie of
the Womb, the Tumour po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es more
the bottom of the Womb, and there is
not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon a palene<U+017F>s and wa<U+017F>ting of the
whole Body, as in an univer<U+017F>al Drop<U+017F>ie.
Be<U+017F>ides, in a Drop<U+017F>ie of the Womb, the
thir<U+017F>t and drine<U+017F>s of the Tongue is not
con<U+017F>iderable, and Wind breaks out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
or a little Water flows out, which
manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>hew, that Wind or Water is
contained in the Womb.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Species of Drop<U+017F>ies in
the Womb are thus di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed, if it
be occa<U+017F>ioned by Wind, the bottom of
the Belly <U+017F>ounds being <U+017F>truck; there are
pricking pains in the Belly, which <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63569:109"/>
run through the Diaphragm, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Loins, Navel, and other parts,
and <U+017F>ometimes the Wind does evidently
break through the Neck of the Womb;
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e grows wor<U+017F>e upon eating and
drinking, and they often belch, and are
better after it; they <U+017F>ometimes perceive
a pain in the Region of the Hypoga<U+017F>ter,
<U+017F>o that they cannot bear an Hand laid
on it; the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns are al<U+017F>o in an Inflation
of the Womb; but there is this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for an Inflation is but for a <U+017F>mall
<U+017F>pace, and a Drop<U+017F>ie from Wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
much longer.</p>
               <p>But if a Drop<U+017F>ie of the Womb is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ioned
by Water, that Region appears
<U+017F>oft and flaccid, for Wind cau<U+017F>es a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion;
there is a greater weight in the
part, and a <U+017F>ound as it were of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
floating, and Water <U+017F>ometimes drops
from the part. And if it proceed from
Flegm, there is a greater <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and
flaccidity of the part, which dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>es,
and afflicts the neighbouring
parts with oedematous Swellings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If there be <U+017F>igns of the
whole Bodies being ill affected, as by
long or acute Fevers, by immoderate
Hemorrhagies, by weakne<U+017F>s of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<U+017F>welling of the Liver or Spleen,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63569:110"/>
or by other ob<U+017F>tinate Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e
parts, by which the Drop<U+017F>ie of the
Womb began, and increa<U+017F>ed with them;
there is good rea<U+017F>on to conjecture that
the Matter of the Drop<U+017F>ie is received in
tho<U+017F>e parts; but if when the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is well, <U+017F>uch a Tumour happens,
and <U+017F>ucceeds particular Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the
Womb, as hard Labour, <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
the Cour<U+017F>es, or too large an Evacuation
of them, or Ulcers and Tumours, we
may gue<U+017F>s that the Drop<U+017F>ie of the
Womb proceeds from them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Matter which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the cavity of the Womb cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
a much greater Tumour than when
it is contained within the Membranes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a Drop<U+017F>ie of the Womb may
be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from Tumours that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a Phlegmon, or an Ery<U+017F>ipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
becau<U+017F>e in the<U+017F>e there is a Fever
and Pain upon the lea<U+017F>t touching; it may
be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from the Scirrhous,
or Cancerous Tumour by the hardne<U+017F>s
that re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the Finger.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When a Woman is with
Child, the Tumour is not equal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
but thru<U+017F>ts it <U+017F>elf out above the
Navel; and when a Woman is with
Child, after <U+017F>ome Months <U+017F>he is mo<U+017F>t
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63569:110"/>
commonly better; but the longer a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie
la<U+017F>ts, the wor<U+017F>e it grows, and the
motion of the Child is plainly to be
felt after the third or fourth Month; yet
in a Drop<U+017F>ie that ari<U+017F>es from Wind, a
palpitation may be <U+017F>ometimes perceived
in the Womb, and when a Woman is
with Child, the Brea<U+017F>ts <U+017F>well, but in a
Drop<U+017F>ie they wax <U+017F>mall.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In a Mole there is a weight
felt in the Body, which is not perceived
in a Drop<U+017F>ie of the Womb, and when
the Sick lies on either <U+017F>ide, a weight is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as if a Stone rolled thither. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
in a Mole there are violent Fluxes
of the Cour<U+017F>es by intervals, namely, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
third or fourth Month, which does not
happen in a Drop<U+017F>ie of the Womb; and
la<U+017F>tly, in a Mole the Brea<U+017F>ts <U+017F>well, and
have Milk in them <U+017F>ometimes, but there
is no <U+017F>uch thing in a Drop<U+017F>ie.</p>
               <p>As to the Progno<U+017F>ticks, a Simple Inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Womb is not dangerous, but
if it continue long, it may turn to a
Drop<U+017F>ie.</p>
               <p>If Wind or Water is contained in
the cavity of the Womb it is ea<U+017F>ier cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than when it is included in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
or in Bladders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:63569:111"/>
This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is cured much the <U+017F>ame
way as a Drop<U+017F>ie or Green-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s is;
but <U+017F>ome things peculiar to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
mu<U+017F>t be added: If the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be new,
and occa<U+017F>ioned by an Ob<U+017F>truction of the
Cour<U+017F>es, and if there be a fulne<U+017F>s of
Blood, Bleeding may be proper, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
it is injurious; but Purging is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and mu<U+017F>t be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and after <U+017F>ufficient Purging, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritives,
Diureticks, and <U+017F>uch things
as move the Cour<U+017F>es mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed,
to which may be added the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of Smallage, and Madder,
each half an Ounce, of the Leaves of Savin,
Feverfew, and Penny-royal, each one Pugil,
of the Seeds of Daucus, one Dram, boyl them
in the Broaths of young Pidgeons, and let

nine Pills; after the u<U+017F>e of which Medicine,
violent Exerci<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed, that thereby
the Excrements bred in the Bowels, and in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63569:111"/>
the habit of the Body may be di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated, and
al<U+017F>o all that which is contained in the Womb,
the Skins being broken by the violence of the
Exerci<U+017F>e, and if the Woman Vomit ea<U+017F>ily, it
will be proper to Vomit her twice a Week.
The following Bolus is very effectual to di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s
the Humour contained in the Womb.</p>
               <p>Take of Mineral Borax, half a Dram,

               <p>Sudorificks are al<U+017F>o very proper; in
the mean while the heat of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach

taken inwardly, and outwardly applyed.
The Womb mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be <U+017F>trengthened by
proper Topical Medicines: Fir<U+017F>t by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations

               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:63569:112"/>
But that the forementioned Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may <U+017F>ucceed the better, you mu<U+017F>t
apply it before and behind, and the Sick
ought to Sweat, if <U+017F>he can, in the Bed
or in a Bath.</p>
               <p>In a windy Drop<U+017F>ie dry Fomentations
are more beneficial, with Bags made of

               <p>After the Fomentation, anoint the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Belly with the Oyls of Nard, Dill,
Rue, Worm-wood, Southern-wood, and
if they are Chimically prepared they will

an Old and Skilful Midwife was called,

               <p>A VVoman had a painful hard Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Of all the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which afflict Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the Cancer is the mo<U+017F>t grievous

The material cau<U+017F>e of Worms, is a
cold phlegmatick and crude Humour,
which is apt to putrifie.</p>
               <p>When there are Worms in the Womb,
the whole Body is re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s and unea<U+017F>ie,
the Mouth of the Womb is always
moi<U+017F>t, the Women are thin and weak,
and <U+017F>ometimes the Worms are expelled
with the Cour<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>ometimes they
may be <U+017F>een, the Lips of the Privities
being opened. Women <U+017F>o afflicted <U+017F>leep

they have di<U+017F>orderly Fevers, and all
other Symptoms which appear in Worms

               <p>As to the Cure, we mu<U+017F>t endeavour to

That the Stones grow in every part of
the Body, <hi>Galen</hi> te<U+017F>tifies, as in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Reins, Liver, Inte<U+017F>tines, Lungs; and
therefore it is no <U+017F>trange thing if they
<U+017F>hould be generated al<U+017F>o in the Womb,
as <hi>Aetius</hi> writes: but they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like the Stones of the Bladder, nor
are they loo<U+017F>e, for if <U+017F>o they could not
continue in the Womb; but they grow to
the Tunicks of the neck of the Womb.
The cau<U+017F>es of them are the <U+017F>ame, as of
the Stone in the Bladder, namely, gro<U+017F>s
and vi<U+017F>cid Humours. The <U+017F>igns of them
are a dull pain in the Womb, and the
Cour<U+017F>es are inordinate, and a Finger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put up the Anus, the Stone may be
<U+017F>elt. But if the Stone be in the neck of
the Womb, the pain is great, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the neighbouring parts, and the
Womb, and the Woman can not <U+017F>it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>As to the Cure, an emollient and lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating

the gro<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>cid Humours mu<U+017F>t be Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to be performed by extracting the Stone,
but fir<U+017F>t the parts mu<U+017F>t be quieted by an
emollient Gli<U+017F>ter made of a Decoction of
Mallows, Mar<U+017F>h-mallows, Fenugreek, of

               <p>The Womans Thighs being <U+017F>pread,
the Chirurgeon mu<U+017F>t thru<U+017F>t up two of
the Fingers of his Left-hand, and with
his Right he mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>s the upper part
of her Belly to force the Stone out, and
this may be the ea<U+017F>ier done, if the Stone
be in the Neck of the Womb, but if it
be in the Womb it <U+017F>elf, the Operation
will be more difficultly performed: But
if the <U+017F>tone grow to the mouth or neck
of the Womb, and cannot be extirpated
this way, it mu<U+017F>t be cut out, the Woman
being rightly placed, and the parts dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Speculum Matricis, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, tho<U+017F>e things mu<U+017F>t be injected
into the Womb which cure Ulcers, fir<U+017F>t,
A<U+017F>tringents, and <U+017F>uch things as <U+017F>top
Blood, and afterwards drying things, and
an exact Cour<U+017F>e of Diet mu<U+017F>t be ordered,
and the Woman mu<U+017F>t be Purged twice
in a Year, le<U+017F>t the Stone <U+017F>hould grow
again.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Stone in the Bladder
in Women is to be managed much in the
manner as in Men, but it <U+017F>eldomer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
and is ea<U+017F>ier Cured, becau<U+017F>e the

pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Urine is larger, and <U+017F>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

it happen, and mu<U+017F>t be extracted, the
Chirurgeon mu<U+017F>t put two of the Fingers
of his Left-hand, (the VVoman being
placed as above directed) into the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and with his Right he mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>s

Take of the leaves of Melilot, Mallows,

of the Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each

they mu<U+017F>t be burnt off, and the Ulcer

               <p>If there be Hemorrhoids, they are
either in the Mouth or Neck of the
Womb, or in the Womb it <U+017F>elf, or in
the Privities; they are as divers as tho<U+017F>e

open; they are with or without Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
they differ al<U+017F>o upon their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
Number and Figure; they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ioned
by Chaps, and by a Condylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
but chiefly by gro<U+017F>s and feculent
Humours falling upon the Veins of the

Men<U+017F>truous Blood into tho<U+017F>e Veins. This
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e may be known by a weight in

weak and <U+017F>ubject to Spontaneous La<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But if the Hemorrhoids of the
Womb, or Anus flow moderately, they
cure and prevent many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the

They are cured as the Piles of

The Fir<U+017F>t are Acrocordones, which hang

               <p>Secondly, Thymus which is a rough
and oblong Tumour, and without pain,
if it be gentle and white, or redi<U+017F>h;
but if it be Malignant it is livid and
painful.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ficus or Mari<U+017F>cae, which differ
from a Thymus only in bigne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is Clavus, which is a
hard white and round prominence like
the Heads of Corns. The<U+017F>e Tumours in
general are of a Scirrhous nature, and
come by immoderate Copulation, and
are <U+017F>ometimes Malignant, by rea<U+017F>on of
the French-Pox. The gentle are known
by their white or redi<U+017F>h colour, and by
the ab<U+017F>ence of pain, the Malignant by
their hardne<U+017F>s, leaden colour and pain.</p>
               <p>They are Cured by four <U+017F>orts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, By a Diet that is not apt to breed
gro<U+017F>s Humours, and by Catharticks to

Secondly, By di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ing Medicines,
which are mo<U+017F>t proper for the Thymus
and Clavus as by dried Sage, with fat
Figs, or Old-<U+017F>hoes burnt and powdered
and mixed with Wine and applyed: But
the Soles of Shoes and a dried Gourd
powdered by them<U+017F>elves, and afterwards
mixed and applied with Wine to Warts
do very well, or you may take of Rue

of Frankincen<U+017F>e, the Leaves of Ba<U+017F>il
Wine and Vinegar, Shoomakers Ink,
boyl them in the VVater that drops out
of a Vine cut; moi<U+017F>ten the part with

and within Six Days, as <hi>Aetius</hi> writes;
Myrmecies will be extirpated, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t

               <p>Thirdly, Things that burn and eat are
proper for Myrmecies and Acrocordos, as
the juice of wild Cucumber with Salt,
or the like: But corroding things mu<U+017F>t

               <p>Fourthly, If they may be cut off, they
ought to be <U+017F>o, but <U+017F>ome bind the root

               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, By Meats of good juice, and by
ab<U+017F>taining from all acrid, acid and <U+017F>alt

that Melancholy Blood is drawn by the<U+017F>e

they mu<U+017F>t be pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that they may

When they are to be applied, you mu<U+017F>t
Foment the part with a Decoction of
Camomile, Mallows, Mullein, and the
like; then rub it, that the Mouth of the
Veins may appear, and to each of them
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63569:135"/>
apply a Leech; if they will not <U+017F>tick,
anoint the place with Chickens Blood,

let a hot Decoction of Camomile,
Dill, Ro<U+017F>es, and Mallows be put under
them, that the vapour of it may comfort
them. A <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Blood
being drawn, they generally fall off of
