            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:44923:7"/>branded with the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hameful and blemi<U+017F>hing Titles; <U+017F>ome do <U+017F>o illy re<U+017F>ent what favours of it, that one would imagine that they had a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Antipathy to it, lurking in the very frame of their Natures: Some damn it as Irreligious and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian, and deem it wholly incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with Go<U+017F>pel Simplicity; becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F>covers the Darkne<U+017F>s of that Light that they fancifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. Its wonderful to <U+017F>ee how many are continually puffing at this Light; <U+017F>ome with the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bla<U+017F>ts of Rage anf Fury, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with the gentle ones of Scoff and Deri<U+017F>ion, but each equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igning its Final and Fatal Extinction. Revealed Knowledge, is to the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome, a thing Dull and Irrational, Natural, with others is Sordid and Athei<U+017F>tic. Either of tho<U+017F>e Lights are much too Glorious for the vitiated Optics of <U+017F>uch Bruti<U+017F>h Sen<U+017F>uali<U+017F>ts. Nothing grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb facs="tcp:44923:7"/>them but what accords with their Humerous Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, and is tempered into a <U+017F>utablene<U+017F>s to their Corrupted Phancies: Its <U+017F>trange Men <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o much oppo<U+017F>e their own Happine<U+017F>s, di<U+017F>own their cleare<U+017F>t Faculties, and without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of Provocation, be content to place them<U+017F>elves in a lower Rank than God and Nature has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. To talk of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Humane Soul, to vindicate its Difference from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Sub<U+017F>tances, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Origin and Production, is now become <U+017F>ufficient to entitle a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on to the Malignant Scoffs of <U+017F>ome Prophaner Wits: For Sen<U+017F>uality is <U+017F>o much their Element, that they are not ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded to be Wi<U+017F>e beyond it, neither can they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think tho<U+017F>e things to have a proper Exi<U+017F>tence, which are not capable of being confined to that Praedicament. So that what-ever is
<pb facs="tcp:44923:8"/>declared of things Spiritual (things of a more Noble and Sublime Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction than what's Corporeal) is by <U+017F>uch no otherwi<U+017F>e e<U+017F>teemed than impertinent Babling. All that we hear from them of the<U+017F>e Matters, is only that con<U+017F>tant Clamour, that to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert Immaterial, and Spiritual Beings is unintelligible Non<U+017F>en<U+017F>e. But it were unworthy any Per<U+017F>on of Ingenuity to be concerned, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Purity of our Faculties, and a <U+017F>erious Reflection on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Nature, is Argument enough to convince any of the mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious unrea<U+017F>onablene<U+017F>s of <U+017F>uch Frantic Surmi<U+017F>es: Should we to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <U+017F>ome perver<U+017F>e Humori<U+017F>t, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve all our Knowledge into Sen<U+017F>e, we mu<U+017F>t be forced to confe<U+017F>s that we under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>carcely any thing of our owu Natures; that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted Actions, which we could no more, nay le<U+017F>s account for, than the Flux and Reflux of the Ocean;
<pb facs="tcp:44923:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>and who<U+017F>e Fountain and Original would be as undeterminable as that of <hi>Nibe,</hi> As for the reducing tho<U+017F>e Acts of Will and Under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>iner Reflex ones, to the Arietations and Fortuious Jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Atomes, is a Notion exceedingly gro<U+017F>s and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urd: For the mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>ite Motion of the <U+017F>moothe<U+017F>t and <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t parts of Matter is utterly incompatible with the <U+017F>ubtle and refined Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a Spirits Faculties: So ridiculous does the Hypothe<U+017F>is of the Athei<U+017F>ts <U+017F>eem to be, that I cannot imagine any <U+017F>hould adopt it, unle<U+017F>s he were <U+017F>wayed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t, or bya<U+017F><U+017F>ed by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret thoughts of his being capacitated to maintain any thing again<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t violent A<U+017F><U+017F>aults of his well accompli<U+017F>hed Adver<U+017F>aries. Let the Athei<U+017F>tic Tribe brave it with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>o much Confidence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption, yet any Rea<U+017F>onable
<pb facs="tcp:44923:9"/>Per<U+017F>on may at an ea<U+017F>ie rate be informed of its groundle<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and the Weakne<U+017F>s of its <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Strong Confidence ought to be built on weighty Rea<U+017F>ons and confirmed Truths, or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>tructure will become the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mens Scorn and Deri<U+017F>ion: And whether the Confidence of <U+017F>ome Athei<U+017F>ts be any better founded, I think the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e may in part evidence to any impartial and di<U+017F>-intere<U+017F>ted Mind: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded that this piece will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to any to whom Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is dear and delightful, but I judge it will be far otherwi<U+017F>e to tho<U+017F>e that affect Ignorance, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their own Blindne<U+017F>s and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that like the <hi>Negro's</hi> think nothing Beautiful but what di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it <U+017F>elf in their own Native Blackne<U+017F>s: But it were apparent Folly to manife<U+017F>t any Re<U+017F>entment of their Cen<U+017F>ures, who endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:44923:9"/>to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the di<U+017F>tance between Man and Brutes, as is evidently vi<U+017F>ible by their earne<U+017F>t and vehement At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ca<U+017F>heir that Knowledge that makes the difference the more wide and con<U+017F>picuous. The Subject, of the en<U+017F>uing Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e (as the Title Page a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us) is Man, the Compendium of the Univer<U+017F>e, and a brief <U+017F>ummary of all Natures Works; <U+017F>o that indeed a Treati<U+017F>e on this Subject, is as it were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the whole Book of Nature: For that there is <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing In Man Analogic to all the Parts of the Harmonious Structure of the World, is that which the Treati<U+017F>e in its very Entrance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents by a very curious and exact Delenation: It de<U+017F>cribes Man in almo<U+017F>t all his Po<U+017F>tures and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, di<U+017F>covers the Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Origin of his Diviner Part; clearly manife<U+017F>ts the <U+017F>ublime Nature of the Properties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb facs="tcp:44923:10"/>of that Incorporeal Being; gives <U+017F>ome probable Conjectures of its Condition, both Antecedent and Con<U+017F>equent, to its <U+017F>tate of Union: Opens the Nature of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <U+017F>hews the Difference occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Terminations of the Ira<U+017F>cible and Concupi<U+017F>cible Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites on the Variety of Objects. Then it evidences to us the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and detects the Vanity of Athei<U+017F>tic Cavils again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o famous and irrefragable a Truth: It al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ents us with a delightful View of the curious Frame of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, and thence rai<U+017F>es us to the Contemplation of the Ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Goodne<U+017F>s and Admiration of the Stupendious Wi<U+017F>dom of the Deity, vi<U+017F>ible in the erecting <U+017F>o Amiable and Harmonious a Fabric. Then MAN in the differing circum<U+017F>tances of Age, Sex, and Complexion, is offered us as the Object of our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation: So that the Author has
<pb facs="tcp:44923:10"/>traver<U+017F>ed all the various Regions of the Microco<U+017F>m, and has nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly de<U+017F>cribed the mo<U+017F>t remarkable Occurrences in that intellectual Sy<U+017F>tem. The De<U+017F>ign of which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Controver<U+017F>ie, is no other than to guide us in the practice of, and <U+017F>hew us the Comprehen<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s of that Ancient Sentence, <hi>Know thy Self.</hi> The Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e aims at the Knowledge of our Selves, at clear and di<U+017F>tinct Apprehen<U+017F>ions of our own Natures, at a view of our whole Frame and Module: And altho nakedly con<U+017F>idered it be <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, yet it is directly levelled at Practice, namely, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us in the regular Ordering and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lives and Actions: it were then undeniable madne<U+017F>s or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedne<U+017F>s, to frown at, or <U+017F>hew a di<U+017F>like of the Endeavours of others advantaging us in a larger Pro<U+017F>pect of our own Beings: If we blame others, and di<U+017F>parage their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb facs="tcp:44923:11"/>de<U+017F>igned for our Benefit, it is an apparent Demon<U+017F>tration we maintain an over-winning Fondne<U+017F>s of our own Abilities; what others may object again<U+017F>t this Treati<U+017F>e, I am not able to conjecture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>hall I be <U+017F>olicitous to enquire; but this I dare promi<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>uch as are acted with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ingenuous Souls, will be candid and favourable: But as for <U+017F>uch as applaud them<U+017F>elves for their admirable Faculty in Obtrecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Raylery, and <U+017F>uch like di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious Foolery, it were ab<U+017F>urd to regard them. It is u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>aid, and I wi<U+017F>h it were more con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That its much ea<U+017F>ier to quarrel at Mens Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, than to frame one of a more even and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic Compo<U+017F>ure. To cen<U+017F>ure Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>es of <U+017F>quable with them is no de<U+017F>perate difficulty, but to write o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that <U+017F>hall in all re<U+017F>pects won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully <U+017F>urmount them, is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:44923:11"/>of no great Facility. I confe<U+017F>s a compleat mea<U+017F>ure of Con<U+017F>idence may accompli<U+017F>h a Man for Drollery and Invectives; but there mu<U+017F>t be other Ingredients to make him de<U+017F>erve the Denomination of truly Learned: And to <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hall look on what the Author here Expo<U+017F>es to the Public, with an Eye of Di<U+017F>dain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, its my humble Reque<U+017F>t they would recommend to us <U+017F>omething of their own on the <U+017F>ame Subject, more worthy our In<U+017F>pection and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<U+017F>al, by which thing I am per<U+017F>waded, they will highly gratifie the Author and plea<U+017F>e others. If Reader, the Authors Judgment and thine, may interfer (as its highly probable they may) let not that be cogent with thee to move thee to a di<U+017F>like of what he offers thee. Thou perhaps judge<U+017F>t thy Opinions to be founded on the plaine<U+017F>t and cleare<U+017F>t Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when-as on the contrary, the Author pre<U+017F>umes, and that it
<pb facs="tcp:44923:12"/>may be not ra<U+017F>hly, that his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are enforced with as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Demon<U+017F>trations as any. It were therefore unbecoming to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate thy Sentence of the Treati<U+017F>e, either in a way of Commendation or Detraction, till thou ha<U+017F>t deliberately weighed and con<U+017F>idered the De<U+017F>ign, Matter, and Method of it. Let it be but admitted to plead at the Bar of Rea<U+017F>on, and I am confident the Author will be content to <U+017F>ubmit to any thing, that <U+017F>hall certainly be determined by that High Court of <hi>Judicature.</hi> What remains is only to recommend the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to thy Candid Peru<U+017F>al, hoping it may be of <U+017F>ome Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to thee. <hi>Vale</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44923:37"/>incumbent upon our Studies, a great Commotion in our Heads, and a kind of Confu<U+017F>ion in the Parts of the Brain, which would not happen, except Perception and Cogitation did depend on Matter, and were made by the Motion and Agitation of the Particles of the Brain.</p>
               <p>There might be <U+017F>ome probability in this,<note place="margin">Its Solution.</note> if the Author could drive us to believe that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el<U+017F>e but Matter in the whole Univer<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>eeing this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, we <U+017F>hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the other as fal<U+017F>e and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; for if this were true, why may not al<U+017F>o the Bodies of Men, when defunct, be endued with the <U+017F>ame Power of Cogitation?

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Fir<U+017F>t, The Opinion of the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Ga<U+017F><U+017F>endus,</hi> who who do thus Philo<U+017F>ophize; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Brutes have a Corporeal

               </p>
               <p>That Brutes are nothing el<U+017F>e but Machins curiou<U+017F>ly Fabricated by the chief Opifex of Nature; being Acted and Moved by no other than a Mechanic Motion, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sen<U+017F>e nor Perception in them; and this Opinion, <U+017F>aith Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>Fernelius,</hi> <U+017F>eems to be taken from the Philo<U+017F>ophy of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es,</hi> where the Blood is <U+017F>aid to be the Life of Brutes. <hi>Le-Grand</hi> al<U+017F>o in his Book, <hi>De Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia <U+017F>en<U+017F>us &amp; cognitionis in Brutis,</hi> hath endeavoured to defend <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and prove that Brutes are nothing but Natural Horologies, or Organs of Clock-work, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as void of Sen<U+017F>e, as Clocks performing their Motion the <U+017F>ame way.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <p>The Third is the Hypothe<U+017F>is of Famous <hi>Derodon,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth, viz.</hi> That Brutes are Acted by an Incorporeal Soul, not differing in kind from Mans, but only in degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That <hi>Bruits</hi> have not Material Souls.</note> From the Fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge my Di<U+017F><U+017F>ent, or contradict my <U+017F>elf in what I <U+017F>aid before; (yet <U+017F>till retaining that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Adoration I bear to the Learning of its Authors.) For I have already declared that there is contrariety between Matter and Spirit; <U+017F>o that a <hi>Material, or Corporeal Spirit,</hi> is a contradiction, and I have already <U+017F>aid, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it <U+017F>elf is Inactive Sen<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s and Inert: <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tem of the Univer<U+017F>e.</note>
                  <q>Neither can the Souls of Brutes, <U+017F>aith a late Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>opher, be imagined to be Flame and Fire; for Flame and Fire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <U+017F>uch a Motion of the In<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Parts of a Body, as whereby they are violently agitated, and many times di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated for begetting tho<U+017F>e Flames of Light and Heat in the Animals:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44923:39"/>Now there is no difficulty at all in conceiving that In<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a Body which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Quie<U+017F>cent, may be put into Montion; this being nothing but a new Modification of them, and no Entity really di<U+017F>tinct from the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Body; as Life, Sen<U+017F>e, and Cogitation are; and therefore it is but a crude Conceit of Athei<U+017F>ts and Corporeali<U+017F>ts, That Souls are nothing but Fiery and Flammeous Bodies; for tho Heat in the Bodies of Animals, be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary In<U+017F>trument for the Life and Soul to act by in them, yet it is a thing really di<U+017F>tinct from Life. We might al<U+017F>o add, That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Hypothe<U+017F>is the Souls of Animals could not be Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the <U+017F>ame thro the whole <U+017F>pace of their Lives, <U+017F>ince that Fire, that needs a Pabulum to prey on, doth not always continue one and the <U+017F>ame Numeric Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance; the Soul of a new-born Animal could no more be the <U+017F>ame with the Sould of that Animal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years after, than the Flame
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44923:40"/>of a new-lighted Candle is the <U+017F>ame with that which twinkles in the Socket; which indeed are no more the <U+017F>ame, than a River or Stream is the <U+017F>ame at <U+017F>everal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances of time: Which Rea<U+017F>on may be farther extended to prove the Soul to be no Body at all, <U+017F>ince the Bodies of Animals are in a perpetual Flux.</q>

There is no Affection of the Soul but Love hath it at command; the Will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all inferiour Faculties of the Soul; but <U+017F>he is governed by Love. <hi>Plato</hi> makes Love to be the great <hi>Hero</hi> that governs the World, <U+017F>o univer<U+017F>al is its Empire and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
