         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But before I proceed to the Divi<U+017F>ion and Differences of Parts, I <U+017F>hal briefly re<U+017F>olve this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion,<note place="margin">Which Part of the Body is fir<U+017F>t generated.</note> 
               <hi>Which Part of the Body is fir<U+017F>t generated.</hi> We mu<U+017F>t therefore know, that according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> all the Parts are formed and differenced at one and the <U+017F>ame time, as in a Circle, there is neither beginning nor end, but altogether are both beginning and end. But all the Parts are not perfected and adorned at one and the <U+017F>ame time; but in the fir<U+017F>t place the Navil-vein. 2. The Liver. 3. Afterwards the Heart (which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> would have to be fir<U+017F>t made, as <hi>Galen</hi> would have the Liver to be) and la<U+017F>tly the brain. The Navil-vein therefore, is fir<U+017F>t fini<U+017F>hed and perfected, in regard of the enlargement thereof by the blood, but not in re<U+017F>pect of its fir<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>titution of the Seed. But others <U+017F>aid that the Groundwork or underwarpe of the Parts is Seed, and the Woof or Super<U+017F>tructure blood, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that there are two material Principles of the body: Seed and blood.

For otherwi<U+017F>e the bowels could not be nouri<U+017F>hed without a proportionable In<U+017F>trument to that end, namely a Vein, by which the blood is conveighed for their Nutriment. For as out of a Kernel or Seed put into the Earth, fir<U+017F>t a long Root de<U+017F>cends into the Earth, after that other Roots <U+017F>pread them<U+017F>elves round about the Surface of the Earth, out of which afterwards, the Trunk and branches <U+017F>pring up; <U+017F>o out of the Seed committed to the Womb, there ari<U+017F>es fir<U+017F>t the Navil-vein, receiving blood out of the Womb-cake; out of which Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vein ari<U+017F>es the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> with its Roots.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Principal</hi> are the Liver, Heart, Brain, which are the Principles of other Parts.

And in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Language, by fle<U+017F>h many times is ment the Mu<U+017F>cles. 2. Vi<U+017F>cerous fle<U+017F>h or the fle<U+017F>h of the Bowels. <hi>Era<U+017F>i<U+017F>tratus</hi> cals it <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or an Affu<U+017F>ion of blood; <hi>Galen</hi> cals it Similar and <U+017F>imple fle<U+017F>h, which <U+017F>upports the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the bowels, fills up the empty <U+017F>paces, and performs the Action. 3. Membranous fle<U+017F>h, or the fle<U+017F>hy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of every Membranous part, as in the Gullet, Stomach, Guts, Womb, bladder. 4. Glandulous fle<U+017F>h, or the fle<U+017F>h of Kernels, which <U+017F>erves. 1. For to <U+017F>upport the divi<U+017F>ions of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. 2. To drink up <U+017F>uperfluous humors, e<U+017F>pecially wheyi<U+017F>h humors, becau<U+017F>e the Kernels are of an hollow Spungy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are vulgarly termed <hi>Emunctories</hi> or Clen<U+017F>ers. Tho<U+017F>e in the Neck being counted Clen<U+017F>ers of the Head; tho<U+017F>e in the Arm-pits, of the Heart; tho<U+017F>e in the Groyns of the Liver. 3. To moi<U+017F>ten the parts for their more ea<U+017F>ie motion, or otherwi<U+017F>e to prohibit dryne<U+017F>s. Such are tho<U+017F>e which are <U+017F>ituate by the Tongue, Larynx, Eye-corners, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the <U+017F>imilar parts are reckoned to be <hi>ten:</hi> A bone, a Gri<U+017F>tle, a Ligament, a Membrane, a<note place="margin">The Number of the Similar Parts.</note> Fibre, a Nerve, an Artery, a Vein, Fle<U+017F>h and Skin.</p>
            <p>Of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>imilar only in the judgment of Sen<U+017F>e, as Veins, Arteries (<U+017F>ome add Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) others are <U+017F>imply and ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>imilar. That Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Mu<U+017F>cles are not truly <U+017F>imple and <U+017F>imilar, hath been rightly taught by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle:</hi> for a Mu<U+017F>cle con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of Fle<U+017F>h, Fibres, and a Tendon: Nerves are made up of the Dura and pia Mater, with Marrow: Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of two different coats; the Veins of a coat (and of Fibres as <U+017F>ome will have it) and Valves. Simply and truly <U+017F>imilar parts are Bones, Gri<U+017F>tles, Ligaments, Membranes, Fibres, Fle<U+017F>h and Skin. To the<U+017F>e <hi><U+017F>ome</hi> add the Ureters, the Air implanted in the Ear, &amp;c. but in vain. For, 1. They are not parts common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the whole body, but proper to <U+017F>ome parts. 2. The implanted Air of the Ears, is nothing but an implanted <U+017F>pirit, which cannot be reckoned among <U+017F>olid parts.</p>
            <p>Here we are to ob<U+017F>erve that all the<U+017F>e <hi>parts</hi> are commonly divided, into <hi>Spermatical, Sanguine,</hi> or <hi>mixt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spermatical</hi> are made of <U+017F>eed, and <U+017F>uch are the eight fir<U+017F>t reckoned; which if they are cut<note place="margin">What a Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Part is?</note> a<U+017F>under, they breed not again, nor can they be truly united, but they are joyned together by a Callus in the middle, by rea<U+017F>on of defect of matter and formative faculty, which acts not after the Conformation of the Parts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sanguine</hi> or fle<U+017F>hy Parts, contrarywi<U+017F>e are bred again, becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be<note place="margin">What a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Part.</note> made of Blood, as the Fle<U+017F>h.</p>
            <p>A mixt Part is the Skin, of which we <U+017F>hall treat hereafter, in <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For feed and blood are commonly accounted the two general Principles of which we are made: <U+017F>o that in the Seed there is very little of the material principle, but much of the active, but in the blood much of the material principle, and but a little and weak portion of the active or effective principle. The fir<U+017F>t Rudiments and underwrap as it were of the parts, are <U+017F>aid to be made of Seed; and the woofe or <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tructure of blood flowing in. But what the Truth is in Contradiction to this vulgar opinion, we have taught <hi>in our Anatomical Controver<U+017F>ies.</hi> For we are rather to hold, that the parts are at fir<U+017F>t made only of Seed, as of their matter; and that the Mothers blood doth nouri<U+017F>h, and encrea<U+017F>e and amplifie the Parts. The Skin in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on to other Parts, hath an indifferent proportion of Seed, not <U+017F>o much as the Spermatical, nor <U+017F>o little as the Sanguinary parts.</p>
            <p>The Compound or <hi>di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts</hi> are, tho<U+017F>e which may be divided into divers unlike parts,<note place="margin">What a di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar part is?</note> as an Hand cannot be cut into other Hands, but into Bones, Mu<U+017F>cles, Veins, &amp;c. The di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>imilar parts are by the Phylo<U+017F>opher called Members: but they are vulgarly termed <hi>Organical</hi> or in<U+017F>trumental parts.</p>
            <p>Now in every Organ, there are for the mo<U+017F>t part, four kinds of parts. For example <U+017F>ake,<note place="margin">Organical parts.</note> in the Eye there is, 1. That part by which the action, <hi>viz.</hi> Seeing is performed, namely the Chry<U+017F>talline Humor. 2. That without which it cannot be performed, as the Optick Nerve. 3. That by which it is the better performed, as the Coats and Mu<U+017F>cles of the Eyes. 4. That by which the action is pre<U+017F>erved, as the Eye-lids, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And becau<U+017F>e the Di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar parts are more or le<U+017F>s Compounded, they are divided into four degrees or ranks.</p>
            <p>The 1. Is <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>imilar to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, as a Mu<U+017F>cle, Vein, Artery. The 2. Is made of the <U+017F>ormer and the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>imilars, as a Finger. The 3. is compounded of the <U+017F>econd, as an Hand, Foot, &amp;c. The 4. Is compounded of the third, as an Arm or Leg.</p>
            <p>Finally the <hi>Body is divided</hi> into its greate<U+017F>t Members, as by <U+017F>ome into the Head, Che<U+017F>t, Belly<note place="margin">con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb facs="tcp:41352:4"/>
Arms and the Legs. But others have better divided them into the <hi>Bellies</hi> and <hi>Limbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bellies are certain remarkeable Cavities of the Body, wherein <U+017F>ome noble bowel is placed: and as there are three principal Members, <U+017F>o are there <hi>three Bellies:</hi> the <hi>lowe<U+017F>t</hi> belly, commonly called Abdomen or the Paunch, contains the Liver and Natural parts. The <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> or Che<U+017F>t, containes the Heart and vital parts. The <hi>uppermo<U+017F>t</hi> or Head contains the brain and Animal parts. The <hi>Limbs</hi> which were given us for more conveniency of living, are the Arms and the Legs.</p>
            <p>And therefore we <U+017F>hall make four books: 1. Of the Lower belly. 2. Of the Middle belly.<note place="margin">This whole Work divided into four Books and four Petty Books or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals.</note> 3, Of the <U+017F>upream belly or Cavity, the Head. 4. Of the Limbs. And to the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer four <hi>Petty Books:</hi> The <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> of the Veins which ari<U+017F>e from the Liver in the lower Cavity. The <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> of the Arteries which ari<U+017F>e from the Heart, in the middle Cavity. The <hi>third</hi> of the Nerves, which are commonly thought to <U+017F>pring from the brain. The <hi>fourth</hi> of the bones, which are mo<U+017F>t what in the Limbs: and as the bones joyned together make a compleat frame and bodies as it were; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o do the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves.</p>
            <p>We may find another divi<U+017F>ion of the body in <hi>Fernelius,</hi> which neverthele<U+017F>s is of no u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ave<note place="margin">The divi<U+017F>ion of the Body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Regions.</note> in Phy<U+017F>ick.

               <hi>Private Regions</hi> he calls the brain, Lungs, Kidneys, Womb, &amp;c. <hi>Publick</hi> or common he makes three extended through the whol body. 1. Hath the Vena porta, and all the parts whereinto its branches are <U+017F>pred. 2. Begins at the Roots of Vena Cava, and is terminated in the <U+017F>mal Veins, before they become Capillary. 3. Hath the Mu<U+017F>cles, Bones, and Bulk of the body and ends in the Skin.</p>
            <p>We purge the fir<U+017F>t Region cheifly by the Guts; The <U+017F>econd by the Urinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; The third by the Pores of the Skin.</p>

Nor the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third, For the third Dige<U+017F>tion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction hath a threefold Excrement. 1. Vaporous and thin which Expires. 2. Thin, but more <U+017F>olid then the former, of a wateri<U+017F>h <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>uch as are Ichors and Wheyi<U+017F>h humors, which by their <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s and Acrimony, would <U+017F>ooner hinder the Generation of the Scarf-skin, or corrode the <U+017F>ame after it is generated. 3.

And if their opinion were true, the Scarf-skin would come off in Baths.</p>
               <p>And therefore the matter thereof is <hi>another Excrement,</hi> viz. an Oyly,<note place="margin">The true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin.</note> Thick, Clammy, and moi<U+017F>t vapor (for of dry Exhalations the Hair is made) proceeding from the Skin and Members under the <U+017F>ame. So we <U+017F>ee in a Skillet of Water-gruel, a Skin grows over the top of the Gruel, being mad, of the vapors thereout a<U+017F>cending, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<U+017F>ed by cold.</p>
               <p>Now the Scarf-skin is <hi>bred,</hi> partly in the womb with the Skin, and partly without the Womb. Within, For 1. So there are the rudiments and beginnings of Hair, Teeth, Nails in the Child in the Womb, 2. Without the Scarf-skin, the skin would be moi<U+017F>t, and the Humor would <U+017F>weat out with pain, as in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and where <hi>Phoenigmi</hi> are applied. 3. Experience <U+017F>hews, that the Scarf-skin is <U+017F>omewhat apparent in an Abortion, and may be <U+017F>eparated by <U+017F>ome fretting Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity. But whiles the Child is in the Womb, it is exceeding tender, <U+017F>oft, and but as yet begun to be made: becau<U+017F>e there is not in the Womb <U+017F>o much cold, only a <U+017F>mall degree <U+017F>pringing from the <U+017F>erous humor which <U+017F>urrounds the Child. But it receives its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and perfection without the Womb, from the coldne<U+017F>s of the Air, which doth more conden<U+017F>e and dry, which is the Cau<U+017F>e that the skin of all New-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants looks red.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the remote and internal <hi>Efficient</hi> thereof is in the inward heat of the<note place="margin">The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cau<U+017F>e thereof.</note> Body, thru<U+017F>ting forth a vapor into the <U+017F>urface thereof, as Exhalations are made by the <U+017F>uns heat. The next and external, is the coldne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>omebody, as the Air, &amp;c. compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thickning. So Gruel, Hot milk, and other hot di<U+017F>hes of meat, have a skin growing over them: <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o the dryne<U+017F>s of the Ambient Air, con<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the external humor, and compacting the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the matter. Now by how much the <U+017F>aid vapor is more Earthy and Clammy, by <U+017F>o much more <U+017F>olid is that which is bred thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>V<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is to defend the Skin. And therefore 'tis <U+017F>omwhat <hi>hard,</hi> howbeit <hi>exceeding thin</hi>

               <p>As for <hi>number:</hi> there is but one Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin;<note place="margin">Its number.</note> only there was once two found by <hi>Aquapendent:</hi> the one being <U+017F>trongly fa<U+017F>tned in the pores of the skin, and in<U+017F>eperable: the other <U+017F>eperable without offence to the skin. Which happens in <U+017F>ome only, not in all parts of the Body. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Laurembergius,</hi> in applying Ve<U+017F>icatories, found the Scarf-skin double; but that is a rare ca<U+017F>e, for that Ve<U+017F>icatories do peitce unto the skin is apparent from the humor dropping out, and the pain.

               <p>5. A Cover hanging over boyling Water, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Vapors which ari<U+017F>e unto it, and turns them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water by its Coldne<U+017F>s.

               <p>
                  <hi>Another Opinion</hi> is, that Fat is made by an hot Cau<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e the matter thereof<note place="margin">An Opinion that Fat is cau<U+017F>ed by Heat.</note> is hot, and becau<U+017F>e Fat ea<U+017F>ily flames; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e all things are made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by Coction, and Heat. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer is clear from what hath been <U+017F>aid before. And we do not mean meer Coldne<U+017F>s, the Cau<U+017F>e of Crudity, but a weak Heat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some</hi> <U+017F>ay that Fat attains its con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tency from the compactne<U+017F>s of the<note place="margin">An Opinion that it is made by compactne<U+017F>s.

That cold things conden<U+017F>e, and Conden<U+017F>ation proceeds from Cold, nor can that which is conden<U+017F>ed conden<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F>s it were a fir<U+017F>t Quality, or <U+017F>hould take the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of Cold, for otherwi<U+017F>e the thinne<U+017F>s of the Membrane would make the fat thin. And why does not the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity or compactne<U+017F>s of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els make the matter contained to be conden<U+017F>ed and compact?</p>
               <p>2. In like manner they object: By a thick cover though very hot, the Vapor ari<U+017F>ing from boyling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it meets therewith, is turned into Water, or in a Di<U+017F>tillation by an Alembick, the Exhalations ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing from the <U+017F>ubject matter, meeting with the thick gla<U+017F>s are <U+017F>topped, and by reflection turned into a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sub<U+017F>tance. But the An<U+017F>wer, is clear from what hath been <U+017F>aid; moreover, the Vapors which are rai<U+017F>ed up by boyling, if they are by the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>o <U+017F>hut in, that there is no place to breath out, new Vapors continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ari<U+017F>ing, that there may not be a Penetration of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that they rea<U+017F><U+017F>ume their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tency: But if they find egre<U+017F>s, they turn to Water, by rea<U+017F>on of the cold Air <U+017F>urrounding the gla<U+017F><U+017F>ie Cover. And therefore it is that, to make the Liquor i<U+017F><U+017F>ue more aboundantly, Di<U+017F>tillers ever and anon cool the <U+017F>ame with cold Water. So when the Air abroad is cold, hot Vapors within do turn to Water upon the gla<U+017F>s Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; which does not happen when the Air is hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>3. They <U+017F>ay, that there are many cold Parts, as the Brain and its coats, &amp;c. which have no Fat about them. I an<U+017F>wer, tho<U+017F>e Parts al<U+017F>o are den<U+017F>e. Nor would Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have Fat in tho<U+017F>e Parts, for it would be both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and hurtful: And a moderate Heat is there provided for, by the thickne<U+017F>s of the Skin, the Hair and the Skull.</p>

               <p>The Ancients called the Membranes <hi>Hymenas,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Chitona's</hi> Coats, al<U+017F>o <hi>Meningas;</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles <hi>Operimenta,</hi> and <hi>Tegumenta</hi> Coverings; and with <hi>Galen</hi> and other Anatomi<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>peaking in a large Sen<U+017F>e, a Coat and a Membrane, are one and the <U+017F>ame thing. But when they <U+017F>peak in a <U+017F>trickt and proper Sen<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>That is a <hi>Membrane</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>ome bulkie Part, as the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum,<note place="margin">The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a membrane and a Coat, and Meninx.</note> the Pleura, the Perio<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, the Pericardium, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Membranes of the Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
               <p>But the term <hi>Tunica</hi> or Coat in a <U+017F>trickt <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, is attributed properly to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as Veins, Arteries, Ureters, the Womb, the Gall-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Pi<U+017F>s-bladder, the Gullet, the Stomach, the Guts, the Stones.</p>
               <p>The term <hi>Meninx</hi> is properly given and peculiarly to the Membranes of the Brain.</p>
               <p>Now a Membrane is a <U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part broad, plane, white,<note place="margin">What a Membrane is?</note> and which may be <U+017F>tretched, made by a proper Membrane-making faculty, of clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and watery Seed, to the end that it might by cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing defend the Parts.</p>
               <p>The Form thereof is the equality of its Surface, Thinne<U+017F>s, and Lightne<U+017F>s (lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould burden) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>trength that it might be widened and <U+017F>tretched.</p>
               <p>Its U<U+017F>e is 1. To cloath and defend the Parts by rea<U+017F>on of its hardne<U+017F>s and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactne<U+017F>s;<note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note> and to be the In<U+017F>trument of feeling: For the Parts feel by help of the Membranes. And <U+017F>o great is the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Membranes, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath covered every Part with a Membrane. 2. To <U+017F>trengthen the parts. 3. To defend the parts from the injury of the Cold, and to keep the Natural Heat from exhaling. 4. To joyn parts with parts. So the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entery knits the Guts to the Back. 5. To <U+017F>hut the mouths of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, lea<U+017F>t the Humors <U+017F>hould flow out, or flow back: As in the Bladder, where the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are implanted, in the Ventricles of the Heart, by the Valves.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Membrane</hi> is <hi>thicker</hi> or <hi>thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>thin</hi> Membrane differs in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. For the Perio<U+017F>tium of the Ribs is thinner then the Pleura, the Perio<U+017F>tium of the Head, is thinner then the Pericraneum; the <hi>pia mater</hi> is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the <hi>dura mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>thick Membrane</hi> is the <hi>Membrana carno<U+017F>a,</hi> which is not every where alike thick; for it is thicker in the Neck then other places. And now let us <U+017F>peak of the <hi>Membrana carno<U+017F>a,</hi> or fle<U+017F>hy Membrane.</p>

                  <hi>carno<U+017F>a</hi> is by <U+017F>ome termed a membranous Mu<U+017F>cle, by others a Nervie Coat, a fattie Coat, &amp;c. It is termed fle<U+017F>hy, becau<U+017F>e in <U+017F>ome places, as about the Forehead, the compa<U+017F>s of the Neck, and the Ears, it turns to a mu<U+017F>culous fle<U+017F>h, and in <U+017F>uch Creatures as by the help hereof can move their whole Skin, it <U+017F>eems to be a Mu<U+017F>cle: It is endued with <U+017F>uch fle<U+017F>hy Fibers, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in their Necks, by the motion whereof they drive away flies. But in Man, <U+017F>ave in his Forehead, it is immoveable; only <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> and <hi>Valverda</hi> report that there were <U+017F>ome men who could move the Skin on their Che<U+017F>t and Back, and in other parts, ju<U+017F>t as oxen do. In whom doubtle<U+017F>s this Membrane was made of the <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>titution, which it hath in Brutes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in new-born Children, it re<U+017F>embles fle<U+017F>h, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of plenty of blood; in grown per<U+017F>ons it is like a Membrane, by rea<U+017F>on of continually being dried. In a Mans Body, if exact Separation be made, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of four di<U+017F>tinct Membranes. <hi>Spigelius</hi> and others do take tho<U+017F>e membranous Fibers, which are every where interwoven among the Fat, to be <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus carno<U+017F>us,</hi> or <hi>Membrana carno<U+017F>a.</hi>

It is therefore fal<U+017F>e, that when the Fat is con<U+017F>umed by fa<U+017F>ting, the Skin <U+017F>ticks to the Mu<U+017F>cles no otherwi<U+017F>e, then a Ball to a peice of cloth wherewith it is covered.

               <p>A Mu<U+017F>cle is termed in Greek <hi>Mus</hi> a Mou<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e it re<U+017F>embles a flaid Mou<U+017F>e; and the Latins cal it <hi>Lacertus</hi> a Lizard, from its <U+017F>imilitude with that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Howbeit we cannot allot one certain figure to the Mu<U+017F>cles, by rea<U+017F>on of their variety.</p>
               <p>A Mu<U+017F>cle is an Organical Part, the In<U+017F>trument of voluntary motion. For<note place="margin">What a Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is?</note> only this part can receive the Iuflux of the motive faculty. <hi>Helmont</hi> allowes the mu<U+017F>cles a life peculiar to them<U+017F>elves, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for a while, even after death, as the convul<U+017F>ive motion in the Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s which continues invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily. Which neverthele<U+017F>s does more truly ari<U+017F>e, from the retraction and drine<U+017F>s of the Nerves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Spirits. Al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame man is in an error in conceiving that new fibres do ari<U+017F>e in the mu<U+017F>cles, and cau<U+017F>e the Pal<U+017F>ie. No man ever <U+017F>aw them, nor can they be bred anew, becau<U+017F>e they are Spermatick parts. The Pal<U+017F>ie ought rather to be referred to a defect of <U+017F>ome fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</p>
               <p>A mu<U+017F>cle is an Organical part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts 1. Of fle<U+017F>h. 2.

Of Veins to carry back the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. Of Arteries pre<U+017F>erving the inbred Heat, and bringing the Nouri<U+017F>hment to the part. 5. Of Nerves, which contribute <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and e<U+017F>pecially motion. For the Brain <U+017F>ends the motive faculty through the Nerves into the Mu<U+017F>cles. 6. Of Membranes which encompa<U+017F>s and keep the mu<U+017F>cles together. 7. Of Fat which moi<U+017F>tens them, and hinders them from being dried by over much motion.</p>
               <p>The Mu<U+017F>cles of the whole Body are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>traitly conjoyned one with<note place="margin">The Connexion of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> another: Yet <U+017F>ometimes they gape, and are at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance, when Wind, wheyi<U+017F>h Humor, or <U+017F>ome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gets between them; as in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tard Pleuri<U+017F>ie, and concerning a Soldier whipt by the Turks. <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus</hi> told me that his mu<U+017F>cles were <U+017F>o wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and <U+017F>eparated, that if he bent his body but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, every mu<U+017F>cle would bear it <U+017F>elf out from its Natural <U+017F>ituation, bunching out as it were, and <U+017F>welling.</p>
               <p>We divide the Mu<U+017F>cles into two <hi>parts,</hi> a <hi>fle<U+017F>hy</hi> part, and a <hi>tendinous</hi> part.<note place="margin">The Parts of a Mu<U+017F>cle only two. The tendinous Part how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fold.</note>

Becau<U+017F>e it holds not true in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral mu<U+017F>cle, nor <U+017F>omtimes in other mu<U+017F>cles of the Che<U+017F>t and Belly. 3. Becau<U+017F>e that Rule is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any rea<U+017F>on, for whether the Nerve be in<U+017F>erted into the beginning of the mu<U+017F>cle, or into any other part thereof, the Spirits flowing in by the Nerve, may equally move the mu<U+017F>cle: As we <U+017F>ee in Wind-In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Air is let in <U+017F>omtimes above, <U+017F>omtimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, one way as conveniently as another. 4. And whereas that Rule is oftentimes found true, it happens by accident, becau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>tmu<U+017F>cles are moved upward, &amp; becau<U+017F>e the Nerves de<U+017F>cend from above, and therefore could not be more <U+017F>afely implanted any where, then in the upper part of the mu<U+017F>cles. And that which <hi>Riolanus</hi> objects again<U+017F>t<note place="margin">The Objection of <hi>Riolanus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered.</note>

have carried them right out into the Larynx, as <U+017F>he doth other Nerves of the <U+017F>ixt Pair. Some Mu<U+017F>cles receive two branches of Nerves, as the Midrif; <U+017F>ome five, as the temporal Mu<U+017F>cle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Middle of the Mu<U+017F>cle,</hi> which they call the belly or body, doth for the<note place="margin">The middle of a Mu<U+017F>cle.</note> mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>well, and is fle<U+017F>hy; <U+017F>ome few have a tendon in the middle, as the Mu<U+017F>culus Diga<U+017F>tricus which opens the nether Jaw, and the <U+017F>econd Pair belonging to the <hi>Os Hyoïdes.</hi>

                  <hi>The end or taile of a Mu<U+017F>cle,</hi> is by <U+017F>ome called <hi>Tendo<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

                  <note place="margin">The end of a Mu<U+017F>cle how known by <hi>Galen</hi> and other Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts?</note> And the end is <U+017F>omtimes round, <U+017F>omtimes broad, <U+017F>omtimes long, other whiles <U+017F>hort; <U+017F>omtimes one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles more then one. Now this end, or tendon, is commonly conceived to be made up of a Concour<U+017F>e of Fibres, Ligaments, and very <U+017F>mal Nerves, which by little and little grow into one Body. For they will have a Nerve, when it comes to the place of a Mu<U+017F>cle to be divided into divers <U+017F>lips, which are met by a Ligament, cleft after the <U+017F>ame manner. Con<U+017F>equently they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>1. That the Tendon hath the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Feeling, but not the<note place="margin">Whether the Head of a Mu<U+017F>cle be void of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e?</note> Head, which they account void of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and Motion. But this is fal<U+017F>e; becau<U+017F>e the tendinous head of a Mu<U+017F>cle, when it is prickt, breeds Convul<U+017F>ions and cruel Symptomes, ju<U+017F>t as if the Head of the Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle were prickt. Moreover, the beginning of a Mu<U+017F>cle hath motion, and therefore <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. It hath motion, becau<U+017F>e a Mu<U+017F>cle, even in its<note place="margin">If it have Motion?</note> Head, is contracted and expanded, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is fle<U+017F>hy.</p>
               <p>2. They <U+017F>ay al<U+017F>o that the End is thicker then the Head: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding<note place="margin">Whether the end be thicker then the Head.</note> is <U+017F>omtimes true and <U+017F>omtimes fal<U+017F>e, as in the Mu<U+017F>culous Biceps, and others.</p>
               <p>3. They will have the Tendon to be <U+017F>ofter then the Ligament (as they call it) or the beginning of the Mu<U+017F>cle, namely <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ofter, as it is harder then a Nerve, But the contrary is true, viz. that the Tendon is harder then the beginning, becau<U+017F>e it many times changes into a boney and gri<U+017F>tley <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as in the feet of feathered fowle; but the beginning doth not <U+017F>o. Moreover, I deny that Nerves enter into the Tendon. For <hi>Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether the Nerves go into the Tendon.</note> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent di<U+017F><U+017F>ections, that when they are entred into the fle<U+017F>h of the Mu<U+017F>cle, they are <U+017F>pread out into many little branches, which go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a certain Membranous flexure, and <U+017F>o vani<U+017F>h or end, before they come to the tendon. Moreover, a Nerve is <U+017F>oft, how therefore can it be mingled with an hard body? Neither is the end le<U+017F>s de<U+017F>titute of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, then the Head, <U+017F>eeing there come no more Nerves to it then the other: for the Nerve being implanted, tends downwards, and not upwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Action of a Mu<U+017F>cle</hi> is voluntary Motion.<note place="margin">The action of a Mu<U+017F>cle is Motion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Motion of a Mu<U+017F>cle, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, 1. A Mu<U+017F>cle is contracted within it <U+017F>elf, towards the Head; and when this is done the oppo<U+017F>ite Mu<U+017F>cle is relaxed and loo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 2. Being contracted, it continues <U+017F>o. And the<U+017F>e two motions are primary, <hi>per <U+017F>e</hi> and not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. 3. After contraction it is relaxed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which motion is accidental, and proceeds from another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mu<U+017F>cles are alwaies <U+017F>et one again<U+017F>t another, as Antagoni<U+017F>ts.</p>
               <p>Now the work of this Motion or Action, which is <U+017F>een in the parts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> whereinto the Mu<U+017F>cles are planted, doth vary according to the Variety of Parts. For in the throat it is <U+017F>wallowing; in the Arme bending and <U+017F>tretching forth, &amp;c. Yea and <U+017F>omtimes one follows upon another. For the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Che<U+017F>t, when they act, do diver<U+017F>ly widen or contract the <U+017F>ame, they draw in Air, or expel Fuliginous <U+017F>ooty vapors, and cau<U+017F>e Re<U+017F>piration.</p>
               <p>This Motion of the Mu<U+017F>cles, is <U+017F>omtimes<note place="margin">And that Voluntary.</note> called Voluntary, <U+017F>omtimes Animal, to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it from the natural, in Brutes Spontaneous. For we can ha<U+017F>ten, or <U+017F>lacken, or <U+017F>top this motion as we plea<U+017F>e. And in this motion, the will of a Man or the Appetite of Brutes, is like an Hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man guiding and putting his Hor<U+017F>e forward; the Nerves re<U+017F>emble the Reins of the Bridle, and the Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are like the Hor<U+017F>e. There are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ingular Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as of the in<U+017F>ide of the Eare, the Midrif, the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Che<U+017F>t, and Eye-lids, who<U+017F>e motion is partly voluntary and partly natural, becau<U+017F>e they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times perform their actions, when we have no thought nor will thereto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> of all the Parts of the Mu<U+017F>cle, is<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e.</note> after the <U+017F>ame manner, as in every perfect Organ. For 1. There is that by which the action is primarily and of it <U+017F>elf performed, and it is the Fibrous fle<U+017F>h; [but e<U+017F>pecially according to the Fibres, for the fle<U+017F>h being wounded according to the length of the Fibres, the motion remains unhurt, but it is not <U+017F>o<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> when the fibres are wounded] for the mo<U+017F>t part the belly of the Mu<U+017F>cle<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which is mo<U+017F>t of all contracted. Hence it is that if you cut a Mu<U+017F>cle of in the beginning end or middle, in a living per<U+017F>on, or in one that is dead it pur<U+017F>es it <U+017F>elf round and draws it <U+017F>elf into it <U+017F>elf like a ball: as al<U+017F>o it doth, being ca<U+017F>t into the water. <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> counts the principal part to be the tendon, upon which the Action depends, becau<U+017F>e it hath a peculiar <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of its own, <U+017F>uch as is no where to be <U+017F>een out of a Mu<U+017F>cle. But this is rather true of fibrous fle<U+017F>h, which is in all Mu<U+017F>cles, where as in <U+017F>ome there is no tendon. 2. That without which it cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the Nerve: For if the Nerves be hurt the Mu<U+017F>cle loo<U+017F>es its motion. 3. That by which it is more <U+017F>trongly and better performed, as the tendons and tendinous fibres. Wherefore tho<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles only, which perform conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual<note place="margin">Which Mu<U+017F>cles do move more <U+017F>trongly?</note> and <U+017F>trong motions, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved united and Con<U+017F>picuous tendons. For the Mu<U+017F>cles do either move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves only, as tho<U+017F>e of the Fundament and Bladder; or they move al<U+017F>o the skin, as in the Lips, forehead and face: and in the<U+017F>e there is no tendon to be <U+017F>een<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> or they move a bone, and the<U+017F>e for the mo<U+017F>t part evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently end in tendons, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>trong motion of an heavy member did require as much: or they move <U+017F>ome other light thing, as the Mu<U+017F>cles of the tongue and Larynx (<U+017F>ome of which have tendons and <U+017F>ome not) of the Eyes, Stones and Yard. 4. Such parts as con<U+017F>erve and guard the action, as the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Membranes and fat.</p>

To every Joynting there comes a Nerve. 2. If it were but one, being contracted into it<U+017F>elf, it could not equally compre<U+017F>s all parts. 3. There <U+017F>hould be no <U+017F>uch mu<U+017F>cle in the whole body, wherein neverthele<U+017F>s there are many long ones, without <U+017F>uch a number of In<U+017F>criptions.</p>
               <p>In the internal Surface of the right mu<U+017F>cles, there are <hi>two Veins</hi> conjoyned, with as many Arteries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper</hi> called <hi>Mammaria,</hi> ari<U+017F>e from the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> lying beneath the<note place="margin">The Veins.</note> Claves, the more remarkeable branch whereof reaches unto the Duggs, and runs out under the right Mu<U+017F>cle, as far as to the Region of the Navil, where it is terminated.</p>
               <p>This is met by the other termed <hi>Epiga<U+017F>trica,</hi> which in Women <U+017F>prings from the Womb, in men the <hi>Vena cava</hi> goes upwards towards the upper Vein, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it touches, it is for the mo<U+017F>t part obliterated.

Hence the Con<U+017F>ent is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to ari<U+017F>e between the Duggs and the Womb, the Belly and the No<U+017F>trils. For when the No<U+017F>e bleeds, we fix Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to the belly, and the Duggs of Women being handled, it in cites them to Venery.</p>

               <p>The proper u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles according to <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> is to move the Share-bone forward in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath been already confuted. <hi>Spigelius</hi> will have them to draw the Brea<U+017F>t to the <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>a pubis</hi> or <U+017F>hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, and the Share-bones to the Brea<U+017F>t, in a <U+017F>traight motion, and <U+017F>o to bend the Che<U+017F>t; whence it is, that in Dogs and Apes, they reach as far as to the <hi>Jugulum,</hi> becau<U+017F>e their Che<U+017F>t did require very much bowing. But the<U+017F>e contrary motions, unle<U+017F>s they be holpen, with tho<U+017F>e inci<U+017F>ions of the right mu<U+017F>cles, do involve a difficulty. <hi>Helmont</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pects that they are <U+017F>tretched in going up hill, and that from thence <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of breath proceeds. <hi>Flud</hi> <U+017F>aith, that by a general u<U+017F>e, they make the Belly round, and compre<U+017F>s it centrally, or towards the middle point thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Galen,</hi> was ea<U+017F>ily hurt by cold, and therefore he alwaies covered his Belly with Wool.

But Naturally;</p>
               <p>It is <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> in the Epiga<U+017F>trium, a place encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed with no Bones, that it<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> might <U+017F>tretch more ea<U+017F>ily, ju<U+017F>t under the Midriff, as it were in the middle of the Body, and it re<U+017F>ts upon the Back-bone: Now its left <U+017F>ide which is the greater and rounder in the bottom, lies in the left Hypochondrium, to give way to the Liver which lies on the right <U+017F>ide, and that <U+017F>o the Body may be equally as it were poi<U+017F>ed, and ballanced<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> or trimmed, as the Watermen <U+017F>peak of their boats: Towards the right hand it grows <U+017F>mall by little and little, that the meat may be gradually thru<U+017F>t thither. Whence we gather that it is better for <U+017F>uch as lie down to <U+017F>leep, to lie fir<U+017F>t upon their left <U+017F>ide till the Dige<U+017F>tion be fini<U+017F>hed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon their right, otherwi<U+017F>e then is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined. But in the left <U+017F>ide there is the bottom, where the meat ought to tarry, for being rowled to the right <U+017F>ide, it is nearer pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out. Howbeit in this ca<U+017F>e, much mu<U+017F>t be allowed to Cu<U+017F>tom.</p>
               <p>'Tis only one in <hi>Number</hi> in man, and <U+017F>uch live Creatures as have teeth in both<note place="margin">The Number of Stomachs in feathered Fowle.</note> their Jaws. <hi>Riolanus</hi> bath twice ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a double Stomach in a man, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by a narrow pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age out of one into another. <hi>Sperlinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> <U+017F>aw the <U+017F>ame in a Woman of <hi>Wittemberg<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

Yea, and that it hath been double in one that chewed the Cud, as <hi>Salmuth</hi> relates and others, is not to be doubted. In <U+017F>ome Fowls there are two Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, the one membranous, which the Latins term <hi>Ingluvies</hi> the Crap, which only receives the meat, that from thence being lightly dige<U+017F>ted, they may ca<U+017F>t it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouths of their young ones, whereas otherwi<U+017F>e young Birds could not be nouri<U+017F>hed. The other is very fle<U+017F>hy and hotter, having within a hard Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, wherein hard meat is received. <hi>Petrus Ca<U+017F>tellus</hi> a rare man, adds a third, which is in like manner fle<U+017F>hy. In Bea<U+017F>ts that chew the Cud, and have Hornes, and teeth only in one Jaw<note place="margin">In Bea<U+017F>ts that chew the Cud.</note> there are four; The fir<U+017F>t <hi>Venter,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulum,</hi> the <hi>Oma<U+017F>us,</hi> and the <hi>Aboma<U+017F>us;</hi> of which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>peaks. The <hi>Venter</hi> and the <hi>Reticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> which is a part thereof, are ordained to hold the crude meat; The <hi>Oma<U+017F>us</hi> receives the Food immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the mouth, if it be thin, if thick, it is fir<U+017F>t chewed, and from hence after a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tay, it <U+017F>lips into the <hi>Aboma<U+017F>us.</hi> Now chewing the Cud, is a <U+017F>econd chewing of the meat in the mouth, for the more perfect Dige<U+017F>tion thereof, whence the Aliment proves excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and for that cau<U+017F>e among the Jews, <U+017F>uch as chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cud were counted clean Bea<U+017F>ts. Chewing the Cud is cau<U+017F>ed, not as <U+017F>ome think, becau<U+017F>e the meat in the fir<U+017F>t Stomach gains <U+017F>uch a quality, that it provokes the Stomach to ca<U+017F>t it up; for <U+017F>o in every <U+017F>harp biting of the Stomach, and in all Animals chewing the Cud, would happen again<U+017F>t their Wills: but it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the voluntary Action of the Stomach, which by a <U+017F>ingular membrane, expels what it plea<U+017F>es, and when it plea<U+017F>es; as that <U+017F>ome To<U+017F>spot of <hi>Malta,</hi> whom I have <U+017F>een, would as he plea<U+017F>ed ca<U+017F>t up what ever he had drunk; and others will <U+017F>wallow down the Smoak of Tobacco, and turn it out again. In great Sea-fi<U+017F>hes I have ob<U+017F>erved a threefold Stomach, as in a Porpice and others; but it grew <U+017F>o together, that there was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three di<U+017F>tinct Cavities with pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages from one to another, three perfect Stomachs.</p>

               <p>The <hi>left</hi> is commonly called the upper Orifice, and <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>ingly the mouth of the Stomach, and <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tis termed the Stomach, becau<U+017F>e of its largene<U+017F>s; the Ancients did cal it <hi>Cor</hi> the Heart, becau<U+017F>e the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es thereof cau<U+017F>ed fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fits<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and other Symptoms like tho<U+017F>e which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <U+017F>uch as are troubled with Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Heart; al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e of its mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and becau<U+017F>e the Heart doth <U+017F>ympathize therewith, both in regard of its nearne<U+017F>s, and they have Nerves proceeding from the <U+017F>ame Branch. This Orifice <hi>is greater,</hi> thicker, and larger, <U+017F>o that it may admit hard or half chewed meat. <hi>Tis <U+017F>ituate</hi> at the eleventh Vertebra of the Che<U+017F>t: It hath circular fle<U+017F>hy Fibres, that it may by Natural In<U+017F>tinct <U+017F>hut up the mouth of the Stomach, after the meat is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in, lea<U+017F>t fumes <U+017F>hould ari<U+017F>e, and go into the Brain, and breed Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and that <U+017F>o Dige<U+017F>tion may be more perfectly accompli<U+017F>hed. So we cover it as we do our Seething-pots with a potlid, to keep in the Fumes, and to hinder the meat from falling back into our mouths, when we lie in bed, and tumble this way and that way. Through this Orifice, meats and drinks are received in. And it is but in the Epiga<U+017F>trick Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is more near the Back-bone, then the <U+017F>word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>hion'd Gri<U+017F>tle or <hi>Cartilago En<U+017F>iformis:</hi> And therefore when it is di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, we apply Epithems rather behind then before. <hi>Helmont</hi> places the <U+017F>eat of the Soul, and the Principle of life<note place="margin">Whether the Soul be <U+017F>eated in the Orifice of the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach?</note> in the Stomach, as it were in its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point, <U+017F>o that it governes and rules over the Head and principal Faculties. If you aske him more particularly where it is placed, he will an<U+017F>wer you that it is there after an exorbitant manner, centrally in a point, and as it were in the middle of an Atome of the thickne<U+017F>s of one Membrane. But the Stomach cannot be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41352:13"/>
the Seat of the Soul, becau<U+017F>e. 1. It is alwaies full of impure meats. 2. No Faculties flow to us from thence. 3. Great Feeders and per<U+017F>ons of large Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, <U+017F>hould have more Soul then other people. 4. The Soul is not fixed to any Centre. 5. When the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is hurt, death doth not pre<U+017F>ently follow, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in him that <U+017F>wallowed the knife. And any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage happen, it is by rea<U+017F>on of the Nearne<U+017F>s of the Heart, and Community of Nerves, and con<U+017F>equently by accident. For the Soul <U+017F>ticks not in the Nerves primarily; but there rather from whence the Nerves have their Original<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and it is a common Membrane. Yet in a large <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, it may be called the Principle of Life, becau<U+017F>e there is the Seat of Appetite, and the fir<U+017F>t Reception and Dige<U+017F>tion of Aliments, who<U+017F>e fault in the following Concoctions, is never amended.

               <p>The Sub<U+017F>tance therefore of the Stomach being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and cold, is holpen by the Heat of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Parts.

               <p>The Stomach is knit in the left part<note place="margin">Its Connexion.</note> to the Midriff (not to the Back-bone) by its Orifice; therefore when it is over full, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the motion of the Midriff, it cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of breath: On the right <U+017F>ide it is joyned to the Gut Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum, by its other Orifice or the Pylorus.</p>
               <p>At the Stomach, in the left <U+017F>ide, under the Midriff, is formed a remarkeable <hi>Cavity</hi> enclo<U+017F>od with Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, partly from the Stomach, partly from the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, and partly from the Call.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Shape</hi> of the Stomach is round and<note place="margin">Shape.</note> oblong, like a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g> Bag-pipe, e<U+017F>pecially if you con<U+017F>ider it together with the Duodenum and Oe<U+017F>opha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.

Al<U+017F>o in gluttonous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons and great Drinkers, it is greater then ordinary, <U+017F>o that when it <U+017F>wells, it may be felt as it were naked. For it is exceedingly dilated, and therefore it is thinner in Drinkers, in whom it is <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>o attenuated, that it can no more wrinkle it <U+017F>elf, whence follows long weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. Which <hi>Walaeus</hi> in Diffection hath ob<U+017F>erved to happen chiefly to tho<U+017F>e old men, who<U+017F>e Stomachs in time of Concoction do breed Wind; which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times al<U+017F>o in gluttonous per<U+017F>ons, takes up more room then their meat. <hi>Columbus</hi> will have it, when it is <U+017F>tretched, to reach as low as the Navil, and <hi>Archange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> will have it to reach further, when it is over <U+017F>tretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but being contracted and wrinkled in <U+017F>uch as live <U+017F>oberly, it is thick, and lies hid under the Liver. Now the Largene<U+017F>s of the Stomach is known. 1. By the Greatne<U+017F>s of the Mouth, for tho<U+017F>e that have large Mouths, are great Eaters, but withal bold and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous. 2.

               <p>The <hi>weight</hi> of the Stomach being dryed with the Oe<U+017F>ophagus, according to the Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Lo<U+017F>elius</hi> is two ounces and two drams; wherein notwith<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have found a variety, according to the diver<U+017F>ity of <U+017F>ubjects.</p>

And becau<U+017F>e it is implanted into the bottom of the <U+017F>tomach, and blood emptied there, cannot provoke Appetite, as many imagine. Others will have it that a Melancholick Excrement which<note place="margin">Whether blood ca<U+017F>t out of the Spleen help Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> could not be changed in the Spleen, is by this Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el brought into the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that by its har<U+017F>h and acid facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it might further the <U+017F>tomachs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and make the meats abide therein, a convenient <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on. But Concoction <U+017F>hould rather be hindred, by the ca<U+017F>ting in of a <U+017F>trange Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Humor. If we <U+017F>hall interpret it touching an acid fermenting juyce, the Opinion will be truer, which kind of juyce, can come from no other place but the Spleen. For according to the Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> the Spleen, e<U+017F>pecially of a Sow, being boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eaten, as coming neare<U+017F>t that of a man, doth wont to help the heavyne<U+017F>s and dullne<U+017F>s of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Hence <U+017F>harp things are plea<U+017F>ing to the Spleen, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives Vinegar to Spleenetick per<U+017F>ons, and <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> makes a Catapla<U+017F>m for the Spleen tempered with the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t Vinegar. Moreover <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath found the left <U+017F>ide of the inner part of the Stomach blacker then the right. <hi>Others</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that nothing is carried into the <U+017F>tomach by the <hi>Vas breve,</hi> but that <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is carried out of the <U+017F>tomach into the Spleen; whether it be the thinner part of the Chyle, as <hi>Conrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Hor<U+017F>tius,</hi> and <hi>Regius</hi> prove, or Blood as <hi>Hogeland</hi> conceives; they being informed by Ligature in di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ections of live Creatures: of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>Moreover the <U+017F>tomach receives Veins from Vena Portae, viz. the Pyloric, Ga<U+017F>tric, and Ga<U+017F>troepiploic branches left and right.</p>
               <p>There is one notable Vein called <hi>Ga<U+017F>trica,</hi> which creeps a long the bottom of the <U+017F>tomach, but doth not quite touch it lea<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tomach being very much <U+017F>tret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it <U+017F>hould be in danger to be broken; but it <U+017F>preds many branches to the <U+017F>tomach: which <hi>Picolhomineus</hi> and <hi>Aquapendent</hi> will have to <U+017F>uck out the more thin and <U+017F>ubtile part of the Chyle, before it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the <U+017F>tomach to the Liver. And this Opinion <U+017F>eems prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 1.

Otherwi<U+017F>e the <U+017F>tomach would be ready to bur<U+017F>t, when it is overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. 3. Thence it comes, that <U+017F>trength is <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by fragrant Wine, broaths, and other comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things.</p>
               <p>In <U+017F>ome Men a part of the Choler pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, is in<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the bottom of the <U+017F>tomach, by which our Country-men <hi>Petrus Severinus,</hi> would have choler to be carried into the <U+017F>tomach. But this is an Error of Nature, and therefore <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons are apt to vomit Choler, for they are exceeding Cholerick, <U+017F>uch as <hi>Galen, Ve<U+017F>alius, Fernelius,</hi> and <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>erius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved.

By the Splenic Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries an acid <U+017F>harp juyce is conveighed into the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach from the Spleen, as the <U+017F>aid <hi>Waloeus</hi> and <hi>Hoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> conceive, which I grant when there is no <hi>Vas breve,</hi> or in ab<U+017F>ence of the Spleen, wherein I ea<U+017F>ily con<U+017F>ent with <hi>Riolanus.</hi>

A branch goes from the left Nerve, a long the upper part of the <U+017F>tomach to the Pylorus, which it infolds with certain branches, and goes to the hollow of the Liver. Other two Nerves al<U+017F>o go unto the bottom of the Stomach, from the branches which run along by the Roots of the Ribs. And therefore it is no wonder, that when the Brain is <U+017F>mitten and hurt, the Stomach is di<U+017F>turbed, and falls a vomiting, e<U+017F>pecially in the pain called <hi>Hemicranea:</hi> As al<U+017F>o that when the Stomach is mi<U+017F>affected, the Animal Faculty langui<U+017F>hes.</p>

               <p>Now <hi>Johannes Walaeus</hi> requires three things to Concoction, fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome<note place="margin">Three things requi<U+017F>ite to Concoction,</note> moi<U+017F>ture to temper the meat and make it liquid, viz. Drink and Spittle; in the next place, <U+017F>omwhat to cut and mince it as it were, as the thin <U+017F>harp humor, and la<U+017F>tly <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to melt and make liquid that which is cut, <U+017F>uch as is heat, wherewith in ravenous bea<U+017F>ts and <U+017F>ome Men, the chyle is made fluid, though they do not alwaies drink, I <U+017F>hould not doubt, but that the Excrements of the third Concoction, <U+017F>ticking to the Cru<U+017F>t, as being <U+017F>till impraegnated with the virtue of the parts nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do give <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the Concoction, which when they are fretted of, is impared, and <U+017F>o in long fa<U+017F>ting men are not <U+017F>o able to dige<U+017F>t: And that the <U+017F>pittle be<U+017F>ides moi<U+017F>tening and tempering the meats, doth perform <U+017F>ome other more noble work in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, viz. prepares the meat in the mouth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it comes to change its <U+017F>mels; and heals Tetters, and either kills or cha<U+017F>es away Scorpions and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>But what becomes of that acid Juyce, when it hath performed its office of fermentation? <hi>H. Regius</hi> beleives that it remaines after the expul<U+017F>ion of the Chylus, to prick the <U+017F>tomach and provoke Appetite. But hunger is rai<U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible mouth of the <U+017F>tomach, and not in the bottom thereof, where this acid juyce is; al<U+017F>o there would be hunger after the <U+017F>tomach is full. I <U+017F>hould think that it is expelled with the Chyle, and that then it is either therewith turned into blood, or that in ob<U+017F>tructions of the Me<U+017F>entery, it goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and rai<U+017F>es di<U+017F>turbance.</p>
               <p>The Action of the <U+017F>tomach is <hi>Coction</hi> which is termed Chylification. For the<note place="margin">Concoction is the Stomachs Act.</note> <U+017F>tomach is the Organ of the fir<U+017F>t Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, the beginning and preparation of which Concoction is performed in the mouth, the middle in the bottom of the Stomach, and the Conclu<U+017F>ion in the <U+017F>mal Guts. Now this Concoction is performed by heat, not<note place="margin">How it is made.</note> of the <U+017F>tomach only, but al<U+017F>o of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts; as al<U+017F>o by a faculty which is naturally bred in the <U+017F>tomach of every Animal. Now it turnes the meats into a white Chylus or Juyce, of a like <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, whiles both its Ori<U+017F>ices being <U+017F>hut very well, it contracts it <U+017F>elf, and clo<U+017F>ely embraces the food.

The weight of all of them dried, is according to the ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Lo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> a pound. Their length, for the mo<U+017F>t part doth exceed the length of the per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>ix times, little more or le<U+017F>s. <hi>Picolhomineus</hi> <U+017F>aies they are a foot and half <U+017F>horter; they are reckoned to be <U+017F>even times as long by <hi>Laurentius, Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and before them by <hi>Cel<U+017F>us,</hi> who neverthele<U+017F>s began to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure from the <hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagus. Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith they are near upon thirteen cubits, or not le<U+017F>s then twelve: but the ful <U+017F>tature of a man, hardly exceeds three Cubits and an half. <hi>Flud</hi> in a certain Body an ell and half long, found the Guts to be but nine ells in length, <U+017F>o that no certain Mea<U+017F>ure can be determined. It varies according to the Multitude of the windings, and the greedine<U+017F>s of the per<U+017F>on in point of eating.</p>
               <p>They have turnings and windings all<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e of the turnings and windings of the Guts.</note> over <U+017F>ave at the beginning and end, that the Ingre<U+017F>s and Egre<U+017F>s might not be hindred. Now the rea<U+017F>on why they have the<U+017F>e windings and turnings is. 1. That the nutriment may not <U+017F>lip away, before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction be perfectly fini<U+017F>hed. Al<U+017F>o lea<U+017F>t if it <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>lip away, before the Chylus be di<U+017F>tributed, we <U+017F>hould be compelled pre<U+017F>ently to eate more meat, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>hould be hindred from our bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s through greedyne<U+017F>s of eating. Hence it is that living Creatures by how much the way is <U+017F>treighter from their <U+017F>tomach to their Vent, by <U+017F>o much the more greedy they are of eating; and the more their Guts are coiled, the more ab<U+017F>tinent they are: which <hi>Cabrolius</hi> ob<U+017F>erved in a very great eater, who had one only Gut, bowed after the manner of a Greek <hi>Sigma.</hi> 3. That we might not be continually going to <U+017F>tool, as it is with greedy Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, <U+017F>eeing the Excrements may lie long in tho<U+017F>e windings.</p>

               <p>For <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> they have the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> or milkie Veins, which are chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tributed<note place="margin">Their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note> between the common and proper Membranes, which carry the Chyle to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and others from the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to bring Blood for Nouri<U+017F>hment, but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry back to the Liver the Blood which remains after the Guts have received their Nouri<U+017F>hment. They have al<U+017F>o Arteries from the Caeliaca for life, which by their motion pre<U+017F>erve from purrefaction, but e<U+017F>pecially to bring Nouri<U+017F>hment from the Spleen to the Guts, which wanted <U+017F>uch kind of <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance. They have <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <U+017F>ixt pare of Nerves. But <hi>Walaeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that the Guts have <U+017F>uch great plenty of Arteries and Veins. 1. That Excrements might be conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the common <U+017F>hore, which are contained in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, whence the Child in the Womb, though it take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41352:16"/>
no meat in at the mouth, yet hath it Excrements in the Guts. 2. That greater plenty of Blood might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the <hi>Vena portae</hi> and the Liver, and might come to be perfected by the Liver.</p>
               <p>All the Guts are commonly <hi>divided,</hi> into the <hi>thin,</hi> or <hi><U+017F>mall,</hi> and the <hi>thick,</hi> or<note place="margin">Difference of the Guts.</note> large Guts. For though they make one continued Channel from the Pylorus to the Fundament: Yet becau<U+017F>e this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age doth vary, in Magnitude, Number of Turnings, Sub<U+017F>tance, Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Figure, and Office, therefore is it di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into divers Guts.</p>

That they may be the more near to the Centre of the Me<U+017F>enterie, and con<U+017F>equently receive Veins and Arteries immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Me<U+017F>enterie, and quickly conveigh the Blood to the Liver. Now the <U+017F>mall Guts are three: Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ileon. And the<U+017F>e perfect and di<U+017F>tribute the Chyle: In as much as by rea<U+017F>on of their narrowne<U+017F>s, every part of the Chylus may be touched, by their Coat and Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. This Di<U+017F>tributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is holpen by the inbred Peri<U+017F>taltick motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Guts are contracted from the upper part down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>a Inte<U+017F>tina</hi> or thick Guts,<note place="margin">The thick Guts.</note> are <U+017F>o called, becau<U+017F>e they have thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Coats; they contain the thick part of the Chyle: And are made to collect, and for a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on retain the Dung. And they are three; Caecum, Colon, and Rectum. And they are <U+017F>ituate by the <U+017F>ides of the <U+017F>mall Guts, which they wall about as it were, that they might give way to the thin Guts, and that the thin Guts might not be oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the thick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of all the Guts is, to be like<note place="margin">Their U<U+017F>e.</note> the Earth, out of which the Me<U+017F>araick Veins <U+017F>uck Blood, and the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> or milkie Veins <U+017F>uck Chyle. And the <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> of the <hi>thin Guts</hi> is, to concoct the Chylus yet more in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and to di<U+017F>tribute the <U+017F>ame. Of the <hi>thick Guts</hi> to contain the Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Reliques of the Chyle. viz. the Dung; al<U+017F>o Winds and Choler proceeding from the Liver. A <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary u<U+017F>e</hi> of the Guts being dried, is to cure pains of the Cholick, and other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Guts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preternaturally depraved, to contain <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Worms, and Duggs, and Stones; al<U+017F>o variou<U+017F>ly to be affected, of which Phy<U+017F>itians are wont to treat.</p>

Nor can we under<U+017F>tand the fingers breath, of which this Gut hardly attains to eight, unle<U+017F>s peradventure the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did al<U+017F>o comprehend the Pylorus in ther me<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>It <hi>proceeds</hi> in the right <U+017F>ide, from the Pylorus towards the Back-bone, or under the Stomach, where being joyned to the Vertebra's of the Loins, by membranous Ligaments, it defends right along, without any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution, and is <hi>terminated,</hi> where the Windings and Wreathings begin.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>thicker</hi> then the re<U+017F>t of the thin Guts; but hath a more narrow Cavity, lea<U+017F>t the Chylus <U+017F>hould <U+017F>lip in too fa<U+017F>t.

               <p>The <hi>fir<U+017F>t thick Gut</hi> is called <hi>Caecum.</hi> 1. Becau<U+017F>e of the ob<U+017F>cure U<U+017F>e it hath in<note place="margin">The thick Guts. The Gut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, or the blind Gut.</note> per<U+017F>ons grown up, howbeit in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the Womb, it is <U+017F>aid to receive the Excrements. <hi>Knobleth</hi> indeed <U+017F>aith that it hath a double Orifice, <U+017F>evered with a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Partition, that by one it may receive from the Ileon, and by the other deliver into the Colon; but we have not yet found this in any man, in whom one and the <U+017F>ame Orifice takes in and gives out. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it hath only one Hole, whence it is al<U+017F>o called <hi>Monocolon.</hi> For it is a little Appendix like a long Worm, which ari<U+017F>ing from the beginning of Colon, and the End of Ilium, of a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>ufficiently thick, <U+017F>preds it <U+017F>elf upon the Colon like a twined worm, and is annexed to the Membrane of the Peritonaeum; but by its End, it is joyned to the right Kidneys, the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum coming between, and is quite free and loo<U+017F>e from the Me<U+017F>enterie.</p>
               <p>It is four fingers <hi>long,</hi> and as broad as ones thumb, but the Cavity thereof is very <U+017F>trait. <hi>Riolanus</hi> did find it exceeding wide, and equal to the Stoma it <U+017F>elf, as I al<U+017F>o have <U+017F>een it. <hi>Sylvius</hi> did in many find it <U+017F>olid, without any Followne<U+017F>s, and in <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, the Dung
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41352:17"/>
does go immediately from the Ileon into the Colon. And <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pects that this Appendix is only bred when the Child being from its Birth troubled with a Loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, the liquid Dung pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>peedily by the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and not abiding therein, being fru<U+017F>trated of its Office, it grows lean. Howbeit, I have <U+017F>een it of the <U+017F>ame thinne<U+017F>s in a Child new born.</p>
               <p>The Ancients by the Caecum un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood<note place="margin">The Inte<U+017F>tinum caecum, or blind Gut of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> that globous and capacious part, at the beginning of the Colon, which <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> and <hi>Rufus Ephe<U+017F>ius</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. For that it was known to the Ancients, contrary to what <hi>Laurembergius</hi> imagins, I do hence prove, becau<U+017F>e 1. They di<U+017F><U+017F>ected Bea<U+017F>ts. 2. <hi>Pollux</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> have <U+017F>et it down di<U+017F>tinctly. 3. <hi>Galen</hi> hath di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed it from the Colon, both by U<U+017F>e and Situation, placing the Caecum on the right Hand, and the Colon on the left.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Caecum is, not to be only for a marke or <U+017F>ign, as <hi>Hofman</hi> imagines, But fir<U+017F>t to receive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>lip down violently into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and breed pains, and force us to be contiually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <U+017F>tool. And there <U+017F>ome imagine the Dreggs or Excrements proceeding from cherries and cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tones, which have been voided <U+017F>orty daies after they were eaten, did lie lurking. The <hi>Conciliator</hi> contends, that the Dung is here <U+017F>eparated from all chylous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Helmont</hi> places the <hi>Fermentum <U+017F>tercoreum</hi> or turdie Leaven, which turns the Excrements of the Chyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plain Turds, in this place. 2. It may help <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards the Elaboration of the Chyle, either by <U+017F>ucking out of the white Me<U+017F>araick Veins <U+017F>ome negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parcels of Chyle, as <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aid, or by dige<U+017F>ting the inobedient Chylus, which could not be tamed, in the Stomach and <U+017F>mall Guts, by rea<U+017F>on of the multitude of Food taken in, as <hi>Zerbus</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es. 3.

But <hi>Riolanus</hi> ob<U+017F>erved this very Gut Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in a certain Apothecary rouled to the Groin, and in little Boys into their Cod, in whom it re<U+017F>ted upon the <hi>Os <U+017F>acrum.

               <p>The <hi><U+017F>econd thick Gut</hi> is called <hi>Colon,</hi> from the torment which is <U+017F>omtimes<note place="margin">The Gut Colon.</note> therein cau<U+017F>ed, by colick pains. Some think tis <U+017F>o called from its Hollowne<U+017F>s, and becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hapes the Belly. Others derive it from a word <U+017F>igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to delay, becau<U+017F>e it gives a <U+017F>top to the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. The Author of a Treati<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>ly a<U+017F>cribed to <hi>Galen,</hi> derives it <hi>a colando,</hi> from <U+017F>train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becau<U+017F>e it is narrow like a <U+017F>trainner, and involved, that there may be a Gradation of the Excrement, and that it may not de<U+017F>cend all at once.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Ligament</hi> de<U+017F>cribed by few, or a <hi>certain Band,</hi> as broad as an half finger, is implanted through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, on the upper part long-wi<U+017F>e, and ari<U+017F>ing from the Caecum, is termined in the Rectum.

               <p>According to the Longitude of the Colon, there are extrin<U+017F>ecally ob<U+017F>erved certain fat Appendices, from the Spleen to the beginning of the <hi>Rectum Inte<U+017F>tinum,</hi> as <hi>Riolanus</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved.

               <p>At the beginning of the Colon, a<note place="margin">A Valve in the Gut Colon.</note> Valve is placed <U+017F>ufficiently thick and membranous, invented by <hi>Baubinus,</hi> looking upwards, not downwards, as <hi>Laurentius</hi> writes: for the Excrements do a<U+017F>cend and not de<U+017F>cend, when they pa<U+017F>s out of the Ileon into the Colon, by rea<U+017F>on of upper Situation of the Guts. But if the Natural <U+017F>etling of the Excrements be con<U+017F>idered, they de<U+017F>cend making ha<U+017F>t out of the Body: And thus <hi>Bartholinus</hi> and <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingerus</hi> are reconciled. The fir<U+017F>t Invention of this Valve, <U+017F>eems to be long unto <hi>Salomon Alberts</hi> an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi<U+017F>t of <hi>Witteberg,</hi> as appears in an Appendix to three Orations <U+017F>et forth by him, about the End, and from the Ob<U+017F>ervations of <hi>Schenkius, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Title de Ilio.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, be<U+017F>ides <hi>Bauhinus Varolus</hi> did al<U+017F>o attribute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof unto him<U+017F>elf, who was a well known Anatomi<U+017F>t in the Univer<U+017F>ity of <hi>Padua,</hi> in the year 1572. And therefore <hi>Riolanus</hi> conceives the fir<U+017F>t Invention thereof, ought to be attributed rather to him then <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus;</hi> But truly, it is in vain that he <U+017F>eeks to bereave him of this commendation, <U+017F>eeing divers Per<U+017F>ons may ob<U+017F>erve one and the <U+017F>ame thing, at one or <U+017F>undry times, without <U+017F>tealing the Invention one from another. For Nature lies open to all diligent Enquires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is found</hi> after this manner: Water<note place="margin">How it is found out?</note> poured or wind blown into the Gut Ile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot pa<U+017F>s through unle<U+017F>s violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But Water doth a little mar the Gut.</p>
               <p>Touching its <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> Authors do not con<U+017F>ent. For omitting <U+017F>uch as wholly deny the <U+017F>ame; <hi>Bauhinus</hi> determines that it is only one, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the figure of a Nail. <hi>Archangelus</hi> <U+017F>aith, that there are three Valves at the Caecum, as in the Heart, looking downwards. I have <U+017F>ought it at <hi>Padua</hi> in many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and at other places, and alwaies found it, but never more then one, and that of an orbicular or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Shape. <hi>Pavius</hi> to <hi>Hildanus</hi> and afterwards <hi>Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgius,</hi> did not find out a membranous Valve, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Ring or Circle with an hanging brim. But the <U+017F>aid Circle is nothing but a Valve, for <U+017F>ome Valves are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41352:17"/>
found of a circular Figure, both in the Heart, and in other Veins. The whole con<U+017F>titution of this Valve is elegantly de<U+017F>cribed by that great Practitioner <hi>Nicholas Tulpius,</hi> that it is a Circle on which hangs a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, two fingers broad, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>haped that it is fit to <U+017F>hut the egre<U+017F>s of Inte<U+017F>tinum Ileum. Before which there hangs a Cortin or <U+017F>lack veile as it were; now the latitude of this Pendulous Membrane is very unequal; for where it looks towards the Ileum, it diffu<U+017F>es it <U+017F>elf loo<U+017F>ely, to the quantity of near two fingers breadth, but the farther from the place it is, the clo<U+017F>elyer it is <U+017F>trait'ned, <U+017F>o that about the middle of the Gut (for <U+017F>o far it runs) it is either quite obliterated, and ends in to that Membranous compa<U+017F>s, which inwardly <U+017F>evers the Inte<U+017F>tinum Colon a Caeco. From which unequal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, there follows nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily that <U+017F>ame circular form, which the value expre<U+017F><U+017F>es being artificially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: as the <U+017F>maller picture faithfully expre<U+017F><U+017F>es. Now this Membrane is fa<U+017F>tned above to that <U+017F>ame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous circle which ends the Colon, but it is fa<U+017F>tned below or rather <U+017F>trongly held, by two very little Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, proceeding on both <U+017F>ides from the <U+017F>ide of that Orifice, through which the thinner Guts disburthen them<U+017F>elves into the wider: the u<U+017F>e of which bones, is to hinder that the value do not ea<U+017F>ily totter, for they bind it to the Ileum: But the lower part of the value doth wave up and down loo<U+017F>ely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is, that nothing may pa<U+017F>s back out of the thick Guts into the thin, be it Wind or Excrement, e<U+017F>pecially in a <U+017F>trong excretion or <U+017F>training at <U+017F>tool, or in co<U+017F>tivene<U+017F>s of the Belly. Hence it is, that the matter of Cly<U+017F>ters cannot naturally reach unto the <U+017F>mal Guts.</p>
               <p>The Colon hath <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> under the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach from the Epiplois po<U+017F>tica. But in the left <U+017F>ide it hath the Haemorrhoidal Vein, and from the lower Me<U+017F>enterick, the Haemorrhoidal Artery.</p>
               <p>The la<U+017F>t thick Gut is termed REC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUM, becau<U+017F>e it goes <U+017F>traight out,<note place="margin">The Inte<U+017F>tinum rectum, or the <U+017F>traight Gut.</note> without any turning, and ends at the Fundament; for it goes <U+017F>treight downwards, from the top of the Os Sacrum to the extremity of the Crupper-bone, to which it is <hi>Knit</hi> firmly, by the Peritonaeum, lea<U+017F>t it fal of: al<U+017F>o it <hi>grows</hi> in men to the Pi<U+017F>pipe in the Yard; to the Neck of the Womb in Women, by mediation of a Mu<U+017F>culous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Whence <U+017F>prings the con<U+017F>ent of the<U+017F>e parts in Men and Women, e<U+017F>pecially of the Womb and this Gut in Women, for the Gut being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated, oft-times the Excrement is ca<U+017F>t out the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Privity.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>long,</hi> as it were an Hand-breath and an half, and three fingers broad; and Corpulent and <hi>thick,</hi> having Fat Appurtenances, growing thereto on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Veins</hi> from the Hypoga<U+017F>trick branch of the Vena Cava, and Haemorrhoidal Veins.</p>
               <p>Four <hi>Nerves</hi> are in<U+017F>erted into the end thereof, which make this Gut very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as is apparent in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>mus.</p>

And therefore, 3. They <U+017F>erve to <U+017F>uck <U+017F>uperfluous Humors out of the Guts, which was <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Opinion. I add 4. A peculiar U<U+017F>e, viz. to receive that plenty of milkie Veins which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es that way, and to keep <U+017F>ome portion of the Chyle, becau<U+017F>e 1. It is of like u<U+017F>e with that greater middle Kernel, and its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is the <U+017F>ame with that which exceeds this only in magnitude, becau<U+017F>e greater milkie Veins pa<U+017F>s that way. 2.

This being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both Atrophia and other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood, to which Opinion al<U+017F>o <hi>A<U+017F>ellius</hi> <U+017F>eems to have encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

I beleive <hi>Fallopius</hi> did not know it. He mentions indeed <U+017F>mall Pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ending into the Pancreas and Kernels next it; but becau<U+017F>e this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is only one, he rather <U+017F>aw through a mi<U+017F>t the milkie Veins, di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed into the Pancreas of the Me<U+017F>enterie and other Kernels. It is for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>ingle, though the <U+017F>ame Party had found it double running one by another in parallel Lines: A <U+017F>hort one in the ordinary place, and beneath it a larger. The Orifice whereof opens widely into the Gut Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, near the Entrance of the Gal-pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, with which it is <U+017F>omtimes joyned by one and the <U+017F>ame Mouth, but more frequently (as I found with the Author) by a different but neighboring Circle. The little Valve <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate before the egre<U+017F>s thereof, looking outwards, keeps the Probe from entring this new pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, being thru<U+017F>t in by the Duodenum.

And therefore this new found pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>U<U+017F>e,</hi> is not to carry Chylus ut of the Duodenum into the Spleen, bo u<U+017F>e 1.<note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note> It doth not reach to the Spleen. 2. A Valve hinders the Ingre<U+017F>s. Nor doth it <U+017F>erve to carry Melancholy out of the Spleen, to which u<U+017F>e <U+017F>erve the <hi>Cap<U+017F>ulae atrabilariae,</hi> the black Choler boxes. Nor to carry fermentative Juyce unto the Stomach, as <hi>Hor<U+017F>tius Junior</hi> ingeniou<U+017F>ly feignes, Becau<U+017F>e 1. Such Juyce is not bred in the Pancreas, which is a glandulous Body. 2. The way is more ready to that purpo<U+017F>e, from the Spleen; this being a more trouble<U+017F>om and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, for it would be troubled by meeting the Chylus in the Duodenum, and would be infected by the nearne<U+017F>s of the Gall-pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. 3. Never any <U+017F>uch Juyce <U+017F>een in this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. 4. Who will be bound that it <U+017F>hall be able to pa<U+017F>s beyond the Pylorus? Nor is it to prepare Chylus, which <hi>Baccius</hi> affirmes to be found in living Creatures. Nor to nouri<U+017F>h the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, <U+017F>eeing that Humor is therefore unfit, and the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liack Arteries do that work, but for the common good. But how, or which way <U+017F>hall it return to the Liver? For he rightly denies it to the Spleen. Shall it return to the Duodenum, and from thence to the Me<U+017F>entery? There would be an infinite Circulation. He <U+017F>hall not ea<U+017F>ily find it in living Anatomies; al<U+017F>o he confounds the Pancreas with the large Kernel of the Me<U+017F>entery. Nor finally does it <U+017F>end the Excrements of the Chyle to the Duodenum, as <hi>Licetus, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Ve<U+017F>tingus</hi> conceive; for in this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age no Chyle is <U+017F>een, but yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Walls. Moreover the refu<U+017F>e of the Chyle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready voided by <U+017F>tool, nor does the Chyle part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new Excrement, till it undergo a new change in the Veins of the Liver. Now <U+017F>ure it is, that out of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41352:20"/>
Pancreas it <U+017F>elf, who<U+017F>e proper pa<U+017F><U+017F>age it is, and in which it begins, and is ended, <U+017F>omwhat is thereby voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Guts, and it doth as I conjecture.</p>
               <p>1. Purge forth Choler, whether bred in the Dige<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pancreas, or in the Spleen, for each of the<U+017F>e are taken to be Auxiliary-Livers. And it is as it were the Bladder-gall of the Spleen, which is conveniently joyned by its mouth, to the other pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Livers-Gall-bladder, by the Duodenum, <U+017F>o that look what u<U+017F>e the one affords to the Liver, the <U+017F>ame the other may be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to afford to the Spleen. And to prevent our doubting, the Humor of Choler daubs the in<U+017F>ide of this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. To which Opinion of mine, very many Learned men have a<U+017F><U+017F>erted, though in <U+017F>ome things they di<U+017F><U+017F>ent.</p>
               <p>2. To receive into it <U+017F>elf the Excrements of Arterial Blood from the Heart and Spleen, though the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Branches of <hi>Arteria Coeliaca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Riolanus</hi> counts it a profitable U<U+017F>e, that by this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, in vomiting, divers Humors are purged out, and the Redundancies of the fir<U+017F>t Region; and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the fomenting Humors which maintain long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<U+017F>ting and malignant Feavers and chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and which lurks in the Pancreas, is this way voided forth. And I may well ad <U+017F>omwhat to this mo<U+017F>t lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Invention. That not only by Vomit, but al<U+017F>o by <U+017F>tool, through the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of Choler-purgers, hot cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Di<U+017F>tempers may be by this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age di<U+017F>charged, which burn the Me<U+017F>entery, Spleen, Arteries, and Heart it <U+017F>elf. And hence proceed cholerick <U+017F>tools in burning Feavers, and blood in a Dy<U+017F>entery or Bloody-flux, by rea<U+017F>on of the large Inundation of Choler, continually flowing from hence into the Guts; which is <U+017F>o much the more hard to cure, by how much the Pancreas doth lie out of the reach of Medicaments, being deeply whelmed among the Bowels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e of the Pancreas it <U+017F>elf</hi> is, 1. To prop and <U+017F>upport Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing<note place="margin">The U<U+017F>e of the Pancreas.</note> through the <U+017F>ame, as the Branches of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na porta,</hi> of the Coeliack Artery, and of the Nerves: E<U+017F>pecially the <hi>Ramus Splenicus.</hi> 2. To a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Concoction of the Stomach, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Heat and Moi<U+017F>ture. 3. To <U+017F>erve as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hion under the Stomach. And therefore that old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Rome</hi> in whom it was become <U+017F>toney, fell fir<U+017F>t into a continual Vomiting, afterwards into an Atrophy or con<U+017F>uming of fle<U+017F>h, and at la<U+017F>t died thereof, as <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus</hi> hath it in his Ob<U+017F>ervations. 4.

               <p>ANd <U+017F>o much may <U+017F>uffice to have <U+017F>aid touching the Organs de<U+017F>tined to primary Dige<U+017F>tion or Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we come now to tho<U+017F>e which are any waies a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting the <U+017F>econd Concoction or Sanguification. And the Principal of the<U+017F>e is the Liver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> is an Organick Part <U+017F>eated in the Lower Belly, ju<U+017F>t under the Diaphragma or Midriff, on the right <U+017F>ide, being the Organ of Blood-making, and the beginning of the Veins.</p>
               <p>It hath its Name in Greek, from a Word that <U+017F>ignifies want or Indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Why the Liver is the Original of the Veins?</note> becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>upplies the want of the Parts of the Body, the Latins cal it <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,</hi> as if you would <U+017F>ay <hi>juxta Cor,</hi> near the Heart. 'Tis called the Principle or Beginning of the Veins, becau<U+017F>e therein the Roots of two of the greate<U+017F>t Veins appear di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed, viz. of the <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Portae,</hi> as Roots implanted in the Earth. The milkie Veins are <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to ari<U+017F>e from the Pancreas: Yet Trunks and Branches of them are al<U+017F>o to be <U+017F>een in the Liver. Now the Roots of Trees di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed in the Earth, do grow together into a Trunk without the Earth. The <hi>Vena arterio<U+017F>a</hi> of the Heart, is in truth an Artery: And the <hi>Arteria veno<U+017F>a,</hi> is a Vein, and may owe its Original to the Liver, becau<U+017F>e in a Child in the Womb, it is joyned with the <hi>cava,</hi> and opens it <U+017F>elf thereinto by an Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is: And be<U+017F>ides, it carries Blood to the Heart, but brings none from it, if there be any force in this Argument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> is commonly but one in <hi>Number,</hi> <U+017F>eldom two: And more <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">Its Number.</note> is the Liver quite wanting, as in <hi>Matthias Ortelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> in the lowe<U+017F>t Belly, under<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> the <hi>Septum tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>um</hi> (which al<U+017F>o <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totie</hi> acknowledged) by the Ribs, and for the greater part in the right Hypochondrium, a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth di<U+017F>tant there from, that the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might not be hindered: Therefore a Swelling in the Liver cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of breath. In Birds it lies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually on both <U+017F>ides: As al<U+017F>o for the mo<U+017F>t part in Dogs which have a thin and long Spleen. In Man it <U+017F>eldom changes its place, <U+017F>o as the Liver <U+017F>hould be in the left, the Spleen in the right <U+017F>ide, which <hi>Gemma</hi> and <hi>Spererius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved. It re<U+017F>ts lightly upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and upper part of the Stomach, e<U+017F>pecially on the right <U+017F>ide, for otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome part thereof reaches to the left <U+017F>ide al<U+017F>o, and <U+017F>omtimes the greate<U+017F>t part, the Spleen being very <U+017F>mall. But <U+017F>ome conceive that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>totle</hi> was ignorant of the Situation of the Liver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>aid <hi>Huper de to Diazoma,</hi> &amp;c. which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, above the Septum is the Liver <U+017F>eated. But the Philo<U+017F>oper is thus to be tran<U+017F>lated: It is placed on the other <U+017F>ide, or beyond the <hi>Septum tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>um;</hi> for <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> with an Accu<U+017F>ative <U+017F>ignifies beyond, but with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netive, it <U+017F>ignifies above.</p>
               <p>And by rea<U+017F>on of the Midriff, to which<note place="margin">Its Figure.</note> it was to give way, it hath its upper and outward <hi>Figure</hi> <U+017F>ufficiently round, convex or gibbous, even and <U+017F>mooth, where al<U+017F>o there is an oblong Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, behind at the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of <hi>Vena cava.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e of the Stomach it hath received a Figure which is hollow on the inner and lower <U+017F>ide, which is termed its <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or <U+017F>addle <U+017F>ide, and it is more uneven then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having in it two hollowne<U+017F><U+017F>es: One on the right hand for the Gall-bladder; another on the left, for the Stomach to pa<U+017F>s by. So that the Liver is on the right <U+017F>ide of an ample roundne<U+017F>s, but on the left it is narrow and <U+017F>harp.</p>
               <p>The Liver is <hi>divided</hi> by <U+017F>ome, into the<note place="margin">Its Divi<U+017F>ion.</note> right and left part: between which there is a <U+017F>mal cleft or chink, where the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical<note place="margin">A Mans Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Laps or Scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops.</note> Vein enters.

               <p>The <hi>Color</hi> of a <U+017F>ound Liver is ruddie [but<note place="margin">Its Color.</note> if it be quite void of blood, or boyled, we may rightly <U+017F>ay with <hi>Gordonius,</hi> that it is whitei<U+017F>h, as in an Embryo, before affu<U+017F>ion of blood be made.

Veins, or who conceive that they are ob<U+017F>curely and hardly known: [among whom <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> are lately come upon the <U+017F>tage, the former of whom could no where find any Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is, either in the Liver, Spleen, or any other Bowel, though they had been boyled, till the whole <hi>Parenchyma</hi> would crumble in peices, and was <U+017F>eparated like du<U+017F>t from all the <U+017F>trings of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, with a needle. Only he ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this one thing, in a fre<U+017F>h Liver, viz. that all the branches of Vena Cava creeping along the bo<U+017F><U+017F>ie part of the Liver, have Coats like <U+017F>elves full of infinite lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle holes, as being made for the draught of the Body, to receive <U+017F>uch Blood as <U+017F>ettles there: but that the branches of the Vena Portae are not <U+017F>o but are divided into boughes, and that every where the branches of both, do run out to the highe<U+017F>t Eminency of the bo<U+017F><U+017F>ie <U+017F>ide of the Bowel, without Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es. But the Porta hath likewi<U+017F>e very many holes great and little, as the Cava hath, <U+017F>ome of which will admit the probe, others not, only they make certain Cavities covered with a thin Membrane. Whence it is apparent, that the blood is <U+017F>taied by tho<U+017F>e clo<U+017F>ed holes and not <U+017F>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, <U+017F>ome of them being<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> covered with a Coat, <hi>Riolanus</hi> in<U+017F>pired by the <U+017F>ame Spirit, doth <U+017F>trongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the Vena Cava and Portae lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be forced to admit the Circulation of the Blood in that Place. He was afraid that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted liquor <U+017F>hould be confounded and mixt with the unconcocted. And what if they be confounded and jumbled together? The Chymus being changed into imperfect blood is confounded coming out of the milky Veins, with that which is contained in the Cava, for both of them are to be perfected in the Heart. And the other which flows out of Porta, prepares both with its acid juyce. But be it how it will be, the Authority of all Anatomi<U+017F>ts doth a<U+017F><U+017F>ert tho<U+017F>e Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es from the times of <hi>Era<U+017F>i<U+017F>tratus</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> to our daies, becau<U+017F>e it is manife<U+017F>t to <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>earch diligently, that the<U+017F>e roots are joyned together, <U+017F>omtimes athwart, <U+017F>o that one lies over the middle of another as it were, <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the extremities of one Vein touch the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or ends of another, otherwhiles the ends of one touch the middle of the other; and <U+017F>omtimes they touch not one another at all; peradventure where the Branches of the Liver <U+017F>erve only for Nutrition. <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus</hi> wi<U+017F>hes us chiefly to ob<U+017F>erve a remarkable Ana<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>is, which re<U+017F>embles a channel, and is as it were a common and continued pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, out of the Roots of Porta into the Roots of Cava, admitting a pretty big Probe. But becau<U+017F>e we cannot rely upon naked Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, experience mu<U+017F>t be called by us to coun<U+017F>el, which doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily per<U+017F>wade us that there are <U+017F>uch Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es or Unions of the Mouths of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>eis, by rea<U+017F>on of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood out of the milky Veins and the Venae Porrae, unto the Cava, and out of the manife<U+017F>t Arteries, <U+017F>eeing the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age only through the fle<U+017F>h cannot <U+017F>uffice, in a quick and plentiful Flux. I confe<U+017F>s all the kinds of Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es are not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Eye as to be <U+017F>een open, in dead bodies, though no man can therefore deny that there are <U+017F>uch things; but <U+017F>ome of them are in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, which admit neither Probe not Wind, and <U+017F>ome admit Wind and nothing el<U+017F>e. The Renowned <hi>Walaeus</hi> ob<U+017F>erved and found by experience, that the Veins of the Porta are in the Liver no where opened into the greater branch of Vena Cava, but that the very <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t branches of Vena Porta, do open into the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t branches of the Vena Cava, as he ob<U+017F>erved in a Liver blown up with wind, after the fle<U+017F>h was taken away, and floating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on water. I have in an Oxes Liver curiou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>ought for apparent Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e there they mu<U+017F>t needs be vi<U+017F>ible becau<U+017F>e of the greatne<U+017F>s, following the example of the mo<U+017F>t learned <hi>Slegelius.</hi> But the very truth is they are not vi<U+017F>ible to the Eye: the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are divers waies interwoven and twi<U+017F>ted one among another; Trunk with Trunk, branches of the Trunkes, either with the Trunk of another Vein, or with little branches; and that either in the middle of tho<U+017F>e little branches, or in the extremities, even as we <U+017F>ee both the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els cleave together in the Womb-cake: But a Probe finds no entrance, by any open hole of an Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is. Neverthele<U+017F>s, it is not to be denied, but that in living<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Bodies there is a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age known to Nature though unknown to us by rea<U+017F>on of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity of a through pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. Which I the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becau<U+017F>e that in the conjunction of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, yea even of the greater, where the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es <U+017F>eems <U+017F>hut, the Coat is extraordinary thin and for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>ingle, as appears by its tran<U+017F>parency, which in Living Bodies being ratified by heat and motion, doth ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>uffer the blood to pa<U+017F>s through.</p>
               <p>By the<U+017F>e Unions therefore of the Roots of the Vena Cava and the Vena Portae, the Blood may pa<U+017F>s through: And by them likewi<U+017F>e the peccant matter pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, when we Evacuate the habit of the Body by Purgations. Not that it <U+017F>hould be carried out of the Porta to the Me<U+017F>entery, as hath been hitherto beleived, but <U+017F>o as thence to pa<U+017F>s through the Heart, and be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied out through the Caeliacal Arteries, and thence through the <U+017F>tomach or the Gall-Conduits into the Guts, forced along by virtue of the purging Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es are likewi<U+017F>e to be ob<U+017F>erved, by which the <U+017F>mal Veins of the Gall-bladder, are joyned to the Branches of Vena Portae and Vena Cava.</p>
               <p>The Roots of Vena Portae, do by little<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Veins.</note> and little towards the lower part become <U+017F>maller and greater, until they make one Trunk, which is called <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> the Gate-Vein: So al<U+017F>o the Roots of the Cava, above and in the fore-part do altogether make up one <hi>Trunk;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the going out whereof, certain Circles are placed, here and there in the greater branches, being of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and very like to Valves, <U+017F>omtimes thicker, other whiles thinner and like Cobwebs, which were fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covered by <hi>Stephanus<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  </hi> and after by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius</hi> in an Oxes Liver; and I likewi<U+017F>e found them, looking towards the larger trunk, which hinder the return of blood, not <U+017F>o much of that which is impure and dreggy, as of the pair being once gone out to the Heart: afterwards, as <U+017F>oon as it comes to the Liver, it is divided into two great branches, the a<U+017F>cendent and de<U+017F>cendent; and hence it is that they <U+017F>ay, the Cava ari<U+017F>es from the upper or bo<U+017F><U+017F>ie part of the Liver, and the Vena Portae from the lower and hollow part.</p>
               <p>The Liver hath two <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <U+017F>ixt pair, one from the Stomach, another from the Co<U+017F>tal, di<U+017F>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed only through its Coat, and not through its <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance (as <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> will have it) that in its inmo<U+017F>t body, it may be void of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, in regard of <U+017F>o many motions of humors. And therefore the pains in this part are, dul and rather a kind of Heavyne<U+017F>s then pain.

And the milky Veins are exceeding <U+017F>mall. 3. The proper Fibres of the Veins, do <U+017F>erve more for <U+017F>trength, then for driving. 4. The Stomach indeed, and the Guts are contracted, but they are not able to expel the chyle; for their motion is ob<U+017F>cure, and though it were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet it would not pre<U+017F>ently follow, that it mu<U+017F>t drive into the Liver. 5.

The dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Chyle <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ent unto the Liver, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as well as the pure. It is therefore <hi>principally</hi> drawn by the Liver, howbeit <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>truction of the Guts, is <hi><U+017F>econdarily</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant thereunto. This Chymus being attracted in the Roots of the milky veins, as in the place where, is by the Parenchyma or Sub<U+017F>tance of the Liver, as the Efficient cau<U+017F>e, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the internal heat of the Chyle, changed into a new <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of blood. Now it gains a <hi>Redne<U+017F>s</hi> like the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the Liver, not <U+017F>o much from the fle<U+017F>h of the Liver alone, which it <U+017F>elf ows its color to blood <U+017F>hed about it, which it layes away when it is wa<U+017F>hed or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and in <U+017F>ome other Creatures we find it of a green color, as from its own proper and adventitious Heat (as Grapes are red) which vani<U+017F>hing away, the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s cea<U+017F>es, as it happens in blood-letting. Nor is that a <U+017F>ufficient cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeing in healthy bodies it continues afterwards red, and therefore we mu<U+017F>t take in light as another Cau<U+017F>e, of which there is a great quantity in red colors, <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting even without Heat, unle<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ubject happening to be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, it come to be extingui<U+017F>hed and exhale. Hence it is, that boyled blood becomes black, and putrid blood is duskie. Hence al<U+017F>o, by how much the more Natural inbred light any man hath, the more he <U+017F>hines with bright blood; contrariwi<U+017F>e, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick per<U+017F>ons, the <U+017F>ame being darkned, the blood grows black and dark. That light and fire are the cau<U+017F>e hereof appears in Oyl of Sulphur, by the mixture whereof Liquors become red.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> is partly planted in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Chyle it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>pringing thereout, by rea<U+017F>on of its previous preparation, and partly kindled therein, either by rea<U+017F>on of the nearne<U+017F>s of the Heart, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering parts, or by rea<U+017F>on of the Arterial blood, derived from the Heart and Spleen.</p>
               <p>The more crude Blood being thus made, is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tributed to nouri<U+017F>h the Liver or the Body, which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is performed by the Hepatick Arteries, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the fle<U+017F>h and Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled into the Roots of <hi>Vena cava,</hi> where by longer tarriance, it is more elaborated, and <U+017F>oon after with the returning blood of the <hi>Vena porta</hi> and the Arteries, it is poured out into the Trunk of <hi>cava,</hi> going all <U+017F>traight along, through the upper part of the Trunk to the heart, that it may there attain its la<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes fit to nouri<U+017F>h all the Parts. Not any thing returns this way to the Liver, the Valves hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which in the Liver look outwards, in the Heart inwards, as the whole Fabrick and Ligatures do te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. By the<U+017F>e it is, that the <hi>Cava</hi> alwayes <U+017F>wells towards the Liver, and is empty towards the Heart.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Nouri<U+017F>hment of all the Parts of the Body being accompli<U+017F>hed by the Capillary Arteries, becau<U+017F>e all the blood is not con<U+017F>umed, which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Pul<U+017F>ations is <U+017F>ent forth, nor can that which is <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous return the <U+017F>ame way, by rea<U+017F>on of the Valves of the Heart <U+017F>eated by the Aorta, which lets any thing pa<U+017F>s from the Heart, but admits nothing back again; and becau<U+017F>e any Artery being tied, is full, and <U+017F>wels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart, but is empty, and lank towards the Veins: Therefore it mu<U+017F>t needs return as it were by a circular motion, out of the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els back again into the greate<U+017F>t Veins, and the Trunk it <U+017F>elf of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and thence into the Heart. As it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es through the Liver, other blood there newly bred, is joyned with that of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and that which is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant from the Arteries, for the re<U+017F>toring of that which is <U+017F>pent, and <U+017F>o the <hi>Circulation</hi> is again repeated. Mean while, as hath been <U+017F>aid, Choler is drawn out of the blood, by branches of ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, terminating into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder and Choler-pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. But the wheyi<U+017F>h part, is becau<U+017F>e of its thinne<U+017F>s retained a while, that the blood may more ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F>s every where, and afterwards it is <U+017F>ent away, partly to the Kidneys (with the wheyi<U+017F>h blood, which according to <hi>Galen</hi> is not concocted in the Kidneys, but becau<U+017F>e the Serum is an Excrement of the Liver, the Kidneys do only <U+017F>eparate the blood from the whey) and from thence by the Ureters into the Bladder; whence the Urin does afterward partly go into the Skin, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out by <U+017F>weat and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Tran<U+017F>piration.</p>

And if the force of the Spirits were <U+017F>o great, they might as ea<U+017F>ily open and <U+017F>hut the valves of the Heart, when they are in the Arteries more plentiful then ordinary. They pierce indeed by their finene<U+017F>s the valves, when they are <U+017F>hut, but they carry not the blood with them. Choler, truly, may by <U+017F>ome other means be inflamed, which is every where among hot blood. Finally, the valve would be broken by the violence of Spirits, and greater danger might follow thereby, then if the Gall-bladder were broken, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof <hi>Salmuth</hi> relates.</p>

Ofkin to the<U+017F>e, is the Opinion of <hi>Helmont;</hi> that it is the bal<U+017F>om of the Liver, and the whole Blood, brought from the Liver to the Me<U+017F>entery, and that therefore the Gall precedes in the work of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Liver follows; al<U+017F>o he <U+017F>ayes it hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Bowel. But how <U+017F>hould it come into the Liver, <U+017F>ince Anatomy doth teach, that this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is brought out of the Liver, but not carried back thither. For, the way is too long, through the Me<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, where by rea<U+017F>on of its acrimony, it makes ha<U+017F>t out, or the edge thereof is blunted.

There are few Veins and Arteries di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, but <U+017F>tore of Choler is collected. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Liver goes before that of the Gall, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Womb do <U+017F>hew, in whom the Liver is full of blood, before the Bladder <U+017F>well with Gall, or be <U+017F>o much as lightly colored therewith.</p>
               <p>3. Their Opinion is not much unlike, who conceive that Choler pre<U+017F>erves the neighbouring Parts, and the Liver it <U+017F>elf from corruption, which <hi>Zerbus</hi> would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prove, becau<U+017F>e when the Gall-bladder is removed from the Liver, the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance thereof where the Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder lay, does pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F><U+017F>olve and melt.</p>

For although the Choler-pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age, be implanted into the beginning of the Gut Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, or into the Duodenum; yet it hath an ea<U+017F>ie pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age to the Colon and Ileum.

               <p>The <hi>Action</hi> of the Spleen is by <U+017F>uch Doctors as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the old Opinion <U+017F>aid to be chie<U+017F>ly threefold. 1. To draw melancholick, excrementitious, and <U+017F>limy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors out of the Liver. 2. To <U+017F>eparate the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Excrement there from, that it may be nouri<U+017F>hed by the good blood. 3. To void it being <U+017F>eparated, into the Stomach and Guts.

They will have the Spleen therefore to be the Receptacle of the melancholick Excrement, or of thick dreggie Blood <U+017F>eparated in the Liver (even as the Gall-bladder receives the yellow Choler) and that therefore the Spleen is <U+017F>et ju<U+017F>t over again<U+017F>t the Liver.</p>

By the Arteries, not only to the Guts, but al<U+017F>o to the Kidneys by the emulgent Veins.

The inner Belly is nothing but the large Cavity of the Ureter, that is to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41352:27"/>
<U+017F>ay a membranous Cavity, made of the Ureters, <U+017F>pred out and widened in the Cavity of the kidneys. But the Ureters in their progre<U+017F>s are not attenuated within, as other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are, but they have the ends of their branches (eight or ten for the mo<U+017F>t part) broad and open like Pipes, embracing certain Caruncles, or little fle<U+017F>hy Eminences.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e <hi>Caruncles</hi> are like kernels, le<U+017F>s coloured and harder then the re<U+017F>t of<note place="margin">The Caruncles.</note> the fle<U+017F>h. <hi>Carpus</hi> was the Finder out of them, though <hi>Rondeletius</hi> <U+017F>aies that he did fir<U+017F>t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve them, and calls them Mammilary productions.

By a <U+017F>hort and crooked pa<U+017F><U+017F>age they are carried downwards to the hollow part of the kidneys, as al<U+017F>o the <hi>emulgent Arteries,</hi> which are remarkable and large, derived from the Trunk of the Aorta, unto the kidneys, not <U+017F>o much to furni<U+017F>h vital Heat, to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t coldne<U+017F>s, as to nouri<U+017F>h the kidneys, and to purge away the wheyi<U+017F>h humor, which is mo<U+017F>t plentifully contained in the Arterial blood. For the<U+017F>e emulgent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are <U+017F>eldom one like another, or one in number, <U+017F>omtimes with <U+017F>ix, five, four, three, and for the mo<U+017F>t part two branches, they go di<U+017F>tinctly to the kidneys, and that either on the one or both <U+017F>ides, <U+017F>eldom on one alone. And when they have entred the hollow part of the kidney, each branch is <U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into four or five little ones, which being again divided into other le<U+017F><U+017F>er ones, they are at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>pent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Veins and Arteries as <U+017F>mal as hairs, which end at the the Heads of the Caruncles, into which they <U+017F>hed their wheyi<U+017F>h humor, that it may di<U+017F>til into the little Pipes of the Ureters: Yet are the Emulgents never opened at the Pipes of the Ureters. For wind or water being forced in, it flows indeed through the Emulgents, but it goes not out by the Pipes. Into the left Emulgent in <U+017F>ome bodies there is implanted a branch of the <hi>Vena azugos</hi> <U+017F>o called, which is thought to be the cau<U+017F>e of that Con<U+017F>ent which is between the Che<U+017F>t and the Kidneys, which the Arteries do not a little further.</p>

               <p>The Kidney hath one very <U+017F>mall <hi>Nerve</hi> on each <U+017F>ide, from the Stomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch<note place="margin">Their Nerves.</note> of the <U+017F>ixt pare, di<U+017F>tributed into its proper Membrane, whence ari<U+017F>es<note place="margin">Why <U+017F>uch as have a <U+017F>tone in their kidney are <U+017F>ubject to vomit?</note> the Sympathy between the kidneys and the <U+017F>tomach, as when per<U+017F>ons di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed in their kidneys, are troubled with <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s and vomiting. But there are a few branches of Nerves, which proceed from about the beginnings of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Me<U+017F>entery, part of which enters into the hollow of the kidneys with the Emulgents, and is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eminated through their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.

The blood therefore going out through the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, is alwaies carried through the branches of the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, which are <U+017F>pred abroad through the whole fle<U+017F>h of the kidneys, and go at la<U+017F>t into very <U+017F>mall pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t the wheyi<U+017F>h Humor is poured right out into the fle<U+017F>h of the kidneys: But the <U+017F>anguine and laudable portion, does partly remain to nouri<U+017F>h the kidneys, and partly returns by little emulgent Veins which are open into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and <U+017F>o to the Heart.

Which Arguments are indeed of <U+017F>ome weight, unle<U+017F>s perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture that <U+017F>mell and ra<U+017F>t happen to the kidneys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they are nouri<U+017F>hed with <U+017F>uch a nutriment as is the matter of Seed, which is carried for the Generation thereof in bordering Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. And when the kidneys are hot or cold, the neighbouring places are al<U+017F>o hot or cold, through which the matter of Seed is carried, and in which it is altered, and therefore Seed may have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity to the Con<U+017F>titution of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys. For <hi>Johannes Walaeus</hi> conceives<note place="margin">This Opinion reconciled with the Doctrine of Circulation.</note> that the Circulation of the blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit this u<U+017F>e of the kidneys, for blood is not carried from the kidneys to the <U+017F>tones, by the Emulgents and Veins: but it falls down only out of the Aorta by the Spermatick Arteries. But this action of the kidneys defended by <U+017F>uch Learned men, may be reconciled with the circular motion of the blood, if we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay. 1. That the more wheyi<U+017F>h part of the Arterial blood is drawn by the kidneys through the emulgent Arteries, whereby the re<U+017F>t which de<U+017F>cends right along through the Spermatick Arteries, becomes more pure and fitter to make Seed. Of which this is a <U+017F>ign, that when the attraction of the kidneys is weak, and the blood comes to the <U+017F>tones more wheyi<U+017F>h then it ought to be, the <U+017F>eed which is voided, is unfit for Generation, though plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in quantity. 2. That the neighbouring Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are irradiated and virtuated by the kidneys, even as the Brain irradiates the lower Parts, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred property re<U+017F>embling light. 3. If any thing <U+017F>hould be carried from the kidneys to the <U+017F>tones, we might very well <U+017F>ay, it is a wheyi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which <U+017F>tirs up a <U+017F>harp titillation and <U+017F>trong provocation and de<U+017F>ire to Venery. For I am not per<U+017F>waded by the Arguments of <hi>Helmont,</hi> that the <U+017F>alt of the Urin takes away the fruitfulne<U+017F>s of the Seed, if it be moderate, <U+017F>eeing it helps the Seed both by its acrimony and fluidity or thinne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Little Birds, indeed, though very la<U+017F>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, have neither kidneys nor bladder; yet they have <U+017F>omwhat that <U+017F>upplies the Office of the kidneys, viz. certain Caruncles or little parcels of fle<U+017F>h, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble the kidneys, which are continued with the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta,</hi> Witne<U+017F>s <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> and others.</p>

But they might have their Parenchyma becau<U+017F>e of their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that they might not be intangled one with another. And it was requi<U+017F>ite they <U+017F>hould have very many Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, to the end they might plentifully purge away the Serum or wheyi<U+017F>h part of the Blood, <U+017F>o that through very many and very <U+017F>mall outlets, the Whey might be i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out into the Caruncles, without any con<U+017F>iderable quantity of Blood therewith. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Kidneys which in healthy per<U+017F>ons are red, clear, <U+017F>olid; according to the kind of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <U+017F>omtimes ob<U+017F>cure and blacki<U+017F>h, <U+017F>omtimes white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h; otherwhiles loo<U+017F>e, brittle, and as it were rotten; and <U+017F>omtimes again, hard and dried. But that might happen, becau<U+017F>e as <U+017F>ome other parts, <U+017F>o the kidneys might be <U+017F>ick, or through <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s of the Body, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction being <U+017F>omwhere hurt, they could not be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed with good blood. 3. Becau<U+017F>e the Urins of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons troubled with the <U+017F>tone are crude: But of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cau<U+017F>e is commonly rendred. Viz. in that the kidneys being <U+017F>topped, the thinner part only of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin can make its way forth. 4.

               <p>Their <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> hath been hitherto unknown.<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authors Opinion.</note> If it may be allowed to conjecture, as doubtle<U+017F>s it is, due con<U+017F>ideration being had to the Structure and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; we may <U+017F>ay, that a thick and excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous black-cholerick humor, is detained in the<U+017F>e Ca<U+017F>es, which had not been purged from the Blood made in the Liver, or Spleen, or both, but e<U+017F>pecially that blood which we formerly proved to be made in the Spleen; which is here kept and dige<U+017F>ted, becau<U+017F>e it could not pa<U+017F>s through the narrow waies of the kidneys. Nor let the a<U+017F>cending of an heavy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance trouble us, which ever and anon happens in the Body, by means of the expul<U+017F>ive and attractive Faculty of <U+017F>ome Part; yea and vehement attraction is advantaged by the highne<U+017F>s of Situation in motions Spiritual. Hence al<U+017F>o perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it is that Urins are <U+017F>omtimes black, when at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time this Humor is collected in the Ca<U+017F>es, in too great a quantity. Where al<U+017F>o may be often doubtle<U+017F>s, the <U+017F>eat of <U+017F>ome morbifick cau<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. And the rea<U+017F>on why melancholick per<U+017F>ons are thereby little pained, is becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of the Nerves, and the thickne<U+017F>s of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, do render the Sen<U+017F>e dull.

And therefore becau<U+017F>e a greater Bowel hath more Excrements then a le<U+017F><U+017F>er, the Conceptacle for the right kidney was to be larger, and that for the left le<U+017F><U+017F>er, and therefore the right <U+017F>ide Ca<U+017F>e is greater then the left <U+017F>ide, becau<U+017F>e the right kidney is greater then the left.

                  <hi>Their Situation.</hi> They run through many parts in their beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,<note place="margin">Their Situation.</note> and end. Their beginning is in the kidneys them<U+017F>elves, what ever <hi>Hofman, Riolanus, Laurenberg,</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> <U+017F>ay to the contrary; in which they ri<U+017F>e like Roots out of the Earth, and as a Vein out of the Liver. Nor does their <U+017F>imilitude with the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der move me; becau<U+017F>e, 1. The Nature of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is peculiar and di<U+017F>tinct from them both. 2. They are not much unlike the belly of the kidneys. 3. All Parts do carry with them the nature and colour of their Original, as we <U+017F>ee in the Aorta and the Cava. Nor does their cleaving fa<U+017F>t to the Bladder infer any thing, <U+017F>eeing the connexion is not greater there then in the kidneys, being conveniently <U+017F>eparable, between the Membrane of the Bladder and the Mu<U+017F>cle. And therefore this <hi>Original</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Original of the Ureters.</note> is in the kidneys, out of nine or ten little Pipes or Channels, to each of which the Caruncles afore<U+017F>aid are applied, though the Caruncles may be al<U+017F>o applied to their middle part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bored through. Now tho<U+017F>e Pipes go into fewer and greater branches, commonly into three, di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the upper, middle, and lower Region of the kidney. The<U+017F>e grow afterwards into one large Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which goes out of the flat <U+017F>ide of the kidney. The middle part, is the whole<note place="margin">Their Middle.</note> long-round Pipe or Channel, re<U+017F>ting upon the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Loins, between two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Peritonaeum, with which</p>
               <p>The Ureters <hi>are fa<U+017F>tned;</hi> above to the kidneys, below to the Bladder,<note place="margin">Their Connexion.</note> with the inner <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance whereof they make one continued Body, <U+017F>o that they cannot be pluckt away without breaking.

Hence it is, that the Bladder being blown up, will not admit <U+017F>o much as any wind. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> deny the<U+017F>e Valves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all other Anatomi<U+017F>ts. But though the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age be crooked, yet is it open enough. The Gut Colon is not a little wreathed, and the Ileon more then that, and yet they have a Valve affixed.

               <p>That which is in the middle, betwixt this proper and the outmo<U+017F>t Coat, is by others called the <U+017F>econd proper Membrane, which neverthele<U+017F>s they grant to be thick, and furni<U+017F>hed with fle<U+017F>hy Fibres.</p>
               <p>But it is rather a <hi>Mu<U+017F>cle</hi> encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the whole Bladder: becau<U+017F>e it hath Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres<note place="margin">The expul<U+017F>ive Mu<U+017F>cle of the Bladder.</note> vi<U+017F>ibly fle<U+017F>hy, in<U+017F>erted into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the bladder: So that, as the circular Mu<U+017F>cle called Sphincter, does cloze the bladder, that our water may not pa<U+017F>s from us again<U+017F>t our wills, <U+017F>o this Mu<U+017F>cle does help the voidance of our water, while<U+017F>t by contracting it <U+017F>elf, it <U+017F>queezes the bladder. And this is, indeed, the Opinion of my Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Aquapendent;</hi> the truth whereof <hi>Walaeus</hi> was wont thus to prove in the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of live Dogs: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cut off all the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Abdomen, he makes a <U+017F>mall piercing wound into the bladder, out of which wound or hole, the urin <U+017F>pins out as far, as naturally it does from the Yard: yet I <U+017F>hal not refu<U+017F>e to grant thus much to other Authors: Viz. that the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Abdomen or Belly, do al<U+017F>o help forward the Expul<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Urin. It ma es nothing again<U+017F>t us, that the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Guts, and Womb, have the like fle<U+017F>hy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane; for they al<U+017F>o did need <U+017F>uch an one, that they might more ea<U+017F>ily be widened and contracted. Hence, though the Membrane of the Bladder be more fle<U+017F>hy, yet in a large <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, the Membrane of the<U+017F>e other parts may likewi<U+017F>e be termed mu<U+017F>culous. But the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirituous blood, forcibly i<U+017F><U+017F>uing forth, and of a dull and lazie urin are different. Moreover, in the Veins, the precedent blood is forced on by that which follows, according to the Laws of Circulation, and the inbred Faculty.</p>

The Cau<U+017F>e hereof is hard to tell; <hi>Jaccbinus, Laurentius, Hofmannus,</hi> conceive that it comes to pa<U+017F>s by rea<U+017F>on of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Mind, which are joyned with fle<U+017F>hly Lu<U+017F>t. But Eunuchs al<U+017F>o are lu<U+017F>tful, for they are great Lovers of Women: And Eunuchs are often tran<U+017F>ported with anger and other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Mind, but they receive not never the more the Habit of Men. <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>eems to have been of Opinion, that a Spirit was bred in the Stones and diffu<U+017F>ed thence al the Body over. But glandulous Bodies of the number of which the Stones are, are unfit to engender an hot Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; nor are there any Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages about the Stones, for the di<U+017F>tribution of that new Spirit, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Galen.</hi> Nor is therefore the Opinion of <hi>Mercatus</hi> allowable, viz. that tho<U+017F>e Spirits are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bred there; but that the Vital Spirits are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Stones in great quantity, that from them they may return back into the whole Body; for tho<U+017F>e which are there collected, are collected to engender Seed. But the Opinion of <hi>Thomas a Vega</hi> does better plea<U+017F>e me, til I <U+017F>hall find a more probable, viz. that a Seminal Air is rai<U+017F>ed up in the Generation of Seed, which thus changes the whole Body. The fle<U+017F>h truly of ungelt Creatures, hath a rammi<U+017F>h ta<U+017F>t of the Seed, which the fle<U+017F>h of <U+017F>uch as are gelt hath not. This Vapor or Air of the Seed is carried to the Heart, either by the inner Pores of the Body, or by the Veins which reconveigh to the Heart the <U+017F>uperfluities of the generated Seed. <hi>Helmont</hi> imagines the Stones do act by a ruling power, at a di<U+017F>tance, as the <U+017F>tomach does upon the Womb, the Womb upon the upper Parts, and that without any right waies or marks; which neverthele<U+017F>s an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeks to find, if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. <hi>Ve<U+017F>tingus</hi> ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly makes the rea<U+017F>on of the change of voice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, <U+017F>trength, &amp;c. in per<U+017F>ons guelded, to be the oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of their inbred Heat by plenty of Matter, which ought to turn to Seed. Now their Sympathy with the Heart, depends partly upon the Nerves, partly (for we hold the Circulation in the Stones) from the fore<U+017F>aid Veins, returning back to the Heart, by which both the vertues of Cordials a<U+017F>cend, and of cooling Medicaments, even as we apply Cordials and Coolers to the Hands, with like <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s.</p>

               <p>Now there are other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which begin at the Stones, and end at the Root of the Yard, whither they carry and there <U+017F>quirt out the Seed, which hath been made in the Stones.

they ari<U+017F>e by continuation from the Seminary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, <U+017F>o that both the Praeparatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the Para<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, and the Out-carrying Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, are but one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body, receiving divers Names according to its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts, and their re<U+017F>pective Offices and Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Walaeus</hi> conceives, that it is more <U+017F>uitable to what appears in Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, to <U+017F>ay, that the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els do not ari<U+017F>e from the praeparatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mixed with them, fa<U+017F>tned to, and opened into them: and that as he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es, to the end that the blood forced in by the Praeparatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, may depo<U+017F>ite that Matter which it contains fit to breed <U+017F>eed, into the little branches of the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia.</hi> But the re<U+017F>t of the blood, which is unfit for Nutrition and Generation of Seed, is by other Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es <U+017F>hed into the Veins, and by Circulation returns to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Now they have their Original from the <U+017F>tones. by means of innumerable <U+017F>mall Pipes or white Fibres.

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Para<U+017F>tatae, is to perfect and fini<U+017F>h the <U+017F>eed, by a power which they<note place="margin">Their U<U+017F>e.</note> receive from the <U+017F>tones.

Before and behind they are flat, on the <U+017F>ides round.</p>
               <p>They are commonly as <hi>big</hi> as a Walnut.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is <U+017F>pongy, and yet harder and whiter then that of other Kernels, and they are covered with a thicker Membrane; all which is to hinder the ovlie <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, of it <U+017F>elf apt to run, from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out. And becau<U+017F>e they are of exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, therefore they cau<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure in Copulation. The<U+017F>e Kernels are open by certain Pores into the Urethra or Pi<U+017F>s-pipe, which is evidently apparent in <U+017F>uch as have died of the Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea, of which Gonorrhaea the<U+017F>e Pores being dilated are many times the <U+017F>eat.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to contain an oylie, <U+017F>lippery, and <U+017F>at Humor, which is pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed forth when need requires, to daub the Urinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, to defend it from the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <U+017F>eed or urin, and that it may not fall in through drine<U+017F>s, but may remain <U+017F>lippery; becau<U+017F>e through it in Copulation, the <U+017F>aid Humor does <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly flow out of the <U+017F>eed.</p>
               <p>This is that which <hi>Galen</hi> ment, when he <U+017F>aid that they contained a certain Humor like <U+017F>eed, but much thinner, the u<U+017F>e of which Humor, is to excite Lu<U+017F>t,

and to cau<U+017F>e Delight in Carnal Copulation.</p>
               <p>Mean while, <hi>Spigelius, Riolanus,</hi> and others do conceive that they contain<note place="margin">Whether the Pro<U+017F>tatae do make <U+017F>eed.</note> <U+017F>eed, which is there collected, and thence voided, having attained <U+017F>ome further perfection, as <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.

               <p>THe Genital Member of a Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<note place="margin">Its Names.</note> called in Latin <hi>Penis a penden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it hangs, al<U+017F>o <hi>Virga</hi> the Rod or Yard, <hi>Colis,</hi> &amp;c. Many other Names are wont to be put upon it, which are better pa<U+017F>t over then mentioned. In Engli<U+017F>h tis mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ually termed the <hi>Yard</hi> or <hi>Prick. Plato</hi> in his Timaeus compares it to a certain living Creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it hath an Appetite to Generation. Howbeit, it is indeed the Part and In<U+017F>trument of a Live-wight, and the Faculty of Appetite is <U+017F>eated in the Brain.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> at the Roots of <hi>Os pubis,</hi> that carnal Copulation might more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently<note place="margin">Situation.</note> be accompli<U+017F>hed, and that it might be no impediment to other parts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> it is placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, becau<U+017F>e only one in number. Yet there was once a man di<U+017F><U+017F>ected at <hi>Bononia</hi> who had two Yards. Which al<U+017F>o <hi>Ob<U+017F>equens</hi> relates of a Boy, among his Prodigies. Another named <hi>Anna,</hi> being lately a vagrant in <hi>Italy,</hi> had no Yard, but in<U+017F>tead thereof a certain piece of <U+017F>pongy fle<U+017F>h under his Navil, which Nature had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him to pi<U+017F>s withal.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is round and long; but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, becau<U+017F>e it is broader on the upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in thickne<U+017F>s and<note place="margin">Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</note> length, does vary, both in the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Animals, and in the Individual Creatures of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ort. <hi>Particularly,</hi> tis in Man <U+017F>o great as was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to propagate his <U+017F>pecies or kind: But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally <U+017F>horter then in many Brutes, becau<U+017F>e Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind couples after another manner then tho<U+017F>e bea<U+017F>ts do. In particular Men, there is exceeding great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. For it is for the mo<U+017F>t part greater then ordinary, 1. In little Men. 2. In <U+017F>uch as ab<U+017F>tain from carnal Embracements, if we beleive <hi>Galen.</hi> 3. If the Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trings be not tied clo<U+017F>e to the Navil in Infants; for otherwi<U+017F>e, by rea<U+017F>on of the Urachus or Pi<U+017F>s-pipe, the Bladder and neighboring Parts, are drawn more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Yet <hi>Spigelius</hi> is herein of a quite contrary mind. 4. In <U+017F>uch as have large No<U+017F>es. For the proportion of the Yard an<U+017F>wers that of the No<U+017F>e very much, if we will beleive Phy<U+017F>iognomi<U+017F>ts. 5. In Block-heads and dull-pated A<U+017F><U+017F>es. Some Nations have this Member larger then ordinary, as the Aethiopians or Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores.</p>
               <p>It con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of the Scarf-skin, Skin, fle<U+017F>hy Membrane, and a proper <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of its own.</p>
               <p>It is void of <hi>Fat,</hi> even in the fatte<U+017F>t<note place="margin">Why the Yard is void of Fat, the fir<U+017F>t Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Laurentius</hi> his Error.</note> men. And it is a great que<U+017F>tion why there is no Fat found either in it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Some, as <hi>Laurentius,</hi> think it is becau<U+017F>e fat through its <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s would hinder its erection: But the Yard will <U+017F>tand, as long as the Bodies thereof are blown up. Others make the Cau<U+017F>e to be lea<U+017F>t the weight thereof <U+017F>hould do hurt, and that the Yard might not grow too great. But if there were a little Fat, it would add nothing to the weight, nor would it enlarge the Yard over much. The truer Cau<U+017F>e therefore is this, that there is therefore no Fat, that its <U+017F>en<U+017F>e might not be dulled, and the plea<U+017F>ure of Copulation abated, when the Fat <U+017F>hould melt by rubbing the Yard.</p>
               <p>Its proper <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is not boney as it is in a Dog, a Wolf, a Fox, a Whale,<note place="margin">Its Sub<U+017F>tance.</note> &amp;c. but peculiar and proper to it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>uch as is no where to be found in any<note place="margin">The four Parts of the Yard.</note> other Part of the Body. Now there are four proper Parts of the Yard, the Urethra or Pi<U+017F>s-pipe, the Nut, and the two nervous Bodies.</p>
               <p>The URETHRA or Pi<U+017F>s-pipe, is a nervous<note place="margin">Urethra.</note> Pipe or Channel, alwaies of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ize, from the neck of the bladder (to which it is joyned, but does not ari<U+017F>e therefrom, nor communicate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) like a long neck, to the End of the Yard; <U+017F>ave where the Nut is joyned with the nervous Bodies.

In which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tis wonderful what <hi>Ve<U+017F>tingus</hi> told me him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>aw, viz. that in young Boys it grows out <U+017F>o long and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it re<U+017F>embles a tayl. <hi>Hildanus</hi> ob<U+017F>erved it in a certain per<U+017F>on very great and fle<U+017F>hy. At the lower end it is tied to the Nut by a Membrane or Band termed <hi>Fraenum</hi> the Bridle, which is terminated in the hole of the Nut. Some will have it to be made up of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Nerves. <hi>Carolus Stephanus</hi> thinks it is compo<U+017F>ed of a Combination of the Tendons of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Yard, and a Nerve.</p>
               <p>The <hi>two nervous Bodies,</hi> on each <U+017F>ide<note place="margin">The nervous Bodies.</note> one, do make up the remaining and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t part of the Yard: the whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance whereof is like a mo<U+017F>t thick <U+017F>pungy Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <U+017F>tuffed with fle<U+017F>h.</p>
               <p>For the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance thereof is twofold, the fir<U+017F>t exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, compact, hard, and nervous; the other internal, <U+017F>pungy, thin, and hollow, and of a dark-red colour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to black; and therefore <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> <U+017F>aies tis filled with a great deal of black Blood, like a Pudding.</p>

               <p>The<U+017F>e two Bodies have their Original from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer parts of the Hip-bones, as from a firm and <U+017F>table Foundation, to which they are <U+017F>trongly tied with two Ligaments; where in their Ri<U+017F>e they keep <U+017F>ome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, that place may be allowed to the Urethra; and then they are carried upwards, and grow into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Share-bone (like the two horns of the letter y) but <U+017F>o as they do not both remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but they loo<U+017F>e near a third part of their nervous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Howbeit they remain di<U+017F>tinct, by the coming between of <U+017F>ome membranous partition (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not of a double Membrane, as at the Ri<U+017F>e of the Bodies, but of one <U+017F>ingle one) very thin and tran<U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <U+017F>trengthned with nervous and <U+017F>trong tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres; which fibres are ranked and ordered like a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Comb.</p>
               <p>All kind of <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> enter into the Yard, <hi>Nerves, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arteries. 1.

               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to widen the lower part of the Pi<U+017F>s-pipe, both in pi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, and e<U+017F>pecially in Copulation, when the bodies of the Yard are full, that the Egre<U+017F>s of the Seed may not be hindred.

For by rea<U+017F>on of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e of Heat, they are contracted after a woman is pa<U+017F>t fourteen, whereas they are before that time di<U+017F>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more largely being full of a white Juyce.</item>

               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to make <U+017F>eed which helps to generate after its way and manner: which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> again<U+017F>t all Rea<U+017F>on and Experience, was bold to deny to women, in <U+017F>ome places of his Writings, contrary to the expre<U+017F>s Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates de Genitura,</hi> where he tells us that women al<U+017F>o <U+017F>end forth <U+017F>eed out of their Bodies, <U+017F>omtimes into their womb, whereby it is moi<U+017F>tned, and <U+017F>omtimes without, if the Orifice thereof do gape over much. Now that in the Womb it helps to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he thereby demon<U+017F>trates, in that if after Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. The woman <U+017F>hal not conceive, the <U+017F>eed which they have both of them voided, does flow out of the womb. But <U+017F>ome other Anatomi<U+017F>ts deny that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones do make <U+017F>eed. But they will have them to be meet Kernels, to receive that moi<U+017F>ture which needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the womb, which is the Opinion of <hi>Cremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> or that they are only made for a mark and <U+017F>ign, which was the Conceits of <hi>Rhodiginus,</hi> and of <hi>Hofman</hi> <U+017F>ince him, who account them rather Carca<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>tones then true <U+017F>tones, becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>mall, void of Juyce, and uncompact. But as for what concerns Humidity we deny that Argument, and <U+017F>ay 1. That there was no need of <U+017F>o much preparation to water the womb. One Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el gently carrying a wheyi<U+017F>h Humor, might have <U+017F>erved that turn, yea the Pores alone might have <U+017F>ufficed, as it is well known to happen in a clammy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor di<U+017F>tilling into the Knee. 2. They may an<U+017F>wer both Intents, viz. Generation and Irrigation. 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us that <U+017F>eed and no other humor hath i<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ued out of the <U+017F>tones of women being di<U+017F><U+017F>ected. <hi>Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius</hi> was hindred in his Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, by the plentiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thereof. The nocturnal pollutions of women te<U+017F>tifie the <U+017F>ame, and women became barren, when in ancient times they were guelded or <U+017F>payed, Witne<U+017F>s <hi>Athenaeus. Galen</hi> experimented the <U+017F>ame in Sows. <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> writes that Cows being guelt, do conceive if they go to Bull pre<U+017F>ently after. 4. The <U+017F>aid <U+017F>eed is found in the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of women, if they are lu<U+017F>ty and free from D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

he hath expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by a neat Picture. 5. That it is true <U+017F>eed, we may gather from a real and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible effect thereof, like that of the <U+017F>eed of men, as Moles, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Eggs, by rea<U+017F>on of the difference of Sex, to which the Male adds Life and Perfection. 6. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have <U+017F>ufficient heat to make <U+017F>eed, and <U+017F>ufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments to that end; yea, and <U+017F>ome of them are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided then men. Their <U+017F>tones are indeed <U+017F>mal and little, but not void of Juyce.

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> conceives that the former is only in<U+017F>erted into the <U+017F>ides of the womb, which are termed <hi>Cornua,</hi> or the wombs horns, and other Anatomi<U+017F>ts are of the <U+017F>ame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who profe<U+017F>s they could find no other In<U+017F>erti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els is, partly to carry the <U+017F>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter to the Trumpets, that it may be there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompli<U+017F>hed, and better wrought, and re<U+017F>erved for further u<U+017F>e, and partly to the bottom of the womb.

               <p>The other <hi>deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,</hi> which ought to keep the Seed before it be <U+017F>quirted out, is the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of <hi>the Womb,</hi> by <hi>Fallopius</hi> <U+017F>o called, from the likene<U+017F>s it hath to a Trumpet of War, which he thus de<U+017F>cribes. There ari<U+017F>es a <U+017F>eminal Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, <U+017F>mall and very <U+017F>trait, nervous, and white, from the Horn of the womb it <U+017F>elf, and when it hath gone a little therefrom, it grows broader by little and little, and cri<U+017F>ps it <U+017F>elf like the tendrel of a Vine, till it comes towards the end. Then di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing its wrinkled Cri<U+017F>pations, and becoming very broad, it <hi>ends</hi> into a certain Extremity, which <U+017F>eems membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and fle<U+017F>hy, by rea<U+017F>on of its red Colour, and at la<U+017F>t becomes very torn and ragged, like the jagged ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of worn clouts, and hath a large hole, which lies alwaies <U+017F>hut, tho<U+017F>e jagged ends alwaies falling in upon it, which neverthele<U+017F>s if they be diligently opened and widened, they repre<U+017F>ent the broad end of a brazen Trumpet.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hall handle the Particulars more di<U+017F>tinctly. The <hi>Trumpets ari<U+017F>e</hi> from the bottom of the womb by one end, nor do they reach with their other end to the Stones, or any other remarkable Part. And therefore they are not manife<U+017F>tly pa<U+017F><U+017F>able in this other Part, but <U+017F>hut up and blind, <U+017F>o that they are like the <hi>Inte<U+017F>tinum caecum,</hi> and are as it were an Appendix of the Womb. But this <U+017F>hutting up may be made according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Fallopius,</hi> which <hi>Riolanus</hi> who was <U+017F>ince him, challenges for his own, by the fringes and jagged ends of the Trumpets, falling together, like Raggs of Cloath.</p>
               <p>They are two in <hi>Number,</hi> on each <U+017F>ide one.</p>
               <p>They are <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> <U+017F>o as to compa<U+017F>s half the Stones, but they are di<U+017F>tant from the Stones, on every <U+017F>ide, near half a fingers breadth, unle<U+017F>s the womb be di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, by which they are drawn up nearer to the Stones. They are ordinarily fa<U+017F>tned only by very thin Membranes, not unlike the wings of Bats or Flitter-mice, through which many Veins and Arteries are di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Stones into the<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and carrying Seed out of the Stones.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is nervous, white, thick and hard.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Figure</hi> is round and hollow. Somtimes their Cavity <U+017F>o praeternaturally widened, as to contain a Mole, which <hi>Marquardus</hi> relates in his <hi>Empirica Praxi;</hi> <U+017F>omtimes a Child, Examples whereof are recited by <hi>Riolanus.</hi> Nor could he <U+017F>ee any other waies for the mans <U+017F>eed to enter, <U+017F>ave the turning and winding Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages of tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.

               <p>The <hi>Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age</hi> therefore of the Trumpets, is not in all parts <U+017F>traight, but winding, becau<U+017F>e the way is <U+017F>hort from the <U+017F>tones to the womb. But the plea<U+017F>ure ought not to be <U+017F>hort, when the <U+017F>eed is poured plentifully out of the <U+017F>tones into the horns of the womb in Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And look what the <hi>Seed-bladders</hi> are in Men, as to pre<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>eed, the<U+017F>e blind pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages may be the <U+017F>ame in Women, when they couple oftentimes, and <U+017F>til void <U+017F>eed. For they may be <U+017F>o termed, becau<U+017F>e they are annexed to the <U+017F>tones by little Membranes, that by Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els brought to them from the <U+017F>tones, as by the milkie and me<U+017F>araick Veins, they may ea<U+017F>ily draw the <U+017F>eed by them concocted, and lay it up within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves for future occa<U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>end it forth when need requires.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, 1. According to <hi>Fallopius</hi> to <U+017F>erve as Chimneys, by which the <U+017F>ooty vapors of the womb may exhale. Which I for my part cannot believe. For the <U+017F>ooty Vapors are conden<U+017F>ed, and being re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into water, are re<U+017F>erved till the time of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, or a<U+017F>cend by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Pores, or breath out at the mouth of the womb, both in Women with Child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the mouth of the womb is never <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut as to hinder, as the Examples of Superfoetation te<U+017F>tifie, as in <U+017F>uch as are not with Child. Nor can I wel tel how the <U+017F>ooty vapors <U+017F>hould find way through the<U+017F>e croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages. 2. According to the <U+017F>aid <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Ob<U+017F>ervations, they make <U+017F>eed, becau<U+017F>e he alwaies found <U+017F>eed in them, but never <U+017F>aw any in the <U+017F>tones; to which I an<U+017F>wered before. 3. Their true U<U+017F>e is, to draw <U+017F>eed out of the <U+017F>tones, by blind pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed through the Membrane, and when it is drawn to perfect the <U+017F>ame by <U+017F>ome tarriance in the Tendrels and Cells, by the irradiation of the vertue of the <U+017F>tones; that it may be more fit for a Child to be made of; finally to carry it to the womb, e<U+017F>pecially in the Act of Copulation, by tho<U+017F>e little Pipes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Horns of the womb, that it may meet the mans <U+017F>eed in the Cavity of the womb or its Neck, to cau<U+017F>e Conception.</p>

               <p>THe Womb is by the Latins termed <hi>Uterus,</hi> from <hi>Uter</hi> a Bottle by rea<U+017F>on of its hollowne<U+017F>s, in which Sen<U+017F>e <hi>Tacitus</hi> does u<U+017F>e <hi>Uterum Navis</hi> for the Keel of a Ship. <hi>I<U+017F>idorus</hi> <U+017F>aies tis <U+017F>o called, becau<U+017F>e tis on each <U+017F>ide one: in a more large <U+017F>ignification tis termed <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the <hi>Dige<U+017F>ts</hi> and <hi>In<U+017F>titutes.</hi> Al<U+017F>o tis called <hi>Matrix, Utriculus,</hi> and <hi>Loci muliebres,</hi> where con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Generation, according to <hi>Varro.</hi> In other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> tis termed <hi>Vulva,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially in Sows, which the ancient Romans did account a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Di<U+017F>h: Of which <U+017F>ee <hi>Plutrach,</hi> and <hi>Langius</hi> in his Epi<U+017F>tles, al<U+017F>o <hi>Martial, Horace, Apitius, Athenaeus,</hi> and among late Writers <hi>Ca<U+017F>tellanus. Hofman</hi> conceives that <hi>Vulva</hi> is corrupted from <hi>Bulga,</hi> and <hi>Bulga</hi> a Word u<U+017F>ed by <hi>Lucilius</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> is originally French, if we believe <hi>Fe<U+017F>tus,</hi> who renders it a Bag. <hi>Nonius</hi> interprets it to be a Satchel or Knap<U+017F>ack hanging about a Mans Arm. See hereof <hi>Vo<U+017F><U+017F>ius.</hi> But the term <hi>Vulva</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Cel<U+017F>us,</hi> and the Authors formerly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>It is <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> in the Hypoga<U+017F>trium, or<note place="margin">Why the womb is placed in the Hypoga<U+017F>trium.</note> the lower Part of the lower Belly, which is framed in the Cavity termed <hi>Pelvis,</hi> by the <hi>Os<U+017F>acrum</hi> and the Flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. And therefore that <hi>Pelvis</hi> or Ba<U+017F>in, is larger in Women: and therefore they have Buttocks greater and wider. Now it was requi<U+017F>ite that it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o placed, that the Womb might be di<U+017F>tended according to the greatne<U+017F>s of the Child, and that the Child might be conveniently excluded.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Womb is placed in the middle incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to no <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>ave <U+017F>omtimes when a Woman is of Child with a Boy or a Girl: for then the Child lies more to the right or left <U+017F>ide, though that be no certain Rule.</p>
               <p>Now it lies between the <hi>Inte<U+017F>tinum rectum</hi> or Ar<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut, which is beneath it, and the Bladder which lies upon it, as between two Pillows. Why therefore <U+017F>hould we be proud who are bred between Dung and Urin?</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> is con<U+017F>idered in length<note place="margin">Its Magnitude.</note> depth, and thickne<U+017F>s, and all the<U+017F>e vary in re<U+017F>pect of Bodies, Age, and Venery.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Length</hi> in tho<U+017F>e of a middle <U+017F>tature, who u<U+017F>e Venery, from the external Privity to the bottoms end, is commonly eleven fingers; the bottom is three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Breadth</hi> of the bottom, is two or three fingers, becau<U+017F>e in Women not with Child the latitude of the bottom and neck is one and the <U+017F>ame. And hence the amplitude may ea<U+017F>ily be conjectured.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Virgins,</hi> which have not attained to ripene<U+017F>s of Age, it is little and le<U+017F>s then the Bladder: in <U+017F>uch as are full of Age it is greater: yet if they ab<U+017F>tain from Venery it is <U+017F>mall enough, though thick, as it is al<U+017F>o in very old Women. But it is greater in <U+017F>uch as have oft conceived, and bore Children: that a man may well near gra<U+017F>p it in his hand, unle<U+017F>s when the Women are great with Child: for then it is more and more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and whereas before Gravidation, the bottom of the Womb did not pa<U+017F>s beyond the beginning of <hi>Os<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> it reaches afterward to the Navil and beyond, <U+017F>o that it re<U+017F>ts upon the thin Guts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>thickne<U+017F>s</hi> of the Womb does va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Whether the womb becomes thinner in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child.</note> after the <U+017F>ame manner. For in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance thereof is thin, in grown per<U+017F>ons thick; and by how much a Woman hath been oftner with Child, by <U+017F>o much is the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of her womb the thicker. When the Cour<U+017F>es flow, the womb grows thick; and when the voidance of the Cour<U+017F>es is at hand, the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the womb appears <U+017F>welling and thick.

The Womb does then <U+017F>o far depart from a membranous Sub<U+017F>tance, and becomes red, and of a fungous and <U+017F>pungie Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, and full of holes like a Pumice-<U+017F>tone, divi<U+017F>ible as it were into many Barks and Shells: which happens becau<U+017F>e of the plentiful Afflux of Blood and Spirits for the Child. Touching both Opinion <hi>Falcobergius</hi> thus judges; that the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Womb does indeed become more thin, as he ob<U+017F>erved in Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of Women with Child; but that it <U+017F>eemed thicker, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Womb-liver does grow exceeding clo<U+017F>e ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that this might deceive many. But <hi>Nicolas Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> <U+017F>aies, that in the womb of a Woman with Child, he hath <U+017F>eparated the Womb-liver from the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, and that he hath found the Membrane to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thick. Which may very well be, for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane being <U+017F>pungie, drinks in the affluent moi<U+017F>ture of the womb, and puts on a thicker condition of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance. If at any time it happen to be praeternaturally thin, either through defect of Humor, or through much Di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion, it is ea<U+017F>ily broken. And <hi>Salmuth</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved as much in a Childbed woman, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>trong Forcers.

But Superfoetation, whether in the womb or without, depends from the virtue of the womb, reaching all over the whole Body thereof.</p>
               <p>The womb is therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to pre<U+017F>erve the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or kind.

               <p>Moreover another action of the womb is <U+017F>aid to be a certain Natural motion:<note place="margin">The wombs motion.</note> whence <hi>Plate</hi> would have the womb to be a certain <hi>Animal</hi> or Live-wight, and <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> <U+017F>aies it is an Animal in an Animal, becau<U+017F>e of its motion.

But the<U+017F>e things favor of the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> who improperly did compare the womb to a living Creature. Whence that fury proceeds, I have already declared. As for what that <U+017F>ame Novelli<U+017F>t <hi>Helmont</hi> <U+017F>aies, that it lives many times, and keeps a coile after a woman is dead, no man will ea<U+017F>ily believe it. For its life depends upon the life of the whole Body; and if it <U+017F>tir after death, either that motion proceeds from winds, or from a Child <U+017F>eeking its way out, after the Mother is dead, as <U+017F>undry Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples demon<U+017F>trate. <hi>Sphinx Theologico-Philo<U+017F>ophica,</hi> tells us that the Mother being dead, a Child <U+017F>uddenly i<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of her womb, and cried lu<U+017F>tily. After which manner <hi>Laurentius</hi> de<U+017F>cribes the Birth of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Manilius. Eberus</hi> hath two Examples of a Child born after the Mothers death, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Johannes Matthaeus,</hi> and the like ca<U+017F>es are fre<U+017F>h in the memory of many here at <hi>Hafnia.</hi> But in oppo<U+017F>ition to <hi>Winchlerus, Sperlingerus,</hi> and others that deny it, we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, 1. That the Child mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be <U+017F>trong. 2. That the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mothers womb mu<U+017F>t be large. 3.

                  <hi>Chap. XXIX.</hi> Of the Bottom of the Womb, and its Mouth.</head>
               <p>WEE have treated hitherto of<note place="margin">See Tab. XXVII.</note> the Womb in General, and its <U+017F>imilar Parts. The <hi>di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts</hi> follow, into which we have divided the <U+017F>ame: viz. the <hi>Bottom,</hi> the <hi>Neck,</hi> and the <hi>Privity,</hi> with the Parts annexed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fundus</hi> or Bottom of the womb, is that part which reaches from the internal Orifice to the End up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. We divide it into the lower and narrower part and the larger upper part; to which we ad a third part viz. the Mouth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lower and narrow</hi> part, is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mouth of the womb, and<note place="margin">The <U+017F>hort Neck of the womb.</note> the beginning, largene<U+017F>s thereof, and it may be called the <U+017F>hort Neck, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it from the true and long Neck. For before the widene<U+017F>s of the womb begins, between it and the inner Mouth, there interceeds another Neck as it were, or narrower Channel, then the largene<U+017F>s of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and this is ob<U+017F>erved both in Man and Bea<U+017F>t. And <hi>Fallopius</hi> is of Opinion, that this part was called the Neck of the womb by the Ancients, as <hi>Galen, Soranus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pinaeus</hi> reckons this part to be as long as a mans thumb, I have ob<U+017F>erved it to be five fingers breadth, long in a Doe.</p>
               <p>The Cavity hereof is not large, but <U+017F>uch as will admit a Probe or large Quil.<note place="margin">Some Cau<U+017F>e of Barrenne<U+017F>s.</note> It is rough, lea<U+017F>t the Seed which hath been drawn in, <U+017F>hould flow out again, as happens in <U+017F>ome barren women, which have this part <U+017F>lippery, by rea<U+017F>on of bad Humors. This roughne<U+017F>s ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es from wrinkles, which according to the Ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pinaeus,</hi> have their Roots <U+017F>ituate beneath, and their Edg tending inwards or upwards, that they may ea<U+017F>ily admit, hardly let go any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>large</hi> and <hi>upper Part</hi> is chiefly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Fundus</hi> or the Bottom, and this Part<note place="margin">The Bottom.</note> is properly called the Womb or <hi>Matrix,</hi> and it is the principal Part for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake the re<U+017F>t were made, being wider and larger then the re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>It is <U+017F>eated above the <hi>Os pubis</hi> or Share-bone, that it may be there dilated and widened.</p>
               <p>The womb hath in a woman only one Cavity, not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">No Cavities or Cells in the womb of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> Cells, as <U+017F>ome fal<U+017F>ly attribute ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <U+017F>even Cells. In Brutes it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided into two parts, and therefore tho<U+017F>e parts are called the two Horns of the womb: though the<note place="margin">Why Horns are <U+017F>aid to be in the wombs of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> form of Horns is not con<U+017F>picuous in all Brutes, but in Cows, Does, Sheep, Goats, &amp;c. Howbeit in imitation thereof, Authors have attributed horns to the wombs of women, becau<U+017F>e on the <U+017F>ides of the bottom thereof, there is on each <U+017F>ide <U+017F>ome protuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, where the deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are in<U+017F>erted. But the womb of a woman is very <U+017F>eldom divided into two parts, as it is in Bea<U+017F>ts, as it hath been ob<U+017F>erved in <U+017F>ome by the <hi>Brother</hi> of <hi>Baubinus, Sylvius, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Ob<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens</hi> before them. And I doubt whether their wombs be <U+017F>o divided, who bear two or more Children at a Birth. The la<U+017F>t year many women at <hi>Hafnia</hi> bore Twins contrary to their cu<U+017F>tom, yea and <U+017F>ome three Children at a Birth, which they never did before nor <U+017F>ince. We mu<U+017F>t not therefore account that to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Families, or attribute the <U+017F>ame to the wombs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing double, which properly belongs to the Seed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o that they are not conceived in a double womb, the womb-cake te<U+017F>tifies, which alone is <U+017F>ufficient for many Children, only it hath <U+017F>o many <U+017F>trings fa<U+017F>tned to it in <U+017F>everal places, as there are Children, as <hi>Be<U+017F>terus</hi> hath lately de<U+017F>cribed it in a like Hi<U+017F>tory.</p>
               <p>Yet is it divided into the right and left part. In the former Boys are for the mo<U+017F>t part ingendred: in the latter Girls. And it <U+017F>eldom happens otherwi<U+017F>e, if we believe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> Hunters have this <U+017F>ign whereby they known whether the Bea<U+017F>t they hunt have a male or female in her belly, for if when <U+017F>he is <U+017F>truck dead, <U+017F>he fall on her right <U+017F>ide, they conclude <U+017F>he is big of a Male, becau<U+017F>e the burthen <U+017F>he goes with is mo<U+017F>t weighty on the right <U+017F>ide; if on the left <U+017F>he fall, they judg it is a Female. Tis reported that women with child of a Boy, do lift their right foot higher then their left, as they walk, as <hi>Salmuth</hi> gives us to under<U+017F>tand, all which <U+017F>igns are neverthele<U+017F>s fallacious. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and his followers do reckon other <U+017F>igns, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this place.</p>
               <p>The right and left <U+017F>ide are differenced by a Line or Seam which <U+017F>ticks up ob<U+017F>curely, which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> termes the Median Line. The like Line is <U+017F>een in the lower Belly under the Navil, dividing that Region into two parts, which they conceive to be then more vi<U+017F>ible, when women bear twins. But in <U+017F>ome women with child I have <U+017F>een this Line manife<U+017F>t, who bore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards only one Child.</p>
               <p>The outward Surface is <U+017F>mooth and even, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as it were with a watry Humor. The inner part hath many Poro<U+017F>ities, which are Mouths, through which in the time of a womans going with child, blood ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the Veins of the womb to nouri<U+017F>h the Infant.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to receive the Seed, contain the Child, nouri<U+017F>h it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Orifice or inner Mouth of the womb</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The inner O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the womb.</note> is oblong, and tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e, but very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (but when it gapes, it is round and orbicular, which is perhaps the cau<U+017F>e why the German Midwives call it the Ro<U+017F>e, and the French Midwives, the Crown of the Mother) like the Hole of the Nut of the Yard, that no hurtful thing may enter in, nor the Seed drawn thither, ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F>s out. If at any time it fall out of the Privity, or be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in<U+017F>ide out, it re<U+017F>embles exactly the Mouth of a Tench.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Situation</hi> thereof be changed, <U+017F>o that it be not ju<U+017F>t in the middle, looking towardst he bottom, tis conceived a Man cannot <U+017F>quirt his Seed thereinto, and that the Seed will <U+017F>ooner flow back, then the woman conceive. If it be quite ab<U+017F>ent, which <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom falls out, an uncurable Barrenne<U+017F>s<note place="margin">Some Cau<U+017F>es of Barrenne<U+017F>s.</note> is thereby cau<U+017F>ed. As al<U+017F>o Barrenne<U+017F>s is cau<U+017F>ed, if it be otherwi<U+017F>e affected, viz. with Cancers, <U+017F>cirrhous Tumors, Ob<U+017F>tructions, Callo<U+017F>ity, over much Fatne<U+017F>s: e<U+017F>pecially through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much Humectation and Relaxation, either through over much Copulation as in Whores, or through too great a Flux of Humors.</p>
               <p>In women with child a glewi<U+017F>h clammy Matter grows to the Orifice, and fills the <U+017F>hort Neck well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near; that the<U+017F>e Parts being moi<U+017F>tned, may more ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be opened in the time of Travel.</p>
               <p>Within the Channel of this Mouth to the lower part thereof, grows its little bunch, which does more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41352:40"/>
He al<U+017F>o informs us that about this little bunch, there are to be <U+017F>een Pores or little Holes, which <U+017F>eem to be the ends of the deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, ending at the Neck. <hi>Columbus</hi> found tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els implanted like the teeth of a comb, full of Blood.</p>
               <p>By this Orifice, the womb draws the Seed into it, which being conceived, it is<note place="margin">The U<U+017F>e of the Orifice of the womb</note> <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>hut <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that the point of a needle cannot enter. And therefore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians do vainly <U+017F>quirt Liquors thereinto with a Syringe, and Whores endeavor in<note place="margin">When the Mouth of the womb is opened.</note> vain to draw out the Conception. But it is opened in Superfoetation, in the Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a bad Conception without hurt to the Child, which <U+017F>omtimes happens in the Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Seed, but it is e<U+017F>pecially opened after a wonderful manner at the time of Child-birth, when it ought to be widened according to the greatne<U+017F>s of the Child, <U+017F>o that the widene<U+017F>s is in a manner equal from the bottom of the womb to the Privity, whereout the Child pa<U+017F><U+017F>es. And this <U+017F>aies <hi>Galen</hi> we may wonder at, but we cannot under<U+017F>tand. And he admoni<U+017F>hes us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occa<U+017F>ion, that it is our duty to acknowledg the Wi<U+017F>edom and Power of him that made us. But this Orifice as well as the womb, does chiefly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of wrinkled Membranes, which being <U+017F>moothed out, will admit of unimaginable Dilatation.</p>

               <p>IN the Bottom of the Womb we have<note place="margin">See Tab.

The <hi>Neck</hi> it <U+017F>elf, the <hi>Hymen,</hi> and the <hi>Mouth of the Bladder.</hi> Of the Hymen we <U+017F>hall treat in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Neck</hi> or Channel of the womb, is by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omtimes called <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the Door of the Womb, <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls it <hi>Sinus pudoris,</hi> the Privity. It is a long Channel, being hollow even when the Child is in the womb, admitting both a Probe and a mans finger, as may be <U+017F>een in <U+017F>uch as are new born.</p>
               <p>It is <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> between the external and the internal Mouth, receiving the Yard like a <U+017F>heath.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure.</hi> The Neck is <U+017F>omwhat writhen and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, al<U+017F>o it is <U+017F>horter and <U+017F>traiter, when it is loo<U+017F>e, and fals together; that the internal parts may not be refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated. But it is <U+017F>traight and widened 1. In carnal Copulation. 2. In the monthly Flux. 3. In the time of Child-birth, when it is exceedingly <U+017F>tretched according to the Shape of the Child; whence al<U+017F>o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the exceeding great pains of women in travel: and then as al<U+017F>o during their Cour<U+017F>es, women are very much cooled.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude.</hi> The length thereof is eight fingers breadth commonly, or <U+017F>even; <U+017F>o as to be as long as a Mans longe<U+017F>t finger. It is as wide as the <hi>Inte<U+017F>tinum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> or Ar<U+017F>e-gut. But the longitude and latitude of this part are <U+017F>o various, that it is hard to de<U+017F>cribe them. For in carnal Copulation, it accommodates it <U+017F>elf to the length of the Yard, and this Neck becomes longer or <U+017F>horter, broader, or narrower, and <U+017F>wells <U+017F>undry waies according to the lu<U+017F>t of the woman. And when that happens, the Caruncles <U+017F>well with Spirits which fill them, as appears in Cows and Bitche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> de<U+017F>ire Copulation; but the Channel is made narrower and le<U+017F>s, as al<U+017F>o in the Act of Generation, that it may more clo<U+017F>e embrace the Yard: and therefore its</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is of an hard and nervous fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <U+017F>pungy, like the Yard; that it may be widened and contracted within, the upper part is wrinkled, when it is not di<U+017F>tended, but<note place="margin">Wrinkles in the Neck of the womb.</note> being widened, it is more <U+017F>lippery and <U+017F>mooth. Howbeit in the Neck of the womb al<U+017F>o when it is di<U+017F>tended, there are many orbicular wrinkles in the beginning of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel near the Privity, mo<U+017F>t of all in the fore part next the Bladder, le<U+017F>s towards the Inte<U+017F>tinum rectum on which it re<U+017F>ts; and they <U+017F>erve for the greater Titillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cau<U+017F>ed by the rubbing of the Nut of the Yard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the <U+017F>aid wrinkles. And in young Maids the<U+017F>e wrinkles are <U+017F>traiter, and the Neck narrower, through which the Men<U+017F>trual blood is voided; al<U+017F>o in grown per<U+017F>ons that are yet Virgins. But the wrinkles are worn out, and the <U+017F>ides become callous, by rea<U+017F>on of frequent rubbing, 1. In old women. 2. In <U+017F>uch as have u<U+017F>ed much Copulation, or have frequently bore Children. 3. In tho<U+017F>e that have been troubled with a long Flux of the Cour<U+017F>es, or of the Whites. And in all the<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance does al<U+017F>o become harder, <U+017F>o that it becomes at la<U+017F>t gri<U+017F>tley, as it were old women, and <U+017F>uch as have born many Children. But in young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, it is more <U+017F>oft and delicate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Neck is to receive the Yard being rai<U+017F>ed, and to draw out the Seed.</p>
               <p>Finally, beyond the middle towards<note place="margin">The Orifice of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> the end of the Neck, in the fore and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, not far from the Privity, comes the <hi>In<U+017F>ertion of the Bladder</hi> into <U+017F>ight, that the Urin may there be voided by the common Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. It is as long as a knucle of ones finger, without fle<U+017F>hy, or rather covered with a fle<U+017F>hy Sphincter. <hi>Pinaeus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves that it is black within, of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance with the Pi<U+017F>s-pipe in Men, as any man may <U+017F>ee, now <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> that told us <U+017F>o.</p>

Younger Virgins have more pain and le<U+017F>s Flux of blood, becau<U+017F>e of the drine<U+017F>s of the Hymen and the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; but tho<U+017F>e that are older, and have had their Cour<U+017F>es, have le<U+017F>s pain and greater flux of blood, for the contrary cau<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>But if her Cour<U+017F>es flow, or have flowed a little before: the Yard is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily<note place="margin">An Exception.</note> admitted, by rea<U+017F>on of the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tho<U+017F>e Parts, whence there is little or no pain, and little or no flux of blood.

               <p>I. The <hi>Arabians</hi> <U+017F>ay the Hymen is<note place="margin">The <hi>I.</hi> Opinion of the Arabians.</note> a piece formed of five Veins at the middle of the Neck of the womb, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erted on either <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>o that the Mouths of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide Veins are joyned with tho<U+017F>e on the left.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e are Fancies.</p>
               <p>II. Others (among whom are <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Ulmus</hi>) do <U+017F>ay that the<note place="margin">The <hi>II.</hi> Opinion.</note> <U+017F>ides of the Neck grow together, and when they are <U+017F>eparated and widened, the Veins are broken which run in tho<U+017F>e Parts. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Experience, which witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that in little Girls the Neck hath its Cavity, nor do the <U+017F>ides there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <U+017F>tick together.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Others</hi> <U+017F>ay it is a tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Membrane.<note place="margin">The <hi>III.</hi> Opinion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And herein they are right. But they are deceived, who have feigned it to have Holes in it like a Seive, and placed it in the lowe<U+017F>t end of the Neck: through which they would have the Urin to be voided.</p>
               <p>IV. The newe<U+017F>t Opinion of all, is that of <hi>Severinus Pinaeus,</hi> a mo<U+017F>t<note place="margin">The <hi>IV.</hi> Opinion.</note> expert Surgeon of <hi>Paris,</hi> who hath wrote an whole Book of the Notes of Virginity, not unprofitable to be read. Now he accounts the four Myrtle-<U+017F>hap'd Caruncles to be the Hymen, tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <U+017F>mall Membrane, placed in the outer part of the neck of the womb; of which hereafter. And <U+017F>ome learned men are at this day of his Opinion, as <hi>Bauhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> for one. I could find no other in a young Girl, lately di<U+017F><U+017F>ected in this place.</p>
               <p>V. The more common Opinion is, that the Hymen is a tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<note place="margin">The <hi>V.</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <U+017F>trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by many Authors.</note> going athwart the neck of the womb, a little above the Neck of the Bladder, which re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the fir<U+017F>t Entrance of the Yard. And many Experiments and Authorities <U+017F>tand up for this Opinion. And in the fir<U+017F>t place of four mo<U+017F>t renowned Anatomi<U+017F>ts, of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua, Ve<U+017F>alius, Fallopius, Aquapendent,</hi> and <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>erius.</hi> And all Antiquity had <U+017F>ome knowledg hereof.

Columbus</hi> and <hi>Sebizius</hi> did three times find it, <hi>Baubinus</hi> twice, as he averrs in his Book of the <U+017F>imilar Parts, and <hi>Wolfius</hi> <U+017F>eems in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions to a<U+017F><U+017F>ent thereunto, who witne<U+017F><U+017F>es that he found it at <hi>Padua. Adrianus Spigelius</hi> affirms that he found it in all the Virgins that ever he did cut up, and I my <U+017F>elf and <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus</hi> at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>aw it at <hi>Padua.</hi> Nor is it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to bring all the Authorities which might be had in this <U+017F>ubject to this place.</p>

Or if they di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ected young Virgins, they through wantonne<U+017F>s do <U+017F>omtimes with their fingers break the <U+017F>aid Skin or Membrane. But if they <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay they did cut up abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Births, Girls of two or three years old &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer tis incredible that the Hymen <U+017F>hould be wanting in <U+017F>uch, <U+017F>eeing the Authorities and Experiences of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anatomi<U+017F>ts forecited, are again<U+017F>t it. Again, if in <U+017F>ome by them di<U+017F><U+017F>ected, it was wanting; by the <U+017F>ame right that they <U+017F>ay this Membrane is praeternaturally pre<U+017F>ent, we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay it was praeternaturally ab<U+017F>ent. For it is <U+017F>eldom ab<U+017F>ent, and for the mo<U+017F>t part pre<U+017F>ent. And others that are for <hi>Laurentius</hi> again<U+017F>t us, <U+017F>uch as <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaccius</hi> and <hi>Augenius,</hi> are to be rejected as per<U+017F>ons not skilled in A<U+017F>tronomie.</p>
               <p>VI. There is a midling Opinion<note place="margin">The <hi>VI.</hi> Opinion.</note> of <hi>Melchior Sebizius,</hi> viz. that all the <U+017F>igns of Virginity mu<U+017F>t be joyned together, when they are pre<U+017F>ent. And when the Hymen or Skin <U+017F>o called is ab<U+017F>ent, we mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s of the Neck and other marks, which being widened in the fir<U+017F>t Copulation, pain and effu<U+017F>ion of blood follows by rea<U+017F>on of the Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e things thus promi<U+017F>ed, let us come to the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of this Hymen or thin Skin which goes cro<U+017F>s the neck of the womb.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> in the neck of the womb, near the end thereof, ju<U+017F>t behind the In<U+017F>ertion of the Neck of the Bladder, or a little more inward. For the Situation does now and then vary, though the difference is but little. And there this Membrane goes cro<U+017F>s the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like the Diaphragma or Midriff.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure.</hi> In the middle it hath an hole like a ring, <U+017F>o that in grown Maids, it will admit the top of ones little finger, through which hole the Cour<U+017F>es flow.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aquapendent</hi> hath many times found this hole in a threefold difference.<note place="margin">The hole in the middle of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is of <U+017F>everal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I. As being Naturally con<U+017F>tituted, and ju<U+017F>t oppo<U+017F>ite to the external Privity.</p>
               <p>II. Higher, and not ju<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t the Privity.</p>
               <p>III. That in the middle was no round hole, but a chink <U+017F>omwhat long. <hi>Sebezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> likens it to the horned Moon a little full. For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <U+017F>ports her <U+017F>elf in the variety of Shape.</p>

               <p>Now a Maid may conceive without<note place="margin">Whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may be made without hurting the Hymen.</note> hurting the token of her Virginity, which <hi>Americus Ve<U+017F>putius</hi> relates to have been common in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>Speronus</hi> and <hi>Peramatus</hi> prove the <U+017F>ame. Tis reported that at <hi>Paris</hi> a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this pre<U+017F>ent Age wherein we live, was got with Child, without any Detriment to her Virginal Parts, and a like Hi<U+017F>tory is related by <hi>Clementina.</hi> Which we may conceive to be done five manner of waies, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up by <hi>Plempius</hi> and <hi>Sinibaldus,</hi> which for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors <U+017F>ake, I <U+017F>hall here omit. Nor does this any waies prejudice the Conception of our Savior, which was performed without any of the<U+017F>e waies, without the Embracement of any Man, and only by the over<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the Holy Spirit, of which it belongs to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to treat. If we believe <hi>Suidas,</hi> the Membrance was by the Midwives found in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when it was que<U+017F>tion'd, whether <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t her Virginity or no; which I conceive to have been incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the Mode<U+017F>ty of that ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Virgin. The living <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he might be reputed for a God, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted that he was born of his Mother <hi>Rachel,</hi> <U+017F>he being a Virgin. St. <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> conceits that in the State of Innocence, the Seed of the Man might be conveighed into the Womb of the Woman, her Virginity remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncorrupted, even as now Men<U+017F>trual blood comes out of the womb of a Virgin, without any Detriment to her Virginity. Which Opinion <hi>Vives</hi> does explain and approve.</p>
               <p>But that Women can become fruitful without the Seed of a Man, is incredible. For <hi>Caranza</hi> judges that Story of <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> of certain hairy women in an I<U+017F>land, which are fruitful without any Copulation of Men, to be a Fable. Touching <hi>Incuboe,</hi> the Que<U+017F>tion is different, which I have handled in another place. It was lately reported in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Magdalena <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Old Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that Mares in <hi>Portugal,</hi> do conceive by the wind, <hi>Ludovicus Carrius</hi> does ju<U+017F>tifie their report. But <hi>Ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Epitomizer, does more rightly explain their meaning to have been only to note the fruitfulne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e Mares, and the <U+017F>peedine<U+017F>s of their Conception</p>

               <p>It is only one in <hi>Number. Ob<U+017F>equens</hi> tells of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had two Privities, and <hi>Licetus</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved many <U+017F>uch as Mon<U+017F>ters.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is external, in the former Region of the Share-bones, where very<note place="margin">Parts of the Privitie.</note> many parts are to be <U+017F>een without Di<U+017F><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and <U+017F>ome without drawing open the Lips; as the Hairs of the Share, the Lips, and the Hillocks them<U+017F>elves; the great external Chink, the Wings, the Tentigo; but <U+017F>ome parts cannot be <U+017F>een without drawing the Lips a<U+017F>ide, as the <hi>fo<U+017F><U+017F>a navicularis,</hi> the two <U+017F>maller Chinks by the Nymphs, the bodies of the Clitoris, the Hole of the Neck of the Bladder, with with a fle<U+017F>hy Valve, the wrinkled Chink or immediate Mouth of the Neck, with four Caruncles, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Membranes: where afterwards the Channel begins of which we have <U+017F>poken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hairs</hi> of the Share in <U+017F>uch as are ripe, break out about the Lips, the better to clo<U+017F>e the Chink. And they are in Women more curled then in Maids; of <U+017F>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry colors, being produced by Nature, partly the <U+017F>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and partly to cover the<U+017F>e parts, which <U+017F>he judges ought in decency to be covered. But the Italian and Ea<U+017F>tern Women out of a de<U+017F>ire of cleanline<U+017F>s and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, do by Art remove the<U+017F>e Hairs as unprofitable.</p>
               <p>The Lips being drawn open, there appears 1. MAGNA FOSSA the large<note place="margin">See Fig. II. <hi>and</hi> III. <hi>of the</hi> XXVIII. Tab.</note> Trench or Ditch, with the outer GREAT CHINK, and we may call the fore<U+017F>aid Ditch <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>a navicularis</hi> the Boat trench, becau<U+017F>e of its likene<U+017F>s to a little Boat or Ship. For it is backwards more deep and broad, that the lower and after-end might degenerate as it were the Ditch or Trench. In this Ditch the Lips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, two Holes appear, but hardly vi<U+017F>ible, <U+017F>ave in live bodies, out of which a good quantity of whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h Humor I<U+017F><U+017F>ues, which moi<U+017F>tens the Mans Share in the time of Copulation. The Orifice or Beginning of the Neck of the Womb, is in the middle of this Ditch.</p>
               <p>Now this Ditch with the external Chink were to be large, that the Child might in the external part come out more ea<U+017F>ily, <U+017F>eeing the Skin cannot be <U+017F>o <U+017F>tretched, as the membranous Sub<U+017F>tance within may be.</p>
               <p>Then we meet with two COLLATERAL CHINKS, which are le<U+017F>s: the right and the left, and they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lips and the Wings.</p>
               <p>Now in this large Ditch, there are fir<U+017F>t of all to be <U+017F>een certain <hi>Caruncles</hi> or little Parcels of fle<U+017F>h, of which we are now to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>

               <p>They are <U+017F>o <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> that each po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es a corner, and oppo<U+017F>e one another in manner of a quadrangle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> of them is before in the circumference of the hole of the urinary Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, to <U+017F>hut the <U+017F>ame (it being greater then the re<U+017F>t, and forked) lea<U+017F>t after the water is voided, any external thing as Air, &amp;c. <U+017F>hould enter into the Bladder.</p>
               <p>The <hi><U+017F>econ</hi> oppo<U+017F>ite to the former, is <U+017F>ituate behind, the <hi>two</hi> remaining ones are Collateral.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> re<U+017F>embles the Berries of Myrtle.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Size</hi> varies, for <U+017F>ome have their <U+017F>horter, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thicker, and thinner then others. Howbeit they abide til extream old Age, and wear not away <U+017F>o much as in tho<U+017F>e that have u<U+017F>ed frequent Copulation and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Child-bearing.</p>
               <p>They have <U+017F>ome Membranes joyned to them, which <hi>Pinaeus</hi> together with the Caruncles terms Valves: <U+017F>o that their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is partly fle<U+017F>hy and partly membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hole</hi> in the middle between the<U+017F>e Caruncles, is of various <U+017F>ize, according to the age of the Party. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved, that in Virgins it equals a third part of the great Chink.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o <hi>He</hi> conceives, the<U+017F>e Caruncles are made by the wrinkling of the fle<U+017F>hy <U+017F>heath of the Privity, that the external part being narrower then the <U+017F>heath, may in time of travel be widened as much as it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a Child-bed Woman, after <U+017F>he was brought to bed, he ob<U+017F>erved them for <U+017F>even daies quite oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by rea<U+017F>on of the great di<U+017F>tention of the Privity, nor is there any appearance of them till the Privity be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <U+017F>traitned and reduced to its Natural form.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, I. to defend the internal parts, while they immediately <U+017F>hut the Orifice of the Neck, that no Air, Du<U+017F>t, &amp;c. may enter. To which end al<U+017F>o the Nymphs and Lips of the Privity do <U+017F>erve.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Pinaeus</hi> will have their u<U+017F>e to be far different.

               </p>
               <p>It is <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> in the middle of the Share, in the upper and former end of the great Chink, where</p>

For in La<U+017F><U+017F>es that begin to be amorous, the Clitoris does fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover it <U+017F>elf. It is in <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er: in <U+017F>ome it hangs out like a mans Yard, namely when young Wenches do frequently and continually handle and rub the <U+017F>ame, as Examples re<U+017F>tifie. But that it <U+017F>hould grow as big as a Goo<U+017F>es neck, as <hi>Platerus</hi> relates of one, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether praeternatural and mon<U+017F>trous. <hi>Tulpius</hi> hath a like Story of one that had it as long as half a mans fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as thick as a Boys Prick, which made her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have to do with Women in a Carnal way. But the more this part encrea<U+017F>es, the more does it hinder a man in his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. For in the time of Copulation it <U+017F>wells like a mans Yard, and being erected, provokes to Lu<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is not boney (though it was <U+017F>o in a Venetian Courtezan, who<note place="margin">Its Sub<U+017F>tance.</note> had it cut off, and the hardne<U+017F>s whereof did inflame the Yards of the Lovers) but as that of a mans Yard, it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of two nervous Bodies hard and thick, within porous and <U+017F>pungy (that this part might ri<U+017F>e and fall) ari<U+017F>ing di<U+017F>tinctly from the Hip-bones, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the brims of the <U+017F>aid Bones. But they are joyned together about the Share-bone, and make up the Body of the Yard. Its <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> are, according to <hi>Pinaeus</hi> three, according to <hi>Riolanus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Mu<U+017F>cles.</note> and <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus</hi> four, like as in a mans Yard, and <U+017F>erving to the <U+017F>ame Intent.

               <p>The outmo<U+017F>t End or Head, <U+017F>ticking out like the nut of a mans Yard (the re<U+017F>t lying hid) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led TENTIGO, having an hole as a mans<note place="margin">Tentigo.</note> Yard, but no thoroughfar.</p>

               <p>Al<U+017F>o it hath <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> of all <U+017F>orts brought unto it.<note place="margin">Its Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note>

               <p>Howbeit <hi>Aquapendent</hi> conceives that the U<U+017F>e of the Clitoris, is to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Neck of the Womb in the time of Copulation.</p>

And even at this day, the Ea<U+017F>tern Nations, in regard of its bignes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, do <U+017F>ear it, that it may grow no more. And they hire ancient women to perform this Piece of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, which they improperly term Circumci<U+017F>ion. And it is to tho<U+017F>e people as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, in regard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed greatne<U+017F>s of the Clitoris, as it is comely; for at <hi>Alcair</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Wenches go naked after this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci<U+017F>ion, and when they are married, they wear a Smock only.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> calls them NYMPHS, either<note place="margin">See FIG. III. <hi>and</hi> IV. <hi>of the</hi> Tab. XXVIII.</note> becau<U+017F>e they do fir<U+017F>t admit the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, or becau<U+017F>e they have charge of the Waters and Humors i<U+017F><U+017F>uing forth. For between them as it were two walls, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin is ca<U+017F>t out to a good di<U+017F>tance with an hi<U+017F><U+017F>ing noi<U+017F>e, without wetting the Lips of the Privity. Others call them the Curicular Caruncles.</p>
               <p>They are <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> between the two Lips.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Magnitude</hi> is not alwaies alike: for <U+017F>omtimes one Wing, otherwhiles both, <U+017F>eldomer in Virgins then in women, do grow <U+017F>o big, e<U+017F>pecially being frequently drawn by the fingers, or otherwi<U+017F>e by an Afflux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that by rea<U+017F>on of the impediments thereby hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to cut them. And <hi>Galen</hi> tells us that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is frequent among the Aegyptians; <U+017F>o that they are faln to cut them in Virgins that are to marry, and in other women al<U+017F>o; and <hi>Aeetius</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineta</hi> do <U+017F>peak to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, which others will have to be under<U+017F>tood of the Clitoris. And they are in the right as I conceive, becau<U+017F>e the Clitoris being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long, may hinder the amorous Embracement, and may be rai<U+017F>ed like the Yard; but the Nymphs cannot be this way trouble<U+017F>om, which are <U+017F>ofter, and in <U+017F>ome do hang down very long, yea in Whores that trade with the<U+017F>e Parts.</p>
               <p>They are in <hi>Number</hi> two; the right and the left, now they are in the beginning commonly joyned together, where they make a fle<U+017F>hy Production, like a Fore-skin cloathing the Clitoris.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Figure</hi> is triangular, but one angle is blunter then the re<U+017F>t, viz. that which comes without the Lips. It is like a Cocks-comb: and for that cau<U+017F>e haply by <hi>Juvenal</hi> termed <hi>Cri<U+017F>ta.</hi>

               <p>Tis covered with a thin <hi>Coat</hi> rather then Skin, as the Lips and other parts of the Mouth.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is partly membranous, <U+017F>oft, and <U+017F>pungy (bred peradventure of the doubling in of the Skin, at the <U+017F>ides of the great Chink) and partly fle<U+017F>hy.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is the <U+017F>ame with that of the Myrtle-<U+017F>hap'd Caruncles. And moreover that the Urin might be conveighed between them, as between two wals.

Yet we can ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparate it from the Chorion. There is in it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41352:44"/>
plenty of Moi<U+017F>ture and Humors wherein the child <U+017F>wims which proceeds in Brutes from Sweat, in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from Sweat and Urin. But <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> having ob<U+017F>erved that in Brutes<note place="margin">Whence the Liquor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that is in the Amni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os.</note> the Sweat and Urin were contained in <U+017F>everal little Membranes, the latter more low and externally in the Chorion, the former higher, and more inwardly in the Amnion; he thought it was <U+017F>o in Mankind much more. But Experience and Rea<U+017F>on are again<U+017F>t it, becau<U+017F>e there are no Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages to the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion. And becau<U+017F>e we do not find the Urachus open in Mankind, therefore the Urin cannot be thence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the Amnios, but is voided by the Yard if it be trouble<U+017F>om, and the remainder is kept till the time of the Birth, in the Bladder, which in Children new born is for the mo<U+017F>t part di<U+017F>tended and full, but in Brutes empty. Nor does the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Urin offend the Child in the Womb, becau<U+017F>e 1. It is but little in a Child in the Womb, becau<U+017F>e of the benignity and purity of its Nouri<U+017F>hment. 2. The Skin is daubed with a clammy Humor, and Brutes are defended by their hairine<U+017F>s. Therefore the <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is</p>
               <p>I. That the Child floating therein as in a Bath, may be higher and le<U+017F>s burthen<U+017F>om to the Mother.</p>
               <p>II. That the Child may not <U+017F>trike again<U+017F>t any neighboring hard Parts.</p>
               <p>III. That in the Birth, the Membrane being broke, this Humor running out, may make the way through the Neck of the Womb, <U+017F>mooth, ea<U+017F>ie, and <U+017F>lippery.</p>
               <p>Part of the Amnios does ever and anon hang about the Head of the Child when it comes forth, and then the Child is <U+017F>aid to be <hi>Galeatus</hi> or Helmeted. This Helmet the Midwives diligently ob<U+017F>erve for divers re<U+017F>pects, and they progno<U+017F>ticate good fortune to the Child, and others that u<U+017F>e it, if it be red; but if it be black, the prae<U+017F>age bad fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraeus, Lemnius</hi> and others, conceive that the happy and <U+017F>trong Labor of the Mother, is the cau<U+017F>e that the fore<U+017F>aid Helmet comes out with the child, but in a trouble<U+017F>om Labor it is left behind. <hi>Spigelius</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwife, thinks that when the Mother and child are weak, it comes away. <hi>Be<U+017F>terus</hi> makes the Rea<U+017F>on to be the roughne<U+017F>s of the Amnios, which the child is not able to break through, or the weakne<U+017F>s of the child, for which cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eldom lives to ripene<U+017F>s of Age. I have <U+017F>een both tho<U+017F>e that have come into the world with this Helmet, and tho<U+017F>e without it, mi<U+017F>erable; and by chance it comes to cleave both to the Heads of <U+017F>trong and weak children.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>econd Membrane is termed Chorion, becau<U+017F>e it compa<U+017F><U+017F>es the child like a Circle.</p>
               <p>This immediately compa<U+017F><U+017F>es the former, and lies beneath it in a round <U+017F>hape like a Pancake, who<U+017F>e inner or hollow part it covers and invelops, <U+017F>preading it <U+017F>elf out according to the mea<U+017F>ure thereof. It is hardly <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated therefrom, and it <U+017F>trongly unites the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to the Womb-liver, and bears them up. Towards the child it is more <U+017F>mooth and <U+017F>lippery, but where it is <U+017F>pread under the Womb-cake, and fa<U+017F>tned thereto, it is more rough: al<U+017F>o it is <U+017F>ufficiently thick and double. In Brutes the <hi>Cotyledons</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyledons are.</note> cleave hereunto, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hy and <U+017F>pungy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. But in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, this Membrane cleavs immediately to the womb, by a certain round and reddi<U+017F>h lump of fle<U+017F>h, fa<U+017F>tned to one part only of the womb (commonly the upper and former part) nor does it compa<U+017F>s the whole child; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing framed of an innumerable company of Branches, of Veins, and Arteries, among which bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is circular, but the Circumference une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, in which I have ob<U+017F>erved five Prominences ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in due order, and the Membrane Chorion in the intermediate <U+017F>paces, thicker then ordinary. Where it looks towards the Womb, it is rough and waved, like baked bread that hath chinks in it; and being cut in this part, it di<U+017F>covers an infinite number of fibres, which if you follow, they will bring you to the Trunks of the Veins.</p>
               <p>It is one in <hi>Number,</hi> even in tho<U+017F>e who bear two or more children at a burthen. For into one Womb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake, <U+017F>o many Cords are in<U+017F>erted in divers places, as there are children.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies according to the condition of the Bodies and the children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Yet it is about a foot in the Diameter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> thereof <U+017F>eems to be a Body wove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of infinite little fibres, blood as it were congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being interpo<U+017F>ed, which is ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore it hath a Parenchyma, it is no wonder, if like a kind of, Liver it make or prepare blood to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h the child.</p>
               <p>The Nature and Appearance of the Sub<U+017F>tance, is not every where alike. For here and there it is <hi>glandulous,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially in the tops of the Hillocks, as being the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories of the childs Work-hou<U+017F>e, placed in the outmo<U+017F>t Verges. It is <hi>thicker</hi> in the middle of the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks; and thin about the brims, variou<U+017F>ly interwoven with the Capillary Veins: For,</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> viz. <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> running through the <U+017F>ame, from the Umbelical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which by little and little are all extenuated about the brims of the Womb-cake, making wonderful contextures, clo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>ticking to the Sub<U+017F>tance thereof, <U+017F>o that no part of the Branches is void. They are joyned together by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es, which <U+017F>hall be hereafter de<U+017F>cribed, through which the blood in the child runs back, out of the Arteries into the Veins. For I have ob<U+017F>erved in the Veins of the Womb-cake, how that the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, may ea<U+017F>ily by ones finger or an in<U+017F>trument, be forced towards the Trunk or Cord, but not towards the Womb-cake. The contrary where to happens in the Arteries, which by impul<U+017F>e of the finger, do ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>end the blood to the Womb-liver, but hardly to the Trunk.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is 1. To <U+017F>upport the Navil-ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, under which it is <U+017F>pred as a Pillow.</p>
               <p>2. Becau<U+017F>e it hath a <U+017F>ingular kind of Parenchyma, to prepare blood to nouri<U+017F>h the Child, as the true Liver does in grown per<U+017F>ons. For it mediately <U+017F>ucks the Mothers blood through its Veins, out of the Veins of the womb, and prepares and tempers it for u<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>oon after <U+017F>ends it through the greater Navil-vein, into the Liver of the child, that it may be carried right forth unto the Heart, by the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is and little Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; out of which by the Arteries it is di<U+017F>tributed into the whole body of the child to nouri<U+017F>h the <U+017F>ame. But part of the blood returns through the Iliack Arteries, to the Womb-cake, as an appurtenance to the child; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pre<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame by its heat, and to nouri<U+017F>mit with Arterial blood, partly that it may be there further perfected; which Labor being fini<U+017F>hed, it returns back again into the concomitant Veins, that together with other blood, newly <U+017F>upplied by the Pipes of the womb, it may pa<U+017F>s back again by the Umbelical Veins, and repeat the fore<U+017F>aid Circle. <figure>

               <p>This Vein <U+017F>eems full of certain <hi>Knots:</hi> which are nothing but a more thick and<note place="margin">The Knots.</note> fle<U+017F>hy Con<U+017F>titution of the <hi>Membrana car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<U+017F>a</hi> in tho<U+017F>e Parts; and a wider opening, wherewith as a <U+017F>poon, the Blood is drawn in, in its long Journey, and is by little and little <U+017F>topped, lea<U+017F>t it flow too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; that the Blood may be there the longer labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as we <U+017F>ee in the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els: and that the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els may be <U+017F>tronger.</p>
               <p>By the Number of the<U+017F>e Knots, the Midwives do gue<U+017F>s the number of Children that a woman <U+017F>hal bear: and if the Knot which fir<U+017F>t follows, be white and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they foretel that the next child will be a Girl, if red, round, and <U+017F>welling, that it will be a Boy. The fir<U+017F>t Divination is vain; for there are as many Knots in the Navil of the la<U+017F>t child, as of the fir<U+017F>t. But the latter may be excu<U+017F>ed by the defect or abundance of Natural heat, whence the Diver<U+017F>ity of Sexes ari<U+017F>es. From the di<U+017F>tance of the Knots one from another, they foretel that the Conceptions will be <U+017F>ooner or longer one after another, and that there will be Twins, if one Knot re<U+017F>t upon, or be near to another. Which we have often found to be fal<U+017F>e, though chance, do now and then confirm the hope of credulous women.</p>
               <p>Two ARTERIES are in<U+017F>erted into the Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Arteries, and are carried with the Vein<note place="margin">Arteries.</note> after the fore<U+017F>aid manner to the womb-cake, where it is <U+017F>pred about in divers Branches, who<U+017F>e <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is not, as hath hitherto been believed, to bring to the child vital Spirit with Arterial blood, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are not joyned to the Arteries of the Womb, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mo<U+017F>t certain Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Arantius;</hi> but to carry back part of the Arterial blood, which is <U+017F>uperfluous to the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Child, by the two Iliack Branches into the Placenta or Womb-cake, partly to nouri<U+017F>h the <U+017F>ame, and fill it with vital Spirit. Partly that the Blood may there be made more perfect, being weakned by a long Journey, and nouri<U+017F>hing the Membranes; which afterwards runs back again to the Child, by the hairy twigs of the veins joyned thereto, with that new blood coming out of the womb.</p>
               <p>This Motion is confirmed by Experience. I have often pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <U+017F>welling veins with my finger, and have ob<U+017F>erved that the blood is ea<U+017F>ily forced out of the vein towards the Child, not to the Womb-cake, where the knots like valves do <U+017F>top the <U+017F>ame; contrariwi<U+017F>e, it is ea<U+017F>ily forced out of the Arteries into the Womb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake. The <U+017F>ame is manife<U+017F>t by Ligatures. For the Umbilical Arteries of a live Child being bound, as yet cleaving to the Mother being alive, <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and others after him, that they pul<U+017F>e between the Ligature and the Child, but have no Pul<U+017F>e between the Ligature and the Mothers womb.</p>
               <p>For this Motions <U+017F>ake the venal and<note place="margin">Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note> Arterial branches are joyned together by <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es,</hi> within the Womb-cake, that the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age might be ready for the blood to run back out of the little Arteries, into the little Veins.</p>
               <p>I have here, following my own <U+017F>ight, ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies of Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es. For <U+017F>omtimes the twigs of the Veins and Arteries, do go one over another cro<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, both internally and externally. Somtimes they are joyned by In<U+017F>ertion, <U+017F>omtimes they couple <U+017F>ide to <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>omtimes they are wreathed. The <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Twigs of the Branches are inoculated into the greater, united in like manner, but with more blunt Ana<U+017F>tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, till the Arteries are reduced to four Branches, the Vein to two, which at la<U+017F>t grow into the trunks of their own kind, <U+017F>pringing out of the Womb-cake. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries go about the veins, and do partly accompany them, and partly creep alone by them<U+017F>elves. I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that there are Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es only in tho<U+017F>e places, wherein they are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing Blood out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the veins, and that the <U+017F>olitary veins do <U+017F>uck fre<U+017F>h Blood out of the Womb.</p>

               <p>Moreover, it is to be <hi>noted</hi> in the twi<U+017F>ting of the cord 1.

Now the times of its falling of are uncertain, in re<U+017F>pect of the Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the child, and the plenty of Blood which flows thereto, from whence the Midwives Progno<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate how long the child <U+017F>hall live. If it fall of the fift day from the hour it was tied, they foretell the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be long-lived; if on the third day, they <U+017F>ay they <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>hort-lived.</p>
               <p>The Navil being thus <U+017F>haped and confirmed, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a <U+017F>trong Skin, which may be preternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>tretched to an immen<U+017F>e degree, to receive the Guts in a Rupture of the Navil, <U+017F>uch as <hi>Severinus</hi> hath de<U+017F>cribed in a Picture, and as my <U+017F>elf have <U+017F>een at <hi>Haf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> in an ancient Woman.</p>
               <p>In <U+017F>ome there is a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the Navil into the Belly. <hi>Alpinus</hi> reports that the Aegyptians cure a bloody Flux, by thru<U+017F>ting their Fingers into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Navil, and turning it divers times about.

tels us of a Boy who had a wheyi<U+017F>h liquor like Urin dropping from his Navil, and <U+017F>omtimes fre<U+017F>h blood. For the inner Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are many times opened, by the Acrimony of the blood and wheyi<U+017F>h humors. Al<U+017F>o the Navil doth in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly open it <U+017F>elf when purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Medicines for the Mother and to kill the Worms, &amp;c. are applied thereto.</p>
               <p>Now the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, after the Child is born, do within the Belly degenerate into Ligaments: the Vein to a Ligament of the Liver, the Arteries into lateral Ligaments of the Bladder. Becau<U+017F>e their u<U+017F>e is now lo<U+017F>t, and there is no longer any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Mothers blood, unle<U+017F>s they be <U+017F>omtimes preternaturally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as in the examples alleadged.

For they report that the Aegyptians puni<U+017F>h Robbers by flaying them alive, and that they leave the Navil untoucht, that they may be tormented the longer: for they think when the Navil is cut off a man mu<U+017F>t needs die, the four Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els being de<U+017F>troyed. But <hi>Riolanus</hi> a man of great experience <U+017F>aw contrary examples, and any man may judg by a Rupture of the Navil. If death follow, it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the inner parts being al<U+017F>o hurt, and a wide dore opened for all hurtful things to enter. <hi>Sperlinger</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that they are choaked, becau<U+017F>e the Navil being cut off, the Liver falls down and draws the Midriff, the Organ of breathing. But 1. This <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of breath doth not cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>udden death. 2.

That the various moving of a Child in the Womb, which Big-bellied Women feel, doth witne<U+017F>s that the Child hath a moving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty though imperfect. 2. The bladder is provoked to excretion, by the over great quantity and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Serum, or wheyi<U+017F>h humor. 3. The Coat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Allantoides</hi> which is not in Man-kind, doth <U+017F>hew the difference between Man and bea<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uarolus</hi> will have all the Urin to be contained in the bladder, till the birth time. But then it would be broken with over <U+017F>tretching; and whence comes all the liquor which is in the Coat <hi>Amnios.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aqua-pendens, Spigelius</hi> and almo<U+017F>t all others will have it go out by the <hi>Urachus,</hi> and be collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Amnios</hi> and <hi>Allantoides,</hi> as in bea<U+017F>ts. But <U+017F>eeing it is not perforated, but <U+017F>olid in Man-kind, it cannot admit the Urin. For it cannot be <U+017F>trained through, without a manife<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, becau<U+017F>e it is thick, and the <U+017F>ame way might hold in grown Per<U+017F>ons. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>lingius</hi> propounds both the<U+017F>e opinions and determins nothing. Now it is no more Porous in a young child then a grown per<U+017F>on. And <hi>Laurentius</hi> eagerly defends this opinion out of <hi>Galen,</hi> bringing the examples of <U+017F>ome, who when their Urin was <U+017F>topt, did void it at their Navil.</p>
               <p>But I an<U+017F>wer: This is done praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,<note place="margin">The Error of Laurentius.</note> as it is al<U+017F>o a known opinion of many, that the Umbilical Vein hath been preternaturally opened in Hydropical per<U+017F>ons, and voided the Water. And <hi>Laurentius</hi> him<U+017F>elf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>es, that all the four Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els do turn to Ligaments; wherein he is right, for they are dried. How therefore can they be opened unle<U+017F>s preternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? So it was I conceive preternaturally opened in the <U+017F>ame Italian called <hi>Anna,</hi> who hath no Yard, in <U+017F>tead whereof a <U+017F>pungy bit of fle<U+017F>h hung out under his Navil, whence the Urin dropt. <hi>Fernelius</hi> and others have other examples of the <hi>Urachus</hi> opened.</p>
               <p>Before the Production of all the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els in the Womb, the <U+017F>eed being curdled in the top of the hinder part, two certain Roots are in<U+017F>erted, on each <U+017F>ide one from the horns of the Womb, fir<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erved by <hi>Varolius</hi> and called <hi>Radices Dor<U+017F>ales,</hi> the back Roots which are obliterated, when the rudiments of the Child are framed, touching which <hi>Riolanus</hi> explains <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ina.</hi>

            <p>THe <hi>middle Venter</hi> or Belly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Thorax</hi> the Che<U+017F>t, and by<note place="margin">The middle Venter what it is.</note> <U+017F>ome ab<U+017F>olutely <hi>Venter,</hi> is all that which is circum<U+017F>cribed above, by Clavicles or Channel-bones; beneath the Midriff; on the fore<U+017F>ide by the Brea<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone; on the hinder part by the Bones of the Back, and on the <U+017F>ides by the Ribs.</p>
            <p>The fore-part is called <hi>Sternon</hi> and <hi>Pectus,</hi> &amp;c. the Hinder-part, the Back; the Lateral Parts are termed the Sides.</p>
            <p>Howbeit the Ancients as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> &amp;c. did comprehend all<note place="margin">Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <hi>and</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle.</note> from the Channel-bones as far as to the Privities, that is to <U+017F>ay, the middle and lower Belly under the Name of Che<U+017F>t. And therefore in this Sen<U+017F>e <hi>Hypocrates</hi> did well write, that the Liver is <U+017F>eated in the Che<U+017F>t: which other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful per<U+017F>ons not under<U+017F>tanding, did imagine that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> was ill ver<U+017F>ed in Anatomy.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is after a <U+017F>ort Oval, though not exactly, and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> compares it<note place="margin">Its Figure.</note> to a Tortoi<U+017F>e or the Belly of a Lute. In Mankind, it is more bunching in the fore-part, but in the middle of the Bre<U+017F>t-bone it is flatter, about the <U+017F>ides round, becau<U+017F>e of the bowing of the Ribs, in the Back more flat.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> in General, varies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different degree of Heat:<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> for by the widene<U+017F>s of the Che<U+017F>t we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure the Heat of the Heart. But in particular per<U+017F>ons it is larger towards the lower Belly, where the vital bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels are concealed, and grows narrower by little and little at the beginning of the Neck.</p>
            <p>Its outer <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is partly bony, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fle<U+017F>hy.<note place="margin">Sub<U+017F>tance.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This middle Belly is not wholly fle<U+017F>hy as the lower is, 1. Becau<U+017F>e it was not to contain any Parts, that were very much to be <U+017F>tretched. 2. That over-much Fat might be bred there, and hinder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration.</p>
            <p>Yet is it partly fle<U+017F>hy, becau<U+017F>e it contains Parts which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought to be moved, as the Heart and Lungs, and for the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>e,</p>
            <p>It could not be altogether bony, like the Skull; for that is a very rare ca<U+017F>e which <hi>Cardan</hi> mentions in his 11. Book of Subtilties, Page 458. in my Edition, of a Man that in<U+017F>tead of Ribs, had one continued Bone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet is it in part bony, for to <U+017F>afeguard the noble Parts. For,</p>

                  <hi>Chap. I.</hi> Of the Dugs.</head>
               <p>ACcording to our Anatomical Method,<note place="margin">See Tab. XXV. Lib. I.</note> the fir<U+017F>t Parts in the Che<U+017F>t which we di<U+017F><U+017F>ect, as <U+017F>oon as we have done with the lower Belly, are the Dugs. Now we <U+017F>hall treat of the Dugs of Women, ca<U+017F>ting in between while, wherein tho<U+017F>e of Men differ therefrom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scituation</hi> of the Dugs, is in the middle of the Bre<U+017F>t, above the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">Why the Dugs in Mankind are <U+017F>eated in the Brea<U+017F>t.</note> Mu<U+017F>cle, which draws to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 1. Becau<U+017F>e of the nearne<U+017F>s of the Heart, from whence they receive heat. 2. For Comeline<U+017F>s <U+017F>ake. 3. For the more convenient giving of <U+017F>uck: becau<U+017F>e the Infant cannot pre<U+017F>ently walk after the manner of Brutes, but being embraced in his Mothers Arms, it is applied to the Dugs. No other Creatures have Dugs in their Brea<U+017F>ts <U+017F>aving the Apes, who hold their young ones in their Arms likewi<U+017F>e. <hi>Laurentius</hi> tells us the Elephant does the like, and <hi>Riolanus</hi> <U+017F>ayes as much of the Bat or Flitter-mou<U+017F>e. Some great Sea-fi<U+017F>hes of the Whale-kind have Dugs on their Bre<U+017F>ts, full of Milk, as we lately ob<U+017F>erved in a Whale that came out of <hi>Norwey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are two in <hi>Number:</hi> not becau<U+017F>e of Twins; but that one being hurt, the<note place="margin">Number of the Dugs</note> other might <U+017F>upply its Office. Howbeit <hi>Varro</hi> reports, that Sows will have <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pigs as they have teats. <hi>Walaeus</hi> in a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ob<U+017F>erved three Dugs, two on the left <U+017F>ide of her Bre<U+017F>t, and one on the right. And <hi>Cabrolius</hi> ob<U+017F>erved in a certain woman four Dugs, on each <U+017F>ide two.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Magnitude.</hi> In Girls new born, there is only a Print or Mark vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> on the bre<U+017F>t, and afterwards by little and little it <U+017F>wells, and in little wenches hardly any thing appears be<U+017F>ide the teats, untill by degrees they grow to the bigne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>hape of Apples; and when they are rai<U+017F>ed two fingers high, their Cour<U+017F>es begin to flow. In old women they wither away, <U+017F>o that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears but the Nipples, the Fat and Kernels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing con<U+017F>umed.</p>
               <p>In women they <U+017F>wel more, and in women with child the la<U+017F>t moneths, they are more and more encrea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>In men they do not ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>o high as in women, becau<U+017F>e ordinarily they were<note place="margin">The difference of the Dugs in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> not to breed milk [yet becau<U+017F>e of the equality of the kind, it was convenient that men <U+017F>hould have them as well as women.] And therefore in men, the Dugs are commonly without Kernels: yet in burly people, the Fat which is under them rai<U+017F>ed the brea<U+017F>ts. In the Kingdom of <hi>Sengea,</hi> the Dugs of women hang as low as their Bellies; and in the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Arnabo,</hi> 'tis <U+017F>aid they turn them over their <U+017F>houlders to their backs, and there <U+017F>uckle their children.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> is roundi<U+017F>h. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent as it were an half Globe. And in<note place="margin">Their Shape.</note> <U+017F>ome becau<U+017F>e of their over-great weight they hang down.</p>
               <p>The Dug is <hi>divided</hi> into the Nipple<note place="margin">Their Parts.</note> and the <hi>Dug</hi> it <U+017F>elf. For in the middle of the Dug there is to be <U+017F>een a peculiar Sub<U+017F>tance, which,</p>
               <p>Is called <hi>Papilla,</hi> the Teat or Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being <U+017F>pungy, like the Nut of a<note place="margin">How the Nipples come to have <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>ite Sen<U+017F>e.</note> Mans Yard, and therefore it will fall and ri<U+017F>e when it is <U+017F>uckt or handled. For it hath an excellent and exqui<U+017F>ite Sen<U+017F>e of feeling, becau<U+017F>e it is as it were the Centre, into which the ends of the Nerves<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Veins, and Arteries do meet. Which is apparent from the Delicacy of its Sen<U+017F>e, and the redne<U+017F>s of its color, a <U+017F>ure token of Blood brought in by the Arteries, by rea<U+017F>on of the Concour<U+017F>e whereof, Chyrurgeons do judg Cancers and other Tumors about the Nipple perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> believes that the Skin is doubled, and as it were compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: but the doubling would make it thicker. But the Skin is exceeding tender, ea<U+017F>ily rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed off, and apt to be pained when the Child <U+017F>ucks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely. Only in old women it grows thick. Not is the Nipple any other where made of the Skin <U+017F>trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or folded.</p>
               <p>If the Nipples turn upwards, a Male child is in the Mothers womb, if downwards a Girl according to the Tradition of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> which hath not been as yet ratified by the confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of women with child.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Number,</hi> there is one Nipple on each Dug. <hi>Hollerius</hi> <U+017F>aw two Nipples upon one Dug, which both yielded Milk.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Colour</hi> in Virgins is red, in <U+017F>uch as give <U+017F>uck it enclines to black and blew, and in them al<U+017F>o they are more <U+017F>ticking out, by rea<U+017F>on of the Infants <U+017F>ucking; in <U+017F>uch as are pa<U+017F>t Child-bearing, the Nipples are of a black color.</p>
               <p>They have a Circle round about them which is called <hi>Areola</hi> the little Par<U+017F>ley-bed, in Virgins pale and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in <U+017F>uch as are with child and give <U+017F>uck, brown, in old women black.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>bored</hi> through the middle, with very <U+017F>mall holes for the Milk to pa<U+017F>s through: For</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Nipple is to be in<U+017F>tead of a Pipe or Funnel, to put into the Mouth of the Infant, whereout it may <U+017F>uck the Milk: Secondly, to <U+017F>erve for a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing Titillation, whereby Mothers and Nur<U+017F>es are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed the more willingly, and with a certain Sen<U+017F>e of plea<U+017F>ure to give their children <U+017F>uck.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dugs</hi> do inwardly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,<note place="margin">The Dug.</note> Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, Kernels, or rather kernel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>h Bodies, and Fat: though the two la<U+017F>t do chiefly make up the Dugs; the Kernels and Fat lye concealed between the Membrane and the Skin.</p>
               <p>Now the fle<U+017F>hy <hi>Membrane</hi> does fa<U+017F>ten the kernelli<U+017F>h Sub<U+017F>tance which it compa<U+017F><U+017F>es, unto the Mu<U+017F>cles which lye thereunder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kernels</hi> are many: In Virgins more hard, in old women con<U+017F>umed, in <U+017F>uch as are with child and give <U+017F>uck, more <U+017F>welling and pappie. Yet there is one great one, ju<U+017F>t under the Nipple, which the other le<U+017F><U+017F>er ones do compa<U+017F>s about, and infinite textures of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els lye between them. <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved a womans Dug to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of one continued Kernel, and not of many, the contrary whereto we <U+017F>ee in <U+017F>cirrhous and cancerous Tumors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is, to turn Blood into Milk. And the u<U+017F>e of the fat of the Dug is to encrea<U+017F>e heat, and to make the Dug of an even round <U+017F>hape. And therefore <U+017F>uch as have the Fat con<U+017F>umed by <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e or old Age, they hang ill favoredly like empty Bladders, and are unfit to make Milk.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</hi> The Dugs receive their Skin and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Veins</hi> from the Axillary, which are called the <hi>Thoracicae Superiores, the upper Che<U+017F>t-veins,</hi> which in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child and <U+017F>uch as give <U+017F>uck, are often black and blew vi<U+017F>ible. They receive other internal Veins, brought thither a long way, that the Blood might be the longer therein wrought, which are termed <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi>

The<U+017F>e are met by other a<U+017F>cendent Veins, by the right Mu<U+017F>cles, of which before: and therefore the Infant being born, the Blood is carried no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">Why Milk is bred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the child is born.</note> to the womb, but to the Dugs, and is turned into Milk. And hence it is that women which give <U+017F>uck, have <U+017F>eldom their Cour<U+017F>es. Hence al<U+017F>o, when the Children <U+017F>uck over-much, Blood comes out at the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Yea, it hath been ob<U+017F>erved that a womans cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es have come away through her Dugs, and Milk by her womb; howbeit, this is a rare chance.</p>
               <p>But the Matter of Milk, be it what it will, cannot according to the Principles of the Bloods Circulation, be carried by the Veins to the Dugs. The <hi>Venae mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi> or Dug-veins, do only carry back what remains <U+017F>uperfluous, after the Child is nouri<U+017F>hed, and Milk made. Moreover, they are <U+017F>eldome joyned with the Epiga<U+017F>trick Veins, and they are too few and <U+017F>mall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to carry <U+017F>o much blood from the womb, as may <U+017F>uffice a Child that is a liberal Sucker.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Arteries</hi> proceed from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Trunk of the great Artery: and<note place="margin">Their Arteries.</note> from the Subclavian branches, which are joyned after the <U+017F>ame manner with the Epiga<U+017F>trick Arteries, as was <U+017F>aid of the Veins.

Hence it <U+017F>eems more likely, blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Dugs to make Milk, which blood being con<U+017F>umed in fat and elderly women they are therefore none of the be<U+017F>t Nur<U+017F>es.

                  </note> for the An<U+017F>wering of the contrary Arguments: You are to Note. 1. That we admit of the Chyle as the remote matter of Milk, but not as the immediate matter thereof. 2. That the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully evacuated by the Milk, is bred again by plentiful meat and drink; and therefore the plenty of Milk cea<U+017F>es when there is little drink taken in, as all Nur<U+017F>es do te<U+017F>tifie. Morcover, <U+017F>uch as are of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin complexion afford mo<U+017F>t Milk, whereas tho<U+017F>e that are of a tender con<U+017F>titution grow lean by giving Suck. 3. That all the blood which is poured out of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Dugs, is not turned into Milk, but only the more wheyi<U+017F>h part, a great deal running back by the Veins into the Heart. 4. That Women which give <U+017F>uck have their Cour<U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Womb are then more enlarged, then in the fir<U+017F>t moneths of their going with Child: and ever and anon they flow <U+017F>paringly from Nur<U+017F>es, and leave off by fits. Al<U+017F>o Women that give <U+017F>uck <U+017F>eldom conceive, unle<U+017F>s they be of a Plethorick habit of body, that is to <U+017F>ay full of good blood. Our Women when they would wean a Boy, if their Dugs <U+017F>well, they do by certain Medicines keep back the Milk, by <U+017F>traitning the Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els, that the matter thereof may not enter nor be drawn that way. 6. That the Brea<U+017F>t and Dug-Arteries are large, and are more and more widened by continual <U+017F>ucking. 7. That the Milk doth drink in the faculty of Meats and Purgatives, even by mediation of the Blood, which con<U+017F>erves the color and faculty of the meats, though <U+017F>undry dige<U+017F>tions have preceded; though vapors alone be rai<U+017F>ed, and the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance a<U+017F>cend not. 8. That many things are performed in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to the <U+017F>ingular con<U+017F>titution of particular per<U+017F>ons, yea and many things which rarely happen, which is to be under<U+017F>tood of the Milk, which was in the Dugs of that <hi>Man</hi> at <hi>Cous,</hi> and of other things thence voided.</p>

               <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, the Dugs have al<U+017F>o white <hi>Pipes,</hi> according to the ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation<note place="margin">Their Pipes.</note> of later Anatomi<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>pringing from the whole Circumference of the lower part which growing narrower, do alwayes meet together, wherein Milk being made, is pre<U+017F>erved for u<U+017F>e. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they are nothing but widened Arteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming white, becau<U+017F>e of the change of the milk and the bordering kernels (which I am willing to believe) I leave to acuter Eyes and Wits to determine. They trea<U+017F>ure up the Milk, when there is occa<U+017F>ion of omitting to give the Infant <U+017F>uck: and when that u<U+017F>e is over, they grow as <U+017F>mall as the mo<U+017F>t Capillary Veins.</p>
               <p>Their U<U+017F>e is, 1. General in Women and Men, to be <U+017F>afeguards to the<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e of the Dugs.</note> Heart: hence Nature hath given Men of cold Complexions larger Dugs then ordinary; and Women that loo<U+017F>e their Dugs become rough-voiced, according to <hi>Hypocrates.</hi> Nor doth the pectoral Mu<U+017F>cle hinder, which performs the <U+017F>ame Office, which is <hi>Riolanus</hi> his Objection; for the more noble parts require great fencing, even by the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t thing, as the Eyes from the Eye-brows, the Heart from the water in the Heart-bag or Pericardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. In women their u<U+017F>e is to breed Milk, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h the young Infant. For the Child was nouri<U+017F>ht by blood in the Womb, and milk is the <U+017F>ame blood only whitened, <U+017F>o that Nature <U+017F>eems to have put a trick upon living Creatures by obtruding upon them the gentler appearance of white milk, in place of red blood, as <hi>Plato</hi> hath it. Which is the Cau<U+017F>e that the People of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Daulphine</hi> did anciently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit their Prei<U+017F>ts, the u<U+017F>e of milk, as well as of Blood.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cau<U+017F>e of milk,<note place="margin">The Efficient cau<U+017F>e of Milk.</note> is not the Womb, where milk was never ob<U+017F>erved, nor do the Dugs breed milk, by that vertue thereof which it <U+017F>elf wants; nor of the <hi>Veins</hi> or Arteries, unle<U+017F>s it be the neare<U+017F>t, can the vertue be communicated from the Dugs. For as for what <hi>Baronius</hi> relates of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> how when he was beheaded, not blood but milk ran from his Neck, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a miracle, if true; or a <U+017F>erous humor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, which <U+017F>ometimes flows from the Arm, when a Vein is opened, and I have <U+017F>een it very like to milk, or finally the Liquor of Kernels being cut, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble milk. But the true efficient cau<U+017F>e of the milk, is that <U+017F>ame kernelly fle<U+017F>h of the Dugs, unto which there is none like, in the whole body. Now it works this moderate Concoction by the propriety of its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and by rea<U+017F>on of its proper temperament. <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> conceives the milk becomes white, by Rea<U+017F>on of plenty of heat and <U+017F>pirit Book 12. Chap. 1. But I am more enclined to believe, that milk is white, becau<U+017F>e it is a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated to the Dugs that are of the <U+017F>ame color.</p>
               <p>Somtimes therefore (though it<note place="margin">Milk may breed in Virgins, Men, Women not with Child, &amp;c.</note> happen <U+017F>eldom) milk may be bred in Virgins, and in Women not with Child, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of <hi>Bodinus</hi> in his Theatre of Nature, of <hi>Joachinus Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Schenkius,</hi> of <hi>Petrus Ca<U+017F>tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the greater <U+017F>ort of Sea fi<U+017F>hes of the whaley kind, I have ob<U+017F>erved a fle<U+017F>hy Midriff like that of Creatures which live on the Land.</p>
               <p>Now the motion thereof is thus: when the Breath is drawn in, the<note place="margin">How the motion of the Diaphragma is performed.</note> Midriff is <U+017F>tretched, when it is blowne out, it is remitted or <U+017F>lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Arantius</hi> and <hi>Laurentius.</hi> Of whom the latter will have the Midriff contrary to all other mu<U+017F>cles to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its end, and he will have the fibres which run out from the Circumference of the Che<U+017F>t, to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, and the ribs to be drawn to the nervous Circle, and <U+017F>o to cau<U+017F>e re<U+017F>piration.

For the Guts are driven down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Midriff when the Breath is blown out, and they a<U+017F>cend again when the Breath is drawn in, which al<U+017F>o any man without Anatomical Section, may perceive in him<U+017F>elf, by laying his Hand upon his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Now the motion of the Midriff ought to be <U+017F>uch, becau<U+017F>e the Che<U+017F>t when the Breath is drawn in, mu<U+017F>t be widened to receive and contain the Air and <U+017F>woln Lungs; and contrarywi<U+017F>e, when the Air is breathed out, the Che<U+017F>t ought to be <U+017F>traitned, becau<U+017F>e then the <U+017F>ooty vapours are expelled, and the Lungs flag and become <U+017F>mall again, and therefore in the former ca<U+017F>e the Midriff is lifted up, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed.</p>

               <p>If it happen to be in two great a quantity, Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Heart, and a <U+017F>uffocating death follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: if it be quite con<U+017F>umed, a Con<U+017F>umption of the body happens. But that it may be bread a fre<U+017F>h when it is <U+017F>pent, we <U+017F>ee clearly in tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag being wounded, the <U+017F>aid Liquor hath run out; for in <hi>Johannes Saviolus,</hi> his Heart-bag being wounded with a Dagger, water i<U+017F><U+017F>ued at every Pul<U+017F>e of his Heart, out of the wound, yet was he happily cured by the Renowned <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence this water <U+017F>hould have<note place="margin">Whence the liquor in the Heart-bag proceeds? The fir<U+017F>t Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> its original, the opinions of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men are different.</p>
               <p>I. The fir<U+017F>t Opinion is of tho<U+017F>e, who will have it to be <U+017F>ent out of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Heart, <U+017F>eeing Blood-letting cures the Panting of the Heart procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Super abundance of this Liquor: And they conceive that this wateri<U+017F>h Liquor is forced out by the fervent heat of the Heart, as in a <U+017F>tick of wood when it burns the <U+017F>ap runs out. Of kin to this is the Opinion of <hi>Nicolas Ma<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> which will have it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <U+017F>trainings of the blood, which come from the Liver to the Ear of the Heart. And <hi>Hofman</hi> is much of his mind, who maintaines that it is part of that wheyi<U+017F>h moi<U+017F>ture which a<U+017F>cends to the Heart with the blood; but becau<U+017F>e the motion thereof is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, there would no <U+017F>mal danger ari<U+017F>e, from <U+017F>o large an Afflux of Humors. I let pa<U+017F>s, how that the <U+017F>tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger per<U+017F>ons, who<U+017F>e blood is moved mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>wiftly, have le<U+017F>s quantity of this Water then tho<U+017F>e that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
               <p>II. Others, and among them <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>eems to make one, will have it to proceed from our drink, <U+017F>ome portion whereof they conceive peirces like Dew out of the <hi>A<U+017F>peria Arteria,</hi> into the <hi>Arteria Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<U+017F>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Some conceive it proceeds from a Watry matter in the Seed, as the inbred Air of the Ears, is thought to proceed from a windy matter in the <U+017F>aid <U+017F>eed.</p>
               <p>IV. Of kin hereunto is the opinion of <hi>Ja<U+017F>olinus,</hi> who will have it to be a <U+017F>elect, mo<U+017F>t perfect and Elaborate portion of the <U+017F>erons Humor, <U+017F>ent thither by Nature it <U+017F>elf, haply in the fir<U+017F>t formation of the Child, through the Veins and Arteries, be<U+017F>ides another part of the drink, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>peaks, and he has experiments touching the <U+017F>ame.</p>
               <p>V. Some <U+017F>ay it proceeds from the watry Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third dige<U+017F>tion.</p>
               <p>VI. Others from the <U+017F>pittle, <U+017F>lipping out of the Kernels of the Tongue into the Wezand, and from thence into the Arteries and Heart.</p>
               <p>VII. Others, from the fat of the Heart, by agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turned into water.</p>
               <p>VIII. Others from the thicker part of the Air which we draw in, being changed into water.</p>
               <p>IX. And la<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>ome think (which I conceive to be mo<U+017F>t likely) that it proceeds from moi<U+017F>t Vapors and Exhalations, forced out of the Humors of the Heart by the motion and Heat theerof, and thru<U+017F>t forth into the Heart-bag and there congealed into water, in regard of the compactne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>aid Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, I. To moi<U+017F>ten and cool the<note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note> Heart, and to facilitate the motion thereof. And therefore tho<U+017F>e in whom it is con<U+017F>umed, have their Hearts roa<U+017F>ted: As it happened to <hi>Ca<U+017F>imire</hi> the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41352:52"/>
Marques of <hi>Brandenburg:</hi> And to that young man of <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Panarolus. Hofmannus</hi> being of a contrary mind, will needs have it to be as a Spur and Incitement of Heat; as Smiths are wont to dip their wi<U+017F>ps of Straw in Water that they may burn the longer: And as Wood is <U+017F>prinkled with Water to make it burn more lu<U+017F>tily. But tho<U+017F>e bundles of Straw are pre<U+017F>erved by the water, becau<U+017F>e their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance being made more moi<U+017F>t and Tenacious, is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon con<U+017F>umed. But the heat of the Heart is pre<U+017F>erved by its radical moi<U+017F>ture, and by the blood continually flowing in, nor doth it need any Incitement from the Water, for if <U+017F>o, then the Heart would be more hot and lu<U+017F>ty in old per<U+017F>ons, who have mo<U+017F>t water in their Heart-bags, II. It <U+017F>erves to make fat by congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. III. That the Heart by <U+017F>wimming therein, may be le<U+017F>s ponderous, and may not <U+017F>trike again<U+017F>t any part.</p>
               <p>An HUMOR likewi<U+017F>e is commonly found in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of the <hi>Che<U+017F>t,</hi> re<U+017F>embling blood and water mingled together, wherewith the parts of the Che<U+017F>t are <U+017F>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they may not be overheated nor overdryed. Hence the <U+017F>ide of our Saviour being opened, blood and water flowed out, which by the <U+017F>uddan flux, and mixture of blood and the Authorities of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, I have at large proved, in my Di<U+017F>pute of the <U+017F>ide of Chri<U+017F>t, again<U+017F>t <hi>Laurentius, Arias Montanus, Bertinus, Nancelius, Poza, Tremellius, Beza, Tirinus, Grotius</hi> and others, who would have it to proceed from his Pericardium or Heart-bag, al<U+017F>o again<U+017F>t <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Tarnovius, Brentius, Laurenbergius</hi> among the late writers, and <hi>Cyprianus, Prudentius, Brigitta, Vida, Sannazarius, Vigerius, &amp;c.</hi> who would fetch it from the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Heart being wounded. Now the Objection of <hi>P. Laurenbergius</hi> is not worth a button, who <U+017F>aies there was not enough of the <U+017F>aid Liquor in the Cavity of the Che<U+017F>t; becau<U+017F>e 1. The natural quantity might <U+017F>uffice, <U+017F>eeing the Evangeli<U+017F>ts do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that it come away in a great quantity. 2. It might be augmented in that la<U+017F>t conflict for life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding the great perfection of his Body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Redemption made liable to temporary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, underwent death it <U+017F>elf. 3. I have at <hi>Padua</hi> <U+017F>omtimes ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>o great a quantity of Water in this part, that it hung down like a great pur<U+017F>e, the Midriff being depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by its weight. <hi>Ja<U+017F>olinus</hi> in wound of the Che<U+017F>t (the inner parts being unhurt) did <U+017F>omtimes collect every day five mea<U+017F>ures of water called <hi>Heminae,</hi> for thirty daies together, which the Membranes being inflamed, was dried up and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed, but when the Inflammation was cured, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in its former Quantity.</p>
               <p>In a Boy at <hi>Paris,</hi> who died of the <U+017F>mall pox, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>tore of water was found in this part, but of a green colour, of which el<U+017F>e-where.</p>

See al<U+017F>o <hi>Gellius</hi> book the 16. Chap. 15. <hi>Galen</hi> relates that bea<U+017F>ts <U+017F>acrificed have lowed at the Altar, after their Hearts were taken out; and the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> tells of a man who <U+017F>pake three or four words of a prayer, when his Heart was pluckt out of his Body, and in the hand of the Executioner. <hi>Plinie</hi> tells us the entrails were twice found without any Heart, when <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> <U+017F>acrificed, and <hi>Julius Ob<U+017F>equens</hi> <U+017F>aies the <U+017F>ame.

               <p>As to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive Quallities, the Heart is moi<U+017F>t, viz. more moi<U+017F>t then the Skin, but drier then the Mu<U+017F>cles, becau<U+017F>e harder: for the parts of the bodie, look how much <U+017F>ofter they are then the Skin, by <U+017F>o much are they moi<U+017F>ter then it.

               <p>The primary <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Heart.</p>
               <p>1. According to <hi>Harvey, Baccius,</hi> and other of his followers, is no other then to be the In<U+017F>trument of the Soul, to force and urge the venal blood received from the Ears into the Arteries, by who<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance it di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>es Nutriment to the whole body, and is rather joyned as an A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant to the Ears, that being of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force, it may <U+017F>upply the defect of the Ears.</p>

The nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of the Heart would not be <U+017F>o great as it is. 4.

the Heart, in that venal blood does not nouri<U+017F>h, before it enters the Heart.</p>
               <p>Now the primary action of the Heart is to be.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> whence it is <U+017F>pred into the whole body, whereby the parts are animated and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained. Swowneing teaches <U+017F>o much and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Heart, in which the heat of the Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted, the Members of the Body begin to flag and being de<U+017F>titute of heat, become <U+017F>tupid. And therefore cordials do good in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, which <U+017F>tir up the langui<U+017F>hing and nummed heat of the Heart. Al<U+017F>o the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of living Creatures does <U+017F>hew, that the Heart is hot, yea that the heart of a Creature being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and newly dead, a warm finger, or <U+017F>ome other warm thing being laid upon it, is <U+017F>een to come to its <U+017F>elf again and to <U+017F>tir, which the Lord <hi>Bacon Con<U+017F>tantine, Harvey,</hi> and others have ob<U+017F>erved in a Dove, an Eele, a Salmon, and a Man.</p>
               <p>It is therefore the Fountain of Heat, both in re<U+017F>pect of its <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> and of the <hi>Blood</hi> contained in it. I joyn both together. For the Heat <U+017F>prings not from the blood alone, as <hi>Harvey</hi> would have it, for the Heart in an Egg, and a Child in the Womb, before it is perfect and hollowed with ventricles, is hot and moves, and the <U+017F>ame heat remains in Hearts taken out of the Body and cut up. The blood which flows thither from the Coronary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, flowes thither for Nutritions <U+017F>ake and to pre<U+017F>erve the Heat. Nor are the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>anguine parts, therefore judged to be hotter then other parts becau<U+017F>e they more abound with any heat, but becau<U+017F>e they have Arteries full of arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood, and depend upon the influence of the heart, wherewith the blood is heated. So that unle<U+017F>s all the blood did pa<U+017F>s through the heart, the parts would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow hot, and the further the blood goes from the heart, by <U+017F>o much the <U+017F>loer in its motion, and the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it growes. That the coldne<U+017F>s of the heart makes the parts of the Bodie cold, though full of blood, the <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the Pul<U+017F>e is a <U+017F>ign.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Blood and Heart grow hot only from the motion of the Heart, as the followers of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> wil have it, for 1. they grant that the fiery atomes or indivi<U+017F>ible particles of fire, are excited and put into action by motion, though they are only brought into play, but not produced by the <U+017F>aid motion. 2. Many things are moved without waxeing hot, as water, unle<U+017F>s they have an inbred principle of heat. 3. Before moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was heat proceeding from the <U+017F>eminary origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is afterwards <hi>pre<U+017F>erved</hi> by continual motion.</p>
               <p>III. Not <U+017F>o much to make as to perfect the Blood.</p>
               <p>It makes Arterial Blood and perfects the venal, or that which<note place="margin">Whether the Heart doe perfect the Blood.</note> is contained in the Veins. For they are out who attribute too much to the heart, as if the heart alone did make blood of the Chylus, they al<U+017F>o are mi<U+017F>taken, who maintaine that the heart contributes nothing to blood-makeing. I goe in a middle way. The Liver challenges the fir<U+017F>t makeing of the blood of the Chylus, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demon<U+017F>trated, which becau<U+017F>e it is not there perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being to thick and unfit to nouri<U+017F>h, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that it <U+017F>hould receive its perfection from other parts. No part is fit for this work <U+017F>ave the heart, which is one of the fir<U+017F>t parts generated in the Womb, and through which in a grown per<U+017F>on all the blood in the body has its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. That the Lungs and heart-ears <U+017F>hould perform their Office, no man will beleive.</p>
               <p>The heart perfects <hi>two <U+017F>orts</hi> of <hi>Blood, that of the Liver</hi> and <hi>that of the Veins.</hi> That of the Liver is twofold, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>f Chyle. The <hi>Vein</hi> blood i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> likewi<U+017F>e twofold one of the de<U+017F>cendent trunk of vena cava, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the a<U+017F>cendent trunk of the <U+017F>aid vein. It receivs the Liver blood through the Cava, to which another joyns it <U+017F>elf out of the lower and upper Truuk, which remaining over and above after the parts are nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by its long journey is become pauled and <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h, and has lo<U+017F>t its heat, which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for pul<U+017F>ation and nutrition.</p>
               <p>This perfection which the Blood receivs from the heart, is hereby confirmed, in that the blood when it comes out of the left Ventricle, has not altogether the <U+017F>ame Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence nor Colour, which it had when it entred the right Ventricle. The diver<U+017F>ity con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in <hi>Heat</hi> and plenty of <hi>Spirits,</hi> wherewith it is furni<U+017F>hed when it goes out of the heart, and which it wants when it enters thereinto; and in <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Operation,</hi> for that which goes out is fit to nouri<U+017F>h, but that which enters in is mo<U+017F>t unfit, Vital Spirits are added by the inbred faculty of the heart, and the <U+017F>ooty vapors are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by that mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hort Concoction, being evacuated by the Lungs and Pericardium or heart-bag.</p>
               <p>For what parts does the heart perfect and renew the blood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ancients</hi> did beleive that the Heart made blood only to nouri<U+017F>h the <hi>Lungs.</hi> But the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the lungs are greater then is requi<U+017F>ite only for their Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there is continually more blood forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the pul<U+017F>ation of the right Ventricle, then could any waies be u<U+017F>eful for the Lungs, unle<U+017F>s they were to be nouri<U+017F>hed with as much blood as is <U+017F>ufficient for the whole Bodie. And that all is not con<U+017F>umed upon the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs, the blood which returnes is a witne<U+017F>s, which runs in great plenty at every pul<U+017F>ation, to the left Ventricle, through the Arteria veno<U+017F>a, which in live anatomies being tied, is <U+017F>een to <U+017F>well betwixt the ligature and the Lungs. For there is no way for it to return into the right Ventricle, the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>topped by the clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hutting of the mitre-fa<U+017F>hion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Valves.</p>
               <p>The right Ventricle therefore is bu<U+017F>ied about blood which is to be <U+017F>ent to nouri<U+017F>h the Lungs; the left doth perfect the blood which flows back from the Lungs, being there impraegnated with air, for the Nutrition of the whole Bodie. For the arterial blood alone is that which nouri<U+017F>hes, becau<U+017F>e it is only fit for nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it alone is forced through the Arteries into the utmo<U+017F>t parts of the Bodie.</p>
               <p>To perfect this blood many things<note place="margin">What things are requi<U+017F>ite to perfect the Blood?</note> concur. 1. <hi>Heat,</hi> which is very dull and la<U+017F>ie, as well in the crude blood of the Liver, as in the returning blood of the whole Body. 2. <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> which by the confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of all men, ought to be joyned therewith, 3. <hi>Light</hi> the companion of the Spirits, by which the blood receives a more Illu<U+017F>trious color, is moved and made fit for Nutrition. 4.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole,</hi> being the proper and natural motion of the heart, is a contraction and drawing of the heart into a narrow compa<U+017F>s, that the blood may by that means be forced out of the right Ventricle through the Vena Arterialis, into the Lungs, and out of the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle through the Aorta into the whole Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole,</hi> being an accidental motion, is the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart, that Blood may be drawn in through the Vena Cava into the right Ventricle, and through the Arteria veno<U+017F>a into the left,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peri-<U+017F>y<U+017F>tole</hi> is a certain re<U+017F>t and <U+017F>top going between both motions, when the Blood is about to enter into or go out of the Ventricles, <U+017F>o <U+017F>mal in healthy per<U+017F>ons that it cannot be di<U+017F>cerned, being very manife<U+017F>t in <U+017F>uch as are at the point of death, It is only one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sy<U+017F>tole and Dia<U+017F>tole, or between the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tole and Sy<U+017F>tole. This is the natural <U+017F>tate of the heart.</p>
               <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e motions two others are Ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
               <p>1. A certain Undation or waving towards one <U+017F>ide according to the carriage of the right Ventricle, as if it did gently wreath it <U+017F>elf, as we <U+017F>ee in an hor<U+017F>e when he is drinking; of which <hi>Harvey</hi> <U+017F>peaks. 2. A <hi>tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> motion of the Heart, when it is cut in <U+017F>under. The former depends upon the Situation of the right Ventricle: The latter is preternatural to the heart, not ari<U+017F>ing from other particles or <U+017F>mal Bodies, <U+017F>ent in by the Coronaria, which is then cut in <U+017F>under, but from the remainders of the vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>We are taught by the te<U+017F>timony of<note place="margin">The Heart takes in Blood in the Dia<U+017F>tole.</note> our Eyes, that in every <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> blood is plentifully received in, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> plentyfully expelled, both into the Vena Arterio<U+017F>a and the Aorta. This appears I <U+017F>ay to our Eye-<U+017F>ight.</p>
               <p>1. By Ligatures or bindings in live Anatomies. If the <hi>Cava</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> with the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Lungs <U+017F>hall be bound or pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed down with the Finger or any other In<U+017F>trument on either <U+017F>ide; we <U+017F>hall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>tly perceive that the part of the <hi>Cava</hi> which is in<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Heart is made empty; that in the <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> of the Ear, it is filled, and thereby the Heart; and that the other part of the A<U+017F>cendent and De<U+017F>cendent Vein, on this <U+017F>ide the Ligature, doth <U+017F>wel. In like manner, the <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a</hi> being tied near the heart, by the <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> of the left Ear, it is made void and empty on this <U+017F>ide the Ligature where it looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heart, but towards the Lungs it ari<U+017F>es and <U+017F>wels. The Arterial Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the heart, do <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves in a contrary fa<U+017F>hion: For the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>a</hi> being tied, it <U+017F>wels towards the heart, becau<U+017F>e it is filled by the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the right Ventricle; the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Magna</hi> being bound, <U+017F>wels between the heart and the Ligature, being filled by the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>2. Be<U+017F>ides the Ligatures, we may gather as much from the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els being opened or wounded. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Arterio<U+017F>a</hi> and the <hi>Aorta Arteria</hi> being opned by a Lancet, at every <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> or Elevation and Contraction of the heart, it pours forth plenty of blood, as long as the heart continues <U+017F>trong, for when it langui<U+017F>hes, it intermits <U+017F>ome Pul<U+017F>es, before it voids any Blood. Now we ob<U+017F>erve no <U+017F>uch thing, when the <hi>Cava</hi> or <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Veno<U+017F>a,</hi> are opened between the heart and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature.</p>

The Antients <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that a drop or two was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at a time, and that the blood did freely pa<U+017F>s and repa<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame way. But one drop of blood unaltered, is not able to fill the heart, nor doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it to pul<U+017F>ation, not to <U+017F>peak how the fore<U+017F>aid experiments do <U+017F>hew the plenty that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es to and fro. Now the Valves do hinder the free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age and repa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the blood by the <U+017F>ame waies, of which the three pointed ones or <hi>Tricu<U+017F>pides</hi> <U+017F>o called, do hinder the blood which enters the heart from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing back the <U+017F>ame way, and the Mitre-<U+017F>hap'd Valves do hinder the blood which goes out of the heart from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the <U+017F>ame way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Later Phy<U+017F>itians,</hi> are divided in their opinions. Some <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that a drop or two is either <U+017F>o rarified as to fill the heart, among<U+017F>t whom is <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> or is turned into <U+017F>pirit, as <hi>Riolanu's Primro<U+017F>e, Leichner</hi> and others <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, who mea<U+017F>ure it by grains, whom we <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer when we come to the <hi>Cau<U+017F>es:</hi> Others being Patrons and favourers of the circular motion of the blood, as <hi>Harvey, Walaeus, Conringius, Slegelius, &amp;c.</hi> do calculate the quantity, by ounces, drams and <U+017F>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>To clear up this Que<U+017F>tion, three things are to be con<U+017F>idered, 1. How much blood is contained in the Dia<U+017F>tole of the heart. 2. How much is expelled or driven out of the heart, in its Sy<U+017F>tole; whether all that enters the Heart in its Dia<U+017F>tole, is <U+017F>quirted out in the next Sy<U+017F>tole. 3. How many pul<U+017F>ations the heart makes in one hour; or how often the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <U+017F>omwhat by its Dia<U+017F>tole, and expels <U+017F>omwhat by its Sy<U+017F>tole, in the <U+017F>pace of an hour.</p>
               <p>1. In the heart being in its <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole, Harvey</hi> hath found above two ounces of blood. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Plempius</hi> found near upon two ounces of blood, in the left Ventricle of the heart of a man that was hanged. <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> will hardly allow half an ounce in the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of one that was hanged, and <U+017F>aies there was more blood in the right Ventricle. <hi>Hogeland</hi> al<U+017F>o wil have half an ounce or a dram at lea<U+017F>t, to enter, at every opening of the Ear.</p>
               <p>Now the quantity of all the blood contained in the body, doth <U+017F>eldom exceed twenty four pounds, or come <U+017F>hort of fifteen.</p>
               <p>2. In the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> there is expelled either a fourth part, or a fi<U+017F>t, or a <U+017F>ixt, or at lea<U+017F>t an eight, or all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is contained in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harvey</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es half an ounce in a man, or three drams, or one dram, in a Sheep and a Dog he <U+017F>aies a <U+017F>cruple. And he proves the <U+017F>ame by that <U+017F>uddain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion of all the blood, if the very lea<U+017F>t Artery be cut, and becau<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>pace of one half hour, all the blood may be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through the heart, he certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that in every Sy<U+017F>tole of the heart, much blood is expelled. <hi>Conringius</hi> approves of his Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Walaeus</hi> admits of half an ounce, but he <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>es only one <U+017F>cruple, as doth <hi>Slegelius. Regius</hi> has many times ob<U+017F>erved half an ounce, <U+017F>omtimes two or three drams, in the heart of a Dog di<U+017F><U+017F>ected. <hi>Hoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> contents him<U+017F>elf with a dram. I being more <U+017F>paring <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e half a <U+017F>cruple, in the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the quantity which i<U+017F><U+017F>ues in <U+017F>uch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore <hi>Conringius</hi> doth rightly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that abides there the <U+017F>pace of one or two Pul<U+017F>es, till by little and little it rai<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf, which I under<U+017F>tand of the reliques and part of the Blood, not of the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the foregoing Dia<U+017F>tole.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Primro<U+017F>e</hi> numbred in one hour 700 pul<U+017F>ations of the Heart. <hi>Riolanus 2000. Walaeus</hi> and <hi>Regius 3000, Harvey,</hi> 2000. in <U+017F>ome 4000, 6000, 8000. <hi>Cardan 4000. Plempius 4450. Slegelius</hi> 4876. I have told upon mine own wri<U+017F>t about 4400, But the number varies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Age, Temperament, Diet &amp;c. of every per<U+017F>on. So many Sy<U+017F>toles therefore and <U+017F>o many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>toles there will be in one hour, as long as the Heart is vigorous, for a langui<U+017F>hing heart has more Dia<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les then Sy<U+017F>toles.</p>
               <p>From the<U+017F>e three Praemi<U+017F>es I have calculated, how much blood may in an hour be <U+017F>quirted out of the Heart, by its <U+017F>undry pul<U+017F>ations.</p>

               <p>THe parts of the Heart which are <U+017F>pecially to be con<U+017F>idered are either externally <U+017F>een as the <hi>Earlets;</hi> or within only, as the <hi>Ventricles</hi> or two Cavities, the <hi>Septum</hi> or partition, and the <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> with the Valves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earlets</hi> or little Ears, were <U+017F>o termed, not from hearing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e<note place="margin">The Earlets of the Heart why <U+017F>o cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</note> of <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>emblance in their <U+017F>hape. For from a long Ba<U+017F>is they end in a blunt point (howbeit the left is more accumulated) of an obtu<U+017F>e triangle; and they have a Cavity, that the Ventricles might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before the Heart. For that <U+017F>ame pul<U+017F>ing Bladder in an Eg, is the Earlets,<note place="margin">What pul<U+017F>es fir<U+017F>t in an Eg.</note> becau<U+017F>e they were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in the Child in the Womb, though the Heart were not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, which afterwards grows upon the Bladder. Others give another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e the Earlets ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame proportion in their pul<U+017F>ing as the Bladder had. But this is very hard to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h in the fir<U+017F>t Generation. <hi>Others</hi> take the Bladder for the Heart, who<U+017F>e Expan<U+017F>ions or Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets appear red, becau<U+017F>e they are tran<U+017F>parent, but the Heart is not <U+017F>een by rea<U+017F>on of the plenty of Seed, and Pul<U+017F>e intermitted.

               <p>Now the EARLETS are Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es or Appendixes; and according to <hi>Hofman,</hi> nothing but the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Heart attenuated and widened.

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> therefore of both ventricles is in a manner the <hi><U+017F>ame,</hi> viz. to generate Arterial blood, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the venal, and to receive the <U+017F>ame running back from all parts of the body through the veins, and to expel the perfect blood through the Arteries into the farthe<U+017F>t parts of the body, that they may be thereby nouri<U+017F>hed. This is proved by the Conformations of the ventricles, which in part are like one to the other, in the right two ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, a Vein and an Artery carrying out, and bringing back and as many in the left. In the former are two <U+017F>orts of Valves the trebble poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Mitre-<U+017F>hap'd, and the like in the latter. The left expels and receives as much as the right, <U+017F>ave that it is con<U+017F>umed in nouri<U+017F>hing the Lungs and the Heart. Yet their different Con<U+017F>titution and Magnitude, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <U+017F>ome difference. Whence 1. There is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Coction in the one and other, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trated above. 2. The right works for the Lungs the left for the whole Body. 3. The right <U+017F>ends <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exhalations and blood to the Lungs; the left receives from the Lungs Blood Impraegnated with Aire.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Septum</hi> or <hi>Partition</hi> between the two Ventricles, which is thick like the other Wall of the left ventricle (which <hi>Columbus</hi> once ob<U+017F>erved to be Gri<U+017F>tley) hollow on the left <U+017F>ide, on the right bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, full of hollowne<U+017F><U+017F>es and holes. which <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e to be the third ventricle of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle;</hi> which hollowne<U+017F><U+017F>es or Caves are more large towards the right <U+017F>ide, but their utmo<U+017F>t ends towards the left <U+017F>ide are hardly di<U+017F>cernable. <hi>Helmont</hi> de<U+017F>cribes them to be triangular, who<U+017F>e Cone ending in the left ventricle, is ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>topped, but the Ba<U+017F>is of the <U+017F>aid triangle in the right ventricle, is never <U+017F>topped <U+017F>ave in Death.

And although by a Probe breaking the tender fle<U+017F>h of the Septum, we may ea<U+017F>ily make a way, yet we may not doubt of the Eyewitne<U+017F>s of <hi>Ga<U+017F><U+017F>endus</hi> nor of the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of <hi>Payanus;</hi> <U+017F>eeing I al<U+017F>o of late found the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sows Heart, in many places obliquely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated with manife<U+017F>t great Pores, which were open of them<U+017F>elves without the u<U+017F>e of a Probe, <U+017F>o as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a large Pea<U+017F>e; but when I put in my Probe, it brought me to the left ventricle, where a thin Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane as it were an Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is was placed, hindering any regre<U+017F>s. <hi>Riolanus</hi> al<U+017F>o hath <U+017F>een it bored through towards the point, where it is mo<U+017F>t thin. <hi>Walaeus</hi> in the Partition of an Oxes Heart, did <U+017F>omtimes find a Cavity in the upper part according to the length of the Heart, open into the left ventricle about the point

               <p>Yet are they not alwaies open in dead bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e in living bodies they are kept open, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual agitation of the Heart, which cea<U+017F>ing, they are not <U+017F>o vi<U+017F>ible to the Eye-<U+017F>ight, even as we <U+017F>ee no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, when the <U+017F>weat breaks out plentifully through the Skin, nor when the <U+017F>eed breakes out of the Kernels and Spermatick ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, into the Urinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>age: nor the Pores by which the Empyema or out of the blood out of the vena Arterio<U+017F>a peirces into the Arteria veno<U+017F>a, through the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs, or the blood in the Liver, out of the branches of Porta into the Cava. <hi>Cael<U+017F>us</hi> is in the right, where he <U+017F>aies, that nothing is more fooli<U+017F>h, then to think that look what and how it is in a living Man, <U+017F>o it mu<U+017F>t needs be in one that is dying, Yea that is dead. Whence many (as <hi>Columbus, Spigelius, Hofman, Harvey, &amp;c.</hi>) have denyed that any thing pa<U+017F><U+017F>es through this Septum or Partition. But it is no wonder that they make a doubt of it: For,</p>
               <p>I. They are <U+017F>o crooked and winding, that a Probe cannot ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F>s through them. Howbeit the<U+017F>e Pores become more con<U+017F>picuous, in the Heart of an Ox long boyled, as <hi>Bauhinus, Riolanus,</hi> my <U+017F>elf with others can witne<U+017F>s. And you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve, in oppo<U+017F>ition to <hi>Hofman</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> that deny it. that in the boyling a moderation mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed, and that the Fibres in living Bodies do never <U+017F>tick <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e together, but that they leave Pores, as the Nerves do <U+017F>hew, finally, that the quicke<U+017F>t-<U+017F>ighted Anatomi<U+017F>ts can <U+017F>ee no Membrane in the boyled Hearts of Oxen. II. In dead Bodies all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages fall in and <U+017F>hrink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. III. That an extream <U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s was requi<U+017F>ite in the End; becau<U+017F>e the thinne<U+017F>t part of the Blood, is <U+017F>trained as it were in that part: And in the mean time, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e holes are not in vain, therfore,</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Septum or Partition of the Heart, is, that the thinner<note place="margin">Whether the Blood pa<U+017F>s through the partition of the Heart?</note> blood may pa<U+017F>s there-through into the lef ventricle, for the Generation of vital blood and <U+017F>pirit, which is afterwards di<U+017F>tributed through the Arteries into the whole Body, for to pre<U+017F>erve and <U+017F>tir up the life and natural heat. But the thicker and greater part of the blood, by a natural and ordinary way, and not a violent only, is communicated to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria veno<U+017F>a, through the vena Arterio<U+017F>a, by mediation of the Lungs, that in the left ventricle it may be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that which <U+017F>weats through the Septum. The thicker part is ordained to nouri<U+017F>h the Lungs, and that it may return back to the left ventricle tis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Air. The thinner part pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Septum, nouri<U+017F>hes the <U+017F>ame in its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, becau<U+017F>e the external Coronary ve<U+017F><U+017F>els do only creep through, and in that long and dangerous journey through the Lungs, it would vani<U+017F>h away and come to nothing. By this way only <U+017F>uch as dive deep into the Sea, and tho<U+017F>e that are hanged for a <U+017F>mal while, do live a while and come to them<U+017F>elves, after the motion of their Lungs is cea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Septum</hi> or <hi>Partition</hi> doth help forward this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, which that it is moved according to the motion of the Ventricles, I have the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns and tokens; Becau<U+017F>e 1. It is furni<U+017F>hed with Circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, as well as the Walls, in a boyled Heart, <U+017F>uch in a manner as are in the Sphincter Mu<U+017F>cle, as <hi>Harvey</hi> te<U+017F>tifies, which <U+017F>eeing them move the Ventricles, they mu<U+017F>t as well move the Septum. 2. A certain Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is felt, if you put in your Finger into a living Heart, according to the ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Walaeus.</hi> 3. In Creatures ready to die, when the motion of the left ventricle cea<U+017F>es, the Septum follows the motion of the right Ventricle, as the <U+017F>ame <hi>Harvey</hi> ob<U+017F>erves: and if the right Ventricle be wounded, <hi>Riolanus</hi> tells us, that the motion remains in the Septum in his <hi>Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Yet the <U+017F>ame <hi>Riolanus</hi> in another place being wi<U+017F>er, denies that it is moveable, unle<U+017F>s towards the Ba<U+017F>is where it is <U+017F>oft gives way a little, and that <U+017F>o it ought to be that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age may be maintained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e when the Ventricles are dilated above the through-far'd Septum, and <U+017F>traitned again like Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the little holes would be <U+017F>hut up. But there is no fear. For in the Sy<U+017F>tole, when the point is drawn back to the Ba<U+017F>is, the Pores are opened in the Septum moved upwards, that the blood may at once pa<U+017F>s both the Septum and the Lungs. Contrarywi<U+017F>e in the Dia<U+017F>tole, becau<U+017F>e the Heart is di<U+017F>tended long waies, the pores are drawn back with the Septum, and are <U+017F>hut up, until the Heart be filled.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Heart-ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> there are found<note place="margin">Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Heart.</note> four remarkeable ones going out of the Heart which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes of Humane Nature. Into the right Ventricle are in<U+017F>erted two Veins; the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>a;</hi> into the left, as many Arteries; <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a</hi> and <hi>Arteria Magna.</hi> Before all which are placed within eleven <hi>Valves</hi> or little dores, made of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els widened and <U+017F>tretched out. The Veins which bring in to the Heart, viz. the Cava and Arteria veno<U+017F>a, have trebble-pointed valves, looking from without inwards; the Arteries which <hi>carry away,</hi> viz. the Aorta and the Vena Arterio<U+017F>a, have Sigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hap'd or Mitre-fa<U+017F>hion'd valves open inwards, <U+017F>hut outwards. The former admit blood into the Heart; being open they <U+017F>uffer the blood to flow out, being <U+017F>hut they hinder it from returning the <U+017F>ame way. The trebble-pointed valves do not only wink, but they are clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut by the blood di<U+017F>tending the Heart, and by the con<U+017F>triction of the Heart which <U+017F>traitens the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. The Sigmoides or Sigma-<U+017F>hap'd are <U+017F>hut by the Relaxation and falling in of the Heart in the Dia<U+017F>tole, whereby the Fibres being <U+017F>tretched out long-waies, they are drawn downwards with the Walls and <U+017F>o <U+017F>hut, like the Chains in Draw-bridges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trebble-pointed</hi> or <hi>Tricu<U+017F>pides,</hi> are opened by the impul<U+017F>e of new blood through the Cava, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria veno<U+017F>a, and the Dia<U+017F>tole of the Heart, whereby the Fibres being drawn downwards, they are opened; But the Mitre-<U+017F>hap'd valves, are open'd in the Sy<U+017F>tole by the Con<U+017F>triction of the Heart, and the blood urgeing its way out. Al<U+017F>o they may be praeternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>hut, by the blood expelled and <U+017F>tanding <U+017F>eated in the full ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells, to which, endeavouring to run back, they make re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance by rea<U+017F>on of their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which Artifice of Nature, we <U+017F>ee every where imitated by the Flood-gates and Locks made upon Rivers. But that according to nature they are not <U+017F>hut by the returning of the expul<U+017F>ed blood, as <U+017F>ome conceive <hi>Walaeus</hi> proves, Becau<U+017F>e 1. Our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve that the blood is carried from the Heart, not to the Heart by the Arteries. 2. In a rare and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hing Pul<U+017F>e, the Artery doth not ri<U+017F>e or <U+017F>wel la<U+017F>t in the upper part towards the Heart, but it <U+017F>wels there fir<U+017F>t. 3. If an Artery be tied two fingers from the Heart, and it be <U+017F>o opened betwixt the Ligature and the valves, that the blood may freely pa<U+017F>s forth, yet the valves will divers times <U+017F>traitly be <U+017F>hut, and the Heart is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly moved.</p>

Moreover, re<U+017F>ting upon the Arteria Magna and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the left <U+017F>ide, it goes to the right and left parts of the Lungs with a double branch, a right and a left: Which afterward <U+017F>pend them<U+017F>elves into <U+017F>undry branches in the Lungs.</p>
               <p>It <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to receive blood out of the<note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note> right Ventricle, and to carry it to the Lungs for their nouri<U+017F>hment, and according to the ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of latter Authors, to pa<U+017F>s over the re<U+017F>t of the blood through the Arteria veno<U+017F>a into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and to hinder the blood from <U+017F>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding back again into the heart.</p>
               <p>Three VALVES are placed therein,<note place="margin">The Sigma-fa<U+017F>hioned Valves.</note> ari<U+017F>ing from the Coat of the vein it <U+017F>elf, looking from without inwards, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embling an half Circle, or the letter Sigma, as it was anciently figured, and did re<U+017F>emble the Latine letter C.</p>
               <p>The ARTERIA VENOSA, which others<note place="margin">The Arteria veno<U+017F>a, why an Arterie?</note> call <hi>Vena Pulmonaria,</hi> is the third Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el of the heart, which is <U+017F>een in the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>It is termed an Artery becau<U+017F>e of its Office: For I. It Pul<U+017F>es in a grown per<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e it is united to the left Ventricle, but it moves not by a proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its own, becau<U+017F>e it is neither an Artery, nor doth it carry pure Arterial blood. II. It is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>Tis called a VEIN, 1. Becau<U+017F>e of its<note place="margin">Why a vein.</note> Sub<U+017F>tance. 2. Becau<U+017F>e in a Child in the Womb, it performs the office of a vein. And it is produced as it were from the Cava, to which it is joyned, by way of Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is. Yea and in a grown per<U+017F>on, it carries blood al<U+017F>o to the heart, as doth the Cava.</p>
               <p>It <hi>Ari<U+017F>es</hi> with a round and great Orifice (greater then that of the Arteria Magna) divided into two parts pre<U+017F>ently after its egre<U+017F>s, ju<U+017F>t in a manner as if it aro<U+017F>e with a twofold mouth; and it is di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated into the right and left part of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>The U<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>I. In its Dilatation to draw Air to<note place="margin">Whether Air enters into the Heart?</note> the heart, not bare and <U+017F>imple Air, but mixed with the blood which returns from the Lungs, for the Generation of vital <U+017F>pirits and Arterial blood, and to nouri<U+017F>h and kindle up the vital flame. For the Arteria veno<U+017F>a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened in living Anatomies, doth pour blood and not pure air into the heart, which for the mo<U+017F>t part we ob<U+017F>erve thicker then ordinary in the Carca<U+017F><U+017F>es of Men and Bea<U+017F>ts, becau<U+017F>e the motion of the left ventricle cea<U+017F>ing, the blood received in this vein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be driven or drawn to the heart. And when the Arteria veno<U+017F>a is cut or opened, there appears no air, becau<U+017F>e the air is not pure and <U+017F>imple, being mixed throughout with blood. And when the Lungs of a living or dead Creature are by Art blown up, not a jot of air is perceived to come thence to the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Carriage of blood is wanting, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Drawer and Driver is al<U+017F>o wanting. But that the air <U+017F>uch as it is, doth come into the heart, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples do te<U+017F>tifie, who have been <U+017F>tifled with the <U+017F>ums of Quick-<U+017F>ilver. Coles, Lime, &amp;c. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e the Lungs and Lung-pipes were made in vain.</p>
               <p>II. In the Contraction of the Heart to thru<U+017F>t out a portion of vital blood, into the Lungs, together with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41352:61"/>
<U+017F>ooty exhalations; which is an old opinion. But that in the Sy<U+017F>tole of the heart, blood or <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>teams <U+017F>hould be carried this way. 1. The Valves hinder, which will not <U+017F>uffer any thing to return. 2. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria veno<U+017F>a being tied, doth <U+017F>wel towards the Lungs, and is lank and emptied near the heart. 3. Being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it pours forth blood on this <U+017F>ide the band, but beyond it being opened it voids neither blood nor <U+017F>ooty exhalations. 4. The <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>teams of the right Ventricle, do evaporate through the vena Arterio<U+017F>a, turn into water in the Pericardium or Heart-bag, breed the hairs in the Arm-pits, and exale into the whole habit of the Body, through the Aorta. 5. The air which goes into the heart, and the <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>teams which go out with the blood, <U+017F>hould be carried the <U+017F>ame way, in contrary motions, which is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<U+017F>al in the natural cour<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erved in the body. For though ever and anon Excrements are driven from and Nutriment is drawn to the <U+017F>ame part, yet the way is different, e<U+017F>pecially where the afflux is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, as in the Arteria veno<U+017F>a from the Lungs; or at lea<U+017F>t they are performed at different times. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>III. In the contraction of the heart, it drives blood which is <U+017F>uperfluous after the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Lungs, or that which runs back, out of the vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio<U+017F>a, into the left Ventricle of the heart.</p>
               <p>Two VALVES only are placed at the Orifice of this ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which look from<note place="margin">The Mitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hap'd Valves.</note> without inwards (bred out of the Nervous circle which grows out of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the heart) which being joyned together do re<U+017F>emble a Bi<U+017F>hops Mitre, They are greater then the Valves of the Cava, have longer threds (and each hath <U+017F>even large ones, be<U+017F>ides little ones annexed to them, which from a broad Ba<U+017F>is do commonly end into a <U+017F>harp point) and for <U+017F>trengths <U+017F>ake very many fle<U+017F>hy Explantations. Therefore two were <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>hut the Orifice clo<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e they are greater then others, the Fibres longer and larger, the Columnes or Pillars <U+017F>tronger, and the Orifice it <U+017F>elf is more Ovall-<U+017F>hap'd, then that of the re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The ARTERIA MAGNA or <hi>great Artery</hi> <U+017F>o called, becau<U+017F>e it is the root of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">The Arteria Magna.</note> is another ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of the left Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, from whence it proceeds and ari<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>At the Orifice hereof, is placed in<U+017F>tead of a Prop, not in Men, but in certain Bea<U+017F>ts, as Harts, Oxen, Hor<U+017F>es, &amp;c. a certain hard <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which is <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gri<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>omtimes Boney, according to the greatne<U+017F>s and Age of the Bea<U+017F>ts. In man the mo<U+017F>t noble and <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, <hi>Harvey</hi> <U+017F>aw a portion of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery turned into a round bone, near the Heart, whence he concludes that the Dia<U+017F>tole of the Arteries, is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed by the blood alone, not by any Pul<U+017F>ifick faculty, derived through the Membranes. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Johannes Schroderus</hi> writes that the meeting together of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in the Ba<U+017F>is of the Heart, was in an heart dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a bone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is, to communicate the Vital <U+017F>pirit, with the Nutritive Arterial<note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note> blood, received from the heart, unto all parts of the Body, for Nutrition and life; which that it may not pa<U+017F>s back again into the heart, Three Valves are placed (like tho<U+017F>e in the vena Arterio<U+017F>a exactly <U+017F>hut) looking from<note place="margin">Its Valves.</note> without inwards, which are termed Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miodes or Sigma-<U+017F>hap'd Valves.</p>

                  <hi>of the</hi> VESSELS of the Heart in a Child in the Womb, are twofold:</p>
               <p>One is made by an <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is,</hi> another by a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is</hi> an Union is made of the Vena Cava and the Arteria Veno<U+017F>a, under the right Earlet, near the Coronaria, before the Cava doth ab<U+017F>olutely open it <U+017F>elf into the right Ventricle. The hole is large and of an Oval Figure.</p>
               <p>Now Nature contrived this Union by way of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is, 1. By rea<U+017F>on of Vicinity. 2. Becau<U+017F>e of the likene<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances.</p>
               <p>Before this hole in the Cavity of Arteria veno<U+017F>a is placed a Pendulous, thin, hard, little Membrane, larger then the hole.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, I. According to the Doctrin<note place="margin">Its various U<U+017F>es.</note> of <hi>Galen</hi> and his Clients, that the blood may be carried through this hole, out of the Cava into the Arteria veno<U+017F>a (not into the right ventricle, for vital <U+017F>pirit is not yet bred, nor do the Lungs need blood <U+017F>o attenuated) to nouri<U+017F>h the Lungs; becau<U+017F>e they could not otherwi<U+017F>e be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed in a Child in the Womb, becau<U+017F>e in it the heart hath no motion whereby the blood might be forced out of the right ventricle into the vena Arterio<U+017F>a: And therefore this Arteria veno<U+017F>a, is a vein in the Child in the Womb. But that it <U+017F>erves the turn of the Heart, and not only to nouri<U+017F>h the Lungs, divers things <hi>Evince</hi> ob<U+017F>erved by the favorers of the Circular Motion. For 1. The Heart is moved even in an imperfect Child, after the third moneth, as Egs and Embryo's do te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. But before the third moneth only a little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Earlet pants, as in In<U+017F>ects before the Heart is perfectly hollowed. But this motion were in vain, if the Heart <U+017F>hould not receive or expel any thing. 2. The blood by the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is is immediately poured into the left Ear, and is nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily thence conveighed by the Sy<U+017F>tole of the Heart, into the left ventricle. 3.

               <p>The <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is, I.

But, 1. It <U+017F>erves not the Lungs alone. 2. The Navil-Arteries do bring out of the Arteria Magna, but carry nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. 3. The Pipe is greater then to <U+017F>erve only to carry Spirits. 4. The Lungs of a Child in the Womb being red, are not nouri<U+017F>hed only with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>

               <p>III. According to late Writers, that the blood which <U+017F>lides out of the upper Trunk of Cava into the right ventricle may pa<U+017F>s through this Pipe, the greate<U+017F>t part thereof indeed to the Aorta, that <U+017F>o with the re<U+017F>t it may nouri<U+017F>h and enliven the whole body of the Embryo; but the lea<U+017F>t portion of all goes up to the Lungs by the ordinary way.</p>
               <p>Both the ventricles in the Child perform one and the <U+017F>ame thing, and part the blood which is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, becau<U+017F>e the more perfect blood is <U+017F>upplied by the Mother, and therefore the Walls are a like thick. And the two ventricles in the Child which doth not re<U+017F>pire, perform the <U+017F>ame, which in imperfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals void of Lungs, is accompli<U+017F>hed by one ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>This Pipe therefore a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is in tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the blood of the Heart, becau<U+017F>e either of the waies would otherwi<U+017F>e be two narrow. For I have ob<U+017F>erved in a Girle new Borne, by me publickly di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ected, that the Pipe was wanting, becau<U+017F>e the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is was larger then ordinary: and there is rea<U+017F>on for it. The Lungs mu<U+017F>t be nouri<U+017F>hed and the whole body mu<U+017F>t be nouri<U+017F>hed. Which can never be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unle<U+017F>s the Arterial Blood be di<U+017F>tributed out of the Aorta. It comes not from the Mother through the Iliack Arteries, becau<U+017F>e they are not joyned to the Arteries of the Womb, be<U+017F>ides their motion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as the binding of the Navil Arteries doth <U+017F>hew. For the Navil-Arteries derived from the Child, do <U+017F>wel towards the Heart thereof, and towards the Placenta or Womb-cake they are empty; for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood in the Child<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> after it is nouri<U+017F>hed, runs back through the Iliack veins to the Placenta, as a part of the Child which mu<U+017F>t be nouri<U+017F>hed, out of which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es again into the Navil-veins, and is mixed with that other blood which comes out of the veins of the Womb, and runs joyntly back again to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Heart of the Child, that the Circulation may be repeated. Now it flows conveniently out of this vena Arterio<U+017F>a through the Pipe or Channel into the Aorta, by rea<U+017F>on of its Situation downwards, and its crooked in<U+017F>ertion into the Aorta.

The air may ea<U+017F>ily be conden<U+017F>ed, as may be proved by a thou<U+017F>and experiments, as by Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, Whips, Trumpets, Winds and infinite things be<U+017F>ide; and therefore it may be mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>traitly compacted about the Che<U+017F>t, and compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed within it <U+017F>elf, as well by the internal <U+017F>ubtile nature of the air and di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed by Atomes, ea<U+017F>ily recollected one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another, as by the external impul<U+017F>e of the Che<U+017F>t, whereby it may more ea<U+017F>ily be conden<U+017F>ed, then driven into another place. 2, By the motion of the Che<U+017F>t or <U+017F>uch a like body, we do not <U+017F>ee the lighte<U+017F>t thing that is, Agitated. By an hole in a Wall all Chinks and Dores being clo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>topped, our No<U+017F>trils being <U+017F>topped, we may with our Mouthes draw air out of the next Chamber, to which it is not credible that the air moved by the Che<U+017F>t, can reach with a <U+017F>trong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though air may penetrate into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, through <U+017F>ome chinks and Rifts, yet is it not in <U+017F>o great quantity, as to <U+017F>tretch the Che<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much as it ought to be <U+017F>tretched, in free Re<U+017F>piration. The <U+017F>ame experiment may be made in a Gla<U+017F>s or Silver ve<U+017F><U+017F>el applied clo<U+017F>e to ones Mouth. 4. While I have held my Breath, I have ob<U+017F>erved my Belly to be moved above twenty times the while. But whether is the Air then driven?

               <p>Therefore the Lungs do only follow the motion of the Che<U+017F>t to avoid <hi>Vacuum:</hi> And therefore only they receive the air drawn in, becau<U+017F>e the Che<U+017F>t by wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it <U+017F>elf, fils the Lungs with air.</p>

For 1. If air enter into the Che<U+017F>t, being peirced through with a Wound, the Lungs remain immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becau<U+017F>e they cannot follow the widening of the Che<U+017F>t, the air in<U+017F>inuating it <U+017F>elf through the wound, into the empty <U+017F>pace. But the Che<U+017F>t being <U+017F>ound, the Lungs follow the widening thereof, to avoid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum; as in Pipes, Water is drawn upwards, and Quittor, Bullets, Darts and other hard things are drawn out of body through the avoidance of Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 2. If the Midriff of a live Creature be peirced through with a light wound, Re<U+017F>piration is <U+017F>topped, the Che<U+017F>t falling in.</p>

But according to the Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Johannes Walaeus, Franci<U+017F>cus Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Franci<U+017F>cus Vander Shagen,</hi> that is not the motion of Con<U+017F>triction and Dilatation, which is the natural motion of the Lungs; but it is the motion of an whole Lobe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, which motion happens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Lungs are fa<U+017F>ten'd to the Media<U+017F>tinum, the Media<U+017F>tinum to the Midriff, and the Lungs are al<U+017F>o

               </list>
               <p>When the Lungs are Dilated, they receive in the Air like a pair of Bellows through the Branches of the Wind-pipe.</p>
               <p>I. To prepare Aire for the Heart, for the convenient nouri<U+017F>hment of the<note place="margin">All kind of Air is not a friend to mans Spirit.</note> lightful Spirit. For every quality of the Aire is not a friend to our Spirit, as is <U+017F>een in <U+017F>uch, as are kild with the <U+017F>moak of Charcole, and the <U+017F>team of newly whited Walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helmont</hi> conceives that the Air is united to the <U+017F>pirit of the Heart, and that it receives a fermentation in the Heart, which accompanying the <U+017F>ame they do both di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the Blood to a total tran<U+017F>piration of it <U+017F>elf, which is the rea<U+017F>on why in the extremity of cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and at Sea, we eat more heartily, becau<U+017F>e the thinne<U+017F>s of the Air di<U+017F>po<U+017F>es the blood to in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible tran<U+017F>piration. <hi>Backius</hi> is <U+017F>omwhat of the <U+017F>ame mind, who conceives that by the moi<U+017F>t and thin body of the Air, the blood is made apt to run, <U+017F>o as that it may be diffu<U+017F>ed into the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Body. Others a<U+017F>cribe both the<U+017F>e effects to the abundance of Sero<U+017F>ity in the Blood. Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aies that water is hungry; and we <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>uch as are given to drink, are enclined to <U+017F>weat much, as al<U+017F>o Scorbutick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons.</p>
               <p>II. To fan and cool the heat. For we <U+017F>ee that the heat of our Bodies <U+017F>tands in<note place="margin">Our heat doth want a Cooler.</note> need of <U+017F>omwhat that is cold, without which it is extingui<U+017F>hed, as is apparent in <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>tay long in very hot Baths, as the flame of a Candle in a clo<U+017F>e place, wanting Air goes out. And<note place="margin">Why Fi<U+017F>hes need no Lungs.</note> therefore the Lungs are called the Fan and cooler of the Heart, and the Fi<U+017F>hes in the Water and other Animals that have but on Ventricle in their Hearts, are without Lungs, becau<U+017F>e they do not want <U+017F>uch a cooling. As al<U+017F>o Infants in the<note place="margin">The Lungs of Children in the Womb move not.</note> Womb, being fanned by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the wide Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es, have their Lungs without motion. Hence it is that having <U+017F>een only the Lungs, you may judg how hot any Creature is; for Nature makes the Lungs the larger, by how much the Heart is hotter. Therefore the Lungs are not ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to Life, but <U+017F>erve to accommodate the Heart. For in<U+017F>tead of Lungs a boy of <hi>Am<U+017F>terdam</hi> four years old, had a little Bladder ful of a Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wind, as <hi>Nicolas Fontanus</hi> a Phy<U+017F>itian of that Citty doth te<U+017F>tifie, which being guarded with very <U+017F>mal Veins, had its original from the A<U+017F>pera Arteria or We<U+017F>and it <U+017F>elf, who<U+017F>e office it is to cool the Heart. Who neverthele<U+017F>s died of a Con<U+017F>umption, becau<U+017F>e haply, his Heart was not furni<U+017F>hed with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Air.</p>
               <p>When the Lungs are contracted in Expiration, they do again afford us a twofold u<U+017F>e. I. Sooty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements do pa<U+017F>s away through the <U+017F>ame, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Heart with the blood, through the Vena Arterio<U+017F>a. II.

For which intent the mouths of the Vena arterio<U+017F>a do <U+017F>o artificially joyn with the Mouths of the A<U+017F>pera arteria, that there is pa<U+017F><U+017F>age only for <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>teams but not for blood, unle<U+017F>s it come away by force and violent Coughing.

And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vocal Organ. A wonder therefore it is that <U+017F>ome Men can live long in the Water like Fi<U+017F>hes, by Nature and not by Art, if <hi>Cardan</hi> is to be believed in the <U+017F>econd Book <hi>de Subtilitate,</hi> when he makes relation of one <hi>Calanus</hi> a Diver in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who would lie three or four hours under the Water. And how in the <hi>We<U+017F>t-indies</hi> everywhere, <U+017F>uch as dive for Pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oy<U+017F>ters, will lie an hour together under the Water. If they did this by <U+017F>ome art, it were not <U+017F>o wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So the Aegyptians are mo<U+017F>t perfect divers, and exerci<U+017F>e Robberies that way. For as appears by the De<U+017F>cription of <hi>Nicolus Chri<U+017F>tophori Radzivilij</hi> his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Hieru<U+017F>alem,</hi> they lie lurking under the Waters, and not being content to <U+017F>teal on land, what ever they can catch they draw into the water, and carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and frequently they catch a man as he lies upon a Ships deck draw him under the water and kill and <U+017F>trip him of his cloathes: So that <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ail are <U+017F>aid many times to watch all night armed, And in the <U+017F>ame parts, aboundance of fi<U+017F>her men will dive under the water and catch fi<U+017F>h with their hands, and they will come up with a fi<U+017F>h in cach Hand and a third in their mouths. The<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons doubtle<U+017F>s, do either live only by Tran<U+017F>piration, as <U+017F>uch do that have fits of the Apoplexy and the Mother; or they have Ana<U+017F>tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es open in their Hearts, by means of which as in the Womb, the blood is freely moved<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs.</p>

               <p>Tis <hi>Situate</hi> in the Neck, and that in<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> the middle thereof, for it is</p>

               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is round and almo<U+017F>t circular;<note place="margin">Shape.</note> becau<U+017F>e it was to be hollow for the voices <U+017F>ake; but on the fore<U+017F>ide it is more Extuberant, on the hinder <U+017F>ide depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that it may give way to the Gullet, e<U+017F>pecially in the time of <U+017F>wallowing, in which while the <hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagus</hi> is depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, the <hi>Larynx</hi> runs back upwards, and <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the <U+017F>wallowing, both by giving way and bearing down that which is to be <U+017F>wallowed.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies according to<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> the Ages of per<U+017F>ons. For in younger per<U+017F>ons the Larynx is <U+017F>trait which<note place="margin">How the voice becomes <U+017F>hril, or big?</note> makes their voice <U+017F>hril: in grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons tis wider, and therefore their voice is bigger. To which al<U+017F>o the length or <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of the Larynx doth contribute: and if plenty of Air or Spirit be drawn and expelled, the Voice becomes big; if little, it becomes <U+017F>mal.</p>
               <p>And therefore according to <hi>Galen</hi> there are two cau<U+017F>es of a great Voice:<note place="margin">What the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es are of a great Voice?</note> the Largene<U+017F>s of the A<U+017F>pera arteria, and the <U+017F>trong blowing out of the air, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aies both the<U+017F>e are cau<U+017F>ed by great hear.

               <p>It is judged, by contracting the <U+017F>ides of the Scuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis, to <U+017F>traiten the Chink: but it is no Servant to the Larynx unle<U+017F>s by accident.</p>

If it be broad and <U+017F>pred out <U+017F>ide-waies, it may be divided into two pair, the <hi>foremore</hi> and the <hi><U+017F>ide pair,</hi> and <U+017F>o <hi>Riolanus</hi> divides it. But it is for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>ingle and <U+017F>mal enough.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to draw the Cartilago Annularis to the Scutiformis.

               <p>The <hi><U+017F>econd Pair</hi> ri<U+017F>es from the back <U+017F>ide of the Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, with a fle<U+017F>hy orignal, and is implanted into the lower part of the <hi>Glottalis</hi> or <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> with a Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous end, opening the Larynx, by drawing a<U+017F>under the two Gri<U+017F>tles called <hi>Arytaenoides.</hi> And therefore they are called <hi>Par Cricoarythenoides po<U+017F>ticum.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third pair, Cricoarythenoides laterale,</hi> ari<U+017F>es above from the <U+017F>ides of the Annularis, and is in<U+017F>erted at the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Glottalis,</hi> into the joynt, there where it is not touched by the former, and opens the Larynx, with the <U+017F>ame oblique carriage of the Gri<U+017F>tles.</p>
               <p>The fourth pair, called <hi>Thyroarytenoides,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and very broad, proceeds from the Scutiformis, viz. from its inner and fore part, and from the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coides</hi> likewi<U+017F>e, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pects, and ends into the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Glottalis,</hi> or the <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> which while it contracts and draws to the <hi>Thyroides,</hi> it <U+017F>huts the Larynx, by a <U+017F>traight pa<U+017F><U+017F>age.

               </p>
               <p>For <hi>it is to be noted,</hi> that all the proper Mu<U+017F>cles of the Larynx, are ordained either to contract or widen the Chink, which that it may be the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently accompli<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>ome of them widen and <U+017F>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>Thyroides,</hi> others the <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> which Gri<U+017F>tles do compa<U+017F>s the Chink, which being drawn in, or widene<U+017F>t, the Chink is withal made narrower or wider.

               <p>The <hi>Epiglottis</hi> in Mankind has no Mu<U+017F>cle; for it is not voluntarily moved in Men, as <U+017F>ome vainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade them<U+017F>elves; but is only depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the weight of <U+017F>uch things as are <U+017F>wallowed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Gri<U+017F>tles</hi> of the Larynx <hi>are five:</hi>

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the Neck is, 1. For the Oe<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, We<U+017F>and, and Lungs.

               <p>IN the Head there is the greate<U+017F>t plenty of Hair, therefore the Nature of the Hair may conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be delivered in this place: though con<U+017F>idered as an Excrement, it does not belong to this place.</p>
               <p>Hairs are found well-near in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">What crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have Hair.</note> that engender their young ones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bodies, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead whereof Fi<U+017F>hes have <U+017F>cales, Birds feathers, and <U+017F>ome Bea<U+017F>ts as the Hedg-hog, have long <U+017F>harp prickles.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Hairs</hi> are indeed Bodies, but not parts of the body, unle<U+017F>s in a very large <U+017F>ignification, as when we <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome parts <U+017F>erve only to adorn the body.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Matter in which,</hi> or the <hi>Place</hi> where hairs are bred, ought not to be too moi<U+017F>t, nor too dry; as we <U+017F>ee nothing grow in a wet fuliginous Soyle, nor in ground over dry and parched.</p>

Now the fore-part of the Head is here to be under<U+017F>tood, which is commonly the only bald place; for no man, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> becomes bald on the hinder-part of his Head. For either Fat or other moi<U+017F>ture in the hinder-part and the Temples keep them from baldne<U+017F>s; fat in the fore-part, the Skin becomes dry and hard like a <U+017F>hell, and therefore is bald.</item>
                  <item>3. By rea<U+017F>on of too much or too little heat.

               <p>The Hairs which grow afterwards, are <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>pring up when a man comes to a ju<U+017F>t age; that is, in a boy when he begins to breed Sperm, and in a Maid when her Cour<U+017F>es break forth, for then the Skin grows open.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o the<U+017F>e are threefold: for 1. Hairs breed on the Share, <U+017F>eldom in the Womb and the Heart. 2. In the Arm-pits, al<U+017F>o in the No<U+017F>trils and Ears. 3.

Nor do they retain a vegetative life in dead per<U+017F>ons, for <U+017F>o the whole man <U+017F>hould not die, nor is there any thing in a dead Carka<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>hould rather pre<U+017F>erve this life, then the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive or rational, not to <U+017F>ay that the<U+017F>e ignoble Parts by the long-la<U+017F>ting of their lives, <U+017F>hould excel all other parts. Plants indeed <U+017F>pring living from the lifele<U+017F>s Earth, but out of a living Seed, which I deny to be in the Hairs, and therefore they <U+017F>tick not in the Body like Plants, nor are bred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Nor mu<U+017F>t we <U+017F>ay with <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of life remain after death, as warmed rooms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hot, when the fire is out; for <U+017F>uch Reliques of life could not remain <U+017F>o many years. The form ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the hairs may be de<U+017F>cribed by their accidents, which are the<U+017F>e following.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Magnitude:</hi> Now the Head-hairs are longe<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e the Brain is greater<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> then the re<U+017F>t of the Kernels: al<U+017F>o they are thicke<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e the Skin of the Head is mo<U+017F>t thick, howbeit it is laxe and open, and contains <U+017F>ufficient moi<U+017F>ture.</p>
               <p>According therefore as the Skin is thick or thin, rare or compact, and the humor plentiful or <U+017F>canty, and the heat weak or <U+017F>trong, the hairs become thick or thin, hard or <U+017F>oft, plentiful or <U+017F>canty, &amp;c. He had <U+017F>tore of hair on his Head, who could <U+017F>uffer him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>hot in the head with a bullet, and had no hurt, whom <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bequius</hi> <U+017F>aw in his Voyage to <hi>Con<U+017F>tantinople.</hi> Yet they grow not infinitely, becau<U+017F>e the Exhalations are not <U+017F>o plentiful, nor does the expul<U+017F>ive Faculty work infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
               <p>2. Their <hi>Figure:</hi> The hairs are <U+017F>traight and flat, in <U+017F>uch as abound with moi<U+017F>ture, but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">Figure.</note> in <U+017F>uch as are dry. Therefore curled hair is harder then that which lies flat. Hence all Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores are curle-pated, becau<U+017F>e of their dry Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Scythians and Thracians have long flat hair, becau<U+017F>e they are moi<U+017F>t, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the hairs are <U+017F>traight becau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages through which they break forth; and cri<U+017F>p becau<U+017F>e of the crookedne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>aid pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages. The augmenting Gla<U+017F>s informs us that the hairs are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular; though others will have them to be round becau<U+017F>e of the roundne<U+017F>s of the Pores.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o they are porous or hollow within, as the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e <hi>Plica</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> does <U+017F>hew, and the hairs of an Elk. Again becau<U+017F>e they may be <U+017F>plit, they have Pores, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totles</hi> maxime.</p>
               <p>III. Their <hi>Colour:</hi> which in Brutes follows the colour of the Skin; and in<note place="margin">The cau<U+017F>e of the colour of the hair.</note> men is exceeding variable, according to the Country, ambient Air predominant Humor, Age, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For tho<U+017F>e that dwell in hot and dry Countries, have their hair not only dry, cri<U+017F>p and brittle, but al<U+017F>o black, as the Aegypians, Arabians, Indians; al<U+017F>o the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Italians, and part of the French have their hair for the mo<U+017F>t part black. They who dwell in cold and moi<U+017F>t Countries, have their hairs not only <U+017F>oft and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aight, but for the mo<U+017F>t part yellow or white, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Denmark, England, Norway, Swedland, Scythia, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again the predominant Humor makes the Colour of the hairs: as in flegmatick per<U+017F>ons, the hairs are for the mo<U+017F>t part white, and <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o the Variety of Heat makes variety of Colours: for immoderate heat makes black hairs: for a vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Excrement is rai<U+017F>ed by the heat, and is changed into an exact <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>tream. But temperate heat makes the hairs yellow; more temperate makes them red; a weak heat makes them white. But both the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es of Colours do ea<U+017F>ily concur in the hair, as when flegm abounds, weakne<U+017F>s of heat is joyned therewith, and when Blood abounds, heat is moderate, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o a change in the Colour is made in re<U+017F>pect of Age, as al<U+017F>o of other accidents. For grown per<U+017F>ons have their hair not only thicker, harder, <U+017F>tronger and more plentiful, but at length al<U+017F>o grey and whitei<U+017F>h.</p>
               <p>But no Hairs on the Body of Man are Naturally green, or blew, though there are both green and leek-colour'd Choler in Mans Body; the cau<U+017F>e whereof is not the thickne<U+017F>s of the hair, uncapable of light, as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> imagined, becau<U+017F>e the hair is capable of being yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, its thickne<U+017F>s nothing hindring; but, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly philo<U+017F>ophizes, <U+017F>eeinge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry colour is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to every Plant, no more is it to the hairs. Yet I have <U+017F>een green hair'd men at <hi>Hafnia,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e as work Metals have their hair commonly green. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Donatus</hi> relates of <hi>Antonius Maria Catabenus,</hi> grey hair'd through Age, how that much Choler mixt with blood abounding in his Body, not only his Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of a Verdigree<U+017F>e or yellow-green colour, but his grey hairs were al<U+017F>o died of the <U+017F>ame hue.</p>
               <p>The Ancients conceived that grey hairs<note place="margin">The cau<U+017F>e of grey hairs.</note> did proceed from drine<U+017F>s, as the Leaves of Trees when they are dried, look white.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> confutes them. For tho<U+017F>e who go with their heads covered, do <U+017F>ooner grow grey, and yet are not <U+017F>o dried, as tho<U+017F>e that expo<U+017F>e their heads bare to the air. Again <U+017F>ome are grey as <U+017F>oon as they are born or quickly after, which cannot proceed from Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Now they grow <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t grey that go<note place="margin">Why they are <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t grey-hair'd that go with their Heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd?</note> alwaies with their Heads covered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the heat cannot be fanned, but is overwhelmed and <U+017F>trangled, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extingui<U+017F>hed, an external heat is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; <U+017F>o that putrefaction is the cau<U+017F>e of grey hairs, which <U+017F>prung from <U+017F>car<U+017F>ity of innate heat, which cannot <U+017F>o dige<U+017F>t the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as in youth. And the outmo<U+017F>t and <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t end of the hair is white<U+017F>t, where there is lea<U+017F>t heat.</p>
               <p>Now why a white Humor <U+017F>hould ari<U+017F>e from putrefaction, the Cau<U+017F>e is,<note place="margin">Why Men are <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t grey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their temples?</note> according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> becau<U+017F>e a great part is turned into Air, which being well mixed with an earthy and warry Sub<U+017F>tance makes whitene<U+017F>s. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o it is apparent, why men are <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t grey about their Temples, becau<U+017F>e there great and fle<U+017F>hy Mu<U+017F>cles are placed under the Skin, which through moi<U+017F>ture do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily putrifie.

                  <hi>Chap. II</hi> Of the Membranes without and within the Skull.</head>
               <p>THe EXTERNAL MEMBRANES which compa<U+017F>s the Skull, are two: The PERICRANIUM and the PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOSTIUM which compa<U+017F>s the Brain; al<U+017F>o there are two Meninges or <hi>Matres</hi> <U+017F>o called, viz. DURA MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER and PIA MATER, that is to <U+017F>ay a thick Membrane and a thin one, which perform the <U+017F>ame Office in their Cavity, which the Pleura performs in the middle Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and the Peritonaeum in the lowe<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The PERICRANEUM is a Membrane thin and <U+017F>oft, compa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Skull, and<note place="margin">The Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum.</note> <U+017F>pringing from the <hi>dura Mater</hi> coming out at the Sutures of the Skull.</p>
               <p>That it <U+017F>prings from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Con<U+017F>ent between the Brain with its Meninges and the Pericraneum, does <U+017F>ufficiently prove, which cannot be by any other way more conveniently made forth. Moreover, this production of the Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> is manife<U+017F>tly vi<U+017F>ible in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in whom the Moles of their Heads are not yet <U+017F>ufficiently clo<U+017F>ed. Tho<U+017F>e Fibres wherewith <hi>Hor<U+017F>tius, Spigelius,</hi> and <hi>Laurenbergius</hi> do conceive that the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craneum is only fa<U+017F>tned to the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> do not go unto the Throat: for the Bones being by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hardned and compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>ame Continuity of the Pericraneum and <hi>dura Mater,</hi> was broken off with Age, from whence aro<U+017F>e that appearance of Fibres which hath deceived <U+017F>ome.</p>
               <p>The PERIOSTIUM is a mo<U+017F>t thin and nervous Membrane, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding<note place="margin">Perio<U+017F>tium.</note> <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, by help whereof, all the bones <U+017F>aving the teeth being compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed therewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible.</p>
               <p>I di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the<U+017F>e two Membranes with <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> and <hi>Bauhinus</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Fallopius, Laurentius</hi> and others, who confound them, <U+017F>eeing they may be accurately <U+017F>eparated by a skilful Anatomi<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>Now the various Mu<U+017F>cles about the Head <U+017F>hall be explained in their proper place.</p>
               <p>The CRASSA MENINX or harder Membrane called al<U+017F>o DURA MATER,<note place="margin">Cra<U+017F><U+017F>a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx.</note> becau<U+017F>e of its thickne<U+017F>s and hardne<U+017F>s, and becau<U+017F>e many conceive all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Body do ari<U+017F>e out of this and the <hi>tenuis Membrana</hi> or <hi>pia Mater,</hi> does cover the Skull all over on the in<U+017F>ide, and all its Cavities and hollowne<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>ticks <U+017F>trongly to its Ba<U+017F>is, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ome have thought it took its Original from thence.</p>
               <p>Now it compa<U+017F><U+017F>es the Brain al<U+017F>o loo<U+017F>ely, on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <U+017F>ide, and covers the in<U+017F>ide of the Skull. (For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Hildanus</hi> and <hi>Varolius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved that it is <U+017F>trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fa<U+017F>tned to the Skull, that was be<U+017F>ides the ordinary Cour<U+017F>e of Nature) that there may be <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance between, as there is between the Heart and the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag, both in living and dead bodies, though in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is greater, by rea<U+017F>on of the defect of Spirits and the falling in of the Brain, which I grant <hi>Olbafius</hi> and <hi>Hofmannus;</hi> and this is <U+017F>o contrived that the <U+017F>welling Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Brain, may not be compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and that there may be no hindrance of the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motion of the Brain,</hi> which is made up of Sy<U+017F>tole and Dia<U+017F>tole, and is continual,<note place="margin">The Brain moves.</note> as may be <U+017F>een in Wounds of the Head, newborn Children, and mo<U+017F>t vehement pains of the head, as <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved: And I my <U+017F>elf have frequently <U+017F>een this motion in wounded per<U+017F>ons. Strange therefore it is that <U+017F>ome learned men will needs deny this motion. But it is a very hard task to a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the true Cau<U+017F>e of this motion: Some make it to be the Meninges; others the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; others the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Brain. But it is ill a<U+017F>cribed to the Meninges: for a great portion of the brain being taken away, and the Meninges them<U+017F>elves, the brain was ob<U+017F>erved to move in a living Sheep, by the <hi>renowned Riolanus.</hi> They judg better who a<U+017F>cribe the <U+017F>ame to the Arteries, for the motions of the Brain and Arteries do happen both at one and the <U+017F>ame time, as may ea<U+017F>ily be ob<U+017F>erved in Fractures of the Skul, and in the Heads of Infants. Yea and <hi>Walaeus</hi> ob<U+017F>erves that in tho<U+017F>e who being wounded in the Head to the Brain, have extream angui<U+017F>h, only certain con<U+017F>picu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arteries do move, and not the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Brain; and when the parties wounded gather <U+017F>trength, the motion of their Brain evidently returns. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath ob<U+017F>erved in living Lambs, Kids and Dogs, that the brain it <U+017F>elf hath no motion but only the Arteries. To him <hi>Olbafius</hi> gives con<U+017F>ent, becau<U+017F>e the motion is mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervable about the Cavities of the dura mater, where are mo<U+017F>t Arteries. And therefore I conceive we mu<U+017F>t not have recour<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain: which is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>oft and flaggie, and <U+017F>ufficiently indi<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed for motion. But the chiefe<U+017F>t motion is ob<U+017F>erved at the full of the Moon, by rea<U+017F>on of the working of the humors at that <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on. But that al<U+017F>o <U+017F>prings from the Arteries, which are more di<U+017F>tended with blood: for the motion of the Heart becomes quicker or <U+017F>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, according to the various Influence of the Stars. That the motion of the brain <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lungs, I have no <U+017F>ufficient <U+017F>ign to prove.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>it is fa<U+017F>tned</hi> to the pia mater and the brain, by Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; to the Skul by thin membranous fibres <U+017F>pring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it <U+017F>elf, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out through the futures, and con<U+017F>tituting the Pericranium.</p>
               <p>This Meninx or Coat is double, as the re<U+017F>t of the Membranes are. The external part re<U+017F>pecting the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, is hard, rough, and of a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e of the hardne<U+017F>s of the Skull which it was to touch.</p>
               <p>The inner part is <U+017F>mooth, <U+017F>lippery, brightly <U+017F>hine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and white, being more drenched with a wateri<U+017F>h moi<U+017F>ture.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>fourfold</hi> where it di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes the Brain from the petty-brain, in which place Dogs have a bone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropping their brain, that it may not bear hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cerebellum, Branilet, or petty-brain.</p>
               <p>But on the Crown of the Head it is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">The Sickle.</note> where it divides the brain into the right and left part: and becau<U+017F>e the Reduplication is in the hinder-part broad, and grows afterwards nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by degrees, yet not to a point, <U+017F>o as to repre<U+017F>ent a Reapers Sickle, therefore<note place="margin">See Tab. 11.</note> they term this Body <hi>Falx</hi> the Sickle.

But in my Judgment the Arterial blood does not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavities, before it be cooled, when it returns from the Generation of Spirits. And then it needs no cooling, being to return immediately through the Veins into the Heart.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Brain</hi> commonly <U+017F>o called hath two parts, the one <hi>Internal</hi> the other <hi>External.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>External</hi> part is properly and<note place="margin">What is properly the Brain.</note> <U+017F>tricktly called the BRAIN and is all that which appears outwardly <U+017F>oft, of an A<U+017F>h color or yellowi<U+017F>h white; which color <U+017F>ome conceive to ari<U+017F>e from an innumerable company of Veins there di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated; and this External <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance is as it were the bark.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Internal</hi> is the remaining <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance<note place="margin">The Marrow what?</note> which lies hidden beneath the the former, being more hard compact and white, which we may call the MARROW, in which are <U+017F>eated the Ventricles commonly <U+017F>o called, but not in the Brain it <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that</p>
               <p>The Brain and Marrow it <U+017F>elf <hi>Differ,</hi>

               <p>The white part therefore of the Brain <U+017F>eems to be buryed in the A<U+017F>h-color'd part, as the Chry<U+017F>talline Humor is in the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>ie.

               <p>The <hi>Globous</hi> or <hi>round part,</hi> which I<note place="margin">The Head of the Marrow, what?</note> <U+017F>hall call the Head of the Marrow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embles the Figure of the Skul, and is of great bulk, having in it three Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Ventricles commonly <U+017F>o called.</p>
               <p>The <hi>long</hi> part, which I will call the Tail of the Marrow, ari<U+017F>es immediately out of the former like a certain Tail, wherein is ingraven the <hi>Calamus Scriptorius</hi> or fourth<note place="margin">A new opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the place where the Animal <U+017F>pirits are made.</note> Ventricle <U+017F>o called by <U+017F>ome; wherein I hold the true Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animal Spirits to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>And this long Portion of the Marrow, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and original of all Nerves what<U+017F>oever that are in that place; contrary to what is commonly thought.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o this lengthened <hi>Marrow</hi> may be con<U+017F>idered in a twofold manner: either as it remains <U+017F>till <hi>within the Skul,</hi> and then the Nerves ari<U+017F>e therefrom, which are vulgarly; attributed to the Brain: or as it is without the Skull, and <U+017F>lides into the Back-bone, gaining the title of the Spinal Marrow.</p>
               <p>But that young Learners may not be confounded, I <U+017F>hall now propound the <U+017F>tructure of the whole Brain commonly <U+017F>o called.</p>

Yet the <U+017F>cull of a mon<U+017F>trous bea<U+017F>t lately found in <hi>Scania,</hi> might preternaturally contain twice that quantity of Brain.

Silvius</hi> ob<U+017F>erves, when the brain is Flaccid and Friable, becau<U+017F>e he ob<U+017F>erved that then it would come of it <U+017F>elf from the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, in di<U+017F><U+017F>ection; and e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by means of Age, or any other waies, are become more <U+017F>olid then ordinary.</p>
               <p>Now there are no <hi>Nerves</hi> Di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated through the Brain and therefore it is Void of all Sen<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>The Veins which are carryed through the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain are, 1. The five branches of the jugular Veins, <U+017F>ome of which go into the Cavity of the dura mater, others are <U+017F>pred up and down through the Coats and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain. But they, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> are no other then, 2. very <U+017F>mal twigs, which on either <U+017F>ide go into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain, out of the Cavities of dura mater.</p>
               <p>There are four Arteries from the Carotides and Cervicales, whereof the former are di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated into the brain upwards and downwards, the latter into the Brainlet or Cerebellum. In the Chinks the <U+017F>ame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotick Arteries are carried in very great number, both in the <U+017F>urface and the bottom, which <hi>Fr. Sylvius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be the cau<U+017F>e of that <U+017F>ame trouble<U+017F>ome pul<U+017F>ing about the Temples in <U+017F>ome kinds of Head-ach: though in the judgment of <hi>A. Kyperus</hi> the pul<U+017F>ation of the external Arteries adds <U+017F>omwhat hereunto, as the Cure of the pain doth <U+017F>hew, by opening the <U+017F>aid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e of the Brain</hi> according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The U<U+017F>e of the Brain.</note> is to cool the Heart, which <hi>Galen</hi> ju<U+017F>tly refutes, becau<U+017F>e the brain is far from the Heart. But there are <U+017F>ome Peripatericks who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> di<U+017F><U+017F>ents from the Phy<U+017F>itians, while he <U+017F>aith the brain is made to temper the heat of the Heart, and they will have it made to produce Animal <U+017F>pirits: In as much as the Animal <U+017F>pirits cannot be generated, unle<U+017F>s the vital Spirits be fir<U+017F>t cooled But,</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> thereof is, 1. To be the Man<U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Soul, for the performance of Animal Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now the brain is no particular Organ of Sen<U+017F>e, as the Eyes, Ears, &amp;c. but an univer<U+017F>al one: for judgment is made in the brain of the Objects of all the Sen<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es judgment touching<note place="margin">Of the brains Motion.</note> Animal Motion, whereas it <U+017F>elf hath no Animal Motion: But it hath a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motion, communicated from the Arteries, and that a perpetual one of widening and contracting it <U+017F>elf, as appears in Wounds of the Head and new-born Children, in the forepart of who<U+017F>e Head, the brain is <U+017F>een to pant, becau<U+017F>e their bones are as yet exceeding <U+017F>oft and plyable.</p>
               <p>In its Dilatation the brain draws vital Spirit with arterial blood out of the Carotick Arteries, and Air by the No<U+017F>trils.</p>
               <p>In its contraction it forces the Animal <U+017F>pirits into the Nerves, which like Conduit pipes carry the <U+017F>aid Spirit into the whole body, and therewith the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion. And by the <U+017F>ame Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the blood is forced out of the Ventricles through the Veins unto the Heart.</p>
               <p>The Matter therefore of the Animal<note place="margin">The Matter of the Animal Spirits.</note> Spirits is two fold; viz. Arterial blood ful of vital Spirit, and Air. Touching the place of its Generation we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak hereafter. For I am not of their opinion who confirme that this Spirit is Generated in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Brain, or in tho<U+017F>e Ventricles in the forepart thereof.</p>
               <p>2. That the Animal <U+017F>pirit may be contained and kept in the brain as in a Store-hou<U+017F>e, after it is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, truly, of the Brain is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Hou<U+017F>e and Receptacle for the Animal <U+017F>pirit, <U+017F>eeing it is the <U+017F>ame with the internal Marrowy <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the Nerves, which al<U+017F>o contains the <U+017F>aid Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now I am of Opinion that in the<note place="margin">A new opinion of the Author, touching the u<U+017F>e of the Brain and the Marrow.</note> Brain, properly <U+017F>o called, or the Rinde, is contained Animal Spirit for Sen<U+017F>e; and that in the whole Marrow Head and Tail, Spirits is kept for Motion, which <U+017F>hall be made manife<U+017F>t in the following Chapter.</p>

               <p>And if any one <U+017F>hall think we<note place="margin">An Objection.</note> ought therefore to begin with the brain, becau<U+017F>e the Spinal Marrow is <U+017F>aid to take its beginning therefrom;<note place="margin">The An<U+017F>wer.</note> we an<U+017F>wer, that we make the Marrow both as it is within the Skull and in<note place="margin">A new Opinion of the Author, that the Marrow is the Original of the brain.</note> the Back-bone, to be the beginning rather of the brain; and that the brain being divided into two parts, is as it were a certain double proce<U+017F>s or production of the Marrow it <U+017F>elf.</p>

It is <U+017F>eated in <U+017F>uch a place, that it can poure forth Animal <U+017F>pirits, into all the Nerves round about it. And therefore <hi>Herophilus</hi> did rightly judg, that this was the mo<U+017F>t principal Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
               <p>Nor can I devi<U+017F>e how it came to pa<U+017F>s<note place="margin">A Proof.</note> that certain learned Men could not <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e weighty Arguments, who have written without cau<U+017F>e, that I a<U+017F><U+017F>igned the Generation of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the <hi>Calamus Scriptorius,</hi> without any rea<U+017F>ons moving me thereto.</p>
               <p>Now mu<U+017F>t we think with <hi>Spigelius,</hi> that this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle did only re<U+017F>ult by con<U+017F>equence, out of the round particles of the Brain, touching one another without any de<U+017F>ign of Nature: for Nature doth nothing to no end, no not when <U+017F>he <U+017F>eems mo<U+017F>t of all to do <U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>Others conceive that the Animal Spirit is bred in the fore Ventricles of the Brain.</p>
               <p>But they are full of Excrements, who<U+017F>e receptacles they rather are, as appears by the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> unto them, and in that they are often found filled with Flegm, and abundance of water.</p>
               <p>Others in the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> others<note place="margin">The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Animal Spirits where it is?</note> in the <hi>Plexus Choroides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the<U+017F>e we hold the Animal Spirit is prepared, but not Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, For nature is wont to provide intertwinings of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els for the preparation of any matter: and <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are <U+017F>o <U+017F>mal, how can it be generated in them, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many Excrements of the brain flow through the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>Others will have them to be wrought in the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the brain. Others in the lengthened body of the <U+017F>pinal Marrow. But the Generation of <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtile a Spirit, did require <U+017F>ome Cavity, which is al<U+017F>o allowed to the Generation of the vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>For which cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome have been induced to allot the making of the natural <U+017F>pirit to be in the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, becau<U+017F>e there is no Cavity in the Liver.</p>
               <p>I am therefore of opinion that the Animal Spirit is prepared in the <hi>Rete Mirable,</hi> and yet more in the <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> and that is generated and wrought up in this Cavity of the <hi>Medulla Elongata,</hi> or in the noble Ventricle; and afterward, as much of it as not derived into the <U+017F>pinal Marrow and the Nerves of the brain, is pre<U+017F>erved and retained in the whole brain, as in a Store-hou<U+017F>e.</p>

               <p>THe Brainlet being as it were a little<note place="margin">The Brainlet what it is?</note> and private kind of Brain, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <U+017F>maller portion, placed under the Brain in the lower and after-part of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Minder-Head: In Brutes it takes up commonly the whole Region of the <hi>Occiput.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath the <U+017F>ame Sub<U+017F>tance, <hi>Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency, Colour,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. with the Brain.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Turnings</hi> and <hi>Windings</hi> it differs from the Brain. The brain<note place="margin">Its Structure.</note> hath <U+017F>undry Circumvolutions with out any Method or Order; the Brainlet hath circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ordinate ones, <U+017F>tretched one over another like Plates. They are differenced partly by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, partly by the pia mater, which being <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the <U+017F>everal Circles may be taken out after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The inner <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is various, whitei<U+017F>h and A<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, which di<U+017F>tributed certain Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els as it were.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els</hi> interpo<U+017F>ed betwixt the <U+017F>everal plates, are carried through the pia mater like nets, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the accurate Ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Francis Sylvins,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing from the Branches of the Arteria cervicalis, do at la<U+017F>t end into the fourth Ventricle.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>con<U+017F>tituted</hi> chiefly of two lateral parts, on each <U+017F>ide making a Globe as it were.</p>
               <p>It hath two <hi>Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> or Excre<U+017F>cences, termed <hi>Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis</hi> or <hi>Worm-like,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they are variou<U+017F>ly orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of many tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e portions, coupled with a thin Membrane.

               <p>And they are <hi><U+017F>ituate</hi> at the <U+017F>eat of the noble Cavity, one before, the other behind.</p>
               <p>About the hinder-part of the Trunk of the Spinal Marrow, in the Circumference of the noble Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, out of the <U+017F>ame brainlet there proceed two other globous proce<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>omtimes two of each <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three.

Fig. 1.</note> <U+017F>maller. <hi>Varolius</hi> calls it the bridg of the brainlet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of all the Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es is to hinder the noble Ventricle from being ob<U+017F>tructed, by pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the brainlet. <hi>Laurentius</hi> <U+017F>aies they help the motion of the Ventricles like a Valve, becau<U+017F>e the Vermiformis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>hortned opens the way, which goes from the third to the fourth Ventricle; when it is extended it <U+017F>huts the Chink, lea<U+017F>t the Spirits <U+017F>hould go back into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cavities. <hi>Riolanus</hi> di<U+017F><U+017F>ents but little from him, for he will have it to open and <U+017F>hut the entrance of the fourth Ventricle. But it is not moved of it <U+017F>elf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e, as the brain, <U+017F>o is it void of any proper motion, unle<U+017F>s you a<U+017F><U+017F>ign it to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els or pia Mater, which are very <U+017F>mall, or at lea<U+017F>t to the neighbouring Animal Spirits.</p>
               <p>Now I believe the u<U+017F>e of the bridg is, to combine and keep in compa<U+017F>s the Circles of the brain, and as a bulwark to defend the noble Ventricle. And therfore it would more properly be called a Sconce or Fence, then a bridg.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the brainlet is the <U+017F>ame with<note place="margin">The U<U+017F>e.</note> that of the brain. But <hi>Galen</hi> would have it to be the Original of the hard Nerves; which is fal<U+017F>e. For no Nerves have their Original from it.</p>

               <p>The<U+017F>e according to the common manner of Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beginning from above, are thought to be <hi>three:</hi> two <hi>foremore and uppermore</hi> as they call them, and <hi>one in the middle,</hi> to which <U+017F>ome add a <hi>fourth,</hi> of which we <U+017F>poke before.</p>

               <p>I conceive that <hi>there is but one Ventricle of the brain,</hi> which is in the<note place="margin">The Authors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there is but one Ventricle of the Brain.</note> middle, but the beginning thereof is divided into two; or there are two proce<U+017F><U+017F>es, which receiving the Excrements, carry them into the middle it <U+017F>elf, which they call the third. For there is one continued Cavity of the brain, and the two Ventricles <U+017F>o called, do end into a common Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Mean while, becau<U+017F>e this and that part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity <U+017F>eem diver<U+017F>ly formed, <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tinction may be allowed for Doctrins <U+017F>ake.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They are commonly and not unfitly liken'd to the Moon when <U+017F>he is in the Wane; although they are hardly ever demon<U+017F>trated to be <U+017F>uch in di<U+017F><U+017F>ection. But <U+017F>eeing they are both oblong, and very large in their hinder part, they may al<U+017F>o be likened to Hor<U+017F>e-<U+017F>hoes. This round form of the Ventricles was fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covered by the mo<U+017F>t accurate <hi>Fr. Sylvius,</hi> and after him I have often demon<U+017F>trated the <U+017F>ame. But if you would find the true Figure, you mu<U+017F>t cut the brain deep towards the Skul, or the Temples, on each <U+017F>ide, becau<U+017F>e it is deeply <U+017F>unk into the <hi>Corpus Callo<U+017F>um.</hi> For that part of the Ventricles towards the <hi>Septum lucidum</hi> is higher, and that which is towards the lateral part of the Skull is lower. The foremore and deeper parts, are near to the Mammillary proce<U+017F><U+017F>es, and if we believe <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colhomineus, Bauhinus, Riolanus,</hi> they are in <U+017F>ome manner tran<U+017F>pa<U+017F><U+017F>able, e<U+017F>pecially in elderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons.</p>
               <p>Moreover they run out in their hinder part by a <U+017F>traight Cour<U+017F>e, where they form a Cavity which is <U+017F>omwhat round, not unlike the Finger of a Glove; this I remember hath been <U+017F>omtimes wanting.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is to be noted, that the<U+017F>e Ventricles do environ the lateral and hind parts of the Roots of the Spinal Marrow, which al<U+017F>o, under the <hi>Plexus Choroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> a part of the brain being wreathed and attenuated inwards, and upwards making the Concameration of the Ventricles, doth embrace with a <U+017F>elvidge as it were and a Fringe or lace, which the prai<U+017F>e worthy <hi>Sylvius</hi> wont <U+017F>o to call for likene<U+017F>s <U+017F>ake, it being knit to the was fore<U+017F>aid roots by exceeding thin threds. If gently lifting up the Plexus, you <U+017F>hall remove this lace from the Root, you <U+017F>hall find little Arteries creeping through the lower <U+017F>urface of the Ventricle, continued to the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But here you <U+017F>hall ob<U+017F>erve, that there is an ea<U+017F>ie outgate for the Humors contained in the <U+017F>aid Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which may de<U+017F>cend down along the <U+017F>pinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

               <p>Two Roots of the Spinal Morrow do penetrate a good depth into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain; to the upper and former whereof, e<U+017F>pecially where it looks inward, the brain being continued (now I mean the whitei<U+017F>h and A<U+017F>h-coloured part by the term Brain) it <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elf every way, e<U+017F>pecially outwards and backwards and by little and little wreathes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts its lower extremities inward and upwards, till at la<U+017F>t being attenuated, it doth on all <U+017F>ides embrace the Root of the <U+017F>pinal Marrow with a lace, a little below the place where it <U+017F>prings therefrom, as was <U+017F>aid before; and <U+017F>o forms the lateral Ventricles.</p>

                  <hi>Regius</hi> adds many pores in the Ventricles; looking into the Fiberkies of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the brain, in which the Animal <U+017F>pirit is bred. But tho<U+017F>e pores and Fiberkies are invi<U+017F>ible to the Eyes of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts.</p>
               <p>They are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by a loo<U+017F>e and<note place="margin">Septum luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> wrinkeld Partition-Skin: which if it be <U+017F>tretched out and held again<U+017F>t the light, it <U+017F>hines becau<U+017F>e of its tran<U+017F>parency, and is therefore cal'd <hi>Septum lucidum:</hi> which <U+017F>ome will have to <U+017F>pring from a mo<U+017F>t thin portion of the brain it <U+017F>elf, others from the <hi>pia Mater</hi> doubled.

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of this Pine-kernel is like that of other ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and e<U+017F>pecially to help the di<U+017F>tribution of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els through the brain. Some will have it placed like a Valve before the hole which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es into the fourth Ventricle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and his Followers <hi>Mey<U+017F><U+017F>onerius, Regius, Hogelandius,</hi> do conceive that this Kernel being placed in the middle of the Ventricles, which when a man is awake are di<U+017F>tended with Spirits perpetually, does 1. Receive the motions of all Objects. 2. That the Soul in this part done by the<U+017F>e motions, does appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all external <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Objects, and all the Ideas proceeding from the five Sen<U+017F>es, as in a Centre, and di<U+017F>cern the <U+017F>ame, and does afterward by help thereof <U+017F>end Spirits into all parts; as in a <U+017F>mal Sphaerical gla<U+017F>s, all things are received in the <U+017F>ame order in which they are either in a Field or Chamber.</p>
               <p>For this cau<U+017F>e <hi>Mey<U+017F><U+017F>onerius</hi> will have it to be of a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Figure,</hi> becau<U+017F>e Individuals require more <U+017F>pace then <U+017F>orts or kinds of things. And that the<U+017F>e Idea's are diver<U+017F>ly moved by the motion of the animal <U+017F>pirit, but are alwaies found joyned by the Verb EST, and according to their equality or inequality, truth or fal<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is compounded, being compared together like two Lines.</p>
               <p>And that for this cau<U+017F>e Infants do not pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>peak nor rea<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>lappine<U+017F>s of their brain gives not pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Idea's. And that the overgreat and confu<U+017F>ed motion of the<U+017F>e Idea's in the Pine-<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd kernel, makes ravenings, as in per<U+017F>ons drunk, phrentick, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But many things there are which will not <U+017F>uffer me to embrace this new and witty Opinion. For</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is too <U+017F>mall and ob<U+017F>cure a body, to be able to repre<U+017F>ent clearly the Species of all things.</item>
                  <item>2. The Species of all Sen<U+017F>es do not come hither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Nerves do not touch the Kernel.</item>
                  <item>3. It is placed in the Quarter of Excrements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are purged out, by the third, and two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Ventricles, where the Species or Repre<U+017F>entati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things would be defiled.</item>
                  <item>4. The Species of things are perceived rather there whereto they are carried. But every <U+017F>en<U+017F>ory Nerve each in its place carries the Species to the beginning of the <U+017F>pinal Marrow, and therefore each in their place are judged and received by the Soul, in the beginning of the <U+017F>pinal Marrow. Moreover this Marrow is big enough, globous, hard, and of a brighter colour.</item>
                  <item>5. Several Idea's would be confounded in this little body. The Eye indeed being likewi<U+017F>e very <U+017F>mall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Species or Repre<U+017F>entations of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Con<U+017F>u<U+017F>ion, but they are only the vi<U+017F>ible Species; whereas in this Kernel the divers Species of different Sen<U+017F>es are to be received.</item>
                  <item>6. There is hence no open or known pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Nerves, as from the beginning of the Marrow, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny communion with <U+017F>ome Nerves of the external <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.</item>

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e of the watry</hi> Humor is to defend the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts from drine<U+017F>s: others add, that as a medium it <U+017F>erves to break the brightne<U+017F>s continually flowing in, and to greaten the Repre<U+017F>entations of the Objects, being <U+017F>traitned in the Pupilla or Sight.</p>

Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is not barely to nouri<U+017F>h the Chry<U+017F>talline, as <hi>Galen</hi> conceived, but to prepare and communicate Nouri<U+017F>hment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

               <p>The outer Ear is <hi>divided</hi> into the upper and lower part.</p>

               <p>The Parts whereof the external Ear is compo<U+017F>ed, are either common, as the Skarf-Skin, the Skin, a Nervous Membrane, Fle<U+017F>h, and a little Fat in the Lobe: Or Proper, as Mu<U+017F>cles, Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and a Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tle.</p>

And by rea<U+017F>on of the diver<U+017F>ity of its Fibres, it <U+017F>eems to perform contrary actions: for the greate<U+017F>t part of the Fibres, which is towards the Root of the tongue, being drawn towards the Original, the tongue is thru<U+017F>t without the Lips; but the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t part of the Fibres acting, tis drawn inwards. This pair hath in<U+017F>criptions as if it were many Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>

It is <U+017F>omtimes ob<U+017F>curely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as if it were many Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to draw the tongue right in, and <U+017F>o to depre<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame. And it is called <hi>Ba<U+017F>ioglo<U+017F><U+017F>um,</hi> or <hi>Hyp<U+017F>iloglo<U+017F><U+017F>um.</hi>

               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to move the tongue directly downwards towards the inner parts, when both act; but if only one be contracted, it moves it to the right or left <U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>By others an <hi>eleventh</hi> Mu<U+017F>cle is added, which yet is no Mu<U+017F>cle, becau<U+017F>e it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not of fle<U+017F>hy Fibres; but it is a parcel of fle<U+017F>h, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of very many Kernels and far, <U+017F>ituate at the Root of the tongue, and appearing when the fore<U+017F>aid Mu<U+017F>cles are taken away.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, that the tongue may be moi<U+017F>tened by this plenty of Kernels.</p>

Man therefore hath received Rea<U+017F>on and Hands, which Bea<U+017F>ts have not; and the Hand is his Servant and In<U+017F>trument.</p>
               <p>Now the old Writers <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> by HAND did under<U+017F>tand that<note place="margin">Manus what?</note> Part of the Body, from the top of the Shoulder to the ends of the Fingers, and this is termed <hi><U+017F>umma Manus.</hi>

               <p>And the <hi>Arm</hi> is divided again, into the Shoulder and Cubit, the <hi>Shoulder</hi> is the part of the Arm from the Shoulder-tip to the bending of the Elbow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cubit</hi> is that part from the bending of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow unto the Wri<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Manus extrema</hi> or <hi>Hand properly <U+017F>o called, is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Brachiale</hi> or <hi>Wri<U+017F>t,</hi> which is the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elbow and Palm; into the Po<U+017F>tbrachiale or Metacarpum, <hi>after-wri<U+017F>t,</hi> which is the part between the Wri<U+017F>t and beginning of the Fingers, and into the Fingers. The Po<U+017F>tbrachial part internal is called the <hi>Palm</hi> of the Hand, the external part is called the <hi>Back</hi> of the Hand.</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>Fingers,</hi> that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Why many Fingers on the Hand?</note> of the Hand might be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which is laying hold: al<U+017F>o that we might be able to take up the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t matters, which we do by two fingers, and other things of many-<U+017F>haped Figures: and becau<U+017F>e all things could not be comprehended with one hand, two were made that meeting together, the one might help the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>right</hi> Hand is more active com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and more ready for motion, not<note place="margin">Why the right Hand is more active then the left?</note> for tho<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es which others childi<U+017F>hly cite, but 1. Becau<U+017F>e in a mans right <U+017F>ide is the <hi>Vena <U+017F>ine pari</hi> <U+017F>o called, which peradventure is double in <U+017F>uch as can u<U+017F>e both hands alike. 2. Becau<U+017F>e the bones are more heavy in the Shoulder, Shoulder-blade and whol arm, then on the other <U+017F>ide, as <U+017F>ome men know for certain; which may proceed from an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Heat in the Mothers Womb, the right part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is hotter then the other. Hence <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> teaches, that naturally the right hand excels the left; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, he tells us the fir<U+017F>t endeavor of motion is on the right <U+017F>ide; <U+017F>o that when a man is about to walk, fir<U+017F>t moves his right Leg; a Bird about to flie, moves fir<U+017F>t its right wing. 3. Becau<U+017F>e the trunk of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian Artery is greater on the right <U+017F>ide then the left, as they know that have diligently con<U+017F>idered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in oppo<U+017F>ition to <hi>Riolanus,</hi> though the difference is not, neither needed to be very great. <hi>Plato</hi> conceives that all men are naturally ambidexters, viz. that they can u<U+017F>e both hands alike, and that it is mens unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and ignorance that makes them right handed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or left handed. But <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> is of Opinion, that from our fir<U+017F>t Formation, the right <U+017F>ides of our Bodies, are alwaies in a manner hotter and <U+017F>tronger then the left, unle<U+017F>s any man by much cu<U+017F>tom, and much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e, do draw much Heat and Spirit to his left Hand that he may become Ambidexter, and able to u<U+017F>e it as his right.</p>

Yet the chief Organ of this motion is a Mu<U+017F>cle: the <U+017F>trength is in the Bones, which are three in every fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the lower of which as the <U+017F>u<U+017F>tainer is alwaies greater then that which is above it and <U+017F>tronger, and in the Joynts they are furni<U+017F>hed on each fide with a Gri<U+017F>tle, on which an Oyly moi<U+017F>ture is poured out for Hummectations <U+017F>ake, and to Facilitate the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Nails</hi> are placed externally on the tops of the Fingers, as al<U+017F>o of<note place="margin">Of the Nails.</note> the Toes: who<U+017F>e upmo<U+017F>t part being white, is called the Root of the Nailes, the white half Moon, and the little Skin which grows to the Root.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> is that heat which the Soul directs to this rather then any other part of the Body.

Tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame white <U+017F>pots which in yong people <U+017F>omtimes appear in their Nails, <U+017F>pring from a vigorous heat, which drives hidden Excrements to the Nails, and <U+017F>eparates them from others of a different Nature.</p>

               <p>eight and <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>erius</hi> nine. For the Arm is <U+017F>aid to be lift up by two Mu<U+017F>cles, <hi>Deltoides</hi> and <hi>Supra-<U+017F>pinatus;</hi> and downwards by two, the <hi>Ani <U+017F>calptor</hi> and <hi>Rotundus major:</hi> forewards by one alone, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pectoralis;</hi> backwards by three, the <hi>Infra-<U+017F>pinatus</hi> and <hi>Sub-<U+017F>capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> and the <hi>Tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>us brevior.</hi> But they conceive the circular motion thereof is cau<U+017F>ed by all of them acting one after another: but others will have the Arm to be wheeled about by the <hi>Infra-<U+017F>pinatus, Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pinatus,</hi> and <hi>Sub-<U+017F>capularis.</hi> But I <U+017F>hall in recounting them follow the order of Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> is termed <hi>Pectoralis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it takes up the Brea<U+017F>t or forepart of the Che<U+017F>t being great and fle<U+017F>hy; which <hi>Galen</hi> conceived might be divided into three or four.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ari<U+017F>es</hi> from wellnigh the whole Bre<U+017F>t-bone, and the Gri<U+017F>tles thereto annexed; where it is a little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous in part of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> and the fift, <U+017F>ixt and <U+017F>eventh true Ribs. 'Tis implanted with a <U+017F>hort, broad Nervous and <U+017F>trong tendon, into the <hi>Os Humeri,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deltoides and the Biceps.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to move the Arm to the Bre<U+017F>t, and as the Fibres are contracted more to the upper or lower part or right forward, <U+017F>o doth the Arm incline this way or that way. This is the Mu<U+017F>cle which <U+017F>uffers in that torment which the Italians call <hi>Tratta de corda,</hi> the Strappado. For it is very much haled and drawn a <U+017F>under, when the Arms are pulled forcibly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> is called <hi>Deltoides,</hi> from its likene<U+017F>s to the Greek letter <U+0394> al<U+017F>o <hi>Triangularis Humeralis,</hi> which is fle<U+017F>hy and <U+017F>o abides, and is <U+017F>pread upon the Head of the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ari<U+017F>es</hi> from the middle of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> looking towards the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and from the top of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> with a fle<U+017F>hy end indeed, but yet a <U+017F>trong tendon lies concealed therein.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to lift up the Arm. In the<note place="margin">The place of an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue in the Arm.</note> middle hereof the Ancients were wont to make Fontanels or I<U+017F><U+017F>ues; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the external part of the <U+017F>aid Mu<U+017F>cles: but an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue is better made in the <U+017F>pace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deltoides and the Biceps, as I <U+017F>hew in <hi>my Treati<U+017F>e of I<U+017F><U+017F>ues,</hi> becau<U+017F>e 1.

Now the place is exactly found below the Shoulder joynt, four or five Fingers bredth, where when you bend the Arm you may feel the <U+017F>pace between the two Mu<U+017F>cles, and the Arm being lift up, it is Circum<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in fat per<U+017F>ons with a <U+017F>mall Cavity, as <hi>Claudinus, Solenander</hi> and others ob<U+017F>erve. <hi>Ferrara</hi> mea<U+017F>ures four Fingers bredth from the Elbow upwards.

This Mu<U+017F>cle becau<U+017F>e it hath a large beginning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers Fibres; according as they are variou<U+017F>ly contracted, <U+017F>o the Shoulder is either drawn more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed more downwards. And becau<U+017F>e it al<U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>es through the lower corner of the Shoulder blade therefore it lightly draws the <U+017F>ame al<U+017F>o away with the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Rotundus major,</hi> and it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely <U+017F>eated behind, under the Axilla, being fle<U+017F>hy, thick, and rounder then the re<U+017F>t.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to draw the Arm downwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and to work contrary to the Deltoides.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t is <U+017F>hort and round, quite fle<U+017F>hy, which ari<U+017F>es with a <U+017F>harp beginning out of the lowe<U+017F>t corner of the Scapula; after it grows thicker and thicker to the middle of its belly, and thence growing <U+017F>maller by little and little, it <hi>terminates</hi> with an acute end into that Ligament, wherewith the Head of the Shoulder is involved.</p>

               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to draw forward into the Brea<U+017F>t.</p>

Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, to draw the Head directly backwards. But if only one do act, the motion is thought to be made circularly to one <U+017F>ide.</p>
               <p>The <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> is implicated and complicated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed <hi>Complexum.</hi> It <U+017F>eems to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t as it were of three Mu<U+017F>cles.

                  <hi>Chap. 8.</hi> Of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Cubitus and Radius.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> of the CUBIT, according<note place="margin">An Order in Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection.</note> to the arbitrary Method of Di<U+017F><U+017F>ecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on follow. Yet I do advi<U+017F>e the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ector, that the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Radius are not to be <U+017F>hewed immediately after tho<U+017F>e, but la<U+017F>t of all; but after the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Cubit, tho<U+017F>e of the fingers, thumb and wri<U+017F>t; becau<U+017F>e the Mu<U+017F>cles of the<U+017F>e parts being <U+017F>hewn and removed, the In<U+017F>ertions of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, are more couveniently di<U+017F>cerned. Otherwi<U+017F>e the Brachium may follow next after the demon<U+017F>tration of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Cubitus and Radius, by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der free for any one to follow.</p>
               <p>The Mu<U+017F>cles of the Cubit are <hi>four,</hi> and of the RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIUS as many.</p>
               <p>There are two Benders of the Cubit, as the <hi>Biceps</hi> and <hi>Brachiaeus:</hi> two Extenders, viz. the <hi>Longus</hi> and the <hi>Brevis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two Pronators of the Radius, the <hi>Rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and the <hi>Quadratus,</hi> and two Supinators, the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gior</hi> and <hi>Brevior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proper Motion of the Cubit is flexion and exten<U+017F>ion. But the Radius makes the whole Arm prone or <U+017F>upine.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t of the Cubit is termed BICEPS; becau<U+017F>e of its double di<U+017F>tinct <hi>Beginning,</hi> which is from the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, the one tendinous and round, from the upper lie of the Acerabulum, the other broader and le<U+017F>s tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, from the <hi>Proce<U+017F><U+017F>us ancoriformis.</hi> And it is <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> with the Head of the Radius, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Arm with its Body. The tendon of this Mu<U+017F>cle ought in Blood-letting to be taken heed of.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>econd lying under this, and <U+017F>pred out upon the bone it <U+017F>elf, being <U+017F>hort, is called BRACHIAEUS; 'tis all fle<U+017F>hy, le<U+017F>s then the former; <hi>art<U+017F>es</hi> from the middle bone of the Brachium, and is before <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> into the common beginning of the Cubitus and Radius, and the Ligament of the Joynt.</p>
               <p>The third is the EXTENDENS <hi>primus</hi> and LONGUS, it <hi>ari<U+017F>es</hi> with a double beginning, from the lower Rib of the Scapula, is ended being fle<U+017F>hy in the Olecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the EXTENDENS <hi><U+017F>ecundus</hi> and BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIS; it <hi>ari<U+017F>es</hi> from the Neck of the Humerus, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind mixed with the precedent, and occupies the <hi>Os Humeri;</hi> and it ends into the part of the Olecranum on which we lean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>erius</hi> adds a fift called <hi>tertius extendens,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers count a portion of the fourth Mu<U+017F>cle; but he counts it a di<U+017F>tinct Mu<U+017F>cle, as later Anatomi<U+017F>ts <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus</hi> do, which they term <hi>Anconeus.</hi> But he would have it to be a portion of his <hi>Brachiaeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ticks <U+017F>ometimes clo<U+017F>e to the fle<U+017F>hy Extremity thereof, and to an<U+017F>wer to the <hi>Poplitaeus,</hi> that an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be maintained between the foot and the hand. It <U+017F>prings out of the hinder extremity of the Shoulder, by the end of the fourth and third Mu<U+017F>cle, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing beyond the Joynt of the Cubir, it is al<U+017F>o <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> by its hinder and lateral part, yet not above a fingers bredth beyond the Olecranum, into the <hi>Os Cubiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>eems to add a <U+017F>ixt, which is the fourth Extender, viz. a fle<U+017F>hy Lump hudled up of the two former, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls <hi>Brachiaeus externus,</hi> to difference it from the <hi>Brachiaeus intern is flectens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e being <U+017F>pred out upon the out<U+017F>ide of the Brachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, it is placed under the two former.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t Mu<U+017F>cle of the Radius is termed ROTUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUS, or <hi>Teres;</hi> from the inner Apophy<U+017F>is of the Arm by a <U+017F>trong and fle<U+017F>hy beginning, it ends obliquely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near into the middle of the Radius, with a fle<U+017F>hy end, and likewi<U+017F>e a membranous tendon, which <hi>Spige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> writes, does go again to the middle of the Radius, and is knit to the outward <U+017F>ide of the <U+017F>aid Radius.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>econd QUADRATUS, reaching from the lowe<U+017F>t part of the Cubita, into the lowe<U+017F>t of the Radiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, wholly fle<U+017F>hy, every where two fingers broad; it goes above that Ligament common to the Radius and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus. The<U+017F>e are the <hi>Manus pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>natores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is the SUPINATOR PRIMUS, from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part of the Brachium growing <U+017F>harp, till it reach into the lower part of the Radius, fle<U+017F>hy, where it is <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> with a tendinous End.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the SUPINATOR ALTER, growing from the outward Apophy<U+017F>is of the Arm, fle<U+017F>hy, membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous without, fle<U+017F>hy within, and is <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> into the middle wel-near of the Radius.</p>
               <p>Among the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Radius <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>erius</hi> once found two little ones, and very <U+017F>mall, about the Joynt Cubit, and proceeding in an oppo<U+017F>ite fa<U+017F>hion, and moving the Radius Prone and Supine like a Pulley. Howbeit, I found them not as yet. I have <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>een in their place, in a mu<U+017F>culous man, one <hi>triangular</hi>

               <p>There are two <hi>Extendentes</hi> or <U+017F>tretchers out, which ari<U+017F>e from the Cubit.

               <p>The other is the <hi>Indicis exten<U+017F>or</hi> the <U+017F>tretcher of the Forefinger which <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls <hi>Indicatorem</hi> the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingus,</hi> though he confound it with the Abductor.

               <p>There are al<U+017F>o two mu<U+017F>cles proper to the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t finger, the <hi>Abductor</hi> and <hi>Exten<U+017F>or.</hi> The former may be parted into many: It ari<U+017F>es in the hollow of the hand<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> from the third and fourth wri<U+017F>t bones of the <U+017F>econd rank, and ends externally into the <U+017F>ide of the fir<U+017F>t joint of the <U+017F>aid finger. <hi>Aquapendent</hi> and others that have <U+017F>ince followed him, do hold that it draws the little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger outwardly, from the re<U+017F>t. <hi>Exten<U+017F>or proprius,</hi> which <hi>Riolanus</hi> exactly <U+017F>eperates from the great one, <hi>ari<U+017F>ing</hi> from the upper part of the radius, and carryed along Cubitus and the Radius, is externally in<U+017F>erted into the finger, with a double tendon,</p>

For one Leg being firmly <U+017F>et upon the ground, we move and bring about the other, and our Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly fixt, keeps us from falling: and <U+017F>o we come to walk.

               <p>The third is the <hi>Seminervo<U+017F>us,</hi> and has the <U+017F>ame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the <U+017F>ame end with the former, <U+017F>ave that in the hinder parts it is carried little forward obliquely, before it terminates at the in<U+017F>ide of the Leg.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>Gracilis,</hi> which is in<U+017F>erted into the <U+017F>ame place, and ari<U+017F>es from the joyning of the <U+017F>hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Four</hi> Mu<U+017F>cles <hi>extend</hi> the Leg.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t is the <hi>Rectus,</hi> ari<U+017F>ing with an acute tendon from the outer and lower Spine of the Ilium.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Foot</hi> is bended and extended. Two mu<U+017F>cles bend it forwards.</p>

               <p>THe Toes of the foot are moved by mu<U+017F>cles, as well as the fingers of the hand.</p>

               <p>One mu<U+017F>cle <hi>extends</hi> the four toes of the foot, which is by <U+017F>ome divided into two; ari<U+017F>ing from the upper and outer part of the tibia, and having four tendons, which are in<U+017F>erted into the <U+017F>econd and third Interjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>

               <p>The <hi>great Toe</hi> has peculiar mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>bent</hi> by one only, proceeding from the upper part of the fibula, and in<U+017F>erted into the third interjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (<hi>Riolanus</hi> <U+017F>ayes the fir<U+017F>t) of the great toe.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>extended</hi> by another, ari<U+017F>ing from the middle of the Fibula (or as <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay from the out<U+017F>ide of the tibia, where it recedes from the Fibula) which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times divided into two tendons.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>brought</hi> to, with one, inwardly fa<U+017F>tned to the greate<U+017F>t bone of the pedium.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is a clammy and cold portion of the Seed. And this is the principle of a Veins Original.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. Blood is made in the Liver.

The <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> is of Trunk with Trunk, a tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e ve<U+017F><U+017F>el going between. The third is <hi>cro<U+017F>s-fa<U+017F>hion'd,</hi> when either the Branches go over the Trunk, or the Trunk go over the Branches cro<U+017F>s-wi<U+017F>e, or the Branches over the Branches in the <U+017F>ame manner. The fourth is mixt of the Cro<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>hion'd and the oblique. The fi<U+017F>t is oblique or angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, when the Branches are mutually in<U+017F>erted obliquely. I have before explained the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Now the <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es</hi> between the Veins and Arteries, are either in the Trunks or the Capillary Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els.</p>
               <p>The Veins are <U+017F>omtimes inve<U+017F>ted with a common Membrane, or <U+017F>ome external<note place="margin">Why the Veins are in <U+017F>ome places inve<U+017F>ted with Coats, in others not.</note> thick one, borrowed from the Neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts, when either they are <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and carried a long way, and are without the Bowels and Mu<U+017F>cles; or when they re<U+017F>t upon hard bodies. This happens in the lowe<U+017F>t Belly, to the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and in the Che<U+017F>t from the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where a Vein is in<U+017F>erted either into <U+017F>ome Bowell or a Mu<U+017F>cle, it needs not this common coat, becau<U+017F>e 1. It is otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>u<U+017F>teined. 2. Otherwi<U+017F>e the ready <U+017F>weating through of the blood would be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. 3. And the laying down of the Excrements of the Vein. 4. It would not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the force of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of any Bowell. 5. It would more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbibe the Blood which is <U+017F>uperfluous after the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment of the parts.</p>
               <p>Now the Veins being <U+017F>o compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed with Membranes do <hi>not feel</hi> (unle<U+017F>s they have Nerves neer them) of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves and by their own Nature, neither the acrimony of the Humors contained, nor cutting or burning.

               <p>Some conceive that a Vein is interwoven<note place="margin">Whether the Veins have Fibres.</note> with a triple kind of Fibres: but they ad, that tho<U+017F>e fibres are there ob<U+017F>curely, and only potentially, nor can be moved out of their place, by rea<U+017F>on of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trait contexture. But I rather conceive with <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius,</hi> that others imagin Fibres to be there, which are no more there than in Leather. for when we pull the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Reins all in pieces, no fibres are there to be <U+017F>een.

The Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els being changed, this Opinion would be ab<U+017F>olutely true.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>A<U+017F>ellius,</hi> who rightly a<U+017F><U+017F>igns the milkie veins to carry Chyle to the Liver, hath <U+017F>hewn that the<U+017F>e common me<U+017F>araick Veins do <U+017F>erve to no other intent, then to bring blood out of the Liver to nouri<U+017F>h the Guts. which u<U+017F>e, being before refuted, he is therein to be excu<U+017F>ed, who was likewi<U+017F>e ignorant of the true motion of the blood.</p>
               <p>6. Their true <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to bring the Blood back after the the nutriment of the Guts, into the Liver, which had bin carried to the Guts, by the me<U+017F>araick Arteries. This is apparent by Ligatures in living Creatures, which <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi> practi<U+017F>ed, in which they <U+017F>well towards the Liver, but are empty towards the Guts. The <hi>Valves</hi> <U+017F>hew as much, which were by <hi>Harvey</hi> found out in the me<U+017F>araick veins, looking towards the Cava and the venae portae, which <hi>Columbus</hi> al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erved, and which hinder the blood of vena portae from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into the Guts. Nor does the Conflux of humors out of the Body about the Guts hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whither the Humors flow thither of their own accord or provoked by medicaments; becau<U+017F>e this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Humors is certainly through the me<U+017F>enterick Arteries which neither <hi>Spigelius</hi> denies, nor tho<U+017F>e that maintaine the Circulation of the Blood.</p>

Conjugation. Some have conceived the<U+017F>e ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to be Arteries, but contrary to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, which acknowledges here a <U+017F>imple coat, and no motion. Only the not knowing of their Trunk, does keep <U+017F>ome learned men as yet in <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>e, which if it could be demon<U+017F>trated to be in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they would be of out mind.

And others account it no impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible thing, that they may by their twigs be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Liver without any Trunk. Yea and it <U+017F>eems not improbable to the renowned <hi>Kyperus</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> that the milkie veins being confounded with the Me<U+017F>araicks in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> or great kernel, do there emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their Chyle into the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> and <U+017F>o it is carried by the Veins into the Liver, that it may be mixed with the <hi>Fermentum</hi> brought from the Spleen, and <U+017F>o receive the Rudiments of Blood. But I <U+017F>hal by and by <U+017F>hew that the milkie veins have branches which reach into the Liver, where they are in<U+017F>erted.</p>

               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Vena cavae</hi> a<U+017F>cends by the Septum, and boring its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the Pericardium, it goes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards the left hand, and infinuates it <U+017F>elf into the right Ventricle of the Heart, with a large hole, where it is joyned on all <U+017F>ides to the left Ear-let: and there is made,</p>

In a Man after its Beginning, which is between the fourth and fi<U+017F>t Vertebra of the Che<U+017F>t, it bends a little back towards the right <U+017F>ide and outwardly, unto the eighth or ninth Vertebra of the Che<U+017F>t; where it begins to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the very middle <U+017F>pace.

               <p>The Beginning of its Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation, is not the Brain, as <hi>Pelops Galen's</hi> Ma<U+017F>ter would have it, but the Heart by the Con<U+017F>ent of all Philo<U+017F>ophers and Phy<U+017F>itians.

               <p>Their <hi>End</hi> or U<U+017F>e is, 1.

That the heat of the parts is fanned, cooled and tempered, and <U+017F>o a <U+017F>ymmetrie or due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Heat is pre<U+017F>erved. which is cau<U+017F>ed, not <U+017F>o much by the Airs being drawn in, when the Artery is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, to avoid Vacuum, as by the arterial Blood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flowing in, impregnated with Air. 2. That this nouri<U+017F>hing arterial Blood, may be continually poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Arteries, and from thence into the parts of the Body. For <hi>in the fir<U+017F>t place,</hi> the Heart by continuall pul<U+017F>ing, drives the Blood into the greater Arteries, which becau<U+017F>e they cannot let it return becau<U+017F>e of the Valves, and are too <U+017F>trong to break, it mu<U+017F>t needs be driven to to the very <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Arteries and the parts of the Body. And tho<U+017F>e parts not being nouri<U+017F>hed with all that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, do <U+017F>end back that which is <U+017F>uperfluous into the Veins, that <U+017F>o it may be circulated. <hi>Moreover,</hi> an Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie being bound in any part of the Body, it is filled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart, otherwi<U+017F>e than the Veins; contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e towards the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Arteries and the parts it is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Blood-letting, the Arm being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently

Lea<U+017F>t the Blood of the Veins to which they are joyned, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>til, and putrifie like <U+017F>tanding waters, and that the Heart may not be de<U+017F>titute of Blood in its continual expul<U+017F>ion, by the driving Arteries it is continually filled again through the Veins.</p>
               <p>This Motion of the Arteries called the <hi>Pul<U+017F>e,</hi> is cau<U+017F>ed, either by the faculty alone,<note place="margin">The Pul<U+017F>e how cau<U+017F>ed.</note> whether <U+017F>eated in the Arteries them<U+017F>elves, as <hi>Praxagoras</hi> would have it, or flowing from the Heart by the coats of the Arteries, as <hi>Galen</hi> and infinite Phy<U+017F>itians after him have taught, e<U+017F>pecially by rea<U+017F>on of a little Reed put into the Arteries, under which they are not mov'd, by rea<U+017F>on of the Intercepton of their coat, til it be taken away. again, becau<U+017F>e as the Heart is contracted and widened, <U+017F>o are the Arteries, as appears by laying one hand to the region of the Heart, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Wri<U+017F>t, and by wounds in the Heart and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: or by the <hi>Blood</hi> either boyling according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> or rarefied according to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or meerly di<U+017F>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Harvey</hi> hath proved: or from both the Blood fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the faculty directing, which is my opinion. For that the Arteries are moved and di<U+017F>tended by the <hi>Blood,</hi> I prove. 1. The Heart by its perpetual pul<U+017F>ing, expels great <U+017F>tore of Blood, as I have demo<U+017F>trated in my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Heart. 2. That the <U+017F>ame Blood doth fill and move the Arteries, the Artery it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hews, being laid bare, into which at every pul<U+017F>e, you <U+017F>hall feel with your fingers the Blood driven in to flow down, with which it is dilated. 3. When an Artery is opened, Blood leaps out, at every pul<U+017F>e, as out of the Heart. 4. <hi>Harvey</hi> <U+017F>aw a portion of the de<U+017F>cendent Artery with two crural branches a <U+017F>pan long taken out of the Body of a Gentleman, which was turned into a fi<U+017F>tulous hollow bone, and neverthele<U+017F>s the Blood which when he was living, de<U+017F>cended through the the Cavity thereof into his Legs, did move the Arteries beneath, by its impul<U+017F>e. The <U+017F>ame hath been ob<U+017F>erved by others in the <hi>Arteria Aorta</hi> 5. In an Aneuri<U+017F>ma the fle<U+017F>h is manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>een to pul<U+017F>e, as formerly the Artery being <U+017F>ound was wont to do by the afflux of Blood. 6. The waving, Worm-creeping pul<U+017F>e, do argue the <U+017F>ame, in the judgment of <hi>Walaeus.</hi> 7. <hi>Harvey</hi> gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare experiment, made with the Guts of a Dog, Wolf or other Creature dried, blown up and filled with Water. For if we <U+017F>mite one end with our Finger, and lay our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the other end, we may cleerly perceive every <U+017F>troak, and the difference of the motion. Howbeit I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the faculty ought to be joyned hereto, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Coats from the Heart, by help whereof, they are contracted and widned; becau<U+017F>e, 1. Otherwi<U+017F>e the Flux of the Blood would be inordinate, and the pul<U+017F>e al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies unequal. 2. All the Arteries are dilated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in one moment, but the Blood alone fils the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively and moves them part after part. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Gloves being blown into, all the fingers are puffed up at once, which <hi>Harvey</hi> objects, and in a Ba<U+017F>in the blow and motion are at once in both ends: but corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood is of another Nature, which cannot be moved like <U+017F>pecies or Winds. 3. The Faculties or Irradiation of vital light, may run through all parts in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eve, like the Light of the Sun. See more of this in the Chapter of the Heart. 4. Hence within <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> his Reed the Artery is ob<U+017F>curely moved, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>wift motion of the Blood cea<U+017F>es when the Faculty is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Howbeit, <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Walaeus</hi> argue differently about this difficult Experiment.</p>
               <p>Now all the Arteries are widened<note place="margin">Whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are dilated together with the Heart or no.</note> when the Heart is contracted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted when the Heart is widened, which is certain from the di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of an Artery and the Heart, and from Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures, nor was it <U+017F>o long ago unknown to <hi>Era<U+017F>i<U+017F>tratus,</hi> and rea<U+017F>on confirmes the <U+017F>ame, becau<U+017F>e when the Heart expels, then are the the Arteries filled with its Blood. Yet have they not contrary pul<U+017F>es, as we find by laying our hand to the wri<U+017F>t and the Region of the Heart, at one and the <U+017F>ame time, for the pul<U+017F>e of the Heart is perceived by us in its Sy<U+017F>tole, but that of the Arteries in the Dia<U+017F>tole, when they are filled, becau<U+017F>e the two motions, are at one and the <U+017F>ame time. The <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t <hi>capillary</hi> Arteries are not perceived to pul<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e there is not <U+017F>o much force in them, and therefore we can hardly di<U+017F>cern them from the Veins. al<U+017F>o they have thin Coats, <U+017F>o that the Blood is <U+017F>een through them, as through the Veins.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Form</hi> is apparent from the Accidents; howbeit the form of an Arterie is the Sub<U+017F>tancial Soul, as it is of the whole Body be<U+017F>ides.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is deep, allwaies under the Veins, that they might be more <U+017F>afe, and that not only in the external, but the internal parts al<U+017F>o, if you except the Belly, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Kidneies: For after that the Vena Cava and the Aorta, de<U+017F>cending from the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Region of the Kidneies, the Cava hides it <U+017F>elf under the Aorta through all that region, til they pa<U+017F>s out of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen; for then the Arterie does again <U+017F>ide it <U+017F>elfe under the Cava. The Cau<U+017F>e whereof <hi>Plempius</hi> conceives to be this; that otherwi<U+017F>e there would have bin danger, lea<U+017F>t the bending of the Body often happening in that place, the Vena cava having but a <U+017F>ingle Coat, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the <U+017F>aid motion.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> is <U+017F>ufficiently great, but<note place="margin">Its Magnitude.</note> the de<U+017F>cending part of the Arterle is greater, the a<U+017F>cendent le<U+017F><U+017F>er, becau<U+017F>e the Number of the internal parts is greater then of the external.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number</hi> of the Arteries is fewer then of the Veins, becau<U+017F>e the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood is quick through the Arteries, <U+017F>low through the Veins, and therefore there are many receptacles provided for that Blood which is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by certain pul<U+017F>es. Yet there are more Arteries then we think, or can be di<U+017F>cerned by us, becau<U+017F>e the capillary Arteries are exceeding like to Veins.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> is like a Pipe or Channel, <U+017F>mooth, round, and long.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages.</hi> Some Arteries are terminated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guts, by which expul<U+017F>ion of Excrements is cau<U+017F>ed; <U+017F>ome have their mouths terminated into the Skin, through which the external air is attracted (in Tran<U+017F>piration which is performed al<U+017F>o by the Veins) and <U+017F>ooty <U+017F>teams expelled. <hi>Platerus</hi> denies that they are in<U+017F>erted into the Bones, but <hi>Spigelius</hi> ob<U+017F>erved at <hi>Padua,</hi> in a great corruption of the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the de<U+017F>cending Trunk of the great Arterie.</head>
               <p>THe Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> or great Arterie <hi>de<U+017F>cending</hi> is greater, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ends out branches from it <U+017F>elf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle and lower belly, as al<U+017F>o into the Thighes.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Che<U+017F>t</hi> or middle Bellie, two Arteries proceed from the greater Trunk.</p>
               <p>I The <hi>Interco<U+017F>tales inferiores</hi> which go unto the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls of eight Ribs, and the neighbouring Mu<U+017F>cles. For it <U+017F>eldom happens, that the Vein <U+017F>ine pari, has to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it an Arterie <U+017F>ine pari, ari<U+017F>eing from the Trunk. By the<U+017F>e interco<U+017F>tals if we beleive <hi>Spigelius,</hi> quittor and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter collected in the Che<U+017F>t, are received into the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and thence by the<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> emulgent Veins carried into the Bladder, which has al<U+017F>o rea<U+017F>on to back it, becau<U+017F>e the conge<U+017F>ted matter is more ea<U+017F>ily hurried through the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the way is <U+017F>horter. I add that quittor more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily follows the natural motion of the Arterial Blood then of the venal.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Phrenica</hi> to <U+017F>erve the Midriff and Pericardium, or Heart-bag.</p>
               <p>The re<U+017F>t of the Trunk peirces through the Clift of the Septum, and <U+017F>preads branches through the lower Belly, <U+017F>ome of which accompany the branches of vena portae, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Branches of Vena Cava. Tho<U+017F>e which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Branches of vena portae are three;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeliaca Arteria, Me<U+017F>enterica Superior &amp; Inferior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caeliaca,</hi> <U+017F>o called becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ends many branches unto the Stomach, proceeds foreward from the Aorta, being under propped by the Call, and is divided into the <hi>Ramus dexter</hi> which is the <U+017F>maller, and the <hi>Sini<U+017F>ter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> which is the larger, which under the hinder region of the Stomach, are knit to the Vena Portae in the Pancreas.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dexter</hi> a<U+017F>cending to the Cavity of the Liver, and proceeding a little forwards, on the higher <U+017F>ide produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Ga<U+017F>trica dextra,</hi> and the <hi>Cy<U+017F>ticae gemellae;</hi> from its low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part, <hi>Epiploe dextra, Inte<U+017F>tinalis,</hi> and <hi>Ga<U+017F>troepiploïs dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Vena portae.</hi> therefore let what was <U+017F>aid there, be here repeated. The Remainder from the <hi>Ramus dexter</hi> goes into the hollow <U+017F>urface of the Liver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sini<U+017F>ter</hi> or <hi>Arteria Splenica,</hi> is greater than the <hi>Dexter,</hi> lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be ea<U+017F>ily ob<U+017F>tructed by thick juyces, and that it may pour <U+017F>ufficient vital blood, into the Spleen. This Artery drawn out into the <hi>Vena Splenica,</hi> by a bending and crooked Cour<U+017F>e goes to the Spleen, and then <U+017F>preads branches after the <U+017F>ame manner as the <hi>Vena Splenica.</hi>

Nor do they draw to the Heart, as <hi>Varolus</hi> would have it, for the valves hinder: and the Chyle is not natural to the Heart. Nor to the Liver or Spleen, as others <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e only the Splenick Arteries do carry vital Blood to the Spleen, and there is only one little Artery implanted in the Liver.

For no Anatomi<U+017F>t as yet hath ob<U+017F>erved any Valves. Nor can <U+017F>ubtile Spirits be <U+017F>topped by Valves. Nor would Apoplexies or Pal<U+017F>ies <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily happen, if the Spirits could be detained in the parts by Valves.</p>

            <p>IN the la<U+017F>t place, I <U+017F>hall briefly (as I<note place="margin">The rea<U+017F>on of the Authors Method. Why he treats la<U+017F>t of the Bones.</note> have done other things) explain the Doctrine of the Bones.</p>
            <p>In the la<U+017F>t place, I <U+017F>ay, becau<U+017F>e when all things el<U+017F>e are removed and <U+017F>eparated, then only the <hi>Bones</hi> come in view, and are <U+017F>ubject to examination. The mo<U+017F>t dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Riolanus</hi> treats in two places of his Enchiridion, of the Bones, once as they appear in the dead Carkas, when the Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g><U+017F>cles are cut off, and again as they are dried in a Skeleton. But this O<U+017F>tentation is <U+017F>uperfluous in a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. For by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on we <U+017F>hould make a new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomical di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Guts, Stomach, Womb, and other Parts taken out, and dried, and commonly hung up for <U+017F>hew in the Anatmoical Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres. There is no u<U+017F>e of the latter Doctrine of the Bones, unle<U+017F>s to help the Memory, nor is it perfectly under<U+017F>tood without the former. And therefore other Anatomi<U+017F>ts, with the parts demon<U+017F>trate the Bones lying beneath them, in the dead body. I <U+017F>hal therefore only bu<U+017F>ie my <U+017F>elf with the fir<U+017F>t, and therewith.</p>
            <p>Joyn the Doctrine of <hi>Gri<U+017F>tles</hi> and <hi>Ligaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>imilitude of their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance: for the<U+017F>e three <U+017F>imilar<note place="margin">Why he treats of the Gri<U+017F>tles and Ligaments with the Bones.</note> parts are very neer of kin, A <hi>Bone,</hi> a <hi>Gri<U+017F>tle,</hi> and a <hi>Ligament,</hi> <U+017F>o that they <U+017F>eem to differ only gradually in re<U+017F>pect of more and le<U+017F>s one from another.

A <hi>Ligament</hi> is yet <U+017F>ofter than a Gri<U+017F>tle, which al<U+017F>o it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>omtimes turns to a Bone, as in decrepit Per<U+017F>ons.

Hence it is, that in the Cavities of the Bones of Animals newly brought forth, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is as yet bloody.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Immediate nutritive Matter</hi> of the <hi>hollowed</hi> Bones, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> is the Marrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <U+017F>aid Bones (who are contradicted by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle</hi> and other Peripetaticks, who will have the Marrow to be rather the excrement of the Bones) as in Gri<U+017F>tles that <U+017F>ame <U+017F>notty matter which lies round about them, is their immediate nutritive Matter; and in Ligaments, Membranes and Nerves, that <U+017F>ame clammy humor <U+017F>hed in among<U+017F>t them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>End</hi> or U<U+017F>e of the Bones, is,</p>
               <list>

                  <item>5. Certain Medicinal U<U+017F>es there are of Bones. Their Pouder cures a Cancer, Fevers, any Fluxes.

               <p>The <hi>Situation</hi> of the Bones is deep, becau<U+017F>e they are the Foundations and Upholders of the Body.</p>
               <p>They vary in <hi>Magnitude</hi> according to the variety of their Utilities. <hi>Great</hi> are the Bones of the Leg, Thigh, Arm, Shoulder, &amp;c. <hi>Small</hi> tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Ear</hi> <U+017F>erving for <hi>Hearing,</hi> the <hi>Se<U+017F>amoidean</hi> Bones, the <hi>Teeth,</hi> the <hi>Wri<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The Number of all the Bones of the Body, is not the <U+017F>ame in all Per<U+017F>ons. For in Children they are more, which by degrees grow together and become fewer.

               <p>They are all of them externally <hi>inclo<U+017F>ed</hi> (not internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) with the Perio<U+017F>tium, excepting the Teeth, <U+017F>e<U+017F>amoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean Bones, and the <U+017F>ides of the other Bones where they are mutually joyned one to another.

               <p>Its <hi>Efficient</hi> is the Ligament-making Power.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Matter</hi> is a clammy roaping part of the Seed.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is, like a cord to bind together the parts of the body, e<U+017F>pecially the Bones, and <U+017F>o to keep them together, in the Head, Che<U+017F>t, Back, and Limbs, that they may not be di<U+017F>located or di<U+017F>pointed.</p>
               <p>Becau<U+017F>e of its mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trong cleaving thereunto, a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament is <U+017F>aid to ari<U+017F>e (though it be indeed made of the Seed) from the Bone primarily, <U+017F>omtimes from a Gri<U+017F>tle, gri<U+017F>tly bone or Membrane: and its <U+017F>aid to be <hi>in<U+017F>erted</hi> into a Bone, Gri<U+017F>tle, Mu<U+017F>cle, or <U+017F>ome part. Or if you would rather have it <U+017F>o; Ligaments grow among the Bones, of in the Bones.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Situation.</hi> Some are without among the Bones, as the gri<U+017F>ly Ligaments <U+017F>o called, which are thick and commonly round: others are wound externally about the bones which are thin and membranous.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Figure:</hi> <U+017F>ome are broader which Anatomi<U+017F>ts term membranous Ligaments, as hath been <U+017F>aid; others are longer, which are called Nervous Ligaments. And they call them <U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e of their re<U+017F>emblance, not as if a Ligament were truly membranous or nervous. So they are called membranous, which being broad and thin do compa<U+017F>s the Joynts, al<U+017F>o which are wrapt about Tendons and Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance</hi> is <U+017F>olid, white, bloodle<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ofter than a Gri<U+017F>tle, harder than Nerves and Membranes: for it is as it were of a middle Nature betwixt a Gri<U+017F>tle and a Nerve.</p>
               <p>It is without Cavity, Sen<U+017F>e or Motion. It was to be without Sen<U+017F>e, lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be alwaies pained in Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when as the Ligaments are made <U+017F>omtimes longer and <U+017F>horter, that is to <U+017F>ay, are contracted and extended. Some neverthele<U+017F>s wil have membranous Ligaments to feel, but they mu<U+017F>t grant it to be <U+017F>o, by means of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and not of their own proper <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
               <p>For this <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of theirs is as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us divi<U+017F>ible into fibres vi<U+017F>ible to the <U+017F>ight, which experience al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.</p>
               <p>Now this Sub<U+017F>tance is in <U+017F>ome places <hi><U+017F>ofter</hi> and more membranous than in others, as in all Ligaments wel-neer, which go round about the Joynts; and among the<U+017F>e, it is <U+017F>ofter about the Joynt of the Shoulder, than about that of the Hip; and yet <U+017F>ofter where it goes about the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntings of the fingers. But in other places the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance is harder<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and as it were in part gri<U+017F>tly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in <U+017F>uch places termed gri<U+017F>tly Ligaments; and they are <U+017F>uch as lie concealed among the Bones, as that which goes from the Head of the Thigh, into the Hip-joynt.</p>

               <p>I <U+017F>ay in a manner or wel-neer, which others do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve: for in <U+017F>ome places the Skul is <U+017F>ingle, thin and tran<U+017F>parent. without any di<U+017F>tance of plates.

               <p>And every where there are frequent <hi>holes</hi> in the Skull, very <U+017F>mall and placed without order, through which <U+017F>mall Veins and Arteries pa<U+017F>s, to the inner Cavity of the Bones, and the <hi>dura Menynx.</hi> But <U+017F>omtimes they are not to be found.</p>
               <p>At length, that we may come to the parts of the Skull, we mu<U+017F>t know that the Skul doth not con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of one only Bone, lea<U+017F>t by one wound the whole Skul <U+017F>hould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces; but of divers: which are fa<U+017F>tned together by the Sutures, of which in the following Chapter.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Skull</hi> in per<U+017F>ons grown to ripe years are <hi>eight.</hi> whereof two <hi>are common</hi> to the Skul, with the upper Jaw-bone, viz. the <hi>cundiforme</hi> and the <hi><U+017F>pongio<U+017F>um.</hi> But there are <hi><U+017F>ix proper</hi> bones, which make up the Skul it <U+017F>elf: One of the <hi>Forehead</hi> (in new born Children two) two of the Forepart of the Head, one of the <hi>Hind-part</hi> (in an Infant four) two of the <hi>Temples.</hi> And there lie hid in the Auditory pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, other <hi><U+017F>ix</hi> bones, on each <U+017F>ide three little ones: the <hi>Hammer,</hi> the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and the <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup,</hi> to which a fourth is added called <hi>Orbiculare.</hi>

               <p>They are termed <hi>true,</hi> which meet together like the teeth of Combs, or like Saws, put together, which I have <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>een after Contu<U+017F>ion movable, which al<U+017F>o in mo<U+017F>t Skuls that are over dried in the Earth is common.

               </list>
               <p>For from the Temples it a<U+017F>cends on both <U+017F>ides, athwart, to the top of the Head. The Arabians call this <U+017F>uture <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cualis</hi> and <hi>Puppis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to joyn the Fore-head bone with the bones of the Hinder-head, and to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them therefrom. The place of the coronal Suture is <U+017F>ound out in a living per<U+017F>on, either by carrying the hand upwards from the Wri<U+017F>t along the No<U+017F>e, or by drawing a Thred out from Ear to Ear, and another cro<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame from the end of the No<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>2. That which is oppo<U+017F>ite to this, is behind and in the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Hinder-head. 'Tis called <hi>Lamdoeidès</hi> the Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da-<U+017F>hap'd, from the Greek letter A. <U+017F>ome call it <hi>hup<U+017F>iloï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> from the letter <hi>up<U+017F>ilon,</hi> al<U+017F>o <hi>prorae <U+017F>utura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This a<U+017F>cends obliquely, from the Ba<U+017F>e of the Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to each Ear, grows into an Angle. Somtimes when the Hinder-head is large or otherwi<U+017F>e, 'tis divided by a tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e <U+017F>uture, <U+017F>imple, or double: <U+017F>omtimes there is a double triple Suture as if a greater triangle did contain one or two le<U+017F><U+017F>er Triangles within the <U+017F>ame: where the Bones <U+017F>o comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">The triangular Bones of the Skul.</note> are termed <hi>o<U+017F><U+017F>icula triangularia,</hi> the little three-cornerd bones, commended, in the Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e triangular bones, <hi>Olaus Worm</hi> a rare man, found others in the Lambda-like Suture, which perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the Boards of the Skull, ob<U+017F>erved as yet by very <U+017F>ew. Three for the mo<U+017F>t part on the right, as many on the left <U+017F>ide, differing in magnitude, figure and <U+017F>ituation, which al<U+017F>o are accurately di<U+017F>cerned and di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed in Infants. The <hi>lowe<U+017F>t</hi> is <U+017F>een at the <hi>Proce<U+017F><U+017F>us mammillares,</hi> the <hi>middlemo<U+017F>t</hi> a little higher, <U+017F>carce half a Fingers breadth, the <hi>third</hi> a little further di<U+017F>tinct from the <U+017F>econd. <hi>Pavius</hi> found only two like to the<U+017F>e, circum<U+017F>cribed with their little Sutures or <U+017F>eams, which he doubts whether he <U+017F>hould refer them to the Bones of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or the Bregma.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Shape</hi> they are Various, Triangular, Oblong, Oval. <U+017F>omtimes in living per<U+017F>ons I have ob<U+017F>erved them to grow <U+017F>o high, that I could Feel them with my Fingers, as if they had been Epiphy<U+017F>is or <U+017F>omewhat growing upon the Bone.</p>
               <p>All are <hi>larger</hi> on the left <U+017F>ide. but the greate<U+017F>t exceeds not the Nail of a Mans thumb.</p>
               <p>They appear more di<U+017F>tinct on the inner &amp; Concave <U+017F>ide of the Skul, than in the outward and convex, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all more cleerly di<U+017F>cern'd when the Skul is taken away,</p>
               <p>We are neverthele<U+017F>s to ob<U+017F>erve that the<U+017F>e bones of <hi>Worm</hi> do in divers Skuls vary, both in Number, Magnitude, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Situation; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>omtimes there are four, <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, and in a Right line only, <U+017F>omtimes in the very Juncture of the Sagittal with the Lambda-<U+017F>hap'd; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times al<U+017F>o in the Scaley temporal Sutures.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>U<U+017F>e,</hi> I believe, is 1. That the Sutures being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged thereabouts, might afford a more free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for Excrements.</p>
               <p>2. That the Skul being made up of more bones, might be more <U+017F>afe in Blows and Contu<U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of this Lambda-like Suture, is to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Hinder-head, from the bones of the Temples, and the forepart of the Head.</p>
               <p>3. In the middle betwixt the<U+017F>e two is the Suture ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Somtimes it proceeds through the middle of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Suture and the midde<U+017F>t of the Fore-head, as far as to the No<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially in Infants: in <U+017F>ome al<U+017F>o it cuts part of the Bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Hinder-head.

               <p>This Suture is termed <hi>Virgata</hi> and <hi>Recta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> is to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h and joyn together the two bones of the <hi>Sinciput</hi> or Fore-part of the Head.</p>

               <p>Now there are many <U+017F>purious Sutures<note place="margin">A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sutures.</note> every where in the Skul, al<U+017F>o many har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, where the bones are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: in the Palate bone a peculiar Suture is <U+017F>een.</p>

               <p>The <hi>U<U+017F>e</hi> of the<U+017F>e little bones is not to make a <U+017F>ound, but that the <U+017F>pecies of <U+017F>ound being received, may pa<U+017F>s to the lower parts, and that there may be a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for the excrements of the Ears.

               <p>And this Jaw-bone in Mankind, is <U+017F>horter and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in Brutes, for Beauties <U+017F>ake, al<U+017F>o it is immoveable as it is in Bea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>aving the Parrot, the Phaenicopterus, and the Crocodile as wel that which lives in the water, as the Land-Crocodile; yet do they not move the upper Jaw only, but their whole Head withall being <U+017F>traitly fa<U+017F>ten'd thereto, as Vipers do, and the like is to be <U+017F>aid of the Parrot.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>lower</hi> Jaw-bone in Mankind and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is only movable, <U+017F>ave in the Crocodile, which hath it <U+017F>o united to the Bones of the Temples, that it can no waies be <U+017F>tirred; but the Parrot moves both.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Connexion</hi> is without motion in the upper Jaw, by a Suture or Harmonie whereby it is joyned with many bones of its own, of which it is compo<U+017F>ed, and other bones placed round about; in the <hi>lower</hi> by way of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondro<U+017F>is,</hi> which is in the middle of the Chin.

                  <hi>Helmont</hi> counts the matter of the Bone not to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boney, but as it were of a middle nature betwixt Bone and Stone; becau<U+017F>e the Teeth turn to Stone whatever kind of food <U+017F>ticks long to them, be it Bread, Fle<U+017F>h, Herbs, Fi<U+017F>h, Apples, Beans, or Pea<U+017F>e, &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:41352:118"/>And about the <U+017F>eventh and fourteenth yeer, <hi>other Teeth are wont to break out</hi> (the<note place="margin">Why and when young ones loo<U+017F>e their Teeth.</note> former falling away) in both the Jaws ten, four Cutters, two Dog-teeth, and four Grinders. And the former fall out in the fourth, fift, and <U+017F>ixt year. becau<U+017F>e the holes grow wider, and therefore the Teeth being at that time <U+017F>oft, do grow loo<U+017F>e and fall out. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dreams <U+017F>aies, that for a man to dream he loo<U+017F>es a Tooth another comes in the Rome, betokens gain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Joy. If their Teeth do not <U+017F>hed, the latter Teeth come out at new holes, the upper commonly on the out<U+017F>ide, the lower on the in<U+017F>ide, as there were new ranks of Teeth. More frequently they <U+017F>pring out on the <U+017F>ides and augment the number.</p>
               <p>But the<U+017F>e Teeth are not bred anew without the Womb: for then likewi<U+017F>e<note place="margin">Whether new Teeth are bred out of the womb?</note> Membranes, Nerves, Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be bred anew: but the <U+017F>eeds of them lie within the Jaws. For <hi>Eu<U+017F>tachius</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome <U+017F>maller Teeth at the back of the re<U+017F>t which fall out, a very thin partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being removed which is found between the two <U+017F>orts of Teeth. But a rare ca<U+017F>e it is for Teeth to breed again, after many years and in old age. As <hi>Thuanus</hi> relates of a man that was an hundred yeer old: in our <hi>Fionia</hi> a man of an hundred and forty years of age, had new Teeth. <hi>Helmont</hi> <U+017F>aw an old Man and Woman of <U+017F>ixty three yeers of age, who<U+017F>e Teeth grew again with <U+017F>uch pains as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have when breed they teeth, which was no token of their long living, for both of them died that yeer. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> hath the like Example touching an old Man.</p>
               <p>But now let us <U+017F>peak of the Teeth in grown per<U+017F>ons.</p>
               <p>The Teeth are <hi><U+017F>eated</hi> in the Compa<U+017F>s of the two Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, in Mankind, <U+017F>hut up within his mouth; in a Boar they <U+017F>tick out, as al<U+017F>o in the Whale-fi<U+017F>h cal'd <hi>Narhual</hi> in our <hi>Greenland;</hi> which <U+017F>ends out an exceeding long wreathed Tooth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They vary in <hi>Figure.</hi> In Man they are of a threefold figure: Cutters, Dog-teeth, and Grinders, as <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>aid in the following Chapter; <U+017F>ave that <hi>Fontanus</hi> ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a certain Man, that they were all Grinders which he had. In Creatures that <hi>chew the Cud</hi> they are double; Cutters and Grinders. In Fi<U+017F>hes they are in a manner all perfectly <U+017F>harp, excepting one kind of Whale, which the <hi>I<U+017F>landers</hi> call Springwall, who<U+017F>e teeth are blunt, but broad.</p>

               <p>THe Vertebrae of the <hi>Neck</hi> are commonly <U+017F>even. In Brutes for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>ix only, and <hi>Busbequius</hi> relates that the <hi>Hyena</hi> hath none, who is confuted by the Skeleton of that Bea<U+017F>t in the cu<U+017F>tody of <hi>P.

               <list>
                  <item>I. Some of them have their tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es cleft in two.</item>
                  <item>II. Al<U+017F>o they have them bored, for the cervical Veins and Arteries, a<U+017F>cending into the Brain.</item>
                  <item>III. They have a cloven Spine or thorny Point.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>two fir<U+017F>t</hi> are joyned by Ligaments to the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Head, that they may <U+017F>tick mo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e to the Head, and have <U+017F>omwhat peculiar to them<U+017F>elves, which the other five have not.</p>
               <p>I. Is termed <hi>Atlas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eems to bear the Head up, which re<U+017F>ts upon the<note place="margin">Why the fir<U+017F>t Vertebra has no Spine?</note> two hollows thereof. Some call it <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tropheus,</hi> though more give that Name to the <U+017F>econd. It <hi>hath no Spine</hi> or <hi><U+017F>harp Point,</hi> lea<U+017F>t the two <U+017F>mall Mu<U+017F>cles of the Head which ari<U+017F>e from the <U+017F>econd Vertebra, <U+017F>hould be hurt when the Head is <U+017F>tretched out.</p>
               <p>It hath a thinner, but more compact <hi>Sub<U+017F>tance.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and is not received: and therefore it hath its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity covered with a Cartilage, to receive the tooth of the following Vertebra.</p>
               <p>II. Is called <hi>Epi<U+017F>tropheus</hi> from turning: for out of the middle of its Body, there ri<U+017F>es an Appendix (others call it a Proce<U+017F>s) round and oblong, like a Dogs tooth, about which the Head with the fir<U+017F>t Vertebra is turned.</p>
               <p>Hence that Appendix is called a tooth; yea and the whole Vertebra is by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An incurable Squinzie by Luxation of the Tooth.</note> <U+017F>o called, by the Luxation whereof, he conceives an incurable Squinzie, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cau<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>The Surface of the Tooth is in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort rough, becau<U+017F>e thence proceeds the Ligament, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is bound to the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hind-part of the Head, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which al<U+017F>o is wound a <U+017F>olid and round Ligament, like a Nerve in <U+017F>hape, wonderous artificially twi<U+017F>ted, that the Marrow may not be compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and hurt.</p>
               <p>Now this <U+017F>econd Vertebra is joyned with the fir<U+017F>t, by a broad <hi>Ligament,</hi> turned round.</p>
               <p>The la<U+017F>t does more agree with the Vertebra's of the Che<U+017F>t, and hath its la<U+017F>t Proce<U+017F>s not alwaies cloven.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae of the Back</hi> are commonly <hi>twelve</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; to which <U+017F>o many Ribs on each <U+017F>ide are articulated: <U+017F>eldom one is wanting; and there is <U+017F>eldomer one more.</p>
               <p>They are thicker then tho<U+017F>e of the Neck; le<U+017F>s <U+017F>olid, and full of little holes, for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the nouri<U+017F>hing Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</p>

               <p>The tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es are longer, but thinner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the fir<U+017F>t and fift; but the Spines are thicker and broader, to which the Mu<U+017F>cles and Ligaments of the Back are fa<U+017F>tned.</p>

               <p>It is broad and immoveable, being the Ba<U+017F>is or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Back.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is commonly triangular. It is in its fore-part hollow, <U+017F>mooth and even; behind it is bunching and rough.</p>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> makes the Os <U+017F>acrum to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of three Bones; becau<U+017F>e he comprehends the other Bones of Os <U+017F>acrum under the Crupper-bone, and calls that an Epiphy<U+017F>is, which others call <hi>Os Coccygis.</hi>

               <p>The Holes are not in its <U+017F>ides, as tho<U+017F>e of the former, but in the fore-part (which are greater, becau<U+017F>e there are greater Nerves) and the hinder-part: becau<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ides in the Os Ilion or Flank-bone.</p>

                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:41352:119"/>OS COCCYGIS the Cockow-bone, <U+017F>o called from the Shape it hath of a Cuckows-bill, is under the former, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of three or four Bones, and two Gri<U+017F>tles. But I conceive there was a greater number of Bones and Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tles in that Dani<U+017F>h Boy, who had a Tail growing out at his Rump.</p>
               <p>Their Connexion is loo<U+017F>e, and in Women loo<U+017F>er then in Men, that they<note place="margin">The Os coccygis may be loo<U+017F>ned.</note> may give way.</p>
               <p>1. In the Voidance of large Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>2. In the time of Womens Travel, that the cavity may be more wide. And therefore <U+017F>ome conceive that this Bone only gives way in the Birth, though <hi>Pinaeus</hi> be again<U+017F>t it, and that the Pains of Women in Travel depend upon the Concour<U+017F>e of little Nerves in that place. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <U+017F>itting it comes forwards, and of its own accord returns into its place.</p>
               <p>This Bone in Men bends more inward to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Inte<U+017F>tinum rectum; in Women outwards, becau<U+017F>e of the Neck of the Womb, and that the Cavity might be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>This Bone being hurt or broken, exceeding great, pains are rai<U+017F>ed, as the Stories related by <hi>Amatus</hi> and <hi>Donatus,</hi> do witne<U+017F>s. <hi>Hofman</hi> believes it is of no u<U+017F>e, but is only the mark of a tail, as the Nipples in Men are only the <U+017F>igns or marks of Duggs. But the con<U+017F>tant Doctrine of <hi>Galen</hi> is, that all Parts of the Body are made for <U+017F>ome U<U+017F>e.</p>

               <p>This Bone is larger in Women, and its Spine is drawn more out <U+017F>idewaies, that<note place="margin">Why the Os I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium is larger in Women?</note> the Womb of a Woman with Child may better re<U+017F>t upon it. And therefore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child do a little complain of this Part, as if it were pulled a<U+017F>under from the Os <U+017F>acrum and other neighbouring Parts to which it cleaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Os pubis</hi> or <hi>Pectinis,</hi> the Share-bone, is the <U+017F>econd middlemore and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more<note place="margin">The Share-bones are loo<U+017F>ned in Child-birth.</note> Part; which Bone is joyned to the Bone of the other <U+017F>ide, by way of Sunchondro<U+017F>is, that is to <U+017F>ay, by a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tle coming between; which in Women is twice as thick and loo<U+017F>e or wide as in Men, that the<U+017F>e Bones in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth may be (not di<U+017F>located or disjoynted, but) loo<U+017F>ned and made to gape, when the Child <U+017F>trives to come forth. But now and then when the Childs greatne<U+017F>s, or the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowne<U+017F>s of the place requires, the Share-bones are pulled a<U+017F>under, as, be<U+017F>ides the Authority of the Ancients, <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved in the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-women, &amp;c. and it is largely proved in the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Controver<U+017F>ies of my <hi>Father Bartholinus:</hi> But this is not alwaies <U+017F>o, namely when the Child is <U+017F>oft and apt to bend it <U+017F>elf and comply with the <U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s of the place when the way is <U+017F>lippery, the Bones much widened, &amp;c. for then the loo<U+017F>ning of the Gri<U+017F>tle does <U+017F>uffice.</p>
               <p>But whether the Share-bones are moved is another que<U+017F>tion. <hi>Joh.

               <p>But <U+017F>ome doubts do as yet make me <U+017F>cruple this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <item>2. The<U+017F>e Bones being joyned together by Symphy<U+017F>is, can have no motion, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> him<U+017F>elf confe<U+017F><U+017F>es.</item>

For in the Examples alleadged, any man may experiment in him<U+017F>elf, that both his Thighs and Back are moved; al<U+017F>o he may by his hand perceive, that both the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Thigh called <hi>Glutaei,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adjacent Mu<U+017F>cles are moved.</item>
                  <item>5. They ought to be immoveable, becau<U+017F>e the upper Parts re<U+017F>t upon them as on a Foundation, and we re<U+017F>t by <U+017F>itting upon this Part.</item>

               <p>In Women that have been lately delivered, the<U+017F>e bones may be <U+017F>eparated with the back of a thin knife, which they cannot be in others. Moreover, though the Share-bones are joyned by a Gri<U+017F>tle, yet they have likewi<U+017F>e two</p>

               <p>That <U+017F>ome hot blood which leaps out of the great Arteries being opened is<note place="margin">What Blood it is which is moved?</note> thinner, more rare and of a more bright colour, than that which flows out of the Veins when they are opened: yet, I will not therefore <U+017F>ay, that the Arterial Blood differs formally from the Venal, Blood: for the Arterial Blood may differ as afore<U+017F>aid from the Venal, becau<U+017F>e it comes reaking hot as it were from the fire, and abounds with greater <U+017F>tore of Spirits, as we <U+017F>ee boyling Milk differs from it <U+017F>elf being cooled, for the <U+017F>ame<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> rea<U+017F>on: for that Blood which is in the <U+017F>maller Arteries, and <U+017F>o farther from the Heart, is ob<U+017F>erved to differ le<U+017F>s from the venal Blood. And when we have taken Blood out of the greater Arteries, yea, out of the Heart it <U+017F>elf of a living Creature, and from the <U+017F>ame Creature, have taken <U+017F>ome out of the Veins, and have let then, both grow cold and congeal, we could never ob<U+017F>erve any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them. So that we can <U+017F>ee no other, but that the Arterial Blood is of the <U+017F>ame kinde with the Venal.</p>
               <p>Some few will have, that the venal Blood is of two kinds, one which is contained in the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> another in the <hi>Vena porta.</hi> But we cannot <U+017F>ee any difference of the<U+017F>e Bloods either when they are included in their ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, or when they are let out: and that Rea<U+017F>on doth teach as much we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee anon.</p>
               <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e, we may likewi<U+017F>e conceive another <U+017F>ort of Blood, which being made of Chyle in the Liver, hath not received any further perfection in the Heart. And we are little concerned to know the Nature thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee it continues <U+017F>uch but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little while. So that we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<note place="margin">That it is only one kinde of blood.</note> into the motion of <hi>only one <U+017F>ort of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Blood may be <hi>moved</hi> either in <hi>that part of the Vein</hi> or <hi>Artery wherein it is contained,</hi> or <hi>out of that part into another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>one part of a Vein or Artery,</hi> the Blood is not di<U+017F>cerned to move up and<note place="margin">It is not moved up and down in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els like boiled water.</note> down, like boyling water, neither when it is received into a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, nor when let out of a living and hot Body; nor yet in the Artery it <U+017F>elf, if it being on either hand tied, <U+017F>hall be opened in the upper part betwixt the two Ligatures.

               <p>But that the Blood is moved <hi>from one part of an Artery or Vein into another,</hi> is<note place="margin">But it is moved o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what <U+017F>hal we <U+017F>ay?

There is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o. For all that may happen becau<U+017F>e the Artery is bound. And really, this is an Argument that it is <U+017F>o, in that many times that Arm in which there is an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue, is perceived to pul<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s and more faintly than the other; the influx of the blood and <U+017F>pirits, being in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure hindred, by the the binding of the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue. Yet <U+017F>ome part may peradventure fall away by binding of a Vein alone; becau<U+017F>e Nature cannot plentifully infu<U+017F>e new blood through the Artery, <U+017F>eeing it cannot freely go back by the Veins. And though the Veins and Arteries do then contain <U+017F>tore of Blood, yet is it peradventure not very fit to nouri<U+017F>h the parts as they <U+017F>hould be, but this wil better appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>It is neverthele<U+017F>s manife<U+017F>t, that in <U+017F>uch as have the <hi>Varices</hi> <U+017F>o called, the<note place="margin">Nor the Varices.</note> blood de<U+017F>cends from the <hi>Vena cava</hi> to the greater, and out of the greater into the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Veins. For that is ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee in a Varix of the Thigh and Foot, and in the Haemorrhoids. But that motion of Blood may happen be<U+017F>ides Nature, becau<U+017F>e the Veins being weakned do not <U+017F>end the Blood upwards, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <U+017F>ame; and becau<U+017F>e the humors by that weight, do re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Natural motion upwards, and de<U+017F>cend, and therefore being collected in great Quantity in the lower Veins, new Blood <U+017F>till coming out of the Arteries; they cau<U+017F>e their dilatation and con<U+017F>equently a Varix.

And it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether mo<U+017F>t likely that Varices are cau<U+017F>ed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: becau<U+017F>e humors in <U+017F>uch as have Varices, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Vein, when they are violently moved in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e, but when they have re<U+017F>ted after exerci<U+017F>e; becau<U+017F>e the humors can re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a <U+017F>maller motion and de<U+017F>cend by their own weight.</p>

But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood this way is but <U+017F>eldome and in <U+017F>mall quantity.</p>
               <p>So that it is now, I conceive, clear, <hi>what the motion of the Blood is,</hi> and by<note place="margin">And that motion of the Blood.</note> what waies it is accompli<U+017F>hed: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that we enquire, what <hi>kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is,</hi> and how it is performed.</p>
               <p>I have ob<U+017F>erved that this Motion of<note place="margin">Is continual.</note> the Blood out of the Heart into the Veins, from the Veins into the Heart, is <hi>continual</hi> never clea<U+017F>ing, nor once <U+017F>topped or interrupted for a moment of time. And the truth is, <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>aid motion is made, as we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee anon, becau<U+017F>e the Heart receives and tran<U+017F>mits, and <U+017F>eeing this motion la<U+017F>ts perpetually all the life long, the <U+017F>aid motion of the blood, cannot but naturally be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o the motion of the Blood is quick, for an Artery or Vein being bound compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately<note place="margin">Quick.</note> <U+017F>wells and grows round and hard: and when the ligature and compre<U+017F><U+017F>ure are taken away, the blood is <U+017F>een to be <U+017F>wiftly moved.</p>
               <p>But how <U+017F>oon the blood performs its Circuit from the Heart and to<note place="margin">So that the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit or round is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in le<U+017F>s than a quarter of an hour.</note> the Heart again, I cannot preci<U+017F>ely determine.

Howbeit it goeth not <U+017F>o <U+017F>wiftly, as we <U+017F>ee it leap out when a vein or Artery is opened, becau<U+017F>e then it is moved in the free and open Air; but within the body it is compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to lift up its ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and to thru<U+017F>t on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going blood.</p>
               <p>And therefore we <U+017F>ee an Artery being cut open e<U+017F>pecially if near the heart, is <U+017F>ooner emptied than the heart can <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it with new blood.</p>
               <p>But if this be true, why do Feavers return once in a quarter of an hour,<note place="margin">Nor do the Fits of Agues argue any other.</note> <U+017F>eeing the Fit <U+017F>eems then to happen, when the corrupt matter comes to the heart? whereas now <U+017F>ome fits come every day, others every third, and <U+017F>ome every fourth day.

               <p>And unle<U+017F>s that upper <U+017F>ide did <U+017F>ettle and fall in, the Heart would be dilated in this return hereof to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <U+017F>tate, as is ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee and feel, when the heart is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ected.

               <p>In the Particles of a live heart di<U+017F><U+017F>ected and taken out of the Bodie, there is no other dilatation then a remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion or <U+017F>lackening from Con<U+017F>triction. Indeed in tho<U+017F>e parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles where con<U+017F>triction is cea<U+017F>ed, there remains a <U+017F>eeing kind of Palpitation; but that is another kind of motion proceeding from the <U+017F>pirit conteined in the fle<U+017F>h and <U+017F>eek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its way out; <U+017F>uch as may al<U+017F>o frequently be <U+017F>een in the mu<U+017F>cles whole or di<U+017F><U+017F>ected, in Creatures di<U+017F><U+017F>ected pre<U+017F>ently upon their death.</p>
               <p>So that the Dilatation and Con<U+017F>triction of the heart happens after the <U+017F>ame manner as that of other parts, the Stomach, Gutts, Bladder, Womb, which are di<U+017F>tended by what is <U+017F>ent into them, which when they have voided, they return to their naturall <U+017F>tate.</p>
               <p>Now we cannot better ob<U+017F>erve this motion of the Heart, then in tho<U+017F>e Bea<U+017F>ts which have only one ventricle in their Hearts, or if they have two, when the Animals begin to langui<U+017F>h, otherwi<U+017F>e when the Creatures are <U+017F>trong, the motion is hardly di<U+017F>cerned becau<U+017F>e of its Swi<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s; al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e the two ventricles pre<U+017F>ent tho<U+017F>e motions doubled; and becau<U+017F>e the Cone of the right ventricle, <U+017F>eeing it is le<U+017F>s high then the left, when it is drawn back to the Ba<U+017F>is, it makes an oblique motion.</p>
               <p>But let us return to our bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and let us <U+017F>ee further how the blood<note place="margin">The Blood is driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of the greater into the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> out of <hi>the Arteries near the Heart,</hi> is <U+017F>pread through the Arteries of the whol Body, now it is done by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t Impul<U+017F>e or driveing or any Artery being bound, at the Ligature it <U+017F>wels very much, and is <U+017F>tretched to an extream hardne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Notwith<U+017F>tanding the <hi>Heavine<U+017F>s</hi> of the Blood furthers its motion downwards, and therefore the Heart <U+017F>eems to have been placed neerer the Head then the Heels.</p>
               <p>It is al<U+017F>o likely that the Blood is drawn into all the Arteries, to the end that they<note place="margin">Yet it is drawn withall.</note> and their neighbouring parts may be nouri<U+017F>hed with convenient Blood.</p>
               <p>But that the Arteries <U+017F>hould draw by<note place="margin">Not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily by dilatation of the Artery.</note> being widened, there <U+017F>eems no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity: for the Blood may be driven forward on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by impul<U+017F>e, and the Arteries may drive the <U+017F>ame: for an Artery being broke and an Aneuri<U+017F>ma made in the Fle<U+017F>h, the Aneuri<U+017F>ma in the fle<U+017F>h, is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pul<U+017F>e after the <U+017F>ame manner as the Artery; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in manife<U+017F>tly the fle<U+017F>h doth not draw the blood by dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the blood is driven into the <U+017F>ame.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Arteries,</hi> in the la<U+017F>t words it is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that an hollow Reed being thru<U+017F>t into the arteries, and the artery tied above the Reed, the artery doth not pul<U+017F>e beyond the ligature, though the blood may be driven through the Reed. But I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that place is mained and wants <U+017F>omwhat, becau<U+017F>e after the manner there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed, the operation can very rarely and hardly <U+017F>ucceed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for a free artery is there pre<U+017F>cribed to be opened out of which when it is open, every body knows what a world of blood leaps out, <U+017F>o that either the Creature will die, or through its weakne<U+017F>s, no arteries at lea<U+017F>t not tho<U+017F>e more remote can pul<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the place is perfect, and that the operation <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ucceed as it is there de<U+017F>cribed, it may happen that the Creature quite langui<U+017F>hing becau<U+017F>e of the flux of Blood, the pul<U+017F>e might be felt on this <U+017F>ide the Reed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Reed being thru<U+017F>t in, rendring the artery more narrow, might in part <U+017F>top the blood, <U+017F>o that it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily fill the artery and lift it up. So I have many times <U+017F>een, arreries which <U+017F>hewed either a langui<U+017F>hing or no pul<U+017F>e, manife<U+017F>tly pul<U+017F>ing, when they were compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed not very far from the Heart. But <hi>Galen</hi> ob<U+017F>erved no pul<U+017F>e beyond the Reed, becau<U+017F>e through the Reed much narrower than the artery, the artery received little blood. And that <U+017F>uch a thing might ea<U+017F>ily happen, I have ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a Rabbit, into the <hi>Aorta</hi> whereof, it being tied on each <U+017F>ide we thru<U+017F>t a little Reed, but becau<U+017F>e the ligature being loo<U+017F>ed the Bea<U+017F>t died, we thought it not worth the while to bind the artery above the Reed and we thought we <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome pul<U+017F>e as far as to the Reed, but we could perceive none beyond the Reed.</p>
               <p>Moreover we could never make that experiment <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, becau<U+017F>e it is not ea<U+017F>ie to find a convenient Artery, and when it is found and duly opened, the Creature mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>peedily dies, either becau<U+017F>e of Blood<U+017F>hed, or (which may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange) by Convul<U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>So that we can <U+017F>ee no other, but that the Blood being forced may pa<U+017F>s through the Arteries, and that by it al<U+017F>o the Arteries may be di<U+017F>tended<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> nor <U+017F>eems it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to call any other Cau<U+017F>e to make the Arteries pul<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeing the forealleadged Cau<U+017F>e may <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

So here, <U+017F>ome tokens are ob<U+017F>erved by <hi>Galen,</hi> that be<U+017F>ides that dilatation they receive from the impul<U+017F>e of the Blood, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries do al<U+017F>o endeavor their own dilatation. That all the Arteries of the body both in <U+017F>ound per<U+017F>ons and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in live Anatomies, do pul<U+017F>e in one and the <U+017F>ame moment: but nothing that is moved to di<U+017F>tance, can be every where at one moment; and therefore not at the <U+017F>ame moment make di<U+017F>tention every where. The Guts when blown up by Anatomi<U+017F>ts, or Pudding-makers, are <U+017F>een to be di<U+017F>tended in the parts neer the Blower fir<U+017F>t, before the remoter parts are di<U+017F>tended. True indeed it is, that the Arteries are not empts as the Guts, but they are di<U+017F>tended being partlyfilled with blood: yet, <U+017F>eeing that blood which comes out of the Heart mu<U+017F>t thru<U+017F>t forward that which is next it, and <hi>that</hi> again that which is next it, and <U+017F>o forward untill the Arteries be filled and di<U+017F>tended every where, it doth not <U+017F>eem, though the motion be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed out of a wide into a narrow place, that it can be performed in one moment<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> ju<U+017F>t as we <U+017F>ee twenty <U+017F>tones which the Boys <U+017F>et in a row, the greate<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t; when the fir<U+017F>t is beaten down, all the re<U+017F>t do not fall in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore we may <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that the Dia<U+017F>tole of the Arteries, is cau<U+017F>ed by the impul<U+017F>e of blood, and by their own proper dilatation: and that both the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es contribute to the bloods motion.</p>
               <p>Hence al<U+017F>o it appears, that this <U+017F>ame<note place="margin">But the impul<U+017F>e i here cau<U+017F>ed only by the Hart.</note> impul<U+017F>e of the Blood is made only by

the Heart, nor does one part of the Arteries drive it into another: for that part which drives by con<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that cannot in the <U+017F>ame moment be dilated, but all the Arteries are dilated in a moment.</p>
               <p>And thus the blood is moved through the Arteries; and out of the<note place="margin">Out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the Veins, out of the <U+017F>maller Veins into the greater</note>

               <p>The Chylus in the <hi>Ramus me<U+017F>entericus, Vena partae</hi> and <hi>Vena cava,</hi> being mingled with the blood, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e, which there as we have <U+017F>aid, does move the blood.</p>

But it makes chiefly towards it perfection, in that the blood is <U+017F>omtimes attenuated, grows hot, and is rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ied in the Heart, and <U+017F>omtimes again it is conden<U+017F>ed and congeales as it were in the Habit of the Body. For no part in the Body is horter then the Heart, and none le<U+017F>s hot then the Habit of the Body. And therefore there happens a certain Circulation as it were, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that whereby the Chymi<U+017F>ts make their Spirits mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtile and perfect. For the blood which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated by heat, after it is conden<U+017F>ed by cold, is able to per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in that thinne<U+017F>s, nor does it return to its old thickne<U+017F>s: from which degree of thinne<U+017F>s in tract of time it attains to a greater by means of heat, in which being again conden<U+017F>ed by cold, it comes to continue; and <U+017F>o at la<U+017F>t it becomes mo<U+017F>t fit for the making of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits.</p>
               <p>For this end the blood is moved<note place="margin">The blood which is carried to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h the part, is not moved circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> circularly; but hath it not therefore el<U+017F>ewhere another motion? Out of the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Arteries the blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried right out into the fle<U+017F>h, that it may con<U+017F>titute the namele<U+017F>s humor, the <hi>Ros, Gluten,</hi> and <hi>Cambium,</hi> nor does it return hither from whence it came, lea<U+017F>t the blood flowing through the lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould hinder the<U+017F>e humors from being gleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated to the parts.</p>
               <p>It flows al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omtimes chiefly, becau<U+017F>e it is driven out of the Arteries into the fle<U+017F>h: and frequently al<U+017F>o the chief moving cau<U+017F>e is attraction: for the bones cannot without attraction receive the thicker part of the humor for their nouri<U+017F>hment, and leave the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thinner part thereof, unfit to nouri<U+017F>h them in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</p>

I truly have alwaies e<U+017F>teem <hi>that</hi> a rare de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Era<U+017F>i<U+017F>tratus,</hi> to explain all things that happen in our Body mechanically, but I account it a ra<U+017F>h thing in him to mea<U+017F>ure the Wi<U+017F>dom of God by his own Wi<U+017F>dom.

Al<U+017F>o that the Valves are not <U+017F>hut by the blood running back, we have this <U+017F>ign, that in ca<U+017F>e the Artery be bound two fingers from the Heart, and it be <U+017F>o opened betwixt the Ligature and the Valves, that the blood may freely pa<U+017F>s forth, and therefore go neither backwards nor forwards; yet the Valves may be divers times well <U+017F>a<U+017F>tned, the Heart ordinarily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <U+017F>o as not to <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In Joy, truly, the Humors move outwards; but this may be betide by the Arteries alone. And in Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, the Humors may be moved inwardly through the Veins alone: and they mu<U+017F>t needs do <U+017F>o, for <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pul<U+017F>e does not cea<U+017F>e in Sadne<U+017F>s, and by the Pul<U+017F>e there goes continually <U+017F>omwhat through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries outwards, hardly can any thing be moved through the Arteries inwards, and to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, praeternaturally the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors have another motion be<U+017F>ides<note place="margin">Yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion thereof.</note> that which we have here de<U+017F>cribed, while<U+017F>t by their lightne<U+017F>s or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity, they mount upwards, or by their weight de<U+017F>cend downwards, as is manife<U+017F>t in <U+017F>uch as have the <hi>Varices</hi> <U+017F>o called. Al<U+017F>o that way being <U+017F>hut up, by which they were wont to be moved, they are compelled to <U+017F>eek another.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41352:132"/>
but that motion la<U+017F>ted not long, nor did the blood ever enter into the Heart by that motion.</p>
               <p>And thus (mo<U+017F>t worthy Friend <hi>Bartholine</hi>) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have an<U+017F>wered your Que<U+017F>tion touching the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood. Whereinto I did enquire more <U+017F>crupulou<U+017F>ly, that I might better know the Nature of the Humors, and their Deflux: from which Flux of Humors innumerable Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ari<U+017F>e. I did al<U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I might more exactly under<U+017F>tand how good or bad blood was generated, if I knew tho<U+017F>e Parts by which the Humor pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing along might be changed. Al<U+017F>o I conceived that I <U+017F>hould be better able to judg, how very many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ought to be cured, if I knew which Vein being opened, would evacuate <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch parts, and through what parts the Remedy ought to pa<U+017F>s, before it can come to the part affected? Al<U+017F>o innumerable things came into my mind, diffu<U+017F>ed through our whole Art, as the Doctrine of Pul<U+017F>es, of Feavers, of Inflammations, their Generation and Cure, and other things, which made me de<U+017F>ire to be acquainted with this Motion of Blood.</p>
               <p>And the Experiments whereby I was brought into this Opinion, are <U+017F>o evident, that I doubt not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that learned and di<U+017F>creer Phy<U+017F>itians will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards, allow of this Motion of the Chyle and Blood.

For tho<U+017F>e The<U+017F>es which he had before objected again<U+017F>t, he hath endeavored now lately by a peculiar Writing to refute. In which Writing there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witty and learned Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages: but I find that fault in the Author, which the Ancients found in <hi>Albutius</hi> the Rhetoritian, who made it his Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in every Cau<U+017F>e he pleaded, not to <U+017F>ay all that <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid, but all that he was able to <U+017F>ay. Al<U+017F>o that Motion of the Blood which is evident in live Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections, he hath never la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to ob<U+017F>erve: ju<U+017F>t as if the matter might better be conceived by the Mind, then he could <U+017F>ee it with his Eyes.

Now the Cau<U+017F>e of that Tumor is not Pain, cau<U+017F>ed by binding the part: for oftentimes little, and commonly no pain in the part bound.

               <p>Nor is it more likely, that the Veins <U+017F>well upon the Ligature, becau<U+017F>e through the Veins which are <U+017F>traiter becau<U+017F>e they are bound, greater pienty of Blood comes and with more <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s from the Liver; as about Bridges and in other places, Rivers being <U+017F>traitned do run more <U+017F>wiftly.

               <p>It remains therefore, that the Veins <U+017F>well beyond the Ligature, becau<U+017F>e<note place="margin">But becau<U+017F>e the motion of the Blood is <U+017F>topped.</note> the motion of the blood running from the <U+017F>mall veins into the Heart, is <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Ligature, and being there gathered together, di<U+017F>tends the Vein. But to the end I might be more certain hereof, I bound the jugular and crural branch, in living Creatures very <U+017F>trongly with a threed, <U+017F>o that no blood might pa<U+017F>s by; and I opened that part of the Vein which was more remote from the Heart, it bled plentifully, <U+017F>wiftly, vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <U+017F>oon after I loo<U+017F>ed the band, and cut the Vein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>under through the middle, and the part thereof far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>t from the Heart being drawn out of the body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, pre<U+017F>ently and <U+017F>wiftly fell a bleeding: whil<U+017F>t in the mean time the part of the Vein neare<U+017F>t the heart, being <U+017F>omewhat elevated, lea<U+017F>t the Creature <U+017F>trugling with pain <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily force out the Blood; fir<U+017F>t it voided but little, and afterwards no blood at all. whence it <U+017F>eemed to me apparent, that the blood came out of the veins far from the heart, into tho<U+017F>e near the <U+017F>ame, and not out of the greater Veins into the le<U+017F><U+017F>er; unle<U+017F>s haply <U+017F>ome neighbouring blood finding a way might <U+017F>lip away. Any one may ea<U+017F>ily try as much in opening a vein in the Arm: for if he force the blood above the Ligature upwards with his finger, <U+017F>o that the vein appear empty, yet <U+017F>hall he <U+017F>ee the blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out as fa<U+017F>t as ever below the Ligature; which could not come through the upper branch being at pre<U+017F>ent emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But if the Vein be thus di<U+017F>tended with blood, which is moved from the <U+017F>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler<note place="margin">Nor doe the Arteries <U+017F>wel becau<U+017F>e of the Ligature.</note> veins to the Heart, how can the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be di<U+017F>tended upon the ligature, which divers excellent Phy<U+017F>itians relate to have been <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tended, that it has been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in<U+017F>tead of a vein; the truth is, the Artery doth not <U+017F>well upon the Ligatures being made, unle<U+017F>s where it is neer the Heart, but farther off it falls in <U+017F>omewhat, and is dimini<U+017F>hed, as I have an hundred times and oftener experimented in the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of living Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies. But I do not think it was any of the authors, meaning thar the remoter part of the Artery was di<U+017F>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by means of the Ligature, but that their meaning only was, where the Vein did not appear which was to be opened, that there the place where it lay was to be <U+017F>ought by feeling; and that by a pit, by motion and <U+017F>welling of the Blood it was to be found: and when we feel a <U+017F>welling, or otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>ame, we <U+017F>hould not pre<U+017F>ently conclude that there was the Vein; for it might be an Artery which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the hard binding had lo<U+017F>t its pul<U+017F>e, and which by rea<U+017F>on of the thickne<U+017F>s of the Coates not quite fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, might counterfeit a certain tumor and puffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up as it were.</p>
               <p>But moreover if the Vein <U+017F>wels by rea<U+017F>on of the Blood returning to the<note place="margin">But the Veins <U+017F>wel al<U+017F>o with two Ligatures, and wherefore.</note> Heart, why does the vein al<U+017F>o <U+017F>wel and if opened, why void Blood, when there is a Ligature made below as well as above the place phlebotomized? which Blood cannot be thought po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly to come from the lower parts, by rea<U+017F>on of the Ligature made below the Orifice. But this does not alwayes <U+017F>o happen, but but <U+017F>ometimes, only when the Arm is tied at a certain di<U+017F>tance, and then the greater Veins in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween tho<U+017F>e two Ligatures do receive that blood from the <U+017F>maller Veins, which <U+017F>maller Veins receive from the <U+017F>maller Arteries, which are joyned to the <U+017F>mal veins by way of Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is. And that indeed the blood which flows out betwixt the two Ligatures, does come by way of Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is out of the Arteries, this is a <U+017F>ign and in that it flows more hotter and with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and more ea<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>ooner a Lipothymia or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit follows the efflux hereof. And this Ligature I am wont to make u<U+017F>e of, when I have <U+017F>igns that <U+017F>piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and hot blood is in fault, and I bid the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon <U+017F>eek out tho<U+017F>e Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es, by his Ligature: for if the Ligature be made above the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is, it <U+017F>tops the motion of the blood; but beneath it does not <U+017F>top it, but the blood leaps out hotter to the feeling of the Patient.</p>
               <p>When a Vein is opened and the<note place="margin">Why in blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind the Arm, when the blood does not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.</note> blood runs out, as <U+017F>oon as it begins to <U+017F>top or come away <U+017F>paringly, or if it did <U+017F>o at fir<U+017F>t, we loo<U+017F>e the Ligature, that the blood might run out fa<U+017F>ter. Now the Ligature <U+017F>eems not therefore to be <U+017F>lacked, to the intent the blood may come from the Liver through the Veins. For though there be little or no blood above the Ligature, yea only a pit appear in the Vein, yet will the cour<U+017F>e of the Blood be increa<U+017F>ed by loo<U+017F>ening the Ligature, which cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly come out of an empty Vein. But by the loo<U+017F>ening of the band, the Blood may the better de<U+017F>cend by the Arteries, and pa<U+017F>s out of them into the Veins; becau<U+017F>e the Arteries being compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Ligature, by loo<U+017F>ening the <U+017F>aid Ligature become more free. Now that the Arteries are not alwayes <U+017F>ufficiently at Liberty when the arm is bound, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient him<U+017F>elf can witne<U+017F>s, who oft perceives the pul<U+017F>e of the Arter<U+017F>e at the Ligature, which perception the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Arterie cau<U+017F>es, when it <U+017F>mites again<U+017F>t the fle<U+017F>h.

               <p>But if that Blood which flows<note place="margin">Why much blood may be taken away.</note> out when a vein is opened, comes out of the Arteries into the veins, how can it be plentifully taken away? for all the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pul<U+017F>e equally, and therefore they <U+017F>eem to afford blood to the Veins in one and the <U+017F>ame mea<U+017F>ure: and if <U+017F>o be there<U+017F>t of the arteries afford <U+017F>o much to their veins as the arteries of the Arms do to theirs and is drawn out, <U+017F>hall not the heart be <U+017F>oon de<U+017F>titute of all blood? There is truly no danger at all: For we have <U+017F>aid the blood comes as fa<U+017F>t unto the heart, as it is driven thence</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot conceive the Blood enters all veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, although the Arteries <U+017F>eem to pul<U+017F>e equally; for all Liquors flow more ea<U+017F>ily and <U+017F>wiftly into an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty place, in which there is nothing to drive and force them, and moreover in this ca<U+017F>e the Blood is more forcibly drawn by the empty Veins then by the full ones.</p>
               <p>Now more <U+017F>tore of Blood i<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ues<note place="margin">And more out of the Arm then out of the Hand.</note> from a<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> vein opened in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, then in the Hand, becau<U+017F>e all that blood, which comes to the Veins through all the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the Cubit of the Hand, mu<U+017F>t return through the Cubit Veins;

but le<U+017F>s runs through the Veins of the Hand, and that only, which comes through the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of the Hand.</p>
               <p>Out of a wounded Arterie, indeed the blood pre<U+017F>ently flowes, although<note place="margin">Why it flows out of a wounded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie not bound.</note> it be not bound. But that happens becau<U+017F>e the Blood is carryed with greater vetiemence, though the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then through the Veins; by which vehemency, it fills the Arterie, lifts up and di<U+017F>tends the Coat, and if it be opened, nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily flies out.</p>
               <p>Our of a Vein opened when Blood has flowed <U+017F>ufficiently, we<note place="margin">The Ligature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loo<U+017F>ed, the blood <U+017F>tops, and <U+017F>ometimes it runs, and why?</note> <U+017F>top it by untieing the Ligature, becau<U+017F>e the Blood may be carried again its old way, now it is at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the way free. But if it <U+017F>o happen, that too much blood being gathered about the Ligature, the Veins cannot give it a free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; or <U+017F>o large an orifice be made<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that the Blood may now go right out that way, by which it went, when it was <U+017F>hut in, <U+017F>ometimes the Band being loo<U+017F>ened, the blood runs out in a full <U+017F>tream.</p>
               <p>Which our Chyrurgeons at this very day, that they may effectually <U+017F>top, they frequently compre<U+017F>s the vein with their Thumbs a little below the Orifice, and <U+017F>o they <U+017F>top the<note place="margin">But is <U+017F>topped by holding the finger in the Vein below the Orifice.</note> blood; lea<U+017F>t if they <U+017F>hould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s it above the orifice, the blood contained therein <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently curdle, and hinder the healing up of the Vein. And they that deny that the blood may thus be <U+017F>topped, I know not wherein we <U+017F>hould credit them who would abu<U+017F>e us in a thing obvious to the Sen<U+017F>es. And <U+017F>eeing the Blood is <U+017F>topped by compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the lower part of the Vein, it is truely manife<U+017F>t that the Blood a<U+017F>cends from the lower parts.</p>
               <p>But in ca<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould happen, not in Blood-letting, but by <U+017F>ome other<note place="margin">Al<U+017F>o when the Vein is cut a<U+017F>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the middle and wherefore,</note> mi<U+017F>chance, that a Vein <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o wounded, that the Blood could not be <U+017F>topped, the Vein is cut a<U+017F>under in the midde<U+017F>t: Whereupon, the Vein being no longer <U+017F>trerched out as before, the parts cut a<U+017F>under are drawn upwards and downwards into the fle<U+017F>h, by which fle<U+017F>h the mouths of the Veins are compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and <U+017F>hut, and that <U+017F>o much the more ea<U+017F>ily becau<U+017F>e the Blood can move its <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much the more ea<U+017F>ily through the neighboring veins which are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and open, the former being <U+017F>hut up, and therefore for the very <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>mall Arterie being cut a<U+017F>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der athwart, neither Bleeding nor Inflammation do follow.</p>
               <p>Which things being <U+017F>o, I conceive it is evident to all Men, that <U+017F>uch things as happen in Blood-letting, do either prove the Circular motion of the Blood, or at lea<U+017F>t are not again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>eeing other Things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected again<U+017F>t us, we mu<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer<note place="margin">No parts receive Blood by the veins excepting the liver.</note> them al<U+017F>o. And fir<U+017F>t whereas they prove that the Blood comes through the Veins, not out of the Arteries, but from the Liver; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome parts re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive Blood, and have Tumors ari<U+017F>ing from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood, which parts have no Arteries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t which they reckon the Pleura. But it does not follow, if the parts have not Arteries, that their veins do not receive their blood from the Arteries, but from the Liver; for as we <U+017F>aid, the blood out of the Me<U+017F>enterick and Celiack Arteries does not enter the Me<U+017F>enterick and Splenick Veins, through which it is carried to the Liver: even <U+017F>o other veins may receive blood from the Arteries, which they may carry into a part more remote from Arteries. Howbeit there is no part of the Body of any bulk, wherein the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts do not rightly acknowledge Arteries to be. And infinite Arteries do not as yet lie concealed from their knowledge, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Arteries di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed through the fle<U+017F>h, have only one Coat as the Veins have. Yea, and in the Liver it <U+017F>elf, there are <U+017F>o many branches of the <hi>Arteria Celiaca,</hi> as there are Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and as many branches al<U+017F>o there are of the <hi>Ductus Cholidocus,</hi> all which have bin by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi<U+017F>ts hitherto reckoned for Branches of <hi>Vena Porta.</hi> becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e three kinds of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inclo<U+017F>ed in a common Coat. At lea<U+017F>t no man will ever deny the Arteries of the Pleura, that has once <U+017F>een the Che<U+017F>t of a living Creature opened; for whil<U+017F>t the Che<U+017F>t is di<U+017F><U+017F>ected, Blood is wont to leap out of the Arteries of the Pleura.</p>
               <p>Moreover they prove that Blood does not come out of the Arteries into the Veins, becau<U+017F>e the Arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o bound, that the Arteries may <U+017F>till pul<U+017F>e, the arm is not immea<U+017F>urably <U+017F>welled below the ligature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it ought to be <U+017F>o <U+017F>wollen and di<U+017F>tended, if by rea<U+017F>on of the Ligature nothing can flow back into the greater Veins, and at every pul<U+017F>e, the Arteries drive <U+017F>omewhat into the lower veins, at every contraction, of which Contractions there are more then three thou<U+017F>and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every hour. Nevertheles, it may come to pa<U+017F>s that the Arm is not extended to <U+017F>uch a bulk when it is bound; becau<U+017F>e the veins are not totally <U+017F>hut up, and the blood may by <U+017F>ome creeping holes pa<U+017F>s under the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and go into the greater veins: as we <U+017F>ee a part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clo<U+017F>ely bound to repel Humors, for divers months or years, is neverthele<U+017F>s nouri<U+017F>hed by the blood which flows through; al<U+017F>o it may come to pa<U+017F>s that <U+017F>o little Blood is forced in through the Arteries of the bound Arm, as that it cannot di<U+017F>tend, or Swell the <U+017F>ame under a long time, for that Blood only is forced in, the veins being <U+017F>tretched with fullne<U+017F>s, which is in the Arteries from the Ligature unto the Hand; for that which is above the Ligature, can enter more ea<U+017F>ily into the veins, by open Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es. Yea it may come to pa<U+017F>s, when the veins being di<U+017F>tended, do no longer permit the Blood to be forced into them by the Arteries, that the pul<U+017F>e of the Arteries is <U+017F>topped, or that the Blood regurgitates upwards, and enters the Veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Ligature, through the Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es: the like whereto I <U+017F>aw in a Duck, as I formerly related. Unle<U+017F>s one of the<U+017F>e things happen, the Arm would pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>wel after it is bound, and a <U+017F>uffocation of the innate Heat, by the Abundance of Blood driven in would follow. For I have often bound mine own and others Armes above the Wri<U+017F>t, and I alwayes <U+017F>aw the veins di<U+017F>tended, and the Fle<U+017F>h to <U+017F>well <U+017F>omewhat and grow red; and oftentimes though not alwayes, the arteries abated by little and little of their pul<U+017F>e, yea and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermitted; and afterward the red colour of the bound Arm was changed into black and blew: and therefore I pre<U+017F>ently undid the Ligature, being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Example. A certain Country-man being wounded in the in<U+017F>ide of his Arm about the Cubit, when the Village Chirurgeon could not <U+017F>top the blood, he bound the Arm extream clo<U+017F>e about the Wound, whence followed an exceeding Inflammation of the lower part of his Arm, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>welling, that deep pits were <U+017F>een in the place of his fingers joynts, and within eighteen hours, the lower part of his Arm was gangrena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreover they object, if the venal Blood comes out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,<note place="margin">How and why the venal blood differs from the arterial.</note> how can the arterial Blood differ <U+017F>o much from the venal?

And the difference between the<U+017F>e two bloods is cau<U+017F>ed by the greater or le<U+017F>s quantity of Heat and Spirits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Blood is more or le<U+017F>s remote from the Heart the fountain of Heat.

And the <U+017F>maller veins have more thin and hot Blood, then the great ones; which any one may ea<U+017F>ily try in opening veins of the Arm and Foot. Yea, and if the Vein be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with a double Ligature on each <U+017F>ide the orifice, as I <U+017F>aid before, the Blood will come out hotter then with a <U+017F>ingle Ligature.</p>
               <p>Now that the Blood does not go out of the <U+017F>maller veins into the<note place="margin">How men<U+017F>trual Blood is collected about the womb.</note> greater, they endeavour to prove by womens monthly purgations, which according to their judgment, are gathered one whole month together in the Veins about the Womb; and if they are carried from the Womb unto the Head, they conceive that they do not pa<U+017F>s through the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and the Heart. Howbeit, the common and true opinion is, that about the time of the u<U+017F>ual flux, the blood begins to be moved to the Womb, from which motion of the humors, pains of the <U+017F>ides and loines are wont to ari<U+017F>e about that time, And I know by Experience, that about the time of the men<U+017F>trual Flux, if the Pul<U+017F>e of the Heart and arteries can be made greater, the Cour<U+017F>es will flow the better, becau<U+017F>e the Blood will through the arteries be driven more forcibly into the Womb. It may neverthele<U+017F>s fall out, that the Cour<U+017F>es may be collected and make an Ob<U+017F>truction in the Womb, and that then the Blood may not return into the greater veins, that motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>topped: but that is be<U+017F>ides nature.</p>
               <p>And when the men<U+017F>trual blood is carried out of the Womb into<note place="margin">How they are carried out of the Womb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Head.</note> the Head, the way is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, through the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> the Heart, and the a<U+017F>cending branch of the <hi>Arteria Aorta,</hi> and that they do indeed pa<U+017F>s through the Heart, tho<U+017F>e palpitations and light faintings do <U+017F>eem to argue, which are wont to attend upon the Cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>topped.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>hould we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a dangerous<note place="margin">How it comes that the Humors pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Heart, do not cau<U+017F>e great Inconveniences.</note> thing, if all the ill humors in our bodies mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s into and through the Heart.

Thirdly that the Arteries are too full then to be able to admit half an ounce, a dram, or a <U+017F>cruple of Blood. But that is too incon<U+017F>iderately avouched; for when the Heart contracts it <U+017F>elf, all the arteries in the body are enlarged, and that on all <U+017F>ides, as I have divers times perceived with my hand, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naked arterie betwixt my fingers. And who will now <U+017F>ay, that all the Arteries of the Body being dilated, cannot admit of a Scruple, a Dram, yea half an Ounce of blood, more then they have?</p>

               </p>
               <p>As for me, this truly is my Opinion, and thus I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade my <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>eeing they have now divers times, <U+017F>o diligently endeavored in Publick to per<U+017F>wade men to embrace this their Opinion of Rarifaction; and have diffected and lookt into the Hearts of Living Creatures, nor have yet dared to <U+017F>ay, that they could <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly perceive any <U+017F>uch Rarifaction of the blood in the Heart; I <U+017F>ay, my Opinion is, that they could not indeed and in truth ob<U+017F>erve any <U+017F>uch Rarifaction of the blood in the Heart, and as they would in this place maintain<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And it will be ea<U+017F>ie for him that is a little ver<U+017F>t in live Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections, to <U+017F>ee that there is no <U+017F>uch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifaction. And therefore though it might be proved, that <U+017F>uch a Rarifaction of the blood, does <U+017F>ometimes happen praeternaturally, yet ought not the cau<U+017F>e of the Natural motion of the Heart, Blood and Arteries be therefore attributed thereunto.</p>
               <p>Yet in the Example which they propound, I do not <U+017F>ee what certainty there is that the blood by rea<U+017F>on of its Rarifaction does po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s ten times more <U+017F>pace then before. For might not that <U+017F>ame Tumor of the external Veins ea<U+017F>ily ari<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e whereas before the veins were contracted and <U+017F>traitned through cold, they could not receive much blood, and therefore they could not <U+017F>well: Which cold and <U+017F>traitning of the ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els being afterwards taken away, and the Veins being loo<U+017F>ned by heat, they might admit much blood, which is driven into them by the heart, and <U+017F>o appear full and <U+017F>welling. That this is not the lea<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of the tumor of the Veins, per<U+017F>ons that are feaueri<U+017F>h <U+017F>eem to teach us, who if they thru<U+017F>t their arms into the cold, have not their Veins <U+017F>o <U+017F>welling, but if they keep them warm under the cloaths, they have them very full and <U+017F>wole, which tumor if it came from Rarifaction, it ought to be in both ca<U+017F>es alike, <U+017F>eeing that in them, the bloods Rarifaction proceeds from an internal cau<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Nor do I conceive that it is al<U+017F>o void of Que<U+017F>tion and undoubted, that when we are fir<U+017F>t cold, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grow hot, the inner Veins as well as the outer do <U+017F>well. For it is much to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts do po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s le<U+017F>s blood and heat before; becau<U+017F>e by that cold wherewith before they were not hurt, if when we are <U+017F>o heated we drink cold drink, they are wonderfully weakened. Doubtle<U+017F>s as the inner veins are oftentimes the trea<U+017F>ury of the blood, wherein the blood is <U+017F>tored up for future u<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o may the external<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Veins be the like trea<U+017F>ury, and they appear to be when they <U+017F>o <U+017F>well as afore<U+017F>aid.</p>

               <p>But truly, the upper part of the Heart is not <U+017F>een to be dilated, when the lower is contracted; <U+017F>ave when the Creature is dying, and that the waving motion of the Heart is cau<U+017F>ed by the impul<U+017F>e of the blood.

But if as it ought to be, the dog be laid on his back, his head and belly re<U+017F>ting on the <U+017F>ame plane, and the wounded Heart be rai<U+017F>ed with a mans fingers, as long as there is any <U+017F>trength in the Heart, it <U+017F>ooner by Con<U+017F>triction ca<U+017F>ts out the blood it hath received, at a di<U+017F>tance, then the whole Heart is filled or widened. But when the <U+017F>trength of the heart decayes, and that it <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>traitens it <U+017F>elf or not at all, becau<U+017F>e the Earlets are more <U+017F>trong, and do <U+017F>till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue pul<U+017F>ing, even when the Heart quite gives over; the blood being driven by the Earlets enters the heart, is there collected, and when more is come in then the Heart can contain, it goe out at the wound, not with violence, as it mu<U+017F>t do to cau<U+017F>e Pul<U+017F>ation, but with a gentle motion, drop after drop.

               <p>But let us an<U+017F>wer the remaining ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections:<note place="margin">By this motion the Veins and Arteries may be nouri<U+017F>hed.</note> They <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, if the blood <U+017F>hould be moved <U+017F>o <U+017F>wiftly, that the Veins and Arteries could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be nouri<U+017F>hed. But a dog can quench his thir<U+017F>t, drinking at the River <hi>Nilus</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as he drinks; but here the parts <U+017F>tay at the brook <U+017F>ide: and whatever they have drawn from the blood, they trea<U+017F>ure up in their own <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be wa<U+017F>hed away, by the running by of the humor.</p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o they conceit this Motion is not u<U+017F>eful for the blood. Seeing it may<note place="margin">And the blood ventilitated better.</note> <U+017F>ufficiently be con<U+017F>erved (<U+017F>ince it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with native heat) by re<U+017F>pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tran<U+017F>piration. Yet mo<U+017F>t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the blood is yet more ventilated, if it be <U+017F>peedily moved, and its <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Particles al<U+017F>o agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with this motion. So the water of a lake or <U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pool, though it be gently moved and fanned on the Surface, yet is it corrupted; when in the mean while Rivers that are totally and in all parts agitated, are found to continue mo<U+017F>t uncorrupt and whol<U+017F>om.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e are the things (mo<U+017F>t excellent <hi>Bartholine</hi>) which I thought fit to joyn to the former, that I might <U+017F>atisfie tho<U+017F>e who cannot receive a new opinion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ob<U+017F>erve any difficulty or ob<U+017F>curity; who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times have neither mind nor time to enquire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly into the bowels thereof. But in my Judgment, we ought not to deny things manife<U+017F>t, although we cannot re<U+017F>olve <U+017F>uch as are difficult.</p>
               <p>But I never was di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to contend and quarrel with any man about words. There are very many excellent things about which time may be <U+017F>pent; which many times al<U+017F>o is not <U+017F>ufficient for our nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occa<U+017F>ions. Al<U+017F>o from a Scoffer that <U+017F>eeks after her, Knowledge does hide her <U+017F>elf away, but to him that is <U+017F>tudious of the truth, <U+017F>he comes to meet, and pre<U+017F>ents her <U+017F>elf to his view.
