      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>To begin Methodically, I <U+017F>hould enjoyn you Travel; for Ab<U+017F>ence doth in a kind remove the cau<U+017F>e (removing the object) and an<U+017F>wers the Phy<U+017F>itians fir<U+017F>t Recipez, vomiting and purging; but this would be too har<U+017F>h, and indeed not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35597:34"/>
to my way. I therefore advi<U+017F>e you to <U+017F>ee her as often as you can, for (be<U+017F>ides that the rarity of vi<U+017F>its endears them) this may bring you to <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e her, and to di<U+017F>cover little defects, which though they cure not ab<U+017F>olutely, yet they quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fury of the Feaver: As neer as you can let it be un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably, when <U+017F>he is in <U+017F>icknes, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; for that will let you know <U+017F>he is mortal, and a Woman, and the la<U+017F>t would be enough to a wi<U+017F>e man: If you could draw her to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of things <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tands not, it would not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>Contrive your <U+017F>elf often into the Company of the cryed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>up Beauties; for if you read but one book, it will be no wonder if you <U+017F>peak or write that <U+017F>tile; variety will breed di<U+017F>traction, and that will be a kind of diverting the humour.</p>
                  <p>I would not have you deny your <U+017F>elf the little things (for the<U+017F>e Agues are ea<U+017F>ier cured with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets than ab<U+017F>tinence) rather (if you can) ta<U+017F>t all: for that (as an old Author <U+017F>aith) will let you <U+017F>ee
<q>
                        <l>That the thing for which we wooe,</l>
                        <l>Is not worth <U+017F>o much ado.</l>
                     </q>
But <U+017F>ince that here would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, you mu<U+017F>t be content to take it where you can get it. And this for your comfort I mu<U+017F>t tell you <hi>(Jack)</hi> that Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e and Woman differ no otherwi<U+017F>e then Frontiniack and ordinary Grapes: which though a man loves never <U+017F>o well, yet if he <U+017F>urfet of the la<U+017F>t, he will care but little for the fir<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>I would have you leave that fooli<U+017F>h humour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35597:35"/>
                     <hi>(Jack)</hi> of <U+017F>aying you are not in love with her, and pretending you care not for her; for <U+017F>mothered fires are dangerous, and malicious humors are be<U+017F>t and <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t vented and breathed out. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your affection to your Rival <U+017F>till, that will <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you from one way of loving, which is in <U+017F>pite; and pre<U+017F>erve your friend<U+017F>hip with her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for who knows but <U+017F>he may help you to the remedy.</p>
                  <p>A jolly gla<U+017F><U+017F>e and right Company would much conduce to the cure; for though in the Scripture (by the way it is but <hi>Apocrypha)</hi> Woman is re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <U+017F>tronger than Wine, yet whether it will be <U+017F>o or not, when wit is joyned to it, may prove a fre<U+017F>h que<U+017F>tion.</p>
                  <p>Marrying (as our friend the late Amba<U+017F><U+017F>ador hath wittily ob<U+017F>erved) would certainly cure it; but that is a kind of live Pigeons laid to the <U+017F>oals of the feet, a la<U+017F>t remedy, and (to <U+017F>ay truth) wor<U+017F>e than the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>(Jack)</hi> I remember I promi<U+017F>ed you a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not a Treaty; I now expect you <U+017F>hould be ju<U+017F>t, and as I have <U+017F>hewed you how to get out of love, <U+017F>o you (according to our bargain) <U+017F>hould teach me how to get into it. I know you have but one way, and will pre<U+017F>cribe me now to look upon Mi<U+017F>tris <hi>Howard;</hi> but for that I mu<U+017F>t tell you afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it is love as in Antipathy; The Capers which will make my Lord of <hi>Dor<U+017F>et</hi> go from the Table, another man will eat up.

another nature, have brought to delight in tho<U+017F>e narrow and uncouth waies we found you in. You mu<U+017F>t therefore con<U+017F>ider that you have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of tho<U+017F>e neer conjunctions of which death is the onely honourable divorce; and that you have now to plea<U+017F>e another as well as your <U+017F>elf; who though <U+017F>he be a Woman, and by the patent <U+017F>he hath from nature, hath liberty to do <U+017F>imply; yet can <U+017F>he never be <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly bribed again<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf, as to betray at once all her hopes and ends, and for your <U+017F>ake re<U+017F>olve to live mi<U+017F>erably.

                  <p>THat it is fit for the King to do <U+017F>omething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary at this pre<U+017F>ent, is not onely the opinion of the wi<U+017F>e, but the expectation. Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve him more now then at other times: for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>tie in an Eclip<U+017F>e, like the Sun, draws eyes that would not <U+017F>o much as have looked towards it, if it had <U+017F>hined out, and appeared like it <U+017F>elf. To lie <U+017F>till now, would, at the be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hew but a calmne<U+017F><U+017F>e of mind, not a magnanimity; <U+017F>ince in matter of government, to think well (at any time, much le<U+017F><U+017F>e in a very active) is little better then to dream well. Nor mu<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tay to act till his people de<U+017F>ire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e 'tis thought nothing reli<U+017F>hes el<U+017F>e: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath nothing reli<U+017F>ht with them, becau<U+017F>e the King hath for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>tayed till they have de<U+017F>ired; done nothing but what they have or were petitioning for. But, that the King <U+017F>hould do, will not be <U+017F>o much the que<U+017F>tion, as what he <U+017F>hould do. And certainly, for a King to have right coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el given him, is at all times <U+017F>trange, and at this

pre<U+017F>ent impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. His party for the mo<U+017F>t part (I would that were mode<U+017F>tly <U+017F>aid, and it were not all) have <U+017F>o much to do for their own pre<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they cannot (without breaking a law in nature) intend anothers. Tho<U+017F>e that have courage have not perchance innocence, and <U+017F>o dare not <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves in the Kings bu<U+017F>ines; and if they have innocence, they want parts to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves con<U+017F>iderable; <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently the things they undertake. Then, in Court, they give much coun<U+017F>el, as they beleeve the King inclin'd, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his good by his de<U+017F>ires: which is a kind of <U+017F>etting the Sun by the Dial, Intere<U+017F>t which cannot er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In going about to <U+017F>hew the King a Cure, now a man <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t plainly <U+017F>hew him the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But to Kings, as to <U+017F>ome kind of Patients, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proper to tell how ill they be: and it is too like a Countrey clown not to <U+017F>hew the way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he know from whence, and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of things before.</p>
                  <p>Kings may be mi<U+017F>taken, and Councellors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but true intere<U+017F>t alone (<U+017F>aith <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Rohan)</hi> cannot erre. It were not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e then to find out the Intere<U+017F>t: for <U+017F>etting down right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before conclu<U+017F>ions, is weighing the <U+017F>cales before we deal out the commodity.</p>
                  <p>Certainly the great intere<U+017F>t of the King is, <hi>A u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his People,</hi> and who<U+017F>oever hath told him otherwi<U+017F>e (as the Scripture <U+017F>aith of the divel) <hi>was a <U+017F>educer from the fir<U+017F>t.</hi> If there ever had been any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35597:53"/>
one Prince in the whole world that made a felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this life, and left fair Fame after death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the love of his Subjects, there were <U+017F>ome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e it.</p>
                  <p>There was not among all our Princes a greater Courtier of the People then <hi>Richard</hi> the third, not <U+017F>o much out of fear, as out of wi<U+017F>edom. And, <U+017F>hall the wor<U+017F>t of our Kings have <U+017F>triven for that? and <U+017F>hall not the be<U+017F>t? (it being an Angelical thing to gain love.)</p>
                  <p>There are 2. things in which the people expect to be <U+017F>atisfied; <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Justice:</hi> nor can this be done by any little acts, but by Royal and Kingly re<U+017F>olutions.</p>
                  <p>If any <U+017F>hall think that by dividing the factions (a good rule at other times) he <U+017F>hall ma<U+017F>ter the re<U+017F>t now, he will be <U+017F>trangely deceived: for in the beginning of things That would do much, but not when whole Kingdoms are re<U+017F>olv'd. Of tho<U+017F>e now that lead the<U+017F>e parties, if you could take off the major number, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and do the <U+017F>ame things <U+017F>till: nay, if you could take off all, they would <U+017F>et up one, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
                  <p>And of how great con<U+017F>equence it is for the King to re<U+017F>ume this right, and be the author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, let any body judge: <U+017F>ince as <hi>Cumneus</hi> <U+017F>aid, tho<U+017F>e that have the art to plea<U+017F>e the People, have commonly the power to rai<U+017F>e them.</p>
                  <p>To do things <U+017F>o that there <U+017F>hall remain no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie, is very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and is no more then real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35597:54"/>
reforming, that is, plea<U+017F>ing them. For to do things that <U+017F>hall grieve hereafter, and yet pretend love (among<U+017F>t lovers them<U+017F>elves, where there is ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t faith) will not be accepted. It will not be enough for the King to do what they de<U+017F>ire, but he mu<U+017F>t do <U+017F>omthing more: I mean (by doing more) doing <U+017F>omthing of his owne, as throwing away things they call not for, or giving things they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not. And when they <U+017F>ee the King doing the <U+017F>ame things with them, it will take away all thought and apprehen<U+017F>ion that he thinks the things they have done already ill.</p>
                  <p>Now if the King ends the differences, and takes away <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect for the future, the ca<U+017F>e will fall out to be no wor<U+017F>e then when two duelli<U+017F>ts enter the Field, where the wor<U+017F>ted party (the other having no ill opinion of him) hath his <U+017F>word given him again (without further hurt after he is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power.) But otherwi<U+017F>e it is not <U+017F>afe to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what may follow: for the people are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally not valiant, and not much Cavalier. Now it is the nature of Cowards to hurt where they can receive none. They will not be content (while they fear and have the upper hand) to fetter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Royalty, but perchance (as timorous <U+017F>pirits u<U+017F>e) will not think them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>afe while that is at all. And po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, this is the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>tate of things.</p>
                  <p>In this great work (at lea<U+017F>t to make it appear perfect and la<U+017F>ting to the Kingdom) it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary the Queen really joyn; for if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tand aloof, there will <U+017F>till be <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions: it being a received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35597:54"/>
in the world, that <U+017F>he hath a great intere<U+017F>t in the Kings favor and power. And to invite her, <U+017F>he is to con<U+017F>ider with her <U+017F>elf, whether <U+017F>uch great vertues and eminent excellencies (though they be highly admired &amp; valued by tho<U+017F>e that know her) ought to re<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied with <U+017F>o narrow a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the e<U+017F>timation of a few? And whether it be not more proper for a great Queen to arrive at univer<U+017F>al honour, and love, then private e<U+017F>teem and value.</p>
                  <p>Then, how becomming a work, for the <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and <U+017F>oftnes of her Sex, is compo<U+017F>ing of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and uniting hearts? and how proper for a Queen, reconciling King and People?</p>
                  <p>There is but one thing remains, which whi<U+017F>per'd abroad, bu<U+017F>ies the Kings mind much (if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbs it) in the mid<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e great Re<U+017F>olutions, and that is, The pre<U+017F>ervation of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervants, whom he thinks <U+017F>omwhat hardly torn from him of late: which is of <U+017F>o tender a nature; I <U+017F>hal rather propound <U+017F>omething about it, then re<U+017F>olve it.</p>
                  <p>The fir<U+017F>t <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, Whether as things now <U+017F>tand (Kingdoms in the ballance) the King is not to follow nature, where the con<U+017F>ervation of the more general <U+017F>till commands and governs the le<U+017F><U+017F>e. As Iron by particular <U+017F>ympathy <U+017F>ticks to the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone, but yet if it be joyned with a great body of Iron, it quits tho<U+017F>e particular affections to the load<U+017F>tone, and moves with the other, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the common Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <U+017F>econd will be, Whether, if he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35597:55"/>
tho<U+017F>e mini<U+017F>ters, they can be of any u<U+017F>e to him hereafter? <U+017F>ince no man is <U+017F>erved with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prejudice, then he that employs <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments, or not beloved, though able and de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them<U+017F>elves.</p>
                  <p>The third is, Whether, to pre<U+017F>erve them, there be any other way then for the King to be fir<U+017F>t right with his people? <U+017F>ince the rule in Philo<U+017F>ophy mu<U+017F>t ever hold good, <hi>nihil dat quod non habet.</hi> Before the King have power to <U+017F>ave, he mu<U+017F>t have power.</p>
                  <p>La<U+017F>tly, Whether the way to pre<U+017F>erve this power be not to give it away? For the people of <hi>England</hi> have ever been like wantons, which pull and tugg as long as the princes have pull'd w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude with a prayer (not that I think it needs at this pre<U+017F>ent: Prayers are to keep us from what may be, as well as to pre<U+017F>erve us from what is) <hi>That the King be neither too in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, nor too re<U+017F>olved from what is within him.</hi> To be <U+017F>ick of a dangerous <U+017F>icknes, and find no pain, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be with lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of under<U+017F>tanding (Tis an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori<U+017F>me of <hi>Hippocrates)</hi> and on the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinia<U+017F>trie</hi> is a <U+017F>ullen Porter, and (as it was wittily <U+017F>aid of Con<U+017F>tancy) <U+017F>hutts out often-times, Better things then it lets in.</p>

In this number and highe<U+017F>t I place this great one, that there is a <hi>Deity;</hi> which the whole world hath been <U+017F>o eager to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, that rather then it would have none at all, it hath too often been contented with a very mean one.</p>
                  <p>That there <U+017F>hould be a great Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>er and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of things, a wi<U+017F>e Rewarder and Puni<U+017F>her of good and evil, hath appeared <U+017F>o equitable to men<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that by in<U+017F>tinct they have concluded it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; Nature (which doth nothing in vain) having <U+017F>o far imprinted it in us all, that <U+017F>hould the envie of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dece<U+017F><U+017F>ors deny the <U+017F>ecret to Succeders, they yet would find it out. Of all tho<U+017F>e little ladders with which we <U+017F>eale heaven, and climb up to our Maker, that <U+017F>eems to me not the wor<U+017F>t, of which man is the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep. For but by examining how I, that could contribute nothing to mine owne being, <U+017F>hould be here, I come to ask the <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>tion for my Father, and <U+017F>o am led in a direct line to a la<U+017F>t Producer, that mu<U+017F>t be more then man. For <hi>if man

made man, Why died not I when my Father died?</hi> <U+017F>ince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Maxime</hi> of the Philo<U+017F>ophers, <hi>the cau<U+017F>e taken away, the effect does not remain.</hi> Or if the fir<U+017F>t man gave him<U+017F>elf being, why hath he it not <U+017F>till? Since it were unrea<U+017F>onable to imagine any thing could have power to give it <U+017F>elf life, that had no power to continue it. That there is then a God, will not be <U+017F>o much the di<U+017F>pute, as what this God is, or how to be wor<U+017F>hipped, is that which hath troubled poor mortals from the fir<U+017F>t, nor are they yet in quiet. So great has been the diver<U+017F>ity, that <U+017F>ome have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t thought God was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e delighted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in his <U+017F>ervice, then he was plea<U+017F>ed with it in his works. It would not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to take a <U+017F>urvey of the world from its cradle; and with <hi>Varro,</hi> divide it into three Ages: the <hi>Unknown,</hi> the <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and the <hi>Hi<U+017F>torical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fir<U+017F>t was a black <hi>night,</hi> and di<U+017F>covered <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> the <U+017F>econd was a weak and glimmering <hi>light,</hi> repre<U+017F>enting things imperfectly and fal<U+017F>ly: the la<U+017F>t <hi>(more clear)</hi> left hand<U+017F>om monuments to po<U+017F>terity. The <hi>unknown</hi> I place in the age before the Flood, for that Deluge <U+017F>wept away things as well as men, and left not <U+017F>o much as foot<U+017F>teps to trace them by. The <hi>fabulous</hi> began after the Flood; in this time Godheads were cheap, &amp; men not knowing where to choo<U+017F>e better, made Deities one of another. Where this ended, the <hi>hi<U+017F>torical</hi> took beginning: for men began to ingrave in pillars, and to commit to Letters, as it were by joynt con<U+017F>ent: for the three great <hi>Epoches</hi> or Termes of Accompt were

                  <p>And the <U+017F>econd was <U+017F>o <hi>fabulous,</hi> that tho<U+017F>e which took it up afterwards, <U+017F>mil'd at it as ridiculous and fal<U+017F>e (which though was ea<U+017F>ier for them to do then to <U+017F>hew a true.) In the <hi>hi<U+017F>torical,</hi> it improved, and grew more refined: but here the <hi>Fathers</hi> entred the field, and <U+017F>o cleerly gained the victory, that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay nothing in it, did I not know it <U+017F>till to be the opinion of good wits, that the particular Religion of Chri<U+017F>tians has added little to the general Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the World. Let us take it then in its <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter e<U+017F>tate,</hi> and look upon it in that age which was made glorious by the bringing forth of <U+017F>o many admirable <U+017F>pirits, and this was about the 80. <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> in the year of the world 3480. for in the <U+017F>pace of an 100. yeers, flouri<U+017F>hed almo<U+017F>t all that <hi>Greece</hi> could boa<U+017F>t of, <hi>Socrates, Plato, Ari<U+017F>totle, Architas, I<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Pythagoras, Epicurus, Heraclitus, Xenophon, Zeno, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Demo<U+017F>thenes, Parmenides, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates, Theophra<U+017F>tes, Empedocles, Tymaeus,</hi> with divers others, Orators and Poets. Or rather (for they had their Religion one from another, and not much different) let us take a view of it in that Century in which Nature (as it were to oppo<U+017F>e the Grecian in<U+017F>olence) brought forth that happy birth of <hi>Roman</hi>

And to <U+017F>ay truth, a great part of our Religion, either directly or indirectly hath been profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed by Heathens; which I conceive not <U+017F>o much an exprobation to it, as a confirmation; it being no derogating from truth, to be warranted by common con<U+017F>ent.</p>

They concluded tho<U+017F>e to be vices which we do; nor was there much difference in their vertues; onely Chri<U+017F>tians have made ready beleef the highe<U+017F>t, which they would hardly allow to be any. They held rewards for the good, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hments for the ill; had their <hi>Elizium,</hi> and their <hi>hell;</hi> and that they thought the pains <hi>eternal</hi> there, is evident, in that they beleev'd from thence was no return. They proportion'd <U+017F>ufferings hereafter, to offences here; as in <hi>Tantalus, Si<U+017F>yphus,</hi> and others, among which that of Con<U+017F>cience) the worm that never dies) was one, as in the Vultures gnawing of <hi>Promotheus</hi> heart, and <hi>Virgils</hi> uglie<U+017F>t of Furies thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in <hi>Pirithous</hi> ear, was not ob<U+017F>curely <U+017F>hown; and yet neerer us, they held the number of the Elect to be but <U+017F>mall, and that there <U+017F>hould be a la<U+017F>t day in which the World <U+017F>hould peri<U+017F>h by fire.

To begin then with their <hi>Jupiter</hi> (for all before were but little <U+017F>tealthes from <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> workes) how much more like a Deity are the actions our <U+017F>tories declare our God to have done, then what the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Authors deliver of theirs? How excellently

elevated are our de<U+017F>criptions of him? Theirs look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if they knew that power onely by their fears, as their Statues erected to him declare: for when he was <hi>Capitolinus,</hi> he appeard with thunder; when <hi>Latiaris,</hi> be<U+017F>mear'd with blood; when <hi>Feretrius,</hi> yet more terrible: We may ghe<U+017F><U+017F>e what their conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions were, by the wor<U+017F>hip they gave him: How full of cruelty were their <U+017F>acrifices? it being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almo<U+017F>t through the whole world, <hi>that gods were plea<U+017F>ed with the blood of men:</hi> and this cu<U+017F>tom neither the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wi<U+017F>dom, nor <hi>Roman</hi> Civility aboli<U+017F>hed, as appears by <U+017F>acrifices to <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the ceremonies of <hi>Liber Pater,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> how ob<U+017F>cene? and tho<U+017F>e daies which were <U+017F>et a part for the honour of the gods, celebrated with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>hews as <hi>Cato</hi> him<U+017F>elf was a<U+017F>hamed to be pre<U+017F>ent at. On the contrary, our <U+017F>ervices are <U+017F>uch as not only <hi>Cato,</hi> but God him<U+017F>elf may be there: we wor<U+017F>hip him that is the pure<U+017F>t Spirit, in purity of <U+017F>pirit; and did we not beleeve what the Scriptures deliver from himfelf, yet would our rea<U+017F>on per<U+017F>wade us that <U+017F>uch an E<U+017F><U+017F>ence could not be plea<U+017F>ed with the blood of bea<U+017F>ts, or delighted with the <U+017F>team of fat: and in this particular, Chri<U+017F>tians have gone beyond all others except the Mahometans; be<U+017F>ides whom there has been no Nation that had not <U+017F>acrifice, and was not guilty of this pious cruelty.</p>
                  <p>That we have the <U+017F>ame vertues with them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true; but who can deny that tho<U+017F>e vertues have received additions from Chri<U+017F>tianity, conducing to mens better living together? revenge of injuries

                     <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> both took him<U+017F>elf, and allowed by the Law to others; <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> placed it in vertues quarter: We extol patient bearing of injuries; and what quiet the one, what trouble the other would give the world, let the indifferent judge. Their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice only took care that men <U+017F>hould not do wrong: ours that they <U+017F>hould not think it, the very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <U+017F>everely forbidden: and this holds too in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tity, de<U+017F>ire of a woman unlawfully being as much a breach of the commandement, as their enjoying, which <U+017F>hew'd not only the Chri<U+017F>tians care, but wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to prevent ill, who provided to de<U+017F>troy it where it was weake<U+017F>t in the Cradle, and declared, He was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then a God which gave them the<U+017F>e Laws; for had he been but man, he never would have provided or taken care for what he could not look into, the hearts of Men, and what he could not puni<U+017F>h, their thoughts. What Charity can be produced an<U+017F>werable to that of Chri<U+017F>tians? Look upon the Primitive times, and you <U+017F>hall find that (as if the whole World had been but a private Family) they <U+017F>ent from Province to Province, and from Places farre di<U+017F>tant, to Releeve them they never <U+017F>aw nor knew.</p>
                  <p>Now for the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which they propo<U+017F>ed: if they take it as the Heathens under<U+017F>tood it, it was an <hi>Elizium,</hi> a place of ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>hades, at be<U+017F>t but a hand<U+017F>om retirement from the troubles of this World: if according to the duller Jewes, Fea<U+017F>tings and Banquettings; (for it is evident

Of the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t we can <U+017F>hew no patterns among<U+017F>t us: for though there be <U+017F>uch a thing as whipping of the body, yet it is but in <U+017F>ome parts of Chri<U+017F>tendom, and there perchance too, more <U+017F>mil'd at then practis'd. Our Religion teacheth us to bear afflictions patiently when they fall upon us, but not to force them upon our <U+017F>elves: for we beleeve the God we <U+017F>erve, wi<U+017F>e enough to chu<U+017F>e his owne <U+017F>ervice, and therefore pre<U+017F>ume not to adde to his commands. With the Jews it is true we have <U+017F>omthing in common, but rather the names then thinges: Our Fa<U+017F>ts being more the medicines of the body, then the puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, <U+017F>piritual, as our Sabbaths; both good mens delight, not their trouble.</p>
                  <p>But lea<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould <U+017F>well into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as would make it look rather like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which I had labour'd to get, then an accompt which I alwaies carry about me; I will now briefly

examine, whether we beleeve not with rea<U+017F>on tho<U+017F>e things we have different from the re<U+017F>t of the world. Fir<U+017F>t then, for the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion of the truth of them in general: let us con<U+017F>ider what they were that conveigh'd them to us: men (of all the world) the mo<U+017F>t unlikely to plot the cozenage of others, being them<U+017F>elves but <U+017F>imple people, without ends, without de<U+017F>ignes, <U+017F>eeking neither honour, riches, nor plea<U+017F>ure, but <U+017F>uffering (under the contrary) ignominy, poverty, and mi<U+017F>ery; enduring death it <U+017F>elf, nay courting it: all which are things di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>teful to nature, and <U+017F>uch as none, but men <U+017F>trangely a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would have undergone. Had they feigned a <U+017F>tory, certainly they would not in it have regi<U+017F>tred their owne faults, nor deliver'd him whom they propounded as a God, ignominiou<U+017F>ly crucified: add to this the progre<U+017F><U+017F>e their doctrine made abroad, miraculous above all other either before or <U+017F>ince: other Religions were brought in with the <U+017F>word, power, forcing a cu<U+017F>tom, which by degrees u<U+017F>urp'd the place of truth: this even power it <U+017F>elf oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing. For the Romans (contrary to their cu<U+017F>tome which entertained all Religions kindly) per<U+017F>ecuted this: which by its owne <U+017F>trength <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hearts of men, that no age, <U+017F>ex, or condition, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to lay down life for it. A thing <U+017F>o rare in other Religions, that among the Heathens, <hi>Socrates</hi> was the <U+017F>ole martyr: and the Jews (unle<U+017F><U+017F>e of fome few under <hi>Mana<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Antiochus)</hi> have not to boa<U+017F>t of any. If we ca<U+017F>t our eyes upon the healing of the blind, curing the lame, redeeming from the grave,

and but with a touch or word, we mu<U+017F>t conclude them done by more then humane power, and if by any other, by no ill; The<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ie not them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o much about the good of man: and this Religion not only forbids by precept the wor<U+017F>hip of wicked <U+017F>pirits, but in fact de<U+017F>troys it where<U+017F>oever it comes. Now as it is clear by Authors impartial (as being no Chri<U+017F>tians) that <U+017F>trange things were done, <U+017F>o it is plain they were done without impo<U+017F>ture.

But let us de<U+017F>cend to tho<U+017F>e more principal particulars, which <U+017F>o much trouble the curious wits: the<U+017F>e I take to be the <hi>Incarnation, Pa<U+017F>sion, Re<U+017F>urrection,</hi> and <hi>Trinity.</hi>

La<U+017F>tly, That God has liv'd with men, has been the general fancy of all Nations: every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular having this tradition; that the Deity at <U+017F>ome time or other conver<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t men. Nor is it contrary to rea<U+017F>on to beleeve him re<U+017F>iding in glory above, and yet incarnate here: So in man him<U+017F>elf, the <U+017F>oul is in heaven when it remains in the fle<U+017F>h, for it reacheth with its eye the Sun; why may not God then being in heaven, be at the <U+017F>ame time with us in the fle<U+017F>h? <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>oul without the body would be able to do much more then with it, and God much more then the <U+017F>oul, being the <U+017F>oul of the <U+017F>oul.

To this I <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer, that as the body is partner in well or ill doing, <U+017F>o it is but ju<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hare in the rewards or puni<U+017F>hments hereafter: and though by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>in we blu<U+017F>h at it here, yet when that <U+017F>hall cea<U+017F>e to be, why we <U+017F>hould be more a<U+017F>hamed then our fir<U+017F>t Parents were, or <U+017F>ome in the la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover'd parts of the World are now, I cannot under<U+017F>tand.

Nor is it the meane<U+017F>t invitement to me now, to think that my e<U+017F>tate there, is above my capacity here.

We then hold God to be one, and but one, it being gro<U+017F><U+017F>e to imagine two omnipotents, for then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be <U+017F>o; yet <U+017F>ince this good is perfectly good, and perfect goodnes cannot be without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love, nor perfect love without communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to an unequal or created, for then it mu<U+017F>t be inordinate; We conclude a Second <hi>Coeternal</hi> though <hi>Begotten:</hi> nor are the<U+017F>e contrary (though they <U+017F>eem to be <U+017F>o) even in created <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, that one thing may come from another, and yet that from whence it comes, not be before that which comes from it; as in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi> But
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35597:66"/>
in the<U+017F>e high my<U+017F>teries, <U+017F>imilitudes may be the be<U+017F>t Arguments. In Metaphy<U+017F>icks they tell us, that to the con<U+017F>tituting of every being, there is a <hi>Po<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ui e<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> from whence there is a <hi>Sapientia <U+017F>ui e<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> and from the<U+017F>e two proceedeth an <hi>Amor <U+017F>ui e<U+017F><U+017F>e:</hi> and though the<U+017F>e three be di<U+017F>tinct, yet they make up one perfect being. Again, and more familiarly; There is a hidden Original of waters in the earth, from this a <U+017F>pring flows up, and of the<U+017F>e proceeds a <U+017F>tream: this is but one e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, which knows nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a before, nor an after, but in order, and (that too) according to our con<U+017F>idering of it: the Head of a Spring is not a Head, but in re<U+017F>pect of the Spring; for if <U+017F>omthing flow'd not from it, it were no Original, Nor the Spring a Spring if it did not flow from <U+017F>omthing, nor the Stream a Stream but in re<U+017F>pect of both: Now all the<U+017F>e three are but one Water, and though one is not the other, yet they can hardly be con<U+017F>idered one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, though I know this is <U+017F>o far from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>tration, that it is but an imperfect in<U+017F>tance (perfect being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible of infinite by finite things) yet there is a re<U+017F>emblance great enough to let us <U+017F>ee the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility. And here the eye of Rea<U+017F>on needed no more the <U+017F>pectacles of Faith, then for the<U+017F>e things of which we make <U+017F>ympathy the cau<U+017F>e, as in the Load-<U+017F>tone, or antipathy, of which every man almo<U+017F>t gives in<U+017F>tance from his owne nature: nor is it here <U+017F>o great a wonder that we <U+017F>hould be ignorant; for this is di<U+017F>tant and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <U+017F>ence; the<U+017F>e neer and <U+017F>ubject to it; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35597:66"/>
it were <U+017F>tranger for me to conclude that God did not work <hi>ad extra,</hi> thus one and di<U+017F>tinct within him<U+017F>elf, becau<U+017F>e I cannot conceive how begotten, how proceeding; then if a Clown <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay the hand of a Watch did not move, becau<U+017F>e he could not give an account of the wheels within. So far is it from being unrea<U+017F>onable, becau<U+017F>e I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand it, that it would be unrea<U+017F>onable I <U+017F>hould: For why <U+017F>hould a created <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance comprehend an uncreated, A circum<U+017F>cribed and limited, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circum<U+017F>crib'd and unlimited? And this I ob<U+017F>erve in tho<U+017F>e great Lovers and Lords of Rea<U+017F>on, quoted by the Fathers, <hi>Zoroastres, Tri<U+017F>megi<U+017F>tus, Plato, Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Plotinus, Proclus, Amelius,</hi> and <hi>Avicen,</hi> that when they <U+017F>poke of this my<U+017F>tery of the Trinity, of which all writ <U+017F>omething, and <U+017F>ome almo<U+017F>t as plainly as Chri<U+017F>tians them<U+017F>elves, that they di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ed it not as they did other things, but delivered them as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they had received them<U+017F>elves, without di<U+017F>pute.</p>
