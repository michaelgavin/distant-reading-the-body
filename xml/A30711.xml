         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>TIS now about 14 years
<U+017F>ince I laboured under an
extraordinary pain in
both my knees and feet,
not knowing whither to
turn my <U+017F>elf for pain, having u<U+017F>ed in
vain all tho<U+017F>e means by which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had found <U+017F>ome ea<U+017F>e. After I had
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed five or <U+017F>ix weeks in tho<U+017F>e exce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
pains, which <U+017F>ometimes, in <U+017F>pight of
my teeth, extorted tears from my eyes,
and con<U+017F>umed my fle<U+017F>h as well as my
<U+017F>trength, keeping me in a manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<U+017F>leeple<U+017F>s; I was per<U+017F>waded to
<U+017F>uffer an <hi>Indian</hi> Doctre<U+017F>s to come to
me, which was of <hi>Quinam,</hi> (whom my
Wife commonly employed for the curing
of our <U+017F>laves, and who al<U+017F>o had been
very <U+017F>uccesful in recovering my only
<pb facs="tcp:50778:4"/>
daughter from a certain difficulty of
breathing <U+017F>he had been troubled with
for two years together). This <hi>Indian</hi>
woman being demanded, whether <U+017F>he
knew how to cure that painful di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
which I was mole<U+017F>ted with; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered,
<U+017F>he did. But to tell you the
truth, it was done by a way of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Which means being by me reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of an apprehen<U+017F>ion I had of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
               </gap> pain that mu<U+017F>t needs accompany
<U+017F>uch a remedy; <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, that then <U+017F>he
would prepare <U+017F>omething to <hi>mitigate</hi>
the pains I <U+017F>uffered, and bring me <U+017F>uch
a medicine in the afternoon; repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>till, that if I would endure the
Cau<U+017F>tick or Burning remedy, the pain
<U+017F>hould ever after <U+017F>tay away: But, for
all that, I could not then re<U+017F>olve upon
it.</p>
            <p>The woman being gone, upon further
con<U+017F>ideration, I began to repent that I
had refu<U+017F>ed the u<U+017F>e of her Cau<U+017F>tick;
and thought with my <U+017F>elf, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this propo<U+017F>ed remedy <U+017F>hould ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
I could feel but one pain at a
time, either that of the Gout, or that
<pb facs="tcp:50778:4"/>
of the Cau<U+017F>tick; longing to <U+017F>ee my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctre<U+017F>s
again; who being returned, and
asked, whether <U+017F>he had ready her mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the Cau<U+017F>tick, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>miling,
<U+017F>he had: At the <U+017F>ame time drawing
it forth out of her pocket, and de<U+017F>iring
me that I would <U+017F>uffer her to try her
art and skill upon me; which having
at la<U+017F>t agreed unto, <U+017F>he went pre<U+017F>ently
to work; having demanded a lighted
candle, and <U+017F>olicitou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>earch'd for
that part of the place affected where
the greate<U+017F>t pain was: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<U+017F>he burned with her <hi>Moxa</hi> (of
which hereafter) on my feet and knees,
(to my be<U+017F>t remembrance) about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
little E<U+017F>cars, which looked like lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
gray <U+017F>pecks, without rai<U+017F>ing any
bli<U+017F>ters, or cau<U+017F>ing any after-pain;
whereupon al<U+017F>o all the pain of the Gout
vani<U+017F>h'd. All this operation was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
within le<U+017F>s than half an hour,
without any bodies hearing me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of pain. And I herewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that even whil<U+017F>t the burning
la<U+017F>ted, I found my <U+017F>elf much inclined
to <U+017F>leep; and that in <U+017F>uch a manner,
<pb facs="tcp:50778:5"/>
that after the operation was over, I
was <U+017F>o overcome by <U+017F>leep, that I <U+017F>lept
very quietly near 24 hours together,
without ever waking; whereas afore,
by rea<U+017F>on of the cruel pains. I had not
been able to <U+017F>leep at all for <U+017F>everal
days and nights together. Being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
I found, 'tis true, my feet and
knees yet much <U+017F>welled; but in a few
days after I was al<U+017F>o freed from tho<U+017F>e
tumifying humours, by the little open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
made by the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>tick, <U+017F>o that
I was able to return to the work of
my vocation; mo<U+017F>t heartily thanking
God Almighty for his goodne<U+017F>s to me,
and duly acknowledging the operation
of this <hi>Indian</hi> woman, admiring withal
the powerfulne<U+017F>s of this remedy again<U+017F>t
<U+017F>o contumacious an evil, as is the
Gout. There near pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed full 27 months
e're I heard any thing of a Gouty pain,
and I began to be full of hope it would
for ever have forgot and quitted me,
according to the promi<U+017F>e of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctre<U+017F>s;
which not long after, to my great
<U+017F>orrow, died. True it is, that after
the time named, I had once, or at mo<U+017F>t
<pb facs="tcp:50778:5"/>
twice in one year <U+017F>ome grudgings of
that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; but never any <U+017F>ore fit:
Only about four years ago, when I
fell into a very hot Fever of nine days
continuance, without hope of life, that
Fever changed, and ended in the Gout;
all the pains of which, in a very <U+017F>hort
time, I freed my <U+017F>elf from, by means of
the <U+017F>aid Cau<U+017F>tick; <U+017F>o that I prote<U+017F>t can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
that being now in a Fever again,
I long as much and more for a fit of the
Gout, as I formerly was wont to dread
it; knowing it to be an argument of
the <U+017F>trength of the heart, when a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
determines in the Gout: <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>pon
which <U+017F>core the famous <hi>Crato,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itian
to three Emperors, and the
learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> were wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
Gouty men, by telling them that
this evil tended to health.</p>
            <p>Now, from the day that I was <U+017F>o
<U+017F>oon and with <U+017F>o <U+017F>light pains cured of
the Gout, I have given my thoughts
liberty to expatiate upon the nature of
the Gout: And fir<U+017F>t of all, to call in
que<U+017F>tion, whether Phy<U+017F>itians hitherto
have had a right notion, and given a
<pb facs="tcp:50778:6"/>
true account of the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: And after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
enquiry into the matter, and
upon the con<U+017F>ideration of this <U+017F>overeign
remedy, I concluded, that this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
mu<U+017F>t needs have another immediate or
proximate cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eat, &amp;c. than had

            <p>Whereupon I thought good to di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the world my thoughts of this

to have kept them only for my

things for the improvement of Phy<U+017F>ick,
and for the relief of tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

and does <U+017F>o disfigure many a

the <U+017F>ame he was before. In the doing
whereof, my de<U+017F>ign is to do good to
my fellow-creatures, and to lay out
this talent for their ea<U+017F>e and comfort;
as al<U+017F>o to open a way for intelligent
and <U+017F>tudious men to <U+017F>earch into, and
<pb facs="tcp:50778:6"/>
find out the nature not only of the Gout,
but al<U+017F>o of divers other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es that
have any affinity therewith; <U+017F>uch as
are <hi>Head-pains, Tooth-ach, Pleuri<U+017F>ies,
Colick,</hi> and even the <hi>Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s</hi>

in the quoted Book: <hi>That the
humour which makes the <U+017F>welling, is
not properly the peccant matter, is
from hence evident; becau<U+017F>e that in
the beginning, before the part <U+017F>wells,
the greate<U+017F>t pain is felt, and the <U+017F>ame
grows le<U+017F>s, when the <U+017F>welling appears.</hi>
'Tis true, that that learned man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth

tis certain, that the external tumor
is not the morbid matter it <U+017F>elf, for

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Becau<U+017F>e it is indeed <U+017F>mall, and
for the mo<U+017F>t part cannot be <U+017F>een by
the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t eye of the body, though
it be <U+017F>een by the eye of rea<U+017F>on. For,

as the contrary is true in the<U+017F>e
and other <U+017F>wellings. See the proof

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Yes, it may; for at times it
appears plainly enough, though few
Arti<U+017F>ts take it for a gouty <U+017F>welling,
mi<U+017F>led by the external appearance of
it, which is in the form of a <U+017F>mall
hard pimple on the place of the part
affected; of which you have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t
proof in <hi>Pareus,</hi> the French
Chirurgian, treating of a di<U+017F>temper
in a young woman at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that
had <U+017F>uch a tumor on her thigh;
though <hi>Pareus</hi> doth not record it for
<U+017F>uch.</p>

by the eye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Then chiefly, when the gouty
cau<U+017F>e attacks the Patient, not about
the joints of the limbs, but in or about
the middle of tho<U+017F>e places, with a
boyling pain, wherein nature labours
as much as <U+017F>he can (though <U+017F>he be not

<U+017F>hall produce but one argument for
all, which <hi>M. Beverwyck</hi> alledgeth
out of <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his Treati<U+017F>e of

he declares, <hi>That the windy <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
do vani<U+017F>h ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t of all.</hi> What
you can <U+017F>ay to this objection, I long
to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> Tho<U+017F>e great men <U+017F>peak here
only in <hi>general</hi> of windy tumors;
and what they <U+017F>ay is only true of <U+017F>uch
windy <U+017F>wellings as lurk under the

skin, or in fle<U+017F>hy parts; not in tho<U+017F>e
that lie in deep parts, and under firm

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What then is the true cau<U+017F>e

the gouty cau<U+017F>e (the damp) <U+017F>o dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> The gouty damp is ea<U+017F>y
enough to be evacuated, and 'tis even
forward to be exhaled; but there is
a notable ob<U+017F>tacle which hinders the
<U+017F>peedy performance of it. And that
is this; The impacted and inclo<U+017F>ed
damp, which cau<U+017F>eth the windy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in the Gout, <U+017F>eeks a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out at, but finds none; partly
becau<U+017F>e of the gro<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the damp;
partly and chiefly by rea<U+017F>on of the
clo<U+017F>e and firm membrane of the bone,
under which it lurks; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince
the place, in which this cold damp
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50778:18"/>
lodgeth, enjoys but little warmth, for
the attenuating of this gro<U+017F>s damp,
and expelling it through the <U+017F>mall
pores of that membrane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But, I pray, Sir, let me know
what is the chief motive that hath
induced you to make Damps the only
<hi>next</hi> cau<U+017F>e of the Gout?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>. Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> This remedy which I
here offer, as that which <U+017F>uddenly
cures this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: For, if it be true,
that the <hi>Medicine declares the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e,</hi>
as Phy<U+017F>itians afirm with their

that no humors, but only a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
thing, is the cau<U+017F>e of this
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ob<U+017F>erving the <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
motion of the gouty matter,
<U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F>lodging in a very <U+017F>hort
time from one limb to another, from
the hand to the foot, from one foot
to the other, &amp;c. flying as 'twere with

               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> This is not <U+017F>aid from well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded

which is often <U+017F>een and felt
in the Gout, <U+017F>ufficient proof that
there is a <U+017F>ort of Gout which comes
from heat?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> This is a Symptom or accident
in the Gout, which is not cau<U+017F>ed by
the next and always accompanying

as I <U+017F>hall more clearly make out, when
I come to <U+017F>peak of this Symptom;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50778:20"/>
But 'tis a Symptom, (not to pa<U+017F>s that
by in this place) which hath <U+017F>trangely
mi<U+017F>led tho<U+017F>e who have mi<U+017F>taken it for

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Is this damp al<U+017F>o ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and malignant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> So 'tis judged by con<U+017F>iderable
and experienced men, as well as by
my <U+017F>elf, and that from the intolerable
pain and other accidents. So doth that
old Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Guido de Culiaco;</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus
in his 7th.</hi> Book, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. proves it
by two Examples; and our new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
confirms the <U+017F>ame. Be<U+017F>ides,
the foetid damps of the Gout do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>peak this malignity, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
both at the time of the act of
burning, and after it; that being <U+017F>uch,
that <U+017F>ometimes both the Patient, and
the Per<U+017F>on that admini<U+017F>ters the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tick,
and dre<U+017F><U+017F>es the part, are ready
to fall away. And this is mo<U+017F>t of all
found at the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the little
wounds, when they begin to omit
good <U+017F>tore of moi<U+017F>ture. For as <U+017F>oon
as you <U+017F>hall in a morning open the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50778:20"/>
little Plai<U+017F>ters, you will be <U+017F>o <U+017F>truck
with a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>tinking <U+017F>mell, that it
will almo<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t you into a <U+017F>wound.
'Tis very probable, that this <U+017F>tuff is
already malign before it be ca<U+017F>t out
from the heart into the limbs; yet
remaining for a while wedged in the
limbs, from the evaporation ob<U+017F>truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
its malignity is heightned. Hence
it is not advi<U+017F>able, to <U+017F>erve this burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing upon any one that is
fa<U+017F>ting; but 'tis be<U+017F>t, that both the
Patient and the Agent <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t
breakfa<U+017F>t, and take a cordial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for Winds
to occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>chief?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An<U+017F>.</hi> Very po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; and then e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
when they are more peccant
by their quality than quantity: So
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his golden Tract of
<hi>Flatus's</hi> doth not without cau<U+017F>e judg
of winds, that mo<U+017F>t of all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

                  <hi>An.</hi> Dr. <hi>Paul Barbette</hi> reckons
them all among<U+017F>t the effects of the
Gouty pain, when he treats of the
Symptoms of <hi>Wounds</hi> in his <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50778:32"/>
p.</hi> 165. of his Dutch Edition.
Be<U+017F>ides that 'tis manife<U+017F>t, that mo<U+017F>t
of the<U+017F>e do then fir<U+017F>t appear when
the pain grows violent, and di<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with the diminution and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
of the pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Whence comes it, that the<U+017F>e
Symptoms that are cau<U+017F>ed by the
Gout, not only in divers Patients, but
al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves at
one time more than another, and
differ <U+017F>o much from one another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> It comes from the greater or le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er
inten<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the efficient cau<U+017F>e, the
Pain; which receives its degrees from
the quality and quantity of the gouty
matter. For the more malign and
abounding the damps are, the more
grievous al<U+017F>o are not only the <hi>proper</hi>
Symptoms, but al<U+017F>o <hi>the<U+017F>e</hi> Accidents
of the Gout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth the raging pain excite
in all Gouty per<U+017F>ons the<U+017F>e Symptoms
all together, and at once?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Not <U+017F>o; for in bodies that
have but little <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity in the blood,
the fir<U+017F>t five Symptoms do appear;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50778:33"/>
but not at all, or very <U+017F>eldom, the
<U+017F>ixth and la<U+017F>t, which is the afflux of
humors: In others, who abound in
that <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity, the afflux of moi<U+017F>ture
will be perceived fir<U+017F>t of all, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
without inflammation. Again,
when the gouty matter lurks deep, as
in the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and in the Gout of
the <U+017F>houlders, you are not then to
reckon upon the change of colour,
and the afflux.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> That raging pains do cau<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
is ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tood; but
how do they produce Fevers, Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Sleepine<U+017F>s, and lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>trength?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The intolerable pain drawing
to the heart, cau<U+017F>eth there a Fever and
Fainting; and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to the brain,
produces there Waking: whence mu<U+017F>t
nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow Lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>trength.</p>

cau<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>o many Phy<U+017F>itians and
Chirurgians are <U+017F>o much wedded to
the Notion of <hi>Humors,</hi> that they dare

which breeds the external <U+017F>welling, is

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 'Tis never perceived in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Gout; for, though in
many Patients this Tumor very <U+017F>oon
follows upon the Gout; yet, if it be
well ob<U+017F>erved, it is never of the <U+017F>ame
age with the Gouty tumor, which in
order of time always precedes it: Yea,
if care be had, its birth may <U+017F>ometimes
be altogether prevented, by being
timely ready to evaporate this dolori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
damp by a <U+017F>peedy application of
my matchle<U+017F>s di<U+017F>charging Remedy;

as for the mo<U+017F>t part it fir<U+017F>t appears

remain <U+017F>welled as before, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<U+017F>ome days, and <U+017F>ome trouble,
before this Swelling can be removed;
yea, if you do not take care, it not

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> I <U+017F>ee, you make two <U+017F>orts of

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> I do <U+017F>o; the one is <hi>Windy,</hi>
which is the Gout it <U+017F>elf; the other
<hi>Serous,</hi> which is a Symptom: And
they differ exceedingly from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherein con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Chiefly in the<U+017F>e particulars:
1. In re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Name,</hi> which they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50778:36"/>
receive from their <U+017F>everal Cau<U+017F>es; for
the Gouty tumor coming from Winds,
takes the name of <hi>Windy</hi> tumor; the
other, coming from a <U+017F>erous humor,
is called the <hi>Serous</hi> tumor. 2. In
re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Place affected;</hi>
for, whereas the Windy tumor di<U+017F>tends
the Membranes of the bones, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fill the Carncous parts, as water
a <U+017F>punge, and render the Fle<U+017F>h very
<U+017F>pungy. 3. In regard of the <hi>Signs;</hi>
for, whereas the <hi>Inward</hi> <U+017F>welling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
grievous and intolerable pain,
the <hi>Serous</hi> none or little. 4. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<U+017F>welling is a proper di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; the
other is rai<U+017F>ed by the pain, and is a
Symptom bred by Con<U+017F>ent of parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But <U+017F>ince that the <hi>Serous</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in the Gout is not produced by
any External cau<U+017F>e, but by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
what is this Cau<U+017F>e?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The violent pain, as hath been
often <U+017F>aid, which is here the cau<U+017F>e of
the Afflux of humors, it being known
by Arti<U+017F>ts, that Pain draws humors
after it; which therefore is by them
a<U+017F><U+017F>igned to be one of the principal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50778:36"/>
cau<U+017F>es of the Afflux of humors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But are the<U+017F>e humors, of which
this kind of Swelling con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts, drawn
into the <U+017F>uffering parts by the Pain
alone?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Arti<U+017F>ts are wont to add, that
<U+017F>ympathizing Nature, as a kind Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<U+017F>uccours the <U+017F>uffering part by
<U+017F>ending moi<U+017F>ture to it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
this Swelling <U+017F>hould be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by Sympathy of Con<U+017F>ent of the
parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What benefit or ea<U+017F>e doth the
part affected receive from <U+017F>ympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
nature by her <U+017F>ending tho<U+017F>e hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
thither?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> That the raging pain is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
mitigated, and rendred more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> In what manner is that done,
or how doth the conveyed humor a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wage
the enraged pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Though this be difficult to
explain; yet I cannot agree to the
common opinion, importing, that the
Pain-breeding matter by means of the
conveyed humors is driven outward,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50778:37"/>
and di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed thorough the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>o the <U+017F>uffering
member for a great part freed of the
pain-cau<U+017F>ing matter: For, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
humors can by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or come to the dolorifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
much le<U+017F>s fotch it out of its deep
<U+017F>eat, and di<U+017F>lodge it, becau<U+017F>e 'tis <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t
impacted and included under <U+017F>o firm
and clo<U+017F>e a Bone-membrane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What is then, in your opinion,
the rea<U+017F>on why the <U+017F>harp pain is often
dimini<U+017F>hed upon the afflux of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture,
not only in the Gout, but al<U+017F>o in
the Tooth-ach? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Methinks 'tis probable, that
'tis done after this manner: The mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
fle<U+017F>hy parts being by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
humors rendred <U+017F>ofter, plumper,

as before, when the carneous parts
had but their own native and proper
moi<U+017F>ture. Secondly, the <hi>periostium</hi>
being by the conveyed moi<U+017F>ture from

without made gentler, may with le<U+017F>s
pain be <U+017F>tretch'd; and it may al<U+017F>o come
to pa<U+017F>s, that by that little warmth,
which this <U+017F>erous matter hath in it
at fir<U+017F>t, it being now come near the

the E<U+017F>car: Continuing this until it
be time to heal up the wound; when
the leaf, being prepar'd again after
the former manner, is to be laid on
with the <hi><U+017F>mooth</hi> <U+017F>ide to the skin; by
which means it will heal up without

'tis not advi<U+017F>able, when the pain is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,

not the Blood that's peccant or faulty,

indeed <hi>run together</hi> with the blood

<U+017F>o <hi>mix with</hi> the blood, as to make

Whereas 'tis otherwi<U+017F>e with the Blood

in his <hi>Examen of Chirurgery,</hi> p. 364.
viz. <hi>The burning with a red-hot Iron

of an <hi>hot Iron</hi> but in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es,

<U+017F>trongly draws out from the deep, and

they do not cure the Gout but by

it chanceth, that the Gout <U+017F>its ju<U+017F>t in

was in a little time perfectly cured;
the matter of the <hi>Schirrus,</hi> thence
di<U+017F>charged, white like mixed chalk,

remove the <U+017F>ame too <U+017F>uddenly.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'tis beneficial, to take a gentle
Vomitive after your meal, once a week.
<hi>Sixthly,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as you perceive any
<U+017F>igns of a Fever (the mother of the
Gout,) then is it proper to take a <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick,
by the advice of <U+017F>ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced

               <p>Q. IS there al<U+017F>o a <hi>Gout</hi> of the <hi>teeth;</hi>
for I have been inform'd by
Dr. <hi>Wilhelmus de Ryne,</hi> who lately
is arriv'd here, that there is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>ht
a treati<U+017F>e in <hi>Europe,</hi> entituled, <hi>of
the Gout of the Teeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thus is very properly expre<U+017F>t
that kind of tooth-ach, which hath
the <U+017F>ame proximate Cau<U+017F>e with the
Gout, and ari<U+017F>eth from cold Damps,
as the Gout doth, which otherwi<U+017F>e,
according to the common opinion is
bred from De<U+017F>luxions.</p>
               <p>Q. But <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, do you think,
that the Gout and Tooth-ach come
from the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>e?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ti's certain to me (whatever
<U+017F>ome may alledg to the contrary,)
that the next cau<U+017F>e, the part afflected,
the <U+017F>eat, the ways, the <U+017F>ignes and
<U+017F>ymptoms are the <U+017F>ame in the<U+017F>e di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50778:68"/>
and do agree together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is then the Cure of the Tooth-ach
to be perform'd after the <U+017F>ame
manner as of the Gout?</p>
               <p>A. By no means, the Tooth-ach is
to be cured in another place, becau<U+017F>e
that the place, where the pain hath
its <U+017F>eat here, is within the mouth and
the teeth, where you cannot come to
burn with our <hi>Moxa?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. Would you then have the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Artery</hi> open'd with a lancet,
(this <U+017F>eeming to be the way by which
the evil damp may be expelled out of
the teeth;) as <U+017F>ome hath ventur'd to
do, to the great ea<U+017F>e of the pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This means is too dangerous,
becau<U+017F>e it is very <U+017F>ubject to occa<U+017F>ion
an <hi>Aneuri<U+017F>ma,</hi> and <U+017F>pends too much
of the vital <U+017F>pirits.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you <U+017F>ay then of <U+017F>cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in the neck or upon the
<U+017F>houlders; or of purging, or of blood-letting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The<U+017F>e and the like remedies
<U+017F>eldom give ea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have then the ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tooth pulled out?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50778:69"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not at all; that way being a de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
one, and not only accompanied
with great pain &amp; mi<U+017F>chief to the poor
Patient, but al<U+017F>o occa<U+017F>ioning many
evils, and even death it <U+017F>elf. But take
me right, I pray; for I here only <U+017F>peak
of that kind of Tooth-ach, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
de<U+017F>cribed, not of that which
comes from the <hi>Rottenne<U+017F>s</hi> of teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, may we follow
<hi>Spigelius,</hi> whole manual operation
<hi>Scultetus</hi> mentions in the 18th of his
<hi>Chirurgical Ob<U+017F>ervations;</hi> who with
his knife, heated red-hot, did cut off
that little branch of the temporal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
which runs through the Ear to the
teeth; by which means the pain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
vani<U+017F>hed and never return'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Tis true, that <hi>Scultetus</hi> <U+017F>peaks
with great commendation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
calling it a Chirurgical reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of wonderful vertue; which
the Author hath fir<U+017F>t practi<U+017F>ed upon
him<U+017F>elf, and afterwards, in <hi>Scultetus</hi>
his pre<U+017F>ence, upon others (always
with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s:) And this hath
been further improved by others:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50778:69"/>
For whereas <hi>Spigelius</hi> made u<U+017F>e of a
red-hot knife, to cut off the <U+017F>aid little
branch on the out<U+017F>ide of the Ear;
others have u<U+017F>ed a little flat caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ing
Iron, in a <U+017F>ilver ca<U+017F>e, that they
might go <U+017F>afely, and not burn dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than was fit; and therewith they
have burnt off and <U+017F>ear'd <hi>within</hi> the
Ear, the <U+017F>ame ramification of the
<hi>Carotid Artery,</hi> with the like happy
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s: As I my <U+017F>elf have experienced
26. or 28. years ago at <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
where Dr. N. <hi>Coets</hi> did, by this means,
immediatly free me from an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
tooth-ach. I have al<U+017F>o under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
here in <hi>India</hi> from very credible
Per<U+017F>ons, that D. <hi>Godefridus Dellius,</hi>
Mini<U+017F>ter at <hi>Kooten</hi> near <hi>Wyck</hi> of
<hi>Dur<U+017F>tede,</hi> hath cured many of that
pain by this very means.</p>
               <p>Q. Since this is <U+017F>o excellent and
effectual a remedy, <U+017F>hall we then <U+017F>tand
by it, or is there <U+017F>omething to be <U+017F>aid
again<U+017F>t it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So there is; and to deal plainly
with you, it ought to yield to a better
remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> to our burning with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50778:70"/>
                  <hi>Moxa,</hi> the which in the Gout of the
Teeth <U+017F>erves not only for a di<U+017F>charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but al<U+017F>o for a revul<U+017F>ive intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
remedy, which always produces
good (if u<U+017F>ed according to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cript)
and never the lea<U+017F>t evil. For,
whereas by the former way, of u<U+017F>ing the
red-hot knife and the cautery, the
body lo<U+017F>es one of the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and the
nobler kind of blood-ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, to the
detriment and <U+017F>poiling of the teeth;
by our way tho<U+017F>e ve<U+017F>els are pre<U+017F>erved
entire and unhurt. T'is true indeed,
that the pain of the teeth by the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
art is <U+017F>o removed as that it never
returns (in ca<U+017F>e that whole branch
be burnt off;) but this is al<U+017F>o true,
that by <U+017F>uch a cauteri<U+017F>ing operation
there is for ever cut off that afflux of
the blood and vital <U+017F>pirits, through this
<U+017F>ear'd artery, to the teeth; whereupon
at la<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t follow an exiccation and
mortification of the teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Since then you prefer your burning
with <hi>Moxa</hi> before all other remedies
in the Tooth-ache al<U+017F>o, pray, teach
me, where it is to be applyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50778:70"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ju<U+017F>t upon the <hi>temporal artery,</hi>
where the <U+017F>ame in the Temples, not
far from the Ear, beats <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t in

place where Chirurgians are wont to
apply their Ma<U+017F>tick-plai<U+017F>ters, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. But is the burning with <hi>Moxa</hi>
upon the <hi>temporal</hi> arteries not too
dangerous?</p>

                  <hi>A<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  </hi> Not at all, if your work be done

               <p>Q. After what manner then is this
Burning to be performed; mu<U+017F>t it be
done as in the ca<U+017F>e of the Gout?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>o; only you mu<U+017F>t in this ca<U+017F>e
Kindle le<U+017F><U+017F>er pellets, and the<U+017F>e to the
number of three upon one place, and
no more; though it be not forbidden,
at <U+017F>ome little di<U+017F>tance from the burned
place to perform anew the like burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
which may be done not only
without fearing the lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>chief
from it, but al<U+017F>o with an expectation
of more ea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this Burning followed by a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50778:71"/>
Mitigation or by a Removal of the
pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It performs both, in an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
manner, and that in<U+017F>tantly, or
pre<U+017F>ently after, without fail; unle<U+017F>s,
unknown to the Patient and Operator,
the Tooth-ach <U+017F>hould proceed from a
hidden rottenne<U+017F>s of the Teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. But, Sir, how will you make it
out, that this is a revul<U+017F>ive and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
remedy, and withal di<U+017F>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the part affected from the evil
which afflicts it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is as clear as the Sun at
noon-day, and that from the effects: For
the Damps, which were already by the
expelling power of the Heart driven
out into the place that is between the
membrane and the teeth, and there
produced <U+017F>o great pain by the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible membrane, are by
this our Burning drawn back to the
place where the Burning is made, and
other Damps intercepted that were
on the way, and <U+017F>o the body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to wi<U+017F>h, disburthen'd from both,

<U+017F>aith, that the true means duly to
purge the blood hath not yet been
found out: Is that true?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is; for the ways hitherto
found out to purify the blood do not
de<U+017F>erve that name. For, the matter
being well con<U+017F>idered, they do <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
el<U+017F>e than di<U+017F>charge the blood of
its impurities: And I am of opinion,
that unto this very time there hath
been found out no better means for
that purpo<U+017F>e than what we here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e;
fora<U+017F>much as thereby the Blood
is <U+017F>uddenly and mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>afely purged of

Burning for the Tooth-ach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After this <U+017F>light Burning there
remains only a little gray <U+017F>peck, which
needs not to be look'd after, becau<U+017F>e
it dries and heals up of it <U+017F>elf, and
<U+017F>erves till then for a vent to the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating

by our way of Burning
with Moxa.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IAcobus Jonas,</hi> about 13 years of
age, Son of <hi>Jonas Aertz,</hi> who
was chief Chirurgion in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pital
of the Noble Company in
<hi>Batavia,</hi> having taken a fancy (again<U+017F>t
his Fathers command) to <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ad
and di<U+017F>mal agonies of dying per<U+017F>ons
in a place where de<U+017F>perate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
per<U+017F>ons were lodged, did upon
a Sunday morning <U+017F>ee one of tho<U+017F>e
give up the gho<U+017F>t in <U+017F>o affrightful a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50778:73"/>
manner under <U+017F>uch terrible convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions,
that being more than u<U+017F>ually
terrified therewith, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to <U+017F>peak of it at Table with
amazement: At which relation his
Father being much troubled, did <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
rebuke him for <U+017F>o dangerous a
curio<U+017F>ity, <U+017F>trictly commanding him,
never to repair to that place again,
from an apprehen<U+017F>ion, lea<U+017F>t one time
or other he <U+017F>hould rue <U+017F>uch a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity.
But behold! The boy laying
him<U+017F>elf down upon a bench after
dinner, to take (as 'tis common in
that place) a nap in the afternoon,
there appear'd to him (as he related
afterwards) in a dream that fearful
departure of the dead, <U+017F>o lively to
his fancy, that in a fright he awaken'd,
crying out a loud, and, <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed on with
a terrible fit of the <hi>Epilep<U+017F>y.</hi> To
which di<U+017F>temper he remained a great
while <U+017F>ubject, and in <U+017F>uch a manner,
that upon the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>turbance he
fell into new fits, of which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was not able by any of the
means by him employed to free him.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50778:73"/>
This did <U+017F>o grieve the good old man,
that in all likelihood it contributed
not a little to his ha<U+017F>ty death.</p>
               <p>It hapned, that upon occa<U+017F>ion I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited
the widow of this Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where <U+017F>eeing this Youth halting, I
asked what the cau<U+017F>e of it was. He
<U+017F>hewing me a <U+017F>welling above his left
knee, accompanied with grievous
pains; I was apt to conclude that it
was a Gouty di<U+017F>temper, and re<U+017F>olved,
thereupon, with the con<U+017F>ent of the
parties concerned, to treat it as <U+017F>uch;
employing my way of burning, which
I did with three pellets con<U+017F>umed on
one place: whereupon all pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vani<U+017F>hed, the youth in<U+017F>tantly
walked without any inconvenience.
I put upon it a Coridons plai<U+017F>ter, and
order'd him to renew it twice in 24
hours. And <U+017F>ince that time he never
had any fit of the Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s;
doubtle<U+017F>s becau<U+017F>e that the venemous
Damps, which cau<U+017F>ed this grievous
di<U+017F>temper, had been evaporated our
of the body, or rather had been thence
drawn out by the <hi>Moxa.</hi> And 'tis
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50778:74"/>
ob<U+017F>ervable, that (according to the
relation made me by the Lad's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)
this Damp never cau<U+017F>ed in him a
fit of the Falling Sickne<U+017F>s, till it had
fir<U+017F>t for a while tormented the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned,
no otherwi<U+017F>e as if it
had been the Gout. Now, when this
peccant matter did a<U+017F>cend from the
knee to the Head (which u<U+017F>ually fell
out every <U+017F>ixth or eighth day,) it was
attended with a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Cold in the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of this Damp, yet acting
<U+017F>o <U+017F>lowly, that the Youth had time
enough to give warning to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a new <U+017F>it, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>he might
take the better care of him.</p>

with his hand, and to turn the
Patient's head which way <U+017F>he,
