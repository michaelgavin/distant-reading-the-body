            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it may perhaps, be onely an affected, or a pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>ty in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet it is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere Truth in me, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s I had not Publi<U+017F>hed this Romance, but at the Reque<U+017F>t and Commands of <U+017F>ome choice Friends, being
<pb facs="tcp:46063:3"/>
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that a piece compo<U+017F>ed in my greener Youth, and mo<U+017F>t of it during the intervals of a <U+017F>harp di<U+017F>temper, cannot be <U+017F>o mature and <U+017F>ound in all its parts, as it might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if undertaken in a more advanced Age, and healthful Lea<U+017F>ure. And therefore, to decline the Vanity of <U+017F>uch as make the Preface rather a Panegyrick to their Books, then an Adverti<U+017F>ement to the Reader; I declare, that this is onely to de<U+017F>ire tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall peru<U+017F>e the following Story, not to impute the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Faults to me, <U+017F>ince there
<pb facs="tcp:46063:3"/>
will be enough be<U+017F>ides upon my own <U+017F>core, to Exerci<U+017F>e the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t of their mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet do I not intend by this Ingenious Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ubmit my <U+017F>elf to every trivial Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urer: For though I <U+017F>hall acquie<U+017F>ce in the Judgement of the Wi<U+017F>e, yet have I too much Spirit to endure the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant reproof of <U+017F>uch bu<U+017F>ie Drones as make a humming noi<U+017F>e, indeed, like Bees, and often light upon the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t Flowers; but yet want the faculty to extract the lea<U+017F>t drop of Honey thence re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <U+017F>uch ill Con<U+017F>tituted Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

as convert the mo<U+017F>t whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome Aliments into corrupt and contagious humors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the<U+017F>e, I therefore ju<U+017F>tly may appeal to <U+017F>ounder judgements, <U+017F>uch as examine with as much skill as equity, and con<U+017F>ult with rea<U+017F>on and under<U+017F>tanding, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either giddy Folly, or be<U+017F>pattering envy to bias them: before whom I dare affirm, that if I de<U+017F>erve cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in <U+017F>ome places, I merit no le<U+017F>s approbation in others; For if my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion be not very Eloquent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:46063:4"/>
is it very Languid; and if novelty be therein plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing, I am confident <U+017F>ome will finde <U+017F>atisfaction; for though my <U+017F>tile may <U+017F>eem to limp, compared to the more Polite and Smooth Language of <U+017F>ome others, yet does it not fall into Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticity or ob<U+017F>cene<U+017F>s; nor leave <U+017F>uch uneven furrows as to make the Readers <U+017F>tumble, unle<U+017F>s their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or Malice lay an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand<U+017F>ome block in their own way.</p>
            <p>Such as can reli<U+017F>h no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> that is, not forced with
<pb facs="tcp:46063:5"/>
Extravagant Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities (no le<U+017F>s Ridiculous then improbable) will find little Gu<U+017F>to and cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here; wherefore I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch to <U+017F>top at this Preface, and make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progre<U+017F>s, for I have endued my Heroes with no greater <U+017F>trength or courage, then may re<U+017F>ide in generous per<U+017F>ons; nor do I fill their Veins with <U+017F>treams of blood greater, then tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>mal channels <U+017F>hould contain.</p>
            <p>I know, indeed, this were an ea<U+017F>ie task, if that were all, that is required to gain
<pb facs="tcp:46063:5"/>
applau<U+017F>e; it being without di<U+017F>pute more facil to rough-draw a Gyant (with a fen<U+017F>ing quil) who <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ingly rout whole Armies in every page, then really di<U+017F>arme the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<U+017F>t Coward that dares but <U+017F>tand in the lea<U+017F>t defen<U+017F>ive po<U+017F>ture.</p>
            <p>And who <U+017F>ees not the fair advantage I might now take to <U+017F>et off the actions of my Heroe by heightning and exagerating them with <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hyperboles, <U+017F>ince he is li<U+017F>ted one of the greate<U+017F>t Conquerours in the Rolls of Fame; But treating of a real
<pb facs="tcp:46063:6"/>
Hi<U+017F>tory, for the mo<U+017F>t part, though it be controverted by <U+017F>ome, I keep clo<U+017F>e to probability, and give him the Character of a man, who was indeed inriched with a more then vulgar Soul, but who<U+017F>e body was not above the Standar of Mortals, nor di<U+017F>proportionate to that condition.</p>
            <p>For, in Truth, how cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <U+017F>oever Fictons may pa<U+017F>s, yet can it not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed wi<U+017F>dome to compo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch as only plea<U+017F>e and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour extravagant and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fancies, but that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant

faculty of the Soul, the judgement; <U+017F>hould limit them within the naturall bounds of Rea<U+017F>on and Po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibility; And <U+017F>o <hi>Romances</hi> <U+017F>hould be no other then the faire<U+017F>t Pictures and ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblances of Truth, from which it is as blameable to deviate, as to add Tinctures to the Ro<U+017F>e or Lilly, <U+017F>uch aids being onely an ugly and gro<U+017F>s paint, that in<U+017F>tead of encrea<U+017F>ing their beauty, blurs them with deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:46063:7"/>
               <hi>But it may be Objected, that I am my <U+017F>elf guilty of tho<U+017F>e lap<U+017F>es, I here condemn, and chide <U+017F>o much in others; <U+017F>ince I have feined the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of <U+017F>o many per<U+017F>ons, and principally</hi> Birinthea, <hi>never mentioned by any ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Reply, that my de<U+017F>igne, being not only to tran<U+017F>cribe former Hi<U+017F>torians but to take my ri<U+017F>e from thence for fre<U+017F>h inventions; I think them very pertinent and excu<U+017F>able, <U+017F>o long as they are within the compa<U+017F>s of

probabillity, and are not found impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities.

This Battle fellow Souldiers, and worthy Officers, will be but the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Crown, which the fir<U+017F>t victory hath prepared: It might <U+017F>lip from us if we <U+017F>hould give <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>pite to our Enemies as to re<U+017F>ume their <U+017F>trength and <U+017F>pirits; Or if the fear which but now affrights them; <U+017F>hould be let alone till it turn'd into de<U+017F>pair. Yet do I not indeed que<U+017F>tion, but you would have as much <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, as you have true valour, though they were in a po<U+017F>ture to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t you more vigorou<U+017F>ly than now they can. But not to expo<U+017F>e you to the hazard of fortune, who refu<U+017F>ed them the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a victory <U+017F>he might have be<U+017F>towed on them; and which they cannot now obtain, but by your unmanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.

            <p>The<U+017F>e words being pronounc'd with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vehemency, the Officers and Souldiers returned to their own places; <hi>Cyrus</hi> drew the <hi>Hircanians</hi> up to the Front, and on each Wing two bodies of Hor<U+017F>e. He had not advanced far, but he was on the Enemies skirts, whil<U+017F>t there was yet but light enough to di<U+017F>cover them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Army more <U+017F>urprized with fear and dread than this of the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrians,</hi> at their approach.

their fir<U+017F>t defeat, made them uncapable to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the attaque of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> who charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with <U+017F>o much precipitancy and mettle, that running here and there, allarmed they <U+017F>oon fell into a mighty confu<U+017F>ion; <U+017F>ome to oppo<U+017F>e, others to e<U+017F>cape, bridled their Hor<U+017F>es, and the nimble<U+017F>t mounted and <U+017F>aved them<U+017F>elves: <U+017F>ome took their Arms as their be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecurity, others threw down theirs to fly with the le<U+017F>s incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. In fine, the greate<U+017F>t part of the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrians</hi> and their confederates being <U+017F>lain without any con<U+017F>iderable oppo<U+017F>ition, this Victory was only <U+017F>ignaliz'd by the illu<U+017F>trious names of <U+017F>ome of the dead: The King of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> were killed upon the place, with many other con<U+017F>iderable per<U+017F>ons, both for their valour and qualities. In this action the <hi>Hircanians</hi> gave infallible proofs of their fidelity and courage; they were the fir<U+017F>t at the on<U+017F>et, and la<U+017F>t in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: few of the Enemies that had <U+017F>aved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves from Death, could e<U+017F>cape from Captivity; mo<U+017F>t of them being made Pri<U+017F>oners, and tho<U+017F>e few that fled, and drove the riche<U+017F>t of their booty before them, were <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely per<U+017F>ued, that the <hi>Hircanians</hi> returned laden with riches, and with a great number of Chariots full of Women. <hi>Cre<U+017F>us</hi> was almo<U+017F>t the only man whom they could not overtake, who having taken the advantage of the whole night before with all his party to <U+017F>hun the next dayes <U+017F>hock, retired, being winged with fear, out of their reach.</p>
            <p>Among<U+017F>t the pri<U+017F>oners that were pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Cyrus, Sybaris</hi> his Lieutenant General, the choice<U+017F>t

of his friends, be<U+017F>towed upon him by the gods for a Companion in his fortunes, took notice of one he knew, and in<U+017F>tantly embraced him with te<U+017F>timonies of <U+017F>o particular an amity, that all the beholders were amazed: And <hi>Cyrus</hi> asking him whom that was he did <U+017F>o much care<U+017F><U+017F>e; My Lord, replyed he, If this Prince were treated according to the merit of his valour and birth, you <U+017F>hould behold him rather with a Crown on his head, and Palms the trophies of Victory in his hands, then in this pre<U+017F>ent unhappine<U+017F>s of a Captivity, which neverthele<U+017F>s cannot but be glorious to him, <U+017F>ince it cannot but be an effect of his courage.</p>
            <p>This Elogy which <hi>Sybaris</hi> made of his friend, render'd <hi>Cyrus</hi> the more curious to know whom he was, and having heard his Name and place of birth, with the gallant deportment had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in the fight, he approached him with all the civilities that were due to <U+017F>o illu<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Captive; and having di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed with him <U+017F>ome time, this Pri<U+017F>oner an<U+017F>wer'd in <U+017F>o brave a manner, that it plainly appeared to him, tho<U+017F>e prai<U+017F>es which <hi>Sybaris</hi> had <U+017F>poken, were rather the te<U+017F>timonies of <U+017F>incere truth, than of any particular affection.</p>
            <p>Their Complements being ended, <hi>Sybaris</hi> to who<U+017F>e care <hi>Cyrus</hi> e<U+017F>pecially recommended him, conducted him to his own Tent, where he was nobly received; and having given him for <U+017F>ome time the liberty to repo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf alone; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience he was in to learn by what adventure he was drawn into that action, made him return and intreat him to relate the <U+017F>tory of his life, ever

                        <p>You know that I was born in <hi>Margiana</hi> of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which, being of the <U+017F>ame blood of tho<U+017F>e Princes that are the Soveraigns, is not a little con<U+017F>iderable in that Country: and be<U+017F>ides this advantage, the more then ordinary care of my Education was added, I being the only child after twelve years marriage 'twixt my Father and Mother.

I could not be <U+017F>atisfied with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but rather wi<U+017F>ht <U+017F>he might have lo<U+017F>t many things of advantage and importance together with her liberty, that might have <U+017F>poken her of a greater quality, though I could not have heard that neither without <U+017F>orrow; and bearing to the Court, as well the remembrance of her mi<U+017F>ery, as the Image of her beauty; I con<U+017F>idered them both a long time, only with a <U+017F>ence of tenderne<U+017F>s and indifferency.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Seni<U+017F>ra</hi> at our return was fully acquainted, that what before we had been ignorant of, was called Love; and whatever other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he e<U+017F>teemed that trouble in his <U+017F>oul, he found it an<U+017F>wer only to that Name; and in this knowledge he eagerly <U+017F>ought the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet <hi>Themira</hi>: But the fir<U+017F>t time he came into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46063:14"/>
her pre<U+017F>ence his tongue was tyed up in an unu<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <U+017F>ilence, which put him into <U+017F>uch a trouble, as never till then had befaln him, in<U+017F>omuch that he could not <U+017F>alute her without a <U+017F>tammering impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, and his <U+017F>udden change would have been ea<U+017F>ily remark'd, if <U+017F>ome Ladies had not put him upon the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of his hunting, and tho<U+017F>e other diverti<U+017F>ements, they imagined he had been to <U+017F>eek in the Country. He indeavoured afterwards in many other encounters to behave him<U+017F>elf more confidently in her pre<U+017F>ence, and went <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prepared expre<U+017F>ly to entertain her in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but immediately a <U+017F>udden inward diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence controuled his <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olutions, <U+017F>o that in two months time all he could do, was rather to expre<U+017F>s his grief upon his face, then proclaim it with his tongue. He often complained to me, that he knew not what re<U+017F>pect hindred him from declaring him<U+017F>elf openly. In fine, con<U+017F>umed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with a flame, he could not hand<U+017F>omely bring to light, he re<U+017F>olved to extingui<U+017F>h it ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, by not <U+017F>eeing her, knowing her pre<U+017F>ence only nouri<U+017F>hed that heat. But when the plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on had invited his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to return into the Country, not being able to indure her ab<U+017F>ence, who<U+017F>e only memory excited <U+017F>uch troubles in his brea<U+017F>t, he asked me, if I would accompany him to <hi>Coupava,</hi> that Ca<U+017F>tle being not far di<U+017F>tant from <hi>Themira</hi>'s: I told him it would be a very great honour to me, when ever he would vouch<U+017F>afe to go there, &amp; to receive him in the be<U+017F>t manner that could be; I <U+017F>ent my Father notice of his de<U+017F>ign, &amp; two dayes after we went, only with <U+017F>uch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

as might not too much di<U+017F>cover us. The whole journey he entertained me with his Amours, and complained of the cruelty of his Fate, in that he fore-<U+017F>aw his Father would never condi<U+017F>cend to it, though <hi>Themira</hi> <U+017F>hould fairly corre<U+017F>pond, which he likewi<U+017F>e placed among<U+017F>t his doubts: I mildely told him, he ought to attempt all means and remedies before he yeilded to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and that I could not believe <hi>Themira</hi> would refu<U+017F>e the honour of his noble affection, <U+017F>he having too great a <U+017F>tock of wit not to di<U+017F>cern the infinite advantages might follow, provided <U+017F>he could clearly penetrate his ju<U+017F>t and hone<U+017F>t intentions.</p>
                        <p>Ariving with the entertainment of the<U+017F>e di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es at <hi>Coupava,</hi> we were <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>urprized finding <hi>Themira</hi> there, who accompanied her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was come to vi<U+017F>it mine. <hi>Seni<U+017F>ra</hi> was extreamly joyful of that good fortune, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already late, the <U+017F>mall portion of that dying evening pa<U+017F>s'd in u<U+017F>ual Complements and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The next morning all the Nobility and Gentry that inhabits near tho<U+017F>e parts come to pay their obedience to the Prince, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready talked of nothing but hunting to divert him: when having told them, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous to ta<U+017F>te the <U+017F>weeter repo<U+017F>e of that <U+017F>olitude, every one retir'd to their dwellings, leaving him the free liberty to compleat his de<U+017F>ign. The fir<U+017F>t time we attempted to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Themira,</hi> was with my Mother, but their ceremonious re<U+017F>pects, and the <U+017F>plended treatment they made for him, hindred him from making known any thing of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The next time we waited on her, he began
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46063:15"/>
to di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parks of his great flame, though <U+017F>paringly; and my Mother and <hi>Themira</hi>'s being retir'd, we remained alone with that beauty, who had the charge to perform the honour of the Hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>hew us all the rarities, of which <hi>Seni<U+017F>ra</hi> took <U+017F>o little notice, that although there were very many which de<U+017F>erved a curious <U+017F>urvey, and might have challenged our admiration, yet he could hardly be <U+017F>o much the Ma<U+017F>ter of his patience and rea<U+017F>on, as to vouch<U+017F>afe to look on them. <hi>Themira</hi> who quickly perceived his <U+017F>mall complai<U+017F>ance, told him <U+017F>he was extreamly <U+017F>orry there was nothing worthy his view; yet <U+017F>he wondered not he took <U+017F>o little delight therein, becau<U+017F>e as it was unworthy of his nobler fancy, <U+017F>o it was an abu<U+017F>e to his patience to <U+017F>trive to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him any longer in that dull <U+017F>olitude, it being ea<U+017F>ie to judge his more choice contentments <U+017F>ummoned him back again to Court.</p>
                        <p>This complement wakened the Princes <U+017F>ilence, which his <U+017F>oft pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had rocked into a mu<U+017F>ing <U+017F>lumber, and obliged him to a reply, rather that he might not be thought incivil, then to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf amorous; yet his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion favourably over-bia<U+017F><U+017F>ed his will, and per<U+017F>waded him to <U+017F>hape his an<U+017F>wer in the<U+017F>e words. If, as you tell me beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Themira,</hi> my <U+017F>atisfaction were rather to be at the Court, than in this place, I cannot <U+017F>ee what rea<U+017F>on could oblige me to leave it; the intere<U+017F>t which called me hither, be it what it will, mu<U+017F>t needs be mo<U+017F>t powerful <U+017F>till detaining me here: but I know not what <U+017F>trange enigmatical Fate mine is, that having <U+017F>o happily found what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ly

                        <p>I <U+017F>hall wonder now no more, reply'd <U+017F>he, <U+017F>ince it is a cau<U+017F>e not to be found in nature; You have rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid he, it is altogether divine; if it were an ordinary thing I might with<U+017F>tand it: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Themira,</hi> if the Sun be not guilty of their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, who too boldly expo<U+017F>e their <U+017F>ight to his bright rayes; if the Sea be not culpable of the wracks of tho<U+017F>e many ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which voluntarily throw or launch them<U+017F>elves into its watery Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, what cau<U+017F>e can I have to complain of that trouble which I have my <U+017F>elf courted and cheri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without the lea<U+017F>t of its allowance?

what Sir?

It is true, an<U+017F>wer'd he, <U+017F>omewhat troubled, the place of it <U+017F>elf would be indeed very indifferent to me, if it did not contain <U+017F>omewhat that might be the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ubject of my joy, as it is now of my griefe.</p>
                        <p>The Prince finding him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>o fair a path, endeavour'd to expound his thoughts more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly; and let her know all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e pointed at her: But <U+017F>he having a very ready wit, <U+017F>harpe judgement, and pre<U+017F>ent memory, ever turned the <U+017F>ence of his <U+017F>peech another way: and whether <U+017F>he feigned that <U+017F>he did not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand him, or really believed he only <U+017F>poke this out of Gallantry and complai<U+017F>ance, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omely warded all his complements, that when we were returned to the Ca<U+017F>tle, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined all her behaviour, we could not fathome any thing of her de<U+017F>ign, or lay hold of the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>illable that might <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>ound favourably on the Princes behalf.</p>

afterward <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented to entertain his noble affection with all the mutual corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that honour would allow of. But for my own part, that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that made me <U+017F>igh for the captivity of the fair <U+017F>lave, in<U+017F>pired me by degrees with a de<U+017F>ign to lighten her <U+017F>ufferings. To this effect, I de<U+017F>ired the Keeper to treat her le<U+017F>s rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the re<U+017F>t, and not dare to put her to any unhand<U+017F>ome or <U+017F>ervile labour, and to make the fellow the more ob<U+017F>ervant, I cau<U+017F>'d an old woman who had been my nur<U+017F>e, to tell him, that my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had an intent to take her to her <U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>During my re<U+017F>idence there. I delighted much to be in the Hall, where <U+017F>he was often working with many others. The plea<U+017F>ure I took in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her, made me in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly wa<U+017F>te much time there, whereof <hi>Seni<U+017F>ra</hi> many times asked me the rea<U+017F>on, which <U+017F>hame obliged me to conceal: Though I had often told him, how much the beauty and mode<U+017F>t gracefulne<U+017F>s of this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the re<U+017F>t of them. <hi>Themira</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court drew us with her, for my part, I left not <hi>Coupava,</hi> but with much repugnance, and before I went, I would needs be acquainted with the fair Captives name, and learnt that <U+017F>he was called <hi>

That <U+017F>weet name came as often into my mouth, as her fair Idea into my mind.

The day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, one of my Uncles came to vi<U+017F>it me, and having led me into the Palace Garden; after a <U+017F>hort preface, which promi<U+017F>ed me the highe<U+017F>t fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity I could wi<U+017F>h for in the world, he told me that <hi>Balden</hi> had <U+017F>o particular an amity or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for me, that he would needs have me find out a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s for my <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>o we might be <U+017F>harers in the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings of his Sons triumph and <U+017F>olem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our Nuptials on the <U+017F>ame day.

I was not readily furni<U+017F>hed with any other an<U+017F>wer, but only that I had hitherto beheld the Ladies at the Court with too much indifferency to have any particular inclination, and that if they would allow me time, I was yet young enough to pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome years thus <U+017F>ingle, and it would not be too late hereafter to think of <U+017F>uch a weighty bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; Think of it then on your part, <U+017F>aid he, and we will con<U+017F>ider of it on ours, and <U+017F>o left me.

                        <p>With the<U+017F>e thoughts I was carried, where I might behold her to confirm my <U+017F>elf in this truth, and I was by her pre<U+017F>ence fortified in the high opinion I had conceived that my e<U+017F>teem was very rational, and that there was none could de<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o truely to be cheri<U+017F>hed and prefered.

<U+017F>he might be no more oblig'd to have that dete<U+017F>table object in her <U+017F>ight.

None could imagine that love and hatred had combin'd in this enterpri<U+017F>e, nor would he declare upon any interrogation, for what cau<U+017F>e he was mov'd to take away the Princes life, and in<U+017F>tead
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46063:52"/>
of imploying his friends, who were very potent, to <U+017F>ue his pardon, he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted to declare, that he de<U+017F>ired not to live but to performe that by a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attempt which he had <U+017F>o unhappily mi<U+017F>s'd in the fir<U+017F>t, it being a de<U+017F>ign too ju<U+017F>t to be thrown by. If any other but a Prince had appeared in it, I might perhaps have fallen under their <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of being confederate, but it was above conjecture to imagine that a per<U+017F>on of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be but anothers in<U+017F>trument, and therefore he alone was adjudged guilty<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>He was condemn'd to pay down his head for the price of this trea<U+017F>on, and becau<U+017F>e this peece of ju<U+017F>tice was to be exemplary, the execution was defer'd till the Kings returne, who was at that time within a dayes journey of <hi>Ninus,</hi> that the whole Court might be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant. My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the interim was made acquainted with the <U+017F>entence pronounced again<U+017F>t him, and feigning as if <U+017F>he were to goe a hunting, as <U+017F>he frequently did, being well mounted, <U+017F>he went directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ninus,</hi> where <U+017F>he arriv'd (ju<U+017F>t the evening before the fatal day, which <hi>Emuin</hi> reck'ned as the la<U+017F>t in his unhappy Calender disguis'd under the <U+017F>hrowd of <U+017F>uch a habit, as was not u<U+017F>uall to her <U+017F>ex.</p>
            <p>The day following all the Court being a<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, with the herds of common people, the King and his <U+017F>on being there pre<U+017F>ent with their extraordinary guard of <U+017F>oldiers, they drew the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Emuin</hi> forth of the pri<U+017F>on, to end his life and mi<U+017F>eries at one blow, but whil<U+017F>t every one had their eyes fixt on him, de<U+017F>canting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ly

            <p>It was the cu<U+017F>tome, of a long <U+017F>tanding, among<U+017F>t the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrians,</hi> that if any one could reveal <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which might aggravate the offenders crime, or could fully clear and di<U+017F>charge them, they were to come thus di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, to pre<U+017F>ent their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. According to this order the Judges in<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended the execution to know what this might be, they carried the written informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, who was amaz'd that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on which brought it, accus'd him<U+017F>elf as the <U+017F>ole author of the attempt, and fully di<U+017F>charged <hi>Emuin,</hi> as having only undertaken the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, out of a blinde obedience to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons command.</p>
            <p>Many had formerly been known to bring in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, but hardly ever any pre<U+017F>ented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves <U+017F>o voluntarily to certain death. In this general con<U+017F>ternation, they caus'd the unknown per<U+017F>on to approach near the King, who was no <U+017F>ooner within reach, but before he gave <U+017F>o much time as to examine a word, <U+017F>natch'd off the vail which concealed the admired per<U+017F>on<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> None could at the fir<U+017F>t in<U+017F>tant di<U+017F>cover who it was, and truly it were difficult not to be extreamly <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with <U+017F>uch an unlook'd for object as a Lady <U+017F>o generou<U+017F>ly out-braving death it <U+017F>elf.

At the<U+017F>e words he made a little pau<U+017F>e, to hear what <U+017F>he would an<U+017F>wer in that vacancy, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his propo<U+017F>ition either too melancholly, or too ob<U+017F>cure to gain a reply; What, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, do you not yet under<U+017F>tand me, mu<U+017F>t I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that in plain terms, which I would hide in <U+017F>ome manner from you, and will you not take notice of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, unle<U+017F>s I <U+017F>ay expre<U+017F>ly, that I love you? Ah, Madam, that word will co<U+017F>t me my life, I can add no more, and 'tis <U+017F>ufficient for my <U+017F>atisfaction that you know it. He could not command <U+017F>trength enough, either to draw out the thred of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e any longer, or to expect her an<U+017F>wer, his <U+017F>ences taking their flight together with his <U+017F>peech, and <hi>Panthea</hi> beholding him in this condition, re<U+017F><U+017F>ented the uproar of many pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions <U+017F>trugling in her bre<U+017F>t together: mode<U+017F>ty, anger, and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion invaded her mind, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ome moments in a deep <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, but <U+017F>eeing tho<U+017F>e that were by, <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ily imploy'd to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, <U+017F>he recover'd <U+017F>o much pitty as to lend her be<U+017F>t endeavours, and truly one may <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he alone was able to revive him, as <U+017F>he had only been the occa<U+017F>ion of his troubles.

            <p>Ha, what, Madam, will you not have me dye after <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umptuous a declaration, do you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure me, <U+017F>triving to make me live. Yes, reparted <hi>Panthea,</hi> I will not have you dye, though I do not pretend your cure, having no remedy for your malady, you only are the cau<U+017F>e of it your <U+017F>elf, and if you found any inclination to love, you ought not to have undertaken the charge of me. Neverthele<U+017F>s what help I can contribute, without a prejudice to my honour, you may ju<U+017F>tly hope for. To love is not a crime, I confe<U+017F>s it, <hi>Ara<U+017F>pe,</hi> and provided you manage your affection accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of vertue, I con<U+017F>ent to it: but do not break the rules which I pre<U+017F>cribe you, if it <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you, as you would have me believe, that I <U+017F>hould only be acquainted with it, I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>teem it ever real, <U+017F>o long as you do not offend my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, look to your health only, and make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to <hi>Panthea,</hi> who intreats you, that your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being not guilty, is capable to bring you as much repo<U+017F>e and content, as it hath co<U+017F>t you trouble.</p>
            <p>If I have ever wi<U+017F>h'd to dye, reply'd <hi>Ara<U+017F>pe,</hi> to end my torments, I do as earne<U+017F>tly now implore the gods, to <U+017F>uffer me to live, <U+017F>ince you command it, Madam, that I may te<U+017F>tifie by my re<U+017F>pects, and <U+017F>ervices, the immortal obligations I owe to your infinite bounty, which does concede far more than my mo<U+017F>t flattering hopes could ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e,

by permitting me to love you: my ambition reach'd no higher but to di<U+017F>cover it before my death, and I <U+017F>hall be, if I may live, henceforth too happy, in my a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous endeavours to make known that the bent of all my worthie<U+017F>t actions tend only to the honour of your <U+017F>ervice.</p>
            <p>This conference gave no le<U+017F>s ea<U+017F>e and comfort to <hi>Ara<U+017F>pe,</hi> than it occa<U+017F>ioned trouble, and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Panthea.</hi> She was no <U+017F>ooner alone, but examining in her own cha<U+017F>t thoughts all that had pa<U+017F>s'd, <U+017F>he accus'd her <U+017F>elf of too much complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ance, as if <U+017F>he had forfeited that <U+017F>evere vertue in which the world does make a Ladies honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and feared lea<U+017F>t the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to continue his fair affections, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pur him on beyond re<U+017F>pect and decency. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <U+017F>he excus'd her <U+017F>elf of fondne<U+017F>s upon that weight of obligations which <U+017F>he ow'd, and thought <U+017F>he could in civility do no le<U+017F>s, than <U+017F>uffer an hone<U+017F>t and vertuous friend<U+017F>hip.</p>
            <p>On the other part, <hi>Ara<U+017F>pe</hi> had quite a contrary opinion, he con<U+017F>trued <hi>Panthea</hi>'s civility <U+017F>o much to his own advantage, that taking the con<U+017F>ent <U+017F>he allowed his affection, to be meant a retaliation equal to his pa<U+017F>sion, he took a nice care of his recovery, that he might be able to reap the fruits of his de<U+017F>ires. This vain pre<U+017F>umption had almo<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>t him, he laid by all re<U+017F>pect, which he till then had ob<U+017F>erved towards her, and follow'd his own head-<U+017F>trong pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>o that <hi>Panthea</hi> finding her <U+017F>elf dangerou<U+017F>ly per<U+017F>ecuted by his in<U+017F>olent court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip, was con<U+017F>train'd to prefer the bill of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who weighing how important it

was towards his affairs not to offend a Prince<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e Husband with his forces might go near to turn the Scale on either <U+017F>ide, whom he pretended to court to a compliance by the mediation of his excellent Prince<U+017F>s, he took her out of his keeping, and made her all the noble <U+017F>atisfaction that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her to expect.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Cyrus</hi> went into <hi>Garamee,</hi> hard by the City of <hi>Oroba,</hi> where <hi>Gobrias</hi> was making preparations for his reception. He encamped there about, and being attended with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers and Nobility of his Army, made his entrance, which was as magnificent on his part, as it was proud and co<U+017F>tly on the inhabitants. The peoples loud acclamations declar'd with how much joy he was receiv'd. <hi>Gobrias</hi> with a great Train of Nobles gallantly mounted, and richly cloathed, went forth to meet him, and conducted him to his Palace, where his Daughter the generous <hi>Azimea,</hi> and all the great Ladies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them: this ceremony being performed on either part with a thou<U+017F>and civil expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. They made him pre<U+017F>ents of a va<U+017F>t <U+017F>um of money, and all the other rarities which the Orient does produce, the which he nobly accepted, but it was only to re<U+017F>tore them to <hi>Azimea,</hi> to whom he profer'd them <U+017F>o gracefully, that <U+017F>he could not refu<U+017F>e them with hand<U+017F>omene<U+017F>s, after <U+017F>he had long di<U+017F>puted with him for genero<U+017F>ity, and that he had prote<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more-over that if he commenc'd that War again<U+017F>t the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrians</hi> for rea<U+017F>ons of State, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires to <U+017F>erve her and to revenge her ju<U+017F>ter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>ts <U+017F>hould be henceforth the principal cau<U+017F>e to

make him continue and carry it on, to confirm which, having given her his hand, he followed her into many <U+017F>pacious rooms, who<U+017F>e furniture for beauty, and magnificence gave no le<U+017F>s wonder than delight; and afterwards taking his quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e for a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>pace (having contracted <U+017F>ome wearine<U+017F>s in viewing the rarities of one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t hou<U+017F>es in all <hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> and vi<U+017F>iting the fortifications about the City) being <U+017F>omewhat refre<U+017F>hed of that toile, he took his farewell of <hi>Gobrias,</hi> (who earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>tly intreated him to honour him with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence at <U+017F>upper, and pa<U+017F>s away <U+017F>ome dayes in that City) and returned to his Camp, preferring that <U+017F>ober frugality which the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> ob<U+017F>erve in their diet, before the delicacy of tho<U+017F>e exqui<U+017F>ite me<U+017F><U+017F>es which <hi>Gobrias</hi> prepared at his <U+017F>plendid entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e whom the beauty of the Ladies of <hi>Garamee</hi> had inamour'd <hi>Hi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>pe</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Cavalry, was one, being conquer'd by <hi>Azimea</hi>'s, but whatever advantage he promi<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf from <hi>Cyrus</hi> favour, who dearly loved him, to whom <hi>Gobrias</hi> had ab<U+017F>olutely committed the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of his Daughter, yet he dur<U+017F>t not fly his thoughts <U+017F>o high as to pretend affection towards a Prince<U+017F>s, who had been elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Scepter of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yria,</hi> and <U+017F>o generou<U+017F>ly refu<U+017F>ed it. He propounded neverthele<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve her, and to become, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, the mini<U+017F>ter of her vengeance, to merit at lea<U+017F>t by that action <U+017F>ome acknowledgement from her goodne<U+017F>s, if he dur<U+017F>t not expect it from her love.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was full of mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange

               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having reply'd, with as much genero<U+017F>ity as Court<U+017F>hip, that this was the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice he could pay to requite <U+017F>o much civility, de<U+017F>ired him, that on the next morning he might free him from the trouble of his unhand<U+017F>ome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e unhealthy company; by rea<U+017F>on of his wounds: <hi>Zorbas</hi> however con<U+017F>ented not to it, till the Chyrurgions had a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without danger, and having ended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he renew'd them by a fre<U+017F>h addre<U+017F>s to <hi>Birinthea,</hi> <U+017F>haping a thou<U+017F>and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es for his mens in<U+017F>olencies, and pray'd her to declare what <U+017F>atisfaction <U+017F>he thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, knowing an ordinary death was too cheap a ju<U+017F>tice and payment for <U+017F>o daring a crime, wherefore he left them to her <U+017F>entence. This Prince<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e mercy <U+017F>wayd above all other <U+017F>entiments, told him, that it would <U+017F>eem to reli<U+017F>h of ingratitude, if after <U+017F>uch choice obligations, which wip'd out all the other <U+017F>cores of injury, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t as to demand their lives. Wherefore as <U+017F>he had rea<U+017F>on to be concern'd in all that related to him, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he not only would profe<U+017F>s it, but evidently prove it by begging their lives of him, as a particular grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>The night was now much wa<U+017F>ted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zorbas</hi> having an<U+017F>werd in a few words, that <U+017F>he might ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of the lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>olent fellows, took his leave, and commanded the mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s of that hou<U+017F>e

            <p>In the mean while, our Heroe's exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive joy for the <U+017F>ight of his dear Prince<U+017F>s, was <U+017F>o great it quell'd for <U+017F>ome time the alarm which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had disquieted and threatned him withall, and as one highly <U+017F>atisfied with his own pro<U+017F>perous affection, he con<U+017F>umed the remainder of that night with the plea<U+017F>ing fancies of happy lovers. But then the <U+017F>adder remembrance of tho<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s promi<U+017F>ing <U+017F>peeches entring again into his mind, when the fir<U+017F>t light of day peep'd into his bed; Ah, cry'd he, <hi>Am I <U+017F>o much a fal<U+017F>e friend to my <U+017F>elf, as yet to flatter my hopes, did not</hi> Birinthea <hi>tell me, that <U+017F>he could not love me?

               <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Birinthea</hi> would have taken their la<U+017F>t adieu of <hi>Zorbas,</hi> at the Gates, but he would needs convoy them till they meet the little troop which ha<U+017F>tned to fetch and guide them to the Camp, which were but few in number to avoid all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition and inquiry.
