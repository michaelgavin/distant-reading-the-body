         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALtho' I have mo<U+017F>t commonly found the Pretenders to New-Light, and
rare Inventions (<U+017F>o common now a-Days) no more but Pretenders;
yet having <U+017F>omething of Curio<U+017F>ity, <U+017F>hall I call it, or Vanity, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>itive
for Truth in <U+017F>uch Preten<U+017F>ions; the noi<U+017F>e of a New-Light of Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a New Method of Phy<U+017F>ick Built upon Principles directly contrary to,
and overthrowing all what<U+017F>oever has been done by the whole World of Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
could not but excite in me an Attention, and cau<U+017F>e me to enquire into
the Truth of <U+017F>uch a Report. But when I had Read over one or two of tho<U+017F>e
Books which at length gave occa<U+017F>ion and Matter to the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
(tho' they contain <U+017F>omething, I confe<U+017F>s very <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ncommon) I found nothing
which could give me the lea<U+017F>t Stomach to another Meal of the <U+017F>ame, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to any New-Di<U+017F>h, afterwards pre<U+017F>ented by the <U+017F>ame Author. I had
found his Sawce <U+017F>owr enough, and the Di<U+017F>hes Garni<U+017F>h'd with Oranges and
Lemons; but the Meat it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o Raw and In<U+017F>ipid, I <U+017F>et it by as a <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>tuff
I had for ever enough of. But <U+017F>ometime <U+017F>ince, conver<U+017F>ing with divers Per<U+017F>ons
having little, or no Skill in Medicinal Cookery, and finding them highly
Commend as choi<U+017F>e Viands, tho<U+017F>e things which I knew would be but of bad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>tion,
and very apt to breed ill Humours: And con<U+017F>idering that it becomes
an Hone<U+017F>t and Generous Phy<U+017F>ician, as well to Advi<U+017F>e what things may pre<U+017F>erve,
or be prejudicial to the Health of his Neighbours, as to heal their Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es;
<hi>I</hi> begun to think, whether I was not oblig'd in Duty to Mankind, as well to
Di<U+017F>cover the evil Practice of another, as to labour to act rightly my <U+017F>elf. And
fora<U+017F>much as I know, an <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nrea<U+017F>onable and Ra<U+017F>h Method of Phy<U+017F>ick, tho' it
hurts not Phy<U+017F>icians, may more than endanger the Lives and Healths of the
People, tho' not in the Theory, yet in the Practice which is made upon them,
I was per<U+017F>waded once more to Read over what I had before been <U+017F>ated
with, and what farther has been offer'd by the Author of the pretended
New-Method, and to tran<U+017F>cribe, and make <U+017F>ome Remarks upon <U+017F>ome of the
chief Things whereby he endeavours to per<U+017F>awde the Truth of what he calls
his New-Hypothe<U+017F>is: Which when I had done, I could not but yet more admire
what it was in this Author, that Per<U+017F>ons of any Literature and Sen<U+017F>e, whether
Young Phy<U+017F>icians, or Gentlemen found <U+017F>o taking; <U+017F>omething very <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ncommon,

and particularly in a Phy<U+017F>ician, that it can attone for, Yes, and

Rea<U+017F>on, Reiterated Tautologies, Contradictions and Calumnies, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of a Quack Book, Bill, or Speech, can be guilty of. I was a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>ie
to think that the Judgment of our Age <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o declin'd it <U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>uch
Per<U+017F>ons: But yet they might have embrac'd their Non<U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and hugg'd their fal<U+017F>e
<hi>Juno</hi> long enough for me, <hi>Sed quod luditur de corio, imo de vita Humana,</hi>
but that her Embraces I knew, might prove unwhol<U+017F>ome to them. Which I
think, will appear in the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, to all that will but grant that
the Art of Healing is grounded upon Rea<U+017F>on, and Experimental Philo<U+017F>ophy.

The way of Dialogue I cho<U+017F>e to Write in, I think, will not only be le<U+017F>s tire<U+017F>ome,
but more ea<U+017F>ie and profitable to my Reader; <U+017F>ince I have Tran<U+017F>crib'd from
my Author Word for Word, all that I take occa<U+017F>ion to Speak too, for the mo<U+017F>t

Rehear<U+017F>ed by <hi>Alkali,</hi> you will find noted in Italick Characters, <U+017F>o that you
may <U+017F>ave the Trouble or Charge of turning to his Books, in Reading mine.
Wherein I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I have not abu<U+017F>ed him. or alter'd his Sen<U+017F>e in a Tittle,
that I know of, or added, more than <U+017F>ome few Words of Connexion, and the
entrance of the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which the Ju<U+017F>te<U+017F>t Reader, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, will pardon

were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible) as he <U+017F>aies he is, and would have us e<U+017F>teem him. 'Tis one of the
Main Poynts of my Religion, tho' I am a Phy<U+017F>ician, That I ought to be a
Friend to all Men; but I am <U+017F>omewhat of the Opinion of <hi>Plautus, Amicum
non ca<U+017F>tigare ob merita, mala noxia imane et facinus,</hi> I think it a
Fault, not to reprove tho<U+017F>e Errors, even in a Friend, that may be of evil
Con<U+017F>equence. But here are Errors, that may endanger even the Lives of
better Men than him that I reprehend, if <U+017F>o unfortunate as to be entic'd by
the love of <U+017F>harp Sawces, &amp; to fall into the Hands of <U+017F>o Bold a Medica<U+017F>ter. The

be Weighed in the mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Ballance, I think it may be found, That I have
<U+017F>aid nothing again<U+017F>t our Doctor, or which, may not be for his real Benefit,
whom I look upon as a Sick-Man, and am <U+017F>o far of his own Opinion, as to
think his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e cannot be Cured without <U+017F>harp Medicines; which tho' he
may as little like in the Swallowing, or Application, as <U+017F>ome of his Patients
may the Effects of his <hi>Acid</hi>-Do<U+017F>es, I hope yet it may be for his Health here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
But there are <U+017F>o many things in my Author, which are the Breakings
forth of Vicious Humours, I am doubtful whether I <U+017F>hall be reckon'd culpable
for giving him <U+017F>o many, or <U+017F>o few Do<U+017F>es, and applying my Corro<U+017F>ives to <U+017F>o many,
or <U+017F>o few of his Sores. I fear you will be weary of <U+017F>eeiug him Dre<U+017F>s'd: Yet I
hope no Phy<U+017F>ician, or Chirurgeon, no, nor Gentleman, or Lady, but may <U+017F>ee
<U+017F>omething worth their while; being if not <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, yet of u<U+017F>eful Con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore I <U+017F>hall no longer detain you at the Door of my Lazar-Hou<U+017F>e,
but take you in to hear, and <U+017F>ee, the Badne<U+017F>s of my Patient, and what <U+017F>ort of
Medicines I have Prepared for him. And tho' you will hear him Talk <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Talk like a Mad-Man (his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being much in his Head) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e that have done for him, as he has always done, calling all his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians,
Scoundrels, except Dr. <hi>Tuthil</hi> who got a little into his Favour;
yet you need not fear if you don't come too near him, any more than I do, tho'
I am re<U+017F>olv'd to handle him clo<U+017F>ely, that if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible the poor Young-Man may
have the benefit, and I the Credit of <U+017F>o great a Cure. But however it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
I confe<U+017F>s, I am almo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>ham'd of Preparing <U+017F>o many Remedies for <U+017F>o

               <p>WELL met Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> whither are you hurrying <U+017F>o

               <p>I <U+017F>hould hardly <U+017F>tay to tell you Mr. <hi>Alkali,</hi> but that I am
engag'd to oppo<U+017F>e you where-ever we meet, you <hi>Principle of Death
and Corruption,</hi> I am always provok'd by you, you have done <U+017F>o
much mi<U+017F>chief in the World: And now to your farther reproach,
I have a fre<U+017F>h in<U+017F>tance of your badne<U+017F>s, by a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger from my
Lord <hi>Lazington,</hi> whom you have plagu'd with a fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and
that a de<U+017F>perate one if I come not in time to his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, none
can help him but I, and he thinks it 7 Years e're I come to him.</p>

               <p>You are very <U+017F>harp Mr. <hi>Acid.</hi> I <U+017F>ometime <U+017F>ince heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that you have reptoach'd me in all Companies, even in
Coffee-Hou<U+017F>es, as well as wrote Books again<U+017F>t me, but now I find
it true: I am glad I have met with you, to tell you, you have
<U+017F>candalou<U+017F>ly reported divers things of me, which if you can't prove
to my Face, I <U+017F>hall not ea<U+017F>ily put up the Injury, nor part with
you willingly without Proof, or Submi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Let my Lord <hi>Lazington</hi>
roar a little, you will be the welcomer when you come; and I
know you can tell how to excu<U+017F>e your delay; <U+017F>ome Duke or other
had <U+017F>ent for you before, and perhaps my Lord will do as well
without you. Let us try whether you can maintain your Charge:
You call me the <hi>Principle of Death and Corruption,</hi> and I hear you
<U+017F>ay, I am the <hi>cau<U+017F>e of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,</hi> and that you alone are the Dr.
that can do any thing con<U+017F>iderable in the Cure of them, and that
by de<U+017F>troying and expelling <hi>Alkali:</hi> And this you make an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is
of, and call it a new one, of your di<U+017F>covery.</p>

               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>

that I continue <U+017F>till to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert my Hypothe<U+017F>is. <hi>That all the</hi> Alkali
<hi>in the Blood is mo<U+017F>t certainly an Excrement in a way of being carried
off by <U+017F>ome of the Emunctories, and when any of the Emunctories
chance to be <U+017F>topp'd, that the</hi> Alkali <hi>has not room to pa<U+017F>s out, then there
is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And the matter of all our D<U+017F>tempers is the <U+017F>ame. And
whereas</hi> Acids <hi>are contrary to</hi> Alkalies <hi>(there being a conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them where-ever they meet) their being given in due proportion,
will le<U+017F><U+017F>en the matter of the Di<U+017F>temper, and in time, totally extirpate
it. Similia <U+017F>imilibus gaudent, &amp; contraria contrariis curantur.</hi> And I
am <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely confirm'd in the truth of my Hypothe<U+017F>is, that I
am <U+017F>ure it is not in the power of any one to overthrow it. Nay
the Hypothe<U+017F>is on which I build, I am <U+017F>ure is true. And I have in
all my Writings, Truth for my Guide: But the oppo<U+017F>ition I have
met with, hath been almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>upportable. Truth at its fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
never wants Oppo<U+017F>ers. But the New Doctrine I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
has gain'd <U+017F>o much Ground, that few Authors in their own
Life-time, have <U+017F>carce <U+017F>een the like. This unwonted and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Encouragement, has fill'd me with a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Gratitude,
to me inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible. Rea<U+017F>on is the true Touch-<U+017F>tone, by which
we ought to Examine every thing, and I have never advanc'd any
thing, till weigh'd in the Ballance of my be<U+017F>t Rea<U+017F>on, and yet, le<U+017F>t
Rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould deceive me, and I <U+017F>o impo<U+017F>e on the World; I have
always join'd Experience to it; <U+017F>o both being conjoin'd, I could
not well deceive my <U+017F>elf, nor lead others into Error. That
Prodigy of Nature. Mrs. <hi>Anne Baynard,</hi> <U+017F>aid in my hearing, that,
<hi>Rea<U+017F>on was that Eternal Standard God Almighty, as a Ray of his own
Image has impre<U+017F>s'd upon Man, to the election, or di<U+017F>like of what may
hurt, or <U+017F>uccour him; and where this is rais'd and improv'd, makes
him an Angel, where <U+017F>unk and depre<U+017F>s'd, a groveling Brute.</hi>

               <p>I find your Confidence, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> as great as I have heard
it reported, which is no Argument to me, that you are in the right;
Confidence and Ignorance being u<U+017F>ually Companions: And I am
the more per<U+017F>waded it may be in the power, of <U+017F>ome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to overthrow your Hypothe<U+017F>is. If you were <U+017F>ure of the
truth of it, I confe<U+017F>s, it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible it <U+017F>hould be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true:
But I <U+017F>upop<U+017F>e you only fancy your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ure. That you
have Truth for your Guide, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e (if you know what you <U+017F>ay)
you mean, you have <U+017F>ome certain Truths, as Rules to guide you to
the invention of others: But perhaps, you may as other fallible
Men, take <U+017F>ome things for Truths that are not true, or not know
how to u<U+017F>e them as Rules, if they are <U+017F>o. What oppo<U+017F>ition you
have met with I know not, it <U+017F>eems it was what you could hardly
bear, I doubt you have thereby confe<U+017F>s'd, your <U+017F>trength to be but
weak. Why Truth <U+017F>hould always have Oppo<U+017F>ers at fir<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>ee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59081:4"/>
not, unle<U+017F>s when it is not clearly demon<U+017F>trated, as your Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is
(to let you <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it true) is not, as you will go near to find,
before we have done. And as for the ground, you <U+017F>ay your new
Doctrine has gain'd in your (but yet <U+017F>hort) life-time, beyond the
Inventions of other Authors, which <U+017F>o <U+017F>urfeits your Heart with
Joy, I think no body el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ees it; for I could never yet meet with
any one Ingenious Man of your Opinion. And if any few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
<hi>Tyros,</hi> or Per<U+017F>on not <U+017F>tudious of Nature, have been plea<U+017F>ed
with your Fancies, I believe, if they will but u<U+017F>e their Rea<U+017F>on,
which you <U+017F>ay is <hi>the Touch<U+017F>tone of Truth, by which we are to examine
all things;</hi> they will find Rea<U+017F>on to alter their Opinion, and find
their Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Acid</hi>'s be<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on was but a fal<U+017F>e ballance, and did
indeed deceive him, and that his experience was but mi<U+017F>taken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and <U+017F>o impos'd upon the Ma<U+017F>ter, and Scholars too.
But that Rea<U+017F>on is an eternal Standard, I do not <U+017F>ee; tho' the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Mrs. <hi>Ann Baynard</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o: I rather think her and you, too
prodigious Metaphy<U+017F>itians; For I take Rea<U+017F>on to be peculiar to
Creatures, and that Creatures and whatever belongs to them are
not Eternal, unle<U+017F>s in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, as an ignorant pretender in
Phy<U+017F>ick in the <hi>Beaux</hi> Language, would be call'd an eternal <hi>Quack.</hi>
Neither can I <U+017F>ee by any of your rea<U+017F>onings Rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o improved
in your <U+017F>elf, as to give any body any ground to take you for an
Angel. Mrs. <hi>Ann Baynard</hi> might be a great Wit for ought I know,
and Wit and Beauty in a Woman, might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly make a young<U+017F>ter
mi<U+017F>take her even for a Godde<U+017F>s, and to be <U+017F>aid to be Witty and
Pretty would plea<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t Women, and by plea<U+017F>ing the Women, a
Doctor may be likely to meet with an Angel <U+017F>ometimes you know

               <p>The Doctrine I have advanced is <U+017F>o directly contrary to
every thing that has been wrote yet, it is enough to <U+017F>tartle
any young Man, nay <U+017F>ome old ones too; but I have <U+017F>o enquir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as to be altogether certain of the Truth of my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is,
but not <U+017F>o as to make People Immortal, which I believe
<U+017F>ome expect from me: But let People lay a<U+017F>ide prejudice and <U+017F>et
them<U+017F>elves to make Experiments, I am <U+017F>ure they will lay a<U+017F>ide
their old Notions, and embrace my new Hypothe<U+017F>is, and I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
certain that my new Doctrine of <hi>Acids</hi> at pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o much
decry'd, will <U+017F>oon obtain the publick vogue, carrying a <U+017F>elf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
along with it, and <U+017F>ome People will be <U+017F>o enamour'd with
it, as to u<U+017F>e <hi>Acids</hi> with as much rea<U+017F>on, as others now u<U+017F>e the
<hi>Cortex;</hi> which has been brought <U+017F>o extravagantly in vogue, that
<U+017F>ome u<U+017F>e it in all Di<U+017F>tempers, and I believe it will in time, be put
into Pla<U+017F>ters to Cure Corns. By this may be <U+017F>een the in<U+017F>tability
of Humane Nature that is more govern'd by Fancies than by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59081:5"/>
<U+017F>o that what is to day condemn'd is to morrow in great
value. But the Doctrine of <hi>Acids</hi> being a thing of Univer<U+017F>al extent,
it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any one <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>chief with them, as
with the <hi>Cortex.</hi>

               <p>If your Doctrine is directly contrary to every thing yet
wrote, it is very likely to be contrary to Truth; for doubtle<U+017F>s there
has been <U+017F>ome Truth wrote before. But I am not at all <U+017F>tartled
at your Doctrine Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' I confe<U+017F>s, I am neither very young,
nor old. What a Novice, or an Old Dotard may be, I know not;
but if any thing be <U+017F>tartling, it is your Impudence, which indeed
<U+017F>eems Mon<U+017F>trous: That a <hi>Mu<U+017F>hroom</hi> in Phy<U+017F>ick <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
oppo<U+017F>e all that has been yet wrote by all the Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
of all Ages, and pretend to have <U+017F>o enquir'd into Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
<U+017F>ince Ye<U+017F>terday, as to be certain that the long Study and Practice
of all other Men gave them nothing but mi<U+017F>takes; but your little
time has produced ab<U+017F>olute certainty. But truly, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Opinion of your <U+017F>elf, I dare <U+017F>ay no body expects Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
from you. As for prejudice, you would have us lay a<U+017F>ide, I
believe I laid it a<U+017F>ide, for <U+017F>ome time before you began with the
<U+017F>tudy of Pharmacy, and have ever <U+017F>ince made Experiments, and
I believe, have had more opportunity, as well as time, to carry
on a cour<U+017F>e of experimental Philo<U+017F>ophy, than your <U+017F>elf; (not to
di<U+017F>parage you) yet I cannot lay a<U+017F>ide all my Notions thereby got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and embrace your new Hypothe<U+017F>is. Your moral Certainty
that it will obtain the Publick Vogue, is no better than to <U+017F>ay, an
uncertain certainty. Nor is your Doctrine <U+017F>elf-evident to any but
Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s own <U+017F>harp <U+017F>elf; who<U+017F>e Eyes perhaps are Micro<U+017F>copes
in compari<U+017F>on to other Mens. But there is no fear, People will
be enamoured with your Hypothe<U+017F>is it has <U+017F>o <U+017F>oure a Countenance.
But the in<U+017F>tability of Humane Nature, (I confe<U+017F>s) is <U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>ome
other Men are <U+017F>o much govern'd by Fancies as well as you, that
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <hi>Acids</hi> may be u<U+017F>ed with the like rea<U+017F>on, and extravagance
as <U+017F>ome have u<U+017F>ed the <hi>Cortex;</hi> but they will hardly mix them
with Plai<U+017F>ters. But tho' <hi>Alkalies</hi> <U+017F>hould be to day wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
perhaps they may be to morrow in as great value as ever.
And if it be not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to do <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>chief with <hi>Acids,</hi> as
with the <hi>Cortex;</hi> yet I believe, <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons may find enough done
with them to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade us from u<U+017F>ing them as you would have us:
But I am certain, a confident Empirick may do a great deal of mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
with <hi>Acids, Alkalies, Cortex,</hi> or any thing.</p>

upon you as a Per<U+017F>on of great Impudence, to accu<U+017F>e all the World
of Learned PHYSITIANS as Fools, or what is wor<U+017F>e, as Knaves,
and uncommon Arrogancy to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert your <U+017F>elf the only Wi<U+017F>e, yea

<U+017F>elfi<U+017F>h in you, but to leave a Name to Po<U+017F>terity. Truly methinks,
you are as <U+017F>elfi<U+017F>h as any body: But as for a a Name to Po<U+017F>terity,
it's pity you <U+017F>hould want it, I'll help you, that you may be <U+017F>ure
to have it, and not for nothing. I wi<U+017F>h you could have written
in <hi>Latin,</hi> that all the World might have known you. Tho' you
<U+017F>ay, you want Univer<U+017F>ity-Glo<U+017F><U+017F>es, you are Rhetorical enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Sir; for you have abundance of Hyperboles, nor want you
other choi<U+017F>e Foiles to <U+017F>et off your Diamonds, nor are your Truths
naked, but <U+017F>o dre<U+017F>s'd up (if you have any) that I cannot <U+017F>ee the

Poor young Man: but it may be hoped you will grow <U+017F>tronger.
But you have had extraordinary Helps, con<U+017F>tant Succe<U+017F>s, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Providence has got you Friends, and <U+017F>upported you
again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many Enemies, all the Chirurgeons in the World, and

               <p>In all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, Phy<U+017F>icians have unanimou<U+017F>ly agreed, that
<hi>Acids</hi> have abounded; and if to <U+017F>uch a Degree, that their <hi>Alkalies</hi>
could not conquer it, then the Patient Dy'd. And as for <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Medicines, I dare be po<U+017F>itive, they never yet Cured any one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper;
but frequently have done a great deal of mi<U+017F>chief. If
any ever receiv'd any advantage by them, I dare be burnt. If they
be given in acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and Nature be <U+017F>trong, <U+017F>he throws off
the load in <U+017F>pight of them; if weak, they add to the load, and
<U+017F>he falls under it. In Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as the <hi>Gout,</hi> poor

Phy<U+017F>icians, Cur'd Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es? I an<U+017F>wer, I own they have Cur'd
<U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, but they could never tell how: They have given
<hi>Steel, Antimony,</hi> and other Preparations, without enquiring into
the nature of them, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing them <hi>Alkalies;</hi> when they at the

               <p>Truly <hi>John,</hi> your Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e begins to grow nau<U+017F>eous: You
are not yet Forty Years old, and could you have <U+017F>pent Thirty of
them in reading the Writings of Phy<U+017F>icians, you could not have
read the Tenth part of what they have Writ, much le<U+017F>s have
known, what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s they always had in their Practice. And as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itive
as you are, I believe, I <U+017F>hall give you matter of Fact, as well
as Rea<U+017F>on, enough to convince any mode<U+017F>t Man, that Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
have been Cur'd by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and when you are convinc'd, I would
coun<U+017F>el you, to burn your Books, rather than your <U+017F>elf, as dareing
as you are. And for <U+017F>hame forbear to accu<U+017F>e all Phy<U+017F>icians at this
rate, either never to have Cur'd Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or now and then to have
done it ignorantly, they knew not how, by giving <hi>Acids</hi> at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
Do you think others have not took as much pains to know
the nature of <hi>Antimony, Steel,</hi> and Vegetable Productions as you?
Had none of them any way to know <hi>Acids</hi> from <hi>Alkalies? Van

de<U+017F>ign, is to undeceive Young Phy<U+017F>icians, who have been impos'd

who have broach'd the Chymera's of their own Brain, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

de<U+017F>ign being, not to Reflect upon that <hi>Noble Society</hi> the <hi>College,</hi> the

               <p>Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you do not know what all Foreigners have done,
neither do they de<U+017F>erve your reproach more than the Phy<U+017F>icians
of our own Nation, or are they le<U+017F>s Men: You cannot well be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that <U+017F>ome of the College you applaud <U+017F>o, are Foreigners,
and as de<U+017F>erving as any of the re<U+017F>t. Nor have Foreigners impos'd
on Young Phy<U+017F>icians, more than tho<U+017F>e of our own Nation, nor
have they been always Men more full of Chymera's, or le<U+017F>s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Experiments; as every one acquainted with the
Medical World mu<U+017F>t acknowledg. Nor was Young Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> the
fitte<U+017F>t Man to undeceive Young Phy<U+017F>icians; he <U+017F>hould have left it
to Older Heads, or have <U+017F>tay'd a little longer. Was there none of
the Fathers of the <hi>Noble Society,</hi> whom after you had abu<U+017F>ed in

the Vertue of <hi>Acids?</hi> Or, none of them <U+017F>o kind as to
undeceive the Young<U+017F>ters, that they left it to you? Or, had none
of them <U+017F>uch a Capacity to Write as Mr. <hi>Acid?</hi> I mu<U+017F>t tell you
truly Sir, you are no Credit to them, of what profit <U+017F>oever you
may be, notwith<U+017F>tanding your Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing Reverence and Re<U+017F>pect
for them. But I believe, after all your bouncing of a New Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is,
we <U+017F>hall find, that Phy<U+017F>icians have u<U+017F>ed <hi>Acids,</hi> knowing them
to be <U+017F>uch, long before you were Born; thinking rightly, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Acids</hi> nor <hi>Alkalies</hi> alone Cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; but a Phy<U+017F>ician u<U+017F>ing
them all with other things, when, and where he <U+017F>ees occa<U+017F>ion.
And to convince you, and <U+017F>hew you how apt you are to contradict
your <U+017F>elf, <hi>(your Memory as you have <U+017F>ometime confe<U+017F>s'd, being a very

your Principles, has not been great I grant; for your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
has been little. Yet <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I am confident, you have
had; for your Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>mell pretty <U+017F>trong of Dr. <hi>Andre,</hi> of <hi>Acid,</hi>
and <hi>Alkali</hi> Publi<U+017F>hed in Engli<U+017F>h, 1689. But when you <U+017F>ay, you
have taken as much true pains to inform your <U+017F>elf in all parts of
Phy<U+017F>ick as any ever did, you cannot be excu<U+017F>ed of Arrogancy;
for we well know, you neither have had the Years, Abilities nor
Opportunity many have had. Be<U+017F>ides you are <U+017F>o extraordinarily
accompli<U+017F>h'd in that one Qualification of a Doctor of Phy<U+017F>ick fa<U+017F>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Language, that it mu<U+017F>t needs have taken up much of your
time to acquire it, and hinder your learning other parts of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But as for your <U+017F>pending as much Money, as mo<U+017F>t who
have been bred at Univer<U+017F>ities, we know very well you never had
it to <U+017F>pend. But why could not Univer<U+017F>ity-Men have Ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>tration
for their Money as well as you: Or, How come they
to be confin'd to the fu<U+017F>ty Notions of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle?</hi> for want of other
Books? I hope you will <U+017F>upply them with fre<U+017F>h Notions for the

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59081:8"/>
behalf of your Hypothe<U+017F>is, that is if it were to be made probable.
Here you are in the right, and I <U+017F>hould have perceiv'd it, if you
had not told me <U+017F>o. And I grant you believe, or would have us
think your Hypothe<U+017F>is is the be<U+017F>t, and cleare<U+017F>t in Phy<U+017F>ick now
extant to all intents and purpo<U+017F>es, and you have <U+017F>aid as much as
this comes to over and over. 'Twas a thou<U+017F>and pities <hi>you were

your <hi>Treacherous Memory</hi> <U+017F>o far fail'd you, as to let you <U+017F>ay,
<hi>you did not pretend to be <U+017F>ole Author, or fir<U+017F>t broacher of the Doctrine

as</hi> Helmont, Paracel<U+017F>us, <hi>&amp;c. who treading out of the common Path,

and admires your Capacity in promoting Medicine, claps you on the
Back, and bids you de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e your Carpers; But the fourth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
them all, and <U+017F>ings you too. I wonder no body did it <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for you are a Subject enough to in<U+017F>pire the dulle<U+017F>t Mu<U+017F>e: But
the Poet might have let us have had his name at length, <U+017F>ure he
needed not to have been <U+017F>hie of owning his Opinion of you any
more than the other Gentlemen; Be<U+017F>ides he might perhaps have
prevented our mi<U+017F>taking him: For I cannot be per<U+017F>waded but
that it was <hi>John Colbatch Junior,</hi> that was the Poet, however I
am <U+017F>ure that <hi>John Calbatch Junior,</hi> cau<U+017F>ed it to be printed in his
Book, and had he not been a <hi>Junior</hi> it had never been there. To
the Unknown Dr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is a very odd Epithet on <U+017F>o Famous an
Author, it cannot <U+017F>ure be an Ironie, but hold; <hi>John Colbatch</hi> Jun.
may be very well thought to be unknown to him<U+017F>elf, otherwi<U+017F>e he
could never have Publi<U+017F>hed his own Prai<U+017F>es at <U+017F>o extravagant a rate.
As for his Poetry I <U+017F>ay, in <U+017F>hort it is Poetry, and it is well it is <U+017F>o;
for nothing but <hi>Poetica licentia</hi> can excu<U+017F>e it, it being all fiction:
And perhaps for this rea<U+017F>on <hi>Tom Saffold</hi> cho<U+017F>e to Publi<U+017F>h his Bills

mention the Famous <hi>Tom Saffold,</hi> it brings into my mind what a
Friend of Mr. <hi>Acids,</hi> who <U+017F>aw what <hi>J. C.</hi> Junior had written

                     <l>Defac'd the Monument of <hi>Saffold</hi>'s Name:</l>
                     <l>Believe him, or his Friend, he merits more</l>

judg <U+017F>uch a one has made a large <U+017F>tep towards being a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ician.
1. An Apothecary mu<U+017F>t have good acquaintance with the
Vegetable Kingdom, not only to know the Faces of Plants; but
their Natures and manners of Operation on Humane Bodies.
2. He mu<U+017F>t well under<U+017F>tand the Nature and Operation of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Metals, which is not to be attain'd without much Reading
and hard labour in the fire, and 3. of Animal Bodies, among<U+017F>t
which is Man, there being <U+017F>carce a part of his whole Body, but
what is <U+017F>ometime or other to be u<U+017F>ed as a Medicine; but fir<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Apothecaries Skill for its Preparation. The famous

               <p>One might have gue<U+017F>s'd you to be an Apothecary, if you
had never told us <U+017F>o, you talk <U+017F>o like an Apothecary: But I
am <U+017F>orry you had no better a Ma<U+017F>ter; it had been well you had
met with one that could have taught you a little good Manners;
for truly <hi>John,</hi> you <U+017F>hew none in publi<U+017F>hing your Ma<U+017F>ter's imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
But pray you, who taught you for that Four Years you
went <U+017F>o far beyond your Ma<U+017F>ter's Capacity, as to become a Ma<U+017F>ter
your <U+017F>elf in <hi>Pharmacy?</hi> Truly I can hardly believe you are a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
in <hi>Pharmacy</hi> yet. For tho' you call your <U+017F>elf a Doctor, I am
<U+017F>ure you talk as if you knew not what <hi>Pharmacy</hi> means, when
you tell us it is the foundation on which <hi>Phy<U+017F>ick</hi> is built. You
have look'd into the Body of Phy<U+017F>ick at a fine rate: But indeed,
you don't talk like an ab<U+017F>olute Ma<U+017F>ter, to tell us, That <hi>Pharmacy,</hi>
that is the making of Medicines, is the foundation on which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick,
that is Natural Knowledge, is built. Surely <hi>John,</hi> you never
read any In<U+017F>titutions, or if you did, what you read <U+017F>lip'd out of
your <hi>treacherous Memory;</hi> but it may be, you would <U+017F>peak with the
Vulgar, while you think with the Learned, and then the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of
it is, That the making of Medicines, is that upon which Medicine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is built. But if you would talk with the Doctors, they place Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick
or Phy<U+017F>iology in the fir<U+017F>t place, as the foundation, meaning
the con<U+017F>ideration of Nature it <U+017F>elf, in its <U+017F>ound <U+017F>tate, or due order.
Then <hi>Pathology,</hi> the account of its Defects. And thirdly, <hi>Semeiotice,</hi> the
con<U+017F>ideration of the events or i<U+017F><U+017F>ues of tho<U+017F>e Defects. Then <hi>Hygieine</hi>
which teaches to pre<U+017F>erve from tho<U+017F>e Defects, as much as my be.
And in the La<U+017F>t place, comes <hi>Therapuetice,</hi> the method of reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Defects of Nature, and the fitting the In<U+017F>truments for that
purpo<U+017F>e is <hi>Pharmacy:</hi> So that it is far from the foundation of the
Building. What Practice you built on your foundation of <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
I know not, or whether your dependance were on that Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.
You are very kind in giving us the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Qualifications of
an Apothecary, you are willing to inform the World, how fit a Man
Mr. Apothecary would be thought to be to make a Doctor of. But
by your Ma<U+017F>ter<U+017F>hip you <U+017F>hew in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and your acquaintance
with <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> I believe before we have done, it will appear,
you have not made that large <U+017F>tride an expert Apothecary has took
towards being a good Phy<U+017F>ician: But I <U+017F>hall remark here only, what
acquaintance you have with Animals; e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch an one as
your <U+017F>elf, of which you <U+017F>ay, There is <U+017F>carce a part but is <U+017F>ometime
or other to be u<U+017F>ed as a Medicine. I believe your Brains would
make an excellent one, but they would hardly yeild one Grain of
<U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s in Di<U+017F>tillation. And as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, you would not u<U+017F>e

Man's fle<U+017F>h crude (except in <U+017F>ome few Di<U+017F>tempers of Women)
becau<U+017F>e you <U+017F>ay it ought to be prepar'd: If the Fire mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed,
it will produce <hi>Alkalies</hi> copiou<U+017F>ly from both fluids and <U+017F>olid parts
of Man's Body; and <hi>Alkalies</hi> acording to your Hypothe<U+017F>is are the
principle of Death and corruption; and yet all parts of Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are <U+017F>ometimes to be prepar'd for a Mediaine. You forget your
<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o oft <hi>John,</hi> I am a<U+017F>ham'd of you. The famous <hi>Etmulier</hi> was a

<hi>Acids</hi> the cau<U+017F>e of many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: How comes he in <U+017F>o much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

his <hi>Fraud or Ignorance;</hi> but you forgive him I <U+017F>ee for <U+017F>ake, <U+017F>ake;
that is, he was an Apothecary, and yeilds you an Argument for

               <p>I wrote my E<U+017F><U+017F>ay of <hi>Alkalies</hi> and <hi>Acids,</hi> during the Siege of
<hi>Namur,</hi> when I had not the opportunity of con<U+017F>ulting Books, nor
the benefit of coming at my own Papers, wherein I had <U+017F>et down
my Ob<U+017F>ervations; wherefore, I only made u<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e occur'd to
my Memory, which is a very taeacherous one, <U+017F>o they are not
<U+017F>o numerous and exact as I de<U+017F>ign'd them; but yet I was willing
to venture them abroad as they were, for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not in the lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign'd to entertain the Learned, but to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

to that (which I will never re<U+017F>t till I have done) I care not.
If we could have a publick Laboratory at the Nation's Expence I
<U+017F>hould hope to <U+017F>ee the matter <U+017F>ooner effected. It co<U+017F>ts the Nation

               <p>I think it had been well Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> you had let alone Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
till you could have con<U+017F>ulted Books, as well as your own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that you might have help'd your <hi>Memory</hi> (which you now
confe<U+017F>s to be <hi>a very treacherous one,</hi> and <U+017F>o <U+017F>hew, I have not abus'd
you) for truly your Ob<U+017F>ervations are not <U+017F>o exact as they <U+017F>hould be.
But you had Rea<U+017F>ons to venture them abroad, not to entertain the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59081:11"/>
Learned; but to undeceive the Multitude. What's the meaning
of this Sir, who are the Learned? The <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>eyd</hi> Doctors <U+017F>uch as your
<U+017F>elf, Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wat<U+017F>on,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baynard?</hi> &amp;c. And are all the re<U+017F>t the
Multitude? Tho<U+017F>e perhaps whom you call <hi>Young Phy<U+017F>icians,</hi> tho' for
Years they may be Old Men. Or, do you mean by the Learned, all
Phy<U+017F>icians, and by the Multitude all other Men who under<U+017F>tand no
thing of Phy<U+017F>ick. The<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t you rather <U+017F>eem to mean: But
what do you Write to teach them Phy<U+017F>ick? What will become of
the Doctors then? There is Vinegar, Crab-Verjuice, Lemons and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges
enuough to be had and you tell them, <hi>They can never over Do<U+017F>e
it, for the Stomach wont fail to reject whatever is to much, and the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is but a puke or two:</hi> We <U+017F>hall have them all turn Doctors,
your method is <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie. But by undeceiving them, I rather <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
you mean you would convince them that the <hi>Alkali</hi>-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
are dangerous fellows, or at be<U+017F>t good for nothing; that they
may Employ you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> and your Di<U+017F>ciples, if you have any:
There's the knack of it; and I confe<U+017F>s, there needs not much
exactne<U+017F>s in putting our Bills to invite tho<U+017F>e that know nothing of
Nature, or good Sen<U+017F>e; and this con<U+017F>ideration makes me inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to fancy, you may be as <U+017F>harp a Fellow in Politicks as <hi>Tom.
Saffold,</hi> who once <U+017F>hew'd him<U+017F>elf more Knave then Fool, when
being told, his Bills were Non-<U+017F>en<U+017F>e; He wittily reply'd, he Liv'd
not by Men of Sen<U+017F>e. And I confe<U+017F>s Fools are <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t caught.
I applaud you for aiming at Certainty; but if you mean Certainty
in Phy<U+017F>ick, and will never re<U+017F>t till you arrive to it; I think, I
may ptomi<U+017F>e the World a perpetual motion on your Credit. A
Publick Laboratory at the Nation's Expence, would be a brave
thing (but that would never make you an infallible Doctor, tho'
you were the Director of it) and a Thou<U+017F>and a Year; yea, Ten
Thou<U+017F>and would be better <U+017F>pent in <U+017F>uch a De<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>ave Mens
Lives, than <U+017F>ome Hundreds of Thou<U+017F>ands to de<U+017F>troy Mankind.
But methinks Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you give the Nation a hard Complement,
aud e<U+017F>pecially His Maje<U+017F>ty the Supreme Director of our Expences,
to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o much Money is <U+017F>pent to de<U+017F>troy Mankind. I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
any <U+017F>uch wicked De<U+017F>ign; but that you abu<U+017F>e both King and
People. But we have a Noble Laboratory to our wi<U+017F>h at the
College, the fitte<U+017F>t place for <U+017F>uch a thing. But <hi>John,</hi> you do not
only be<U+017F>patter every body el<U+017F>e, but you di<U+017F>grace the College too,
by begging Money to buy them Coals and Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, as if they were
either not able to defray the Charges of the de<U+017F>ign them<U+017F>elves,
or <U+017F>o covetous they would not, unle<U+017F>s the People give Money
to in<U+017F>truct them in their Art, as well as pay their Fees for the
effects of it. What the Governing Officers are as to tru<U+017F>t, and
Publick Spirit, I <U+017F>hall leave to tho<U+017F>e that be<U+017F>t know them. But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59081:11"/>
indeed <hi>John</hi> I have no hope that tho<U+017F>e Men who under<U+017F>tand Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy
enough already, will ever be eager in the de<U+017F>ign you
talk of, either with their own, or others Money; and <U+017F>ubmit it
to your teachings: I could never find them <U+017F>o <U+017F>olicitous about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructing
young Phy<U+017F>icians as your <U+017F>elf Sir; but if they were, I
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>till fear a publick Laboratory, as you would direct it,
would rather be a publick Pe<U+017F>t, than a publick Benefit; there
would be <U+017F>o much Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and other <U+017F>harp
Corro<U+017F>ives made, and given to the Sick, as would de<U+017F>troy ten to
one more than Powder and Ball do's: When not one in ten but
<U+017F>ometimes may want a Doctor; but not one in ten thou<U+017F>and go's to
the Wars: And the<U+017F>e things would be <U+017F>o much more dangerous;
becau<U+017F>e (like White-Powder) they would do execution, without
giving a report. For <hi>John</hi> I mu<U+017F>t tell you, I <U+017F>till believe, that
<hi>Acids</hi>-may be the Cau<U+017F>e of many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; e<U+017F>pecially in the Hand
of a four Hypothetick: And <hi>Alkalies</hi> may in many ca<U+017F>es be very
good Medicines: And this will go near to be my Opinion, till you
have convinc'd me by good Rea<U+017F>ons, grounded on <U+017F>ufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
that your new Hypothe<U+017F>is is any more, than a new
Method of Quacking.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>Every Man may be capable of judging, whether my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe<U+017F>is
is true or fal<U+017F>e, from this ea<U+017F>ie Method. Every Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's
Boy knows that all <hi>Acids</hi> pour'd on Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> or a
<U+017F>olution of it, will turn in Red, and as the <hi>Acid</hi> is <U+017F>tronger, or
weaker, <U+017F>o will the Red colour be: So on the other hand, all
manife<U+017F>t <hi>Alkalies,</hi> lixivious or Volatile will turn the Syrup Green,
and as the <hi>Alkali</hi> is <U+017F>tronger, or weaker, <U+017F>o will the Green Colour
be. Whence I infer if the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood did turn the Syrup Red,
it would be plain, that the <hi>Serum</hi> did abound with <hi>Acids;</hi> but if
on the other hand it turns the Syrup Green it is more, or
le<U+017F>s impregned with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles. I po<U+017F>itively a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, I
could never find the <hi>Serum</hi> turn the Syrup into any colour but
Green. All manife<U+017F>t <hi>Alkalies</hi> thus change the Syrup to a Green.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> If the <hi>Serum</hi> too do's <U+017F>o change it, it mu<U+017F>t needs abound
with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles. This is an ea<U+017F>ie way of Arguing, and
the plaine<U+017F>t Demon<U+017F>tration in the World. And no one that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
under the <hi>Gout,</hi> or any other Di<U+017F>temper Chronical, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
but will be glad to lo<U+017F>e two or three Ounces of Blood, to
make this Experiment, on which <U+017F>o much depends. Every Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
may thus rea<U+017F>on with him<U+017F>elf: My Phy<U+017F>ician tells me, my
Blood abounds with <hi>Acids,</hi> and upon that <U+017F>core, gives me <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
to correct them; but if he <U+017F>hould be mi<U+017F>taken, and my Blood
abound with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> his giving me <hi>Alkalies</hi> will encrea<U+017F>e the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper:
Therefore <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>o fair an opportunity, my own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59081:12"/>
Eyes <U+017F>hall be judg, what my Blood abounds with: Whether Dr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi>'s Enemies, being almo<U+017F>t all the World of Phy<U+017F>icians, or
he are to be blam'd. If my Blood abound with <hi>Acids,</hi> he ought
to be Kick'd out of the Common-Wealth; if on the other hand,
it abounds with <hi>Alkalies;</hi> he de<U+017F>erves all the Encouragement in
the World; for di<U+017F>covering <U+017F>o u<U+017F>eful and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary a Truth, and
thereby expo<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to the malice and rage of <U+017F>o many. This
Experiment is liable to no Objection, I know of; and by it I can
refer my <U+017F>elf to every Gentleman, and from Gentlemen, I <U+017F>hall
have Ju<U+017F>tice. Phy<U+017F>icians have endeavour'd to expo<U+017F>e me, becau<U+017F>e
owning me to in the be right; would be owning their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>takes:
But by this Experiment, I have appeal'd to more ju<U+017F>t Judges.</p>

               <p>You being to talk like a Philo<U+017F>opher, and a Logician too;
now Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> I hope, that I <U+017F>hall have <U+017F>ome Work, and that we
<U+017F>hall leave Playing: And I am very glad, I am capable of judging
of your Hypothe<U+017F>is, by your own conce<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ay, every
Man is <U+017F>o: And I hope, <U+017F>ome Men will be capable of judging
of what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay to it; tho' perhaps, every Apothecary's Boy
may not: For in <U+017F>ome places they do not teach them for the fir<U+017F>t
thing, the change of colours in Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> by <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
But I <U+017F>hall appeal to Phy<U+017F>icians, and Gentlemen too, if Men
of Sen<U+017F>e. Gentlemen you know, are many of them, troubled
with the <hi>Gout;</hi> and I remember you have told us, <hi>Tbat all that
are afflicted with the</hi> Gout, <hi>are Men of Sen<U+017F>e; for you never met with
one Block-head that was troubled with it.</hi> This is good Logick, could
we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, you had met with all the Men troubled with the
<hi>Gout.</hi> But I <U+017F>hall love <hi>Alkalies</hi> the better for this trick: For if
all that are troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> are Men of Sen<U+017F>e, and all that
are troubled with the <hi>Gout</hi> abound with <hi>Alkalies</hi> (as you have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd)
it looks <U+017F>omething like an Argument that Men abounding
with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> are Men of Sense; and then on the contrary, Men
abounding with <hi>Acids,</hi> are likely to be Block-heads; and I <U+017F>hould
always be afraid of an <hi>Acid</hi> Doctor, not only lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be an
A<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf, but lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould make me a Fool too, by de<U+017F>troying
the <hi>Alkali</hi> in my Blood; which gives me more happine<U+017F>s in a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
Under<U+017F>tanding, than infelicity in the <U+017F>ence of a Gouty Paroxy<U+017F>me.
But tho' I appeal to Gentlemen, as well as Phy<U+017F>icians; I <U+017F>hall not
like, you <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>grace my Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, Gentlemen
better Judges in Phy<U+017F>ical matters, than Phy<U+017F>ycians them<U+017F>elves:

who woulld be judg'd by his Clients, whether he pleaded Law, or

Ju<U+017F>t, than Gentlemen; however Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> or other Gentlemen
may take it: But a<U+017F><U+017F>ert their Education for the generality, in all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59081:12"/>
re<U+017F>pects equal to, if not exceeding Gentlemen; and if their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compl<U+017F>hments
in Phy<U+017F>ical Knowledge be not greater, it is a great
<U+017F>hame, and Gentlemen are unwi<U+017F>e in u<U+017F>ing them. But let us come
to the rea<U+017F>on of your Hypothe<U+017F>is. All <hi>Alkalies</hi> turn Syrup of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
Green, Tarbox the Blood abounds with Alkalous particles.
This is an ea<U+017F>ie way of argueing; but truly your Argument is far
from a Demon<U+017F>tration; you are out in your Logick here, and
have not prov'd the Point. For unle<U+017F>s you could have made a
regular Category, and have <U+017F>aid, Whatever turns Syrup of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
Green, is an <hi>Alkali.</hi> But <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood turns Syrup of
<hi>Violets</hi> Green; therefore it is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or abounds with <hi>Alkali:</hi>
and then have prov'd your Major: It will not follow, that
the <hi>Serum</hi> abounds with <hi>Alkali:</hi> For tho' all <hi>Alkalies</hi> will turn
Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green; yet it wants to be prov'd
that what<U+017F>oever turns it Green, is an <hi>Alkali, or that nothing but
Alkali will do <U+017F>o:</hi> Which I am <U+017F>ure, you will never be able to do,
but by denying <U+017F>ome of your a<U+017F><U+017F>ertions; as may appear before we
have done. But I grant, that the Blood abounds with <hi>Alkalous</hi>
particles; if by abounding, you mean only that it yields, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a great deal of <hi>Alkali,</hi> and not that it has always too much.
And what then Mr. <hi>Acid?</hi> You don't de<U+017F>erve all the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World for this nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Di<U+017F>covery; becau<U+017F>e truely,
it is none of your Di<U+017F>covery; being well known, long before you
were born, to your Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Helmont,</hi> and a great many more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Men; yea, I dare <U+017F>ay, all that at pre<U+017F>ent de<U+017F>erve the
Name of Phy<U+017F>icians, knew it before you ever <U+017F>aw Blood Di<U+017F>till'd,
or knew it would yield a Salt, or that Serum would turn Syrup
of <hi>Violets</hi> Green. But you have di<U+017F>cover'd one thing indeed, in a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erting
this your Di<U+017F>covery, that is your <U+017F>elf, unacquainted with the
World of Phy<U+017F>icians, or arrogant and fooli<U+017F>h in publi<U+017F>hing that, as
your Invention, which was generally known, long before you
knew any thing of Phy<U+017F>ick. And truly <hi>John,</hi> you de<U+017F>erve to be
laugh'd at and hi<U+017F>s'd, if not kick'd out of the Company of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians,
for this Di<U+017F>covery. But to the Argument, 'Tis true,
the Blood abounds with <hi>Alkali,</hi> whoever di<U+017F>cover'd the truth of
it. What then, do's it follow, that the Blood's abounding with
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> is the Cau<U+017F>e of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es? Not at all. For, if it
abound with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I <U+017F>ay, it <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o, as it naturally does
in Per<U+017F>ons mo<U+017F>t healthy; and it no way follows, that the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of that which ought to abound; is the Cau<U+017F>e of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es:
But the want of the due quantity of that which ought to abound;
or the abounding of that which <U+017F>hould not, or do's not naturally
abound, is much more likely to be the Cau<U+017F>e of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. It is
well known to tho<U+017F>e Phy<U+017F>icians who have (as they ought) been
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59081:13"/>
exercis'd in Experimental Phylo<U+017F>ophy, that Man's Body by a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechinal
Examination yields a great quantity of Volatile, Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Salt; but the quantity of it is much exceeded by the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts;
yea, even by one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Water, the abundance
of which, a Hypothetick Brain, might as well have fancy'd the
cau<U+017F>e, not only of a <hi>Drop<U+017F>y;</hi> but of all other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; there being
more of it to be carry'd off by Per<U+017F>piration, than of any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It is beyond all doubt, that the Particles con<U+017F>tituting the
Humane Frame, are of different Figures and Sizes, and have
their determinate Proportions, as to quantity; from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>e
the different appearances of the Parts in their Natural
Shapes and Con<U+017F>titutions; as al<U+017F>o the different qualities of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Products from one, and another of them. But for a Man
to <U+017F>ay, That the abounding of any one of the<U+017F>e (tho' by abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he mean one of them is too much in quantity) is the Cau<U+017F>e
of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; looks <U+017F>o unlike a Philo<U+017F>opher, or even a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Man, that I admire any one fond of a Reputation, <U+017F>hould be
guilty of <U+017F>uch a folly, as either to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert it, or believe it! It is
evident to all Men, that in any <U+017F>ort, <U+017F>tudy the Nature of Bodies,
that a due Proportion of the component Parts is requi<U+017F>ite to the
proper Con<U+017F>titution of a Compound Body. And if a Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
but of two <U+017F>orts of Particles: For in<U+017F>tance, <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
(<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing them them<U+017F>elves to be <U+017F>imple Bodies) in all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
as there ought to be a certain Proportion; the abounding of
one, as well as of the other, would make an undue Con<U+017F>titution,
or Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But the Body of Man, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not wholly of <hi>Acid</hi>
and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles; <U+017F>o that one of the<U+017F>e two mu<U+017F>t needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
to make a Di<U+017F>proportion; but of divers others, either
Natural Con<U+017F>tituents, or Artificial Products: And that it <U+017F>hould
be <U+017F>aid, that but one of the<U+017F>e can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly abound, is without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
colour of Rea<U+017F>on; when not only our Food, which encrea<U+017F>es
and maintains the bulk of our Bodies, is <U+017F>o different, abounding
now with one, then with another <U+017F>ort of Particles Homogeneous
to tho<U+017F>e our Bodies con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of; but al<U+017F>o the various Excrements
to be Ege<U+017F>ted, may be now one, then another retain'd, or too
ha<U+017F>tily carry'd off, and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e a di<U+017F>proportion; and what the
proportion ought to be between the<U+017F>e divers Particles, I doubt,
will be found a matter too hard for a better Philo<U+017F>opher than
Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> certainly to determine. Moreover, the Body of Man
is to be con<U+017F>ider'd as con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of <U+017F>olid and fluid Parts, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

threefold Divi<U+017F>ion; the fancy of <hi>Alkalies</hi> abounding to be the cau<U+017F>e

in<U+017F>ufficient. In the <U+017F>olid Parts, there is to be con<U+017F>ider'd, their
undue Conformation; too little, or too great, too narrow, or too
wide in proportion to one another; and <U+017F>o their unequal <U+017F>trength,

acknowledge as a Truth) That there is no Being we have any

and their Cure in Humane Nature.</hi> But to return to the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in
Hand, It is apparent, that the exorbitant De<U+017F>ire or violent action of
the Will of Man; is that which often produces <U+017F>uch an alteration
in his Body, as when perceiv'd becomes a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. For in<U+017F>tance,
the Blood is too much retarded, or accelarated in its cour<U+017F>e, as
well as the more <U+017F>ubtile Liquors variou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>ordered; from
whence proceed divers ill Effects, which cannot be thought to
proceed from the Production of too much <hi>Alkali,</hi> or retarding its
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Evacuation in a Moment. The un<U+017F>atisfy'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
in its mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>udden Di<U+017F>appointments, cannot be thought to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59081:14"/>
<U+017F>o great a Chymi<U+017F>t, as to produce in an in<U+017F>tant a greater quantiyt
of <hi>Alkali</hi> Salt than the Body can bear, or <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon <U+017F>eparate the
<hi>Acid</hi> that <U+017F>hould attemper it; but is rather to be thought, to
produce its Effects in a more <U+017F>ubtil way. The force of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
and De<U+017F>ire upon the Body, is very well known, tho' the
way of working tho<U+017F>e various Effects is little under<U+017F>tood: But I
<U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider it no farther here, than in relation to <hi>Alkali,</hi> which
is with no colour of Rea<U+017F>on to be thought either the Cau<U+017F>e of
tho<U+017F>e Mental Di<U+017F>order, or the in<U+017F>trument of the Effects produc'd
thereby. But to come a little clo<U+017F>er to the Term of abounding
either of <hi>Alkali</hi> or <hi>Acid,</hi> in the liquid or <U+017F>olid Parts: When may
either be <U+017F>aid to abound, <U+017F>o as to be likely to be the Cau<U+017F>e of a
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e? I an<U+017F>wer, When there is too much of the one or the
other. And how <U+017F>hall we know that? May Gentlemen <U+017F>ay (for
we will appeal to Gentlemen; yea, and Ladies too, if they will
Read us: Poor Men and Phy<U+017F>icians we <U+017F>hall get but little by;
tho' they <U+017F>hould think us Skilful Doctors.) I mu<U+017F>t tell you, Sirs
and Madams, there ought to be <U+017F>ome Con<U+017F>ideration of the due
Proportion, before we talk of abounding; and it is certain, That
there is abundantly more <hi>Alkali</hi> in, or produc'd from the Blood
and other Parts of Man's Body than <hi>Acid,</hi> and ought to be <U+017F>o in a
<U+017F>ound Man, as we have <U+017F>een Demon<U+017F>trated by abundance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.
The proportion of <hi>Alkali</hi> to <hi>Acid,</hi> we need not
<U+017F>cruple to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, no le<U+017F>s than as twenty to one, when we have
found the <hi>Alkali</hi> to the <hi>Sal<U+017F>um</hi> as <U+017F>eventeen to one: But we will
not pretend to a<U+017F>certain the Proportions; it being a very difficult
matter to find them. But we will <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, twenty to one, or but
ten to one if you plea<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>hew you that your Doctor <hi>John</hi>
has talk'd like an A<U+017F>s-ey'd Doctor to you. For if there ought to
be but one part of <hi>Acid</hi> to ten of <hi>Alkali,</hi> and there be ju<U+017F>t that
proportion; neither can be <U+017F>aid to abound, or thought to cau<U+017F>e
a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: But if there be two, or more parts of <hi>Acid</hi> to ten of
<hi>Alkali,</hi> the <hi>Acid</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>aid to abound, or be too much, not the
<hi>Alkali.</hi> And as for the little Trick <hi>John</hi> has <U+017F>hew'd you with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of <hi>Violets,</hi> at the expence of two or three Ounces of your
Blood (which in <U+017F>ome Ca<U+017F>es ought not to be <U+017F>par'd.) I think, I
<U+017F>hould undervalue your Parts, if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, you can't <U+017F>ee
thro' the Juggle and make an Objection, where your Doctor <U+017F>ays
he can <U+017F>ee none. For tho' <hi>Acid</hi> greatly abound, or be a deal too
much; yet the <hi>Serum</hi> will not turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Red, unle<U+017F>s
there were more <hi>Acid</hi> then <hi>Alkali.</hi> And <U+017F>uch a quantity of <hi>Acid</hi>
(if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, in a Living Humane Body) would be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper
too great, for either an <hi>Acid</hi> or an <hi>Alkali</hi>-Doctor ever to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59081:14"/>
reduce. And that you may <U+017F>atisfie your own Eyes, and judge
whether Doctor <hi>Acid,</hi> or all the Phy<U+017F>icians in the World, ought to
be Kick'd out of the Common-wealth; without the trouble, and
<U+017F>ometimes hazard of lo<U+017F>ing two, or three Ounces of your Blood.
Take Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> and drop into it a quantity of an Alkalous
Spirit: and you will find it pre<U+017F>ently turn Green, and then take an
<hi>Acid,</hi> and drop but a little in, and you <U+017F>hall not find it turn Red;
but drop in till you have over-power'd the <hi>Alkali,</hi> it will turn
Red; then drop in again of the <hi>Alkali,</hi> and as <U+017F>oon as you have
over-power'd the <hi>Acid,</hi> it will turn Green again. By this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
you may be rationally per<U+017F>waded, there may be too much
<hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood, and <U+017F>o enough to cau<U+017F>e a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; tho' the
Blood does not contain more <hi>Acid</hi> than <hi>Alkali;</hi> and <U+017F>o turn the
Syrup Red. And that there may not be too much <hi>Alkali,</hi> tho'
there is enough to turn the Syrup Greeen.</p>

               <p>The Phy<U+017F>icians of our own Age, more particularly of our
Nation, and among them (mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>pecially of our College) have
made greater Di<U+017F>coveries in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts, than
ever were made before; but as for the fluids, wherein the Cau<U+017F>e and
Seat of Di<U+017F>eases lurk, they have in a great mea<U+017F>ure been neglected:
But the College abounds with Men of <U+017F>uch large Capacities, that if
once they <U+017F>et about the Work, I doubt not, but they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it. Being Skill'd in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts. A Noble
Qualification! Enables a Man to talk finely; but do's not in the
lea<U+017F>t enable him to Cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. For it's an exact skill in the
Anatomy of the Juices, that makes a Man a good Phy<U+017F>ician. And
I have made it the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of my Life, to under<U+017F>tand rightly the
the Juices of Humane Bodies in their Natural and Morbid States;
and by that means have been capable of doing more than other
People; and I tell you, that the Blood has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in it;
but when People are in a perfect <U+017F>tate of Health: Nay, I tell you,
the Blood can't over-abound with <hi>Acids,</hi> neither in a Morbid nor
Healthy State: For tho' manife<U+017F>t <hi>Acids,</hi> are things the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
much more covets and delights in, than any thing be<U+017F>ides:
When <U+017F>he is loaded with more than the Body has occa<U+017F>ion for,
<U+017F>he won't fail of rejecting them by Vomit; which may be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
by an over large Draught of Vinegar; but altho it can't
over-doe; yet it is very defective in conveying a <U+017F>ufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
into it, thro' its own fault, or the Phy<U+017F>icians. But the Blood
of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed Per<U+017F>ons has more <hi>Alkali,</hi> than that of the Healthy;
as in Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> it abounds with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles, more than
in Health as <U+017F>ix to four, or five and a half, or as five to four; which
you will find in my Book of Blood, where my Experiments are as
clear Demon<U+017F>trations of my Hypothe<U+017F>is, as what is given by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59081:15"/>
Mathematicians. So in the Small-Pox and in Scorbutick Per<U+017F>ons
it does appear by many Tryals, that the Blood of <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>ons
does more abound with Alkalous Particles, than that of <U+017F>ound
People, and a Sick Per<U+017F>on's <hi>Serum</hi> will turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green
<U+017F>ooner than a well Per<U+017F>on's. And if Phy<U+017F>icians would Critically
Analize the Blood in all Di<U+017F>tempers, I believe, thereby the Cau<U+017F>e
of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es would be certainly known.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you are very lavi<U+017F>h of your prai<U+017F>es where you
place your favour; I wonder the College who have <U+017F>o great a
<U+017F>hare of them, are not <U+017F>ufeited. They have made more Di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts, you <U+017F>ay, than ever was
made before. What Di<U+017F>coveries have they made I pray you?
Wherein have they out-done others, either of the foregoing Age,
or Foreigners of this? What improvements have they made in the
Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts? You know perhaps, but you won't
tell us: and 'tis no matter, whether it be any thing or nothing.
For being skil'd in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts is <hi>a Noble Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
you <U+017F>ay: But how do's it Ennoble a Man? Why, onely
enables him to talk finely; but do's not in the lea<U+017F>t enable him
to Cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. It is an exact Skill in the Anatomy of the Juices,
that makes a Man a good Phy<U+017F>ician; which Anatomy has been
neglected even by our College. What is the inference of this?
Why, our College have a Noble Qualification of Talking finely;
but not in the lea<U+017F>t an ability to Cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Pray you Sir, what
are the People the better for the Colleges Ability to Talk finely;
if they have none to Cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. No, but they are Men of
large Capacities! Capable of perfecting the Anatomy of the
Juices too, if they would but once <U+017F>et about the Work. But
when that will be, who knows? They under<U+017F>tand Philo<U+017F>ophy
enough already (tho' their Friend <hi>John</hi> <U+017F>ays no) and while they
are in that Opinion, they will hardly learn more. While they
think the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts is enough for them; they
will never <U+017F>et about the Anatomy of the Fluids by Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
And <U+017F>o for ought we know, they are like to remain
Phy<U+017F>icians <hi>in Verbo</hi> only; Fine Talkers. But Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> is the
only Phy<U+017F>ician <hi>in Re,</hi> indeed, among<U+017F>t them. 'Twas great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in them to take you into the College Sir, that they might
have one real Phy<U+017F>ician to actuate the re<U+017F>t; that they might not
be a Body without a Soul: You know <hi>Acid is the Soul of the
World.</hi> And an A<U+017F>s-Ey'd Doctor may as well be the Soul of the
College. I can hardly think, they would <U+017F>o readily have given
you a Licence; but that they expected you would do <U+017F>omething
for them, they could not do for them<U+017F>elves; run down the
<hi>Badger,</hi> catch the <hi>Salmon,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other piece of Difficulty.

You, who have made it the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of your Life, to under<U+017F>tand
rightly the Juices of Humane Bodies in their Natural and Morbid

People (if you <U+017F>ay true) more than all the re<U+017F>t of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
But you are a Particle of the College, and what you do;
is the doing of the College. 'Tis well they have you, that they
may not only be <U+017F>aid to do <U+017F>omething; but more than other
People; tho' not in the whole, yet in one part of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Acid.</hi> But truly <hi>John,</hi> your crying down the Skill in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of the <U+017F>olid Parts, is but a dull way of excu<U+017F>ing your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
therein, and you do but as Block-heads commonly do,
cry down as u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, all Knowledg they them<U+017F>elves have not; that
Fools may think them Wi<U+017F>e enough. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you <hi>John,</hi>
and the Gentlemen too, That the Skill in the Anatomy of the
Solids, is <U+017F>o far nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that the Anatomy of the Juices <U+017F>ignifies
little to a Phy<U+017F>ician without it. The Animal Oeconomy can never
be well under<U+017F>tood in its due Order and Defects, by one that
knows nothing of the Structure of the Parts. For in<U+017F>tance, tho'
I knew the Gall to be of <U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>uch, a Nature and Quality,
and by a Pyrotechnical Analy<U+017F>is, to yield <U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>uch different
Bodies, or Sets of Particles: What am I the wi<U+017F>er, as a Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
unle<U+017F>s I know where this, thus qualify'd Liquor, is <U+017F>eparated
and di<U+017F>charg'd? How otherwi<U+017F>e, can I determine of the U<U+017F>e,
or Defects of this Liquor? So likewi<U+017F>e as to the other Liquors of
the Body: How can I know their Motions, Secretions and U<U+017F>es,
unle<U+017F>s I know which way they pa<U+017F>s, and where <U+017F>eparated? Was
the Famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> or <hi>Servetus</hi> before him, nothing the better for
being aware of the ways of the circular Motion of the Blood, but
only that they could Talk finely. Fye <hi>John,</hi> you don't talk like a
Light in Phy<U+017F>ick, much le<U+017F>s in Chirurgery. I mu<U+017F>t tell you, if
you had been skill'd in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts; you
would not only have talk'd more finely; but more truly than you
do, as we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee in a Material in<U+017F>tance before we have done.
And as you have fooli<U+017F>hly confe<U+017F>s'd your Ignorance in the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the <U+017F>olid Parts (a <U+017F>hame to any Phy<U+017F>ician, e<U+017F>pecially to one
that Writes him<U+017F>elf of the Noble College) <U+017F>o I believe, I <U+017F>hall
find you ignorant of the Anatomy of the Fluids too; and that it
will appear, you have not done more than other People in any
thing, but Impudent Boa<U+017F>ting! You tell me, that the Blood
has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in it, but when People are in a perfect <U+017F>tate
of Health; and that it can't <U+017F>uper-abound, neither in a Morbid,
nor Healthy <U+017F>tate: For tho' the Stomach covets <hi>Acids</hi> more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he will not fail to reject what's more than enough,
by Vomit; but tho' <U+017F>he can't over-doe, yet <U+017F>he's very defective
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59081:16"/>
through her own, or the Phy<U+017F>ician's fault. You are a cunning
Man! Of a <U+017F>he Stomach. You once told us, <hi>That all Per<U+017F>ons have
<U+017F>ome degree of Sickne<U+017F>s.</hi> Now that the Blood has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in
it, but in a perfect <U+017F>tate of Health. But I an<U+017F>wer, If all Per<U+017F>ons
have <U+017F>ome degree of Sickne<U+017F>s; then none are in perfect Health;
and if none are in perfect Health, according to you, none have
any <hi>Acid</hi> in their Blood. Yet again you tell us, <hi>That Leanne<U+017F>s is
for want of enough</hi> Acid <hi>in the Blood, and Fat is nothing but a concrete
of</hi> Acid <hi>and oily Parts; and over-much Fatne<U+017F>s, if it may be call'd a
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, is caus'd by</hi> Acids. What a mi<U+017F>ery it is for a Man to
have a <hi>Treacherous Memory;</hi> <U+017F>o to contradict him<U+017F>elf. If Fat be a
concrete of <hi>Acid</hi> and Oily Parts, wherever there is Fat there is
<hi>Acid;</hi> but there's Fat in Per<U+017F>ons under many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a Body, before now, that Dy'd of another Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e than
Fatne<U+017F>s, that cut two or three Inches in Fat upon the <hi>Abdomen:</hi>
And Fatne<U+017F>s in <U+017F>ome, is Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e enough; and if your
Doctrine were true, nothing could be more proper than
<hi>Alkalies</hi> to Cure it. But farther Sir, If there be never any
<hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood; but in <hi>a</hi> State of perfect Health: How
can <hi>Acids</hi> Cure the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Blood: <hi>Mortifie and Expel
the luxriant Alcalous Particles, reduce the <U+017F>erum to fluidity, make
the too thick Blood thin, and the too thin Blood thick,</hi> The
Miracles of <hi>Acids! That he that can <U+017F>hew how this can be,
what</hi> Acids <hi>taken in the Latitude can do, mu<U+017F>t be as Wi<U+017F>e as</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>the Wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Man that ever was, or <U+017F>hall be.</hi> Yet you tell us,
<hi>That</hi> Acids <hi>produce the<U+017F>e different things, by being differently <U+017F>pecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with other things, but</hi> Acid <hi>is the <U+017F>oul of them.</hi> And <U+017F>o <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
is not the Wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Man, for you are as Wi<U+017F>e as he. But tho' I
believe there has been, or may be, one Man at lea<U+017F>t Wi<U+017F>er than
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and you too Sir, I much que<U+017F>tion whether he would be
cunning enough to tell, how all the<U+017F>e fine things come to pa<U+017F>s,
which you <U+017F>ay are done in the Blood of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed Per<U+017F>ons by
<hi>Acids,</hi> if as you <U+017F>ay, there never comes any <hi>Acid</hi> there, but in a

the <U+017F>tomack <U+017F>o unerringly rejects to a grain, whatever of its belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Acid</hi> is too much to be convey'd into the Blood, and yet is
fooli<U+017F>hly defective in letting in enough. But to leave the<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions

of the<U+017F>e Famous Men, be not enough; let me rea<U+017F>on with you
a little farther my <U+017F>elf. How can Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es if caus'd by <hi>Alkali</hi>
(as you <U+017F>ay) be Cur'd by <hi>Acids,</hi> but by <hi>Acids</hi> coming into the
Blood. Mu<U+017F>t not there be <U+017F>ome time for their Operation there,
before they can mortifie and expel the Abundant <hi>Alkali,</hi> <U+017F>o as that
<hi>Acid</hi> mu<U+017F>t be in the Blood, while the Per<U+017F>on is yet Di<U+017F>eas'd?
Or, do's <hi>Alkali</hi> leap out at one Door as afrighted, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Acid</hi>
with his <U+017F>our Face coming in at another? Are your Cures all <U+017F>o
<U+017F>udden? No <hi>John,</hi> I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e not. But altho' there were no <hi>Acid</hi>-Doctor
to convey <U+017F>our Liquors into the Blood; yet I <U+017F>ay, there
may be <hi>Acid,</hi> and that too much, in the Blood of a Di<U+017F>eas'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
as the cau<U+017F>e of his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. It's undoubted among Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that the Health of the Body, very much con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the due
Temper and Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of the Blood, and other Liquors of the
Body, that they be neither too thick nor too thin. If they be
too thick, they cannot pu<U+017F>s freely through the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
and circulate through the <hi>Aana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es</hi> of the Arteries and Veins,
but <U+017F>tick and cau<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>tructions; whence ari<U+017F>e Swellings and
Pains, by di<U+017F>tention of the Parts, and the Liquors <U+017F>tagnating;
get a fermentavive Motion, and <U+017F>o corrupt and corrode the <U+017F>olid
Parts, and produce Ulcers: But if the Ob<U+017F>truction be <U+017F>ooner
open'd, and the Coagulated Parts be carry'd along again into the
Ma<U+017F>s of Blood; it is thereby retarded in its motion, before the
Particles can be <U+017F>eparated; from whence may proceed divers Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
Now it's certain, that <hi>Acids</hi> coagulate and thicken the
Blood, and other Juices of the Body, as any one may <U+017F>ee by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, as Oyl of <hi>Vitrol,</hi> <U+017F>p. of <hi>Niter,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
&amp;c. with a little Blood, or <hi>Serum:</hi> The <hi>Acids</hi> turning the
<hi>Serum</hi> into thick white Corruption, and the Red part into a tough
black Matter. So <hi>Acid</hi> Liquors injected into the Veins of Animals
kill them by coagulating their Blood: When on the other Hand,
<hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors make the Blood more thin and florid, on which
account it cannot be thought, by any Body that has his Sen<U+017F>es,
that when the Blood is too thick, or coagulated, 'its caus'd by
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> and not by <hi>Acids.</hi> You <U+017F>aid Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> that <hi>Whoever <U+017F>hou'd
take upon them to An<U+017F>wer any thing you have <U+017F>aid, unle<U+017F>s they back their
Arguments with Experiments, you <U+017F>hould take no notice of them.</hi> But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sir, you have not back'd your A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion. <hi>That</hi> Acids <hi>make the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59081:18"/>
Blood thin when too thick</hi> with Experiments. I would coun<U+017F>el the
Gentlemen to do it for you, and they will <U+017F>ee how friendly your
<hi>Acids</hi> are to the Blood. Be<U+017F>ides, that there's too much <hi>Acid</hi> in
the Blood, in <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, may fairly be argu'd, <hi>a Juvantibus
&amp; laedentibus.</hi> It being commonly <U+017F>een, that Per<U+017F>ons afflicted with
<U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, are very much hurt and the Symptoms exa<U+017F>perated
by the u<U+017F>e of <hi>Acids,</hi> as <hi>Hypocondriacks, Hy<U+017F>terical</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick</hi>
Per<U+017F>ons; tho<U+017F>e afflicted with divers kinds of Ulcers and that have
I<U+017F><U+017F>ues: On the contrary Reliev'd, Eas'd and Heal'd by <hi>Alkalies;</hi>
as is well known to Phy<U+017F>icians and Chirurgeons. Farther, to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, becau<U+017F>e <hi>by all the ways you could yet contrive, you have
not been able to procure one Grain of pure</hi> Acid <hi>from the Blood either of
Healthy, or Sick People.</hi> I'll teach you. From the Blood of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Di<U+017F>eas'd or Healthy Per<U+017F>ons, as al<U+017F>o from their Urine which
is <U+017F>eparated, from thence you may get a <hi>Sal <U+017F>al<U+017F>um,</hi> like Sea-Salt,
which you <U+017F>ay, is an <hi>Acid;</hi> but I <U+017F>ay, yields an <hi>Acid</hi> by Di<U+017F>tilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and from Fle<U+017F>h and Blood, as well as from Urine, may be
got the <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus,</hi> which is an Oyl coagulated into an open Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
by an <hi>Acid;</hi> which <hi>Acid</hi> may be as ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated, as the
<hi>Acid</hi> is from common <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is eai<U+017F>e enough, tho' you
<U+017F>ay, '<hi>tis no ea<U+017F>ie matter to do it.</hi> And from Urine, an excrement
of the Blood, be<U+017F>ides <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus,</hi> I have made a perfect burning
Sulphur, without any addition of any Body that could yield it, or
help to compo<U+017F>e it; which Sulphur would make good Matches,
and might be Di<U+017F>till'd into Oyl of Sulphur, <hi>per Campanam</hi> as ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as any other Sulphur; and <hi>every thing is di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd,</hi> you <U+017F>ay, <hi>into
that of which it was made.</hi> But I <U+017F>ay, not by every <U+017F>ort of Di<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
But that in a common Di<U+017F>tillation of Blood, by <U+017F>uch a
Di<U+017F>tiller as your <U+017F>elf, there's no <hi>Acid</hi> produc'd, is ea<U+017F>ie to an<U+017F>wer,
by an Experiment or two. For in<U+017F>tance, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and
mix with it a con<U+017F>iderable quantity of an <hi>Acid,</hi> and you <U+017F>hall
Di<U+017F>till them, and <U+017F>hall not get one Grain of <hi>Acid;</hi> but an <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
Liquor. Again, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and mix an <hi>Acid</hi> with
it, and you <U+017F>hall Di<U+017F>till them, and <U+017F>hall not get one Grain of <hi>Acid;</hi>
but they <U+017F>hall both unite, and both come over in a Liquor, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> nor <hi>Acid</hi> but a <hi><U+017F>al<U+017F>um.</hi> Again, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi>
and mix an <hi>Acid</hi> with it, and you <U+017F>hall Di<U+017F>till them, and <U+017F>hall get
neither <hi>Acid, Alkali</hi> nor <hi>Sal<U+017F>um;</hi> but a burning Oyl. Which things, if
you are a Chymi<U+017F>t, as you profe<U+017F>s, you can't be Ignorant of. From
which Experiments, it may ea<U+017F>ily be believ'd, that tho' there may
be a <U+017F>mall quantity of <hi>Acid,</hi> actually in the Blood, yea, a large
quantity in compari<U+017F>on of what there <U+017F>hould be; yet the <hi>Alkali</hi>
far exceeding it; the <hi>Acid</hi> may be <U+017F>o far alter'd by the Fire,
or lock'd up with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> as to come over as an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59081:18"/>
remain a <hi>Sal<U+017F>um?</hi> And though a mere <hi>Sal<U+017F>um</hi> cannot truly
be <U+017F>aid to be either an <hi>Acid,</hi> or an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or have an affect
as either, Whatever <U+017F>eparations or alterations the Fire, may
make from it, or upon it; yet it is certain that the Natural
or Artificial Conjunction of an <hi>Acid</hi> with an <hi>Alkali,</hi> does make a
<hi>Sal<U+017F>um,</hi> and nothing is more common, than to have the Blood
apparantly Salt, even to the ta<U+017F>te, in many Ca<U+017F>es, in <U+017F>ome more,
<U+017F>ome le<U+017F>s; which <hi>Sal<U+017F>um</hi> (tho' the <hi>Acid</hi> that is coagulated with
the <hi>Alkali</hi> were not <U+017F>eparate in the Body fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o capable of
hurting) is very likely as a <hi>Sal<U+017F>um,</hi> to be the Cau<U+017F>e of divers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,
when it too much abounds; which we may ea<U+017F>ily believe,
from this Con<U+017F>ideration, That it's well known, that the Eating
too much common Salt, is the Cau<U+017F>e of many Di<U+017F>orders. As
for in<U+017F>tance <hi>Seamen</hi> (as you confe<U+017F>s) <hi>who live upon Salt-meat, and
Salt-fi<U+017F>h, are more troubled with the Scurvey than others,</hi> not as you
<U+017F>ay, <hi>becau<U+017F>e they eat more Fle<U+017F>h and Fi<U+017F>h (which abound with Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
parts) than others:</hi> For others that cat as much Fle<U+017F>h and
Fi<U+017F>h, and that fre<U+017F>h too, are not <U+017F>o much troubled with it, but
becau<U+017F>e their Fle<U+017F>h and Fi<U+017F>h is more Salt, and is al<U+017F>o kept longer,
whereby the Spiritous and Volatile parts are exhal'd, and <U+017F>o yield
a gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Chyle. Nor as you <U+017F>ay, <hi>That the moi<U+017F>t Air hinders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration;</hi>
For it is well known, That Men at Sea generally eat
more, and void fewer Excrements of the Belly, than at Land,
and con<U+017F>equently per<U+017F>pire more. Nor is the <hi>Sea-Salt carry'd off
all by <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rine,</hi> it being to be found in a greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity in
the Blood, and other Liquors of the Body. Nor can <hi>Sea Salt,
and any</hi> Alkali <hi>make a Sal Armoniack,</hi> as you tell us, either in the
Body, or by a Pyrothechnical Conjunction; unle<U+017F>s the Sea-Salt
be fir<U+017F>t an <hi>Acid,</hi> as I have found by experience, and any body
may <U+017F>ee that will try to make a <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> And tho' the Air at,
Sea <U+017F>hould hinder <U+017F>weat, as you <U+017F>ay, yet it furthers Per<U+017F>piration;
whereby the <hi>Alkalies</hi> if they could do any hurt, may be carry'd
off, if that be <U+017F>uppos'd the cour<U+017F>e they ought to go. And that
we per<U+017F>pire more when we don't <U+017F>weat, than when we do (tho'
it may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange to <U+017F>ome) might be urg'd by divers Rea<U+017F>ons,
if it were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and may be try'd by Staticks. How an <hi>Acid</hi>
Spirit <U+017F>hould be Di<U+017F>till'd from Sea-Salt while in the Blood, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Liquors of the Body, I confe<U+017F>s I <U+017F>ee not, but I know by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Experience, that there's often <U+017F>eparated, or produc'd in the
Stomach, a Praternatural <hi>Acid,</hi> a kind of Vinegar, from things
taken in, that are fermentable into Vinegar; as Sugar, Honey,
Bread, <U+017F>trong Liquors; which tho' in their fir<U+017F>t inge<U+017F>ted Form,
could not be truly call'd <hi>Acids,</hi> yet become very <U+017F>trong ones, and
if they were <hi>Acids</hi> grow <U+017F>tronger. Be<U+017F>ides, every one knows,

that we Eat and Drink things already <U+017F>our, both which we know,
are not always rejected by Vomit (as Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> <U+017F>aies) But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding,

than <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o do, may pa<U+017F>s this Watch, and get in with the

Per<U+017F>ons contains or yields more <hi>Alkali,</hi> than that of Sound
Per<U+017F>ons. I an<U+017F>wer, It's a more difficult thing than you, or any other
young Chymi<U+017F>t would imagine, exactly to find the quantity of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi>-Salt in a parcel of Blood. To <U+017F>eparate the Volatile-Salt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Phlegm, and from the Oyl, and both of them from the
<hi>Caput mort.</hi> will be found too hard a Task for an older Work-man
than your <U+017F>elf. The difficulty of giveing an exact account of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59081:19"/>
contents of a parcel of Blood, will appear from divers Con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Blood is a Body that will <U+017F>well up as it drys, <U+017F>o that the top
of the matter will have le<U+017F>s Heat than the bottom, and retain
<U+017F>ome of the Volatile Parts; <U+017F>o that if you don't take it out and
Di<U+017F>til part of it again in another Retort, you will not get all, and
notwith<U+017F>tanding all the care po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>ome of the Volatile parts
will be lo<U+017F>t in working; <U+017F>o that the mo<U+017F>t wary Arti<U+017F>t, do what
he can, will not be able to <U+017F>ay, Here's all the <hi>Alkali,</hi> or Oyl, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in <U+017F>o much Blood. But there will be <U+017F>till greater Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in giving the true Contents in divers parcels of Blood; for if
you <U+017F>hould take a Pound, or any other quantity of Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it into equal parts, and Di<U+017F>til one half in one Retort, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in another, the products would not be the <U+017F>ame. For the
different degrees of Fire that might happen, different time of
Di<U+017F>tilling, and taking off, and <U+017F>eparating the Phlegm, Oyl, and
Salt, the different clo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of Luteing, yea, the very <U+017F>hapes and
<U+017F>izes of the Retorts and Receivers, would almo<U+017F>t in inevitably
cau<U+017F>e different Products. Farther, the Bloods of divers Per<U+017F>ons,
tho' all in Health, or of one healthy Per<U+017F>on, took at divers times,
would as much differ in the Products, as that of the Di<U+017F>eas'd and
Healthy, as well as vary upon other Tryals. As I have <U+017F>een the
Sweat of a Per<U+017F>on in perfect Health, turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green
readily, when the very <hi>ichor</hi> and corruption in the pu<U+017F>tles of the
<hi>Small-Pox,</hi> would hardly alter its colour into a di<U+017F>cernable Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
So the Blood of the <U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>eas'd Per<U+017F>on, taken at one time
or <U+017F>tate of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, would as much differ from that taken at
another time, as either of them would from a Sound Per<U+017F>on's;
having <U+017F>ometimes more, <U+017F>ometimes le<U+017F>s <hi>Serum.</hi> So that I mu<U+017F>t
tell you, you have not been a Chymi<U+017F>t long enough, to de<U+017F>erve
Credit, <U+017F>ince it appears you have not yet Learn'd to <U+017F>peak mode<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the <U+017F>olid Food, being over attenuated, is made capable of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
thro' the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er is convey'd to the Guts; and
having but few Nutritious Particles, Leanne<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t needs follow:
And as I <U+017F>aid, that Leanne<U+017F>s is for want of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Fat is nothing but a concrete of <hi>Acid,</hi> and Oily Parts:
When the Blood is de<U+017F>titute of <hi>Acids,</hi> and abounds with <hi>Alkalies,</hi>
as it doth with all People who have too much <hi>Acid</hi> in their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
the Blood de<U+017F>titute of <hi>Acids</hi> to coagulate the Oyl, there
can be no Fat produced: And that already generated, having its
<hi>Acid</hi> mortify'd by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> loo<U+017F>es its con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and is turned
into a thin Oyl, and when the Oyl is gone, the <hi>Alkalies</hi> prey on
the Mu<U+017F>cles, Nerves, and Fibers, and cau<U+017F>e general Di<U+017F>orders.
Thirdly, Tho<U+017F>e troubled with Acidity in the Stomach, are Co<U+017F>tive,
becau<U+017F>e the more thin Parts are carry'd off by the Urinary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.

tho<U+017F>e Animals, but have no Caul, have no Kidneys: And if that
had been true, it might have look'd like an Argument that they
do not Pi<U+017F>s: But if there are Animals that have no Caul, and
yet have Kidneys, as Birds have: what u<U+017F>e are they for, if not
to <U+017F>eparate <U+017F>ome <U+017F>erous matter from the Blood? and tho' they do
not Pi<U+017F>s in the manner, as <U+017F>ome Animals do, being more dry and
per<U+017F>piring much; yet there is, as is well known, a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age from
their Reins, into the common pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the thicker Excrements.
In his Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of Animals fir<U+017F>t gorged with Water, and finding
the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Caul turgid; he <U+017F>hou'd have certify'd him<U+017F>elf,
that tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els were turgid with the Water that was reciev'd
into the Stomach, and have <U+017F>een that he could pre<U+017F>s it out of the
Stomach into them, and out of them into the Kidneys, and where
they were in<U+017F>erted. And as for the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of Hydropical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
tho' he found the Caul <U+017F>o affected<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> it might be but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant,

could not pa<U+017F>s that way. As to the Per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>e Caul was part
Cut away, it can't be Rationally thought that a difficulty of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water, <U+017F>hou'd be caus'd by the Urinary Liquors not being
tran<U+017F>mitted to the Kidneys, but rather, from its being ob<U+017F>tructed
in the Bladder, from <U+017F>ome other Cau<U+017F>e than the Cutting of his
<hi>Omentum:</hi> Nor is he certain, that the pain and weight in the
Man's Stomach, and loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s when he Drank much, was not from

I don't que<U+017F>tion, tho' you give no more than the<U+017F>e two, but
that you could give us a Hundred more <U+017F>uch Stories: But if we
<U+017F>uopo<U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e matters of Fact true, I <U+017F>ay, the <U+017F>peedie<U+017F>t of your
Cures is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden, as to make it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to conclude, that
the Medicines could not go a longer March, and thro' more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files

Almo<U+017F>t every one's Experience, will certifie them of more
<U+017F>udden Effects of things taken into the Body, in the remote<U+017F>t Parts
from the Stomach. When we are faint and weak by Fa<U+017F>ting,
and take Meat and Drink, we <U+017F>oon feel a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Refre<U+017F>hment and
Strength throughout the whole Body, and tho<U+017F>e that take too
much Vinous Liquors, in a very <U+017F>hort time, will feel the Effects there
of in their very Finger-ends. Be<U+017F>ides its well known, that divers
things taken into the Stomach, will in half an Hours time produce
their Effects in the very Skin, cau<U+017F>ing copious Sweats. And what's
more, I my <U+017F>elf, have Experienc'd that the mere Ta<U+017F>ting a thing,
has in a few Minutes time wrought by Sweat, Vomiting and Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Nay, <U+017F>ome things apply'd outwardly, will very <U+017F>oon both
Purge and Vomit; the Particles of which can't be communicated
to the Stomach, but by a longer way than from the Stomach to
the Kidneys by the <hi>Lacteals.</hi> And as for the Ta<U+017F>ting of things in
the Urine; I <U+017F>ay, you never Ta<U+017F>ted any of your <hi>Acids</hi> there: But
whatever you might Ta<U+017F>te in the Urine, it's no Argument of your
<U+017F>hort pa<U+017F><U+017F>age: The Ta<U+017F>te of things is oft found remaining, where
they mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uppos'd to have pa<U+017F>s'd the <hi>Lacteals.</hi> Every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Woman

be very <U+017F>trongly Ta<U+017F>ted in her Cow's-Milk, but will hardly ever
be lo<U+017F>t in the Chee<U+017F>e made thereof. As for the total de<U+017F>truction of
things, you talk of; there's no <U+017F>uch thing in Nature. And as to
your fancy, that tho<U+017F>e troubled with <U+017F>our Stomachs, make Water
often, and much; I in my <U+017F>elf Experience the contrary, being
commonly troubled with too much Acidity, if I Drink any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable
quantity of Fermented Liquors, and yet I have <U+017F>eldom
met with any but will Pi<U+017F>s once, or twice, before I have any <U+017F>uch
motion; neither do I find my <U+017F>elf make more Water, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59081:25"/>
with a <U+017F>our Stomach, than at other times. Nor are <hi>Acids</hi> <U+017F>o
apt to attenuate the Nutritious Parts of our Food: Every one
that knows how to make a Po<U+017F><U+017F>et can tell you, that the more Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
part of Milk, is curdled, and hardened by <hi>Acieds:</hi>
And our Chyle it <U+017F>elf is of the Nature of Milk. As for
leanne<U+017F>s, that it is cau<U+017F>ed by want of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
the Oyl, it is but your fancy. If you had examin'd
Fat by the Fire, or any way whereby you may judg of it, you
would not have found it more <hi>Acid</hi> than Fle<U+017F>h or Blood, but have
found it pa<U+017F>t your Art to <U+017F>eparate it into an <hi>Acid</hi> and an Oyl; nor
did you ever take <hi>Acid</hi> and Oyl mixed with a great deal of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and coagulate them into Fat by <U+017F>uch a heat, as that of our
Body. You may indeed coagulate Oyl into Brim<U+017F>tone by an <hi>Acid,</hi>
but you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a heat, as cannot be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed in the body
of an Animal, and your <hi>Acid</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>tronger, and your Oyl
more undivided than they can be <U+017F>uppos'd to be while diluted,
and mixed with the aqueous, and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors of the Body.
If you had under<U+017F>tood Sope-making, you might have <U+017F>een Oyl
and Gree<U+017F>e coagulated, and hardned by <U+017F>trong boyling with fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Alkalies</hi> in<U+017F>tead of being made thin, and you <U+017F>hould have try'd
whether Volatile <hi>Alkalies</hi> would turn Fat into a thin Oyl, before
you had <U+017F>o po<U+017F>itively a<U+017F><U+017F>erted it: For it is well known on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that Vinegar is given with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s to tho<U+017F>e that are too fat:
An example of which, <U+017F>ee <hi>Cattieri,</hi> Obj. 13. p. 44. in a Military
Man that was very fat, who by continual u<U+017F>e of Vinegar,
decrea<U+017F>ed eighty <U+017F>even Pounds. As for the co<U+017F>tivene<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e
troubled with <U+017F>our Stomachs, I al<U+017F>o experienced the contrary,
being <U+017F>eldom or never co<U+017F>tive e<U+017F>peciolly when troubled with too
much Acidity in my Stomach. But we come to your own rai<U+017F>ed
Objection: How can Steel, an <hi>Acid,</hi> cure <hi>Atrophies,</hi> and not rather
exa<U+017F>perate them by encrea<U+017F>ing Acidity in the Stomach? Here
Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> you had given us <U+017F>ome of your deep thoughts in a rare
di<U+017F>covery, that Steel has that excellent property to carry the
preternatural <hi>Acid</hi> of the Stomach into the Blood, there to do
fine feats: But we mu<U+017F>t take it upon your word, for you have
not proved by any Experiment, that Steel thus u<U+017F>hers the <hi>Acid</hi>
in through the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veins, which would without its a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance,
have been let down at the invi<U+017F>ible trap-doors in the bottom of
the Stomach. You <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the <hi>Acid</hi> too gro<U+017F>s, when turn'd into
Vitriol to pa<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e fine outlets, which I confe<U+017F>s are <U+017F>o fine,
that I could never <U+017F>ee them; but <hi>Vitriol</hi> I know when di<U+017F><U+017F>olved
(and it cannot be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed long in a coagulated form in the
Stomach) will pa<U+017F>s very fine filters, and in<U+017F>inuate it<U+017F>elf through
the pores of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that will hold divers other Liquors:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59081:26"/>
And here is another My<U+017F>tery <U+017F>till, that one <hi>Acid</hi> is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved by,
and coagulated with another. But the truth of the matter
<U+017F>poils all your di<U+017F>covery, which is that Steel by all tryals is found
to be an <hi>Alkali,</hi> fermenting with, and ab<U+017F>orbing <hi>Acids,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
hindring them where ever they go together with it from
having the effects of <hi>Acids.</hi> And a far better rea<U+017F>on of the good
effects of Steel, where it is found a beneficial Remedy, is that as
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> it ab<U+017F>orbs the <hi>Acids</hi> in the Stomach and Bowels, and
<U+017F>o hinders them from doing mi<U+017F>chief, either there, or in any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rece<U+017F><U+017F>es, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing any way into the Blood, or urinary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
<U+017F>heathing their offen<U+017F>ive poynts, carries them off with it<U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Excrements of the Belly. But farther, to <U+017F>hew how
repugnant your fancies are to rea<U+017F>on, and them<U+017F>elves, you <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e your Urinary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the Stomach to the Kidneys,
and that <hi>Acids</hi> have the power of attenuating things, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
that way: Then according to your Doctrine we can't <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e
them to take any other cour<U+017F>e, this being the readie<U+017F>t way, and
how freely <U+017F>oever you give your <hi>Acid</hi> Medicines, they will be

of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and want of <hi>Acids</hi> in the Blood, unle<U+017F>s Nature knows
your <hi>Acids</hi> from others, or that they are embodied, as you <U+017F>ay,

an Excrement in the proper <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, is apparent from the manner and
way of its <U+017F>eparation. The Liver the large<U+017F>t Bowel in the Body,
having no other a<U+017F><U+017F>ignable u<U+017F>e, but the <U+017F>ecretion of this Liquor,
which is ejected mo<U+017F>t commonly into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> rarely into
the <hi>Jejunum,</hi> and there mixed with the Chyle, as all that are skill'd
in the Anatomy of the <U+017F>olid Parts know. But it cannot well
be thought, that a meer Excrement <U+017F>hould be thus di<U+017F>charged

of the Nature of this Liquor, which by Di<U+017F>tillation yields
a volatile <hi>Alkalous,</hi> in the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> a <hi>Lixivious</hi>-Salt running in

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59081:27"/>
that commonly u<U+017F>ed, or very analogous to it, I think is plain. Its
the Nature of common Fire, to con<U+017F>ume whatever is a proper
<hi>Pabulum</hi> or fewel for it, and to leave its Excrements behind it,
which are A<U+017F>hes and Soot. The Body of Man would <U+017F>oon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd,
unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>upply'd with proper Food, and how could this be,
and what would become of what we Eat and Drink, I can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand;
unle<U+017F>s there were a Fire, or Flame within us to con<U+017F>ume
it. Common Fire can't <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without Air: Is it not the <U+017F>ame
thing with the Life of Man? Let him be enclos'd in a place
where Air can't come at him, he immediately Expires, as is well
known to Miners. Heat and Warmth are the con<U+017F>tant Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of Fire, and that there's Heat and Warmth in the Body
of Man, none, Ma<U+017F>ter of his Sen<U+017F>es, will deny. How is it po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
for the Heat of our Bodies to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd, unle<U+017F>s there were

                  </gap>rrence of <U+017F>ome of the greate<U+017F>t Men the World has afforded,
that the Life of Man is a Flame. The <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus,</hi> which is as
much Fire as any thing we know, is a true Animal Fire, to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from all Animal Sub<U+017F>tances; and if it did not actually exi<U+017F>t
in them, how can it be Extracted from them I know not: It is an
<hi>Acid</hi> Sulpherous Sub<U+017F>tance, and the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of Animal Fires, is a
Sulpherous <hi>Acid:</hi> Common Sulphur, Tallow, Pitch, do abound with
Sulphur, &amp; are inflammable; yet from none of the<U+017F>e is by any known
Artifice the lea<U+017F>t Pho<U+017F>phorus, or any thing like it attainable. Upon
the <U+017F>troaking of Cats in the dark, fla<U+017F>hes of fire will follow. This
gentle <U+017F>troaking can never cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o violent a motion, as you
make Fire to be, unle<U+017F>s it were actually in the Animal. I confe<U+017F>s
Fire is a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance con<U+017F>tantly in motion, and a brisk motion, yet
all brisk motion is not Fire: But I know <U+017F>everal fluids the more
briskly moved the colder; as a River is always colder where the
Current is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>wift. And which is none of the lea<U+017F>t Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove our Life is a Flame; let a Man be <U+017F>eiz<U+017F>ed with a
Feaver, or any Di<U+017F>temper attended with a total lo<U+017F>s of Appetite,
the Fat will fir<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>umed, and a Corpulent Man <U+017F>oon
brought to a Skeleton, when the evacuations of Urine and Stool
are le<U+017F>s than in Health: Which could not be, unle<U+017F>s there were
a Flame to cau<U+017F>e that Con<U+017F>umption. There is a difference in <U+017F>ome
re<U+017F>pects between Animal and Culinary Fire, in many they agree.
Neither will burn without due acce<U+017F>s of Air; both cau<U+017F>e warmth:

but Animal Fire (<U+017F>o I call <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus)</hi> immerg'd in Water, and
taken out will retain its properties without being applied to other
enkindled Bodies: This common Fire will not do. Now where

if well con<U+017F>ider'd, I think, may give us <U+017F>ome determinate
Notion of Fire: There's never any Fire, but where there is a
brisk Motion; and you grant me, that all brisk Motion is not Fire,
but <U+017F>uch a Motion as I have de<U+017F>crib'd; and no other that I know
of, will determine the matter <U+017F>o, as that we may not <U+017F>ay, every
Motion is Fire, or no motion is Fire. Now Fire, as I have <U+017F>aid, being
a congeries of a quantity of <U+017F>ubtil, rigid and inflexible Parts <U+017F>o mov'd,
as to cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ations of Heat and Light, and if too near the
Body that of Burning, there can be no <U+017F>uch thing found in the Body
of Man. But let us con<U+017F>ider your own Arguments, you u<U+017F>e to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59081:29"/>
us of the Exi<U+017F>tence of a Fire, or Flame in the Blood. The
Nature of common Fire, <U+017F>ay you, is to con<U+017F>ume its proper <hi>Pabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
or Fewel, and to leave A<U+017F>hes and Soot as its Excrements,
which you appeal to Chymi<U+017F>ts are <hi>Alkalies.</hi> The Body of Man
would be con<U+017F>umed, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>upply'd with proper Food (fewel you
mean for the Fire) and how this could be, and what <U+017F>hould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of all we Eat and Daink, unle<U+017F>s there were a Fire in us to
con<U+017F>ume it, you don't know, and the <hi>Alkali</hi> found in Animals, is
the Excrement of their Fire. I an<U+017F>wer, that change wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
combu<U+017F>tible Bodies by Fire, and what alteration is made on
our Food in the Body, is va<U+017F>tly different, and neither is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ummption
in the vulgar <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, not one Particle of Matter being
to be rationally thought to be de<U+017F>troy'd. But real Fire by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion <U+017F>eparates the Parts of many compound Bodies, both
the combu<U+017F>tible and incombu<U+017F>tible ones. Tho<U+017F>e Bodies we call
combu<U+017F>tible, abound more or le<U+017F>s, with Oily Parts, which are as it
were the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the <hi>Igneous:</hi> But there are few of tho<U+017F>e Bodies
but are compounded of other kinds of Parts, be<U+017F>ides <hi>Oleous,</hi>
which in the hurry are <U+017F>eparated from one another, and not only
<U+017F>o, but <U+017F>ometimes alter'd, either broken into <U+017F>maler Parts, or by
<U+017F>trikeing together, are connected one with an other otherwi<U+017F>e than
they were in the natural compound; whence new re<U+017F>ulting Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or artificial compounds ari<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as Soot, and <U+017F>ix'd <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
being <U+017F>eparable again. Now which of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>eparated Bodies,
<U+017F>hould rather be call'd an Excrement (if the fancy of calling any
of them <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be allow'd) is merely Arbitrary: In mo<U+017F>t of them
Water is the greate<U+017F>t quantity, of that which is ca<U+017F>t out as mo<U+017F>t
unfit for the continuance of this hurry, and <U+017F>o might rather be
call'd the Excrement. The <hi>Acid</hi> and Volatile <hi>Alkalious</hi> Bodies are
carry'd off next, and the Oyl it <U+017F>elf, tho' commonly alter'd, is
mo<U+017F>t of it <U+017F>eparated before the Fire goes quite out; the fix'd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
and tho<U+017F>e portions of Oyl, and <hi>Acid,</hi> that <U+017F>tick in it to make
it <U+017F>uch, abiding in the Earth la<U+017F>t with the <hi>Igneous</hi> particles. Now
whatever, is done here, is done by a violent <U+017F>eparation, and <U+017F>tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together of the Parts of Matter. But what alterations of things
are made in the Body, are made by the gentle Motions of Natural
ferments, and <U+017F>eparations by peculiar Strainers of the curiou<U+017F>ly
compos'd Organical Frame, wherein there's no <U+017F>uch degree and
manner of Motion, as can properly be call'd Fire. As for the
Con<U+017F>umption of the Body, you <U+017F>ay, would <U+017F>oon be, if there were
not a <U+017F>upply by Food; I an<U+017F>wer, The forbearance of Food,
would not con<U+017F>ume the Body, but the Organical Frame of it,

uncon<U+017F>um'd in <U+017F>pight of Hunger. And the Fat, which you
<U+017F>ay, is fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>um'd in Feavers and Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es where there's a total
lo<U+017F>s of Appetite is carry'd off, not becau<U+017F>e it is combu<U+017F>tible, and
<U+017F>o Burnt away; but becau<U+017F>e its apt to be attenuated, and does not
<U+017F>o firmly adhere as other Parts. The Evacuations by Stool and
Urine, mu<U+017F>t needs be little, when the Appetite is lo<U+017F>t, and little
Eat: But at all times, its well known, the Evacuations by the
Pores, are the greate<U+017F>t. And as for what we Eat and Drink, tho'
you can't tell what <U+017F>hould become of it, if there were not a Fire
to con<U+017F>ume it: Yet any one that is led more by Con<U+017F>ideration and
Experiment, than Fancy, may as ea<U+017F>ily give an account of the
wa<U+017F>te of it, as of wearing out a Coat, or a pair of Shooes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome Fire or other that Burns them to pieces. The
Food is fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>eparated by Chewing, then in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
by a gentle Heat, and Motion, and probably by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort
of Fermentation; the things we Eat, mo<U+017F>t of them being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
thereof, if kept in a moderate Heat, and <U+017F>ufficient Moy<U+017F>ture,
even out of the Body: Then in the <U+017F>mall Guts there is a <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, and great part is carry'd down, and rejected as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
which Coals, (if you plea<U+017F>e,) you may catch as hot as
ever they were without Burning your Fingers. That part that is
not thus rejected is <hi>Percolated</hi> into the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veins, which convey
it into the <hi>Ductus Chyliferus,</hi> and <U+017F>o into the Blood, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hing
the Parts, both Liquid and Solid; the <hi>Serous</hi> part being but
the <hi>Vehicle</hi> for the more <U+017F>olid, and the <hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood. Whil<U+017F>t
a Man grows, the different Particles of this Nutritive-Juice, as they
are fit <U+017F>ome for one thing, <U+017F>ome for another, adhere, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Parts of the Body, and <U+017F>o encrea<U+017F>e its Bulk; tho<U+017F>e
Parts that are more thin, and fluid, add to and increa<U+017F>e the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
of the Body, out of which, great part is <U+017F>eparated by Urine.
When a Man has done growing, there is no need of addition,
but only of a <U+017F>upply of as much as dayly wa<U+017F>tes, which con<U+017F>idering
the Poreou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Body in all Parts, and the continual natural,
and voluntary Motions thereof, for the feveral Works of Life, can't
ea<U+017F>ily be <U+017F>uppos'd to be little, tho' we can find no <hi>Focus</hi> for a Fire
to con<U+017F>ume us. It's very well known that Labouring Men, and
that in Cold-Weather, have better Stomachs, and Eat more, than
tho<U+017F>e that live Idlely, tho' kept hotter than the Laborious; which
may well be thought to proceed from their u<U+017F>ing more Motion,
whereby the Particles of Food are carry'd about more <U+017F>wiftly and
at length work'd out, and this all done merely by rubbing, where
there is no Fire, which you <U+017F>ay, rejects as Excrements Soot and
A<U+017F>hes, the one of which may be farther <U+017F>eparated into Volatile
Salt, and Oyl, the other into Earth and fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> either of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59081:30"/>
which you may call an Excrement of the other, as you love
or hate, this or that: But you are fallen out with <hi>Alkali, &amp; <U+017F>tercus
humanum, offends your <U+017F>queemi<U+017F>h <U+017F>tomach, ergo, Alkali Merda e<U+017F>t, Alkali</hi>
is the Excrement. Which I think, as good a Rea<U+017F>on as any
you have given. But yet whatever analogy may be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption
of combu<U+017F>tibles by common-Fire, and of our Food
by any thing in the Body, there is this va<U+017F>t difference; In this
there is no Soot nor A<U+017F>hes made of what we Eat and Drink,
much le<U+017F>s of the Air, The other Fewel as you call it, which we
breath in. Here neither the Flame, not the Coal will Burn you,
enkindle the mo<U+017F>t combu<U+017F>tible Matter, or give you any Light.
And tho' a Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> and an Oyl, <U+017F>omething like what may
be got from Soot, may be <U+017F>eparated from the Liquid, or Solid
Parts of the Body, they mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be wrought upon by a common
and greater Fire, than any is in the Blood: And tho' from the
Gall, and Dung may al<U+017F>o be <U+017F>eparated a <U+017F>mall quantity of fix'd Salt,
they mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be expos'd to a real and violent Fire, and <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t
the other Parts, before there can be produc'd any thing that may
be call'd A<U+017F>hes from them. Common Fire, you <U+017F>ay, can't <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
without Air, and the like you affirm of the Life of Man; <U+017F>o
they mu<U+017F>t be both Fires. I an<U+017F>wer, Tho' both require Air; yet
not for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on. The Air is an Ela<U+017F>tick or Springey
Body, capable of being expanded, or contracted, and in its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<U+017F>ion
by Heat, or the Motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Particles (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
when ever a quantity of them, <U+017F>ufficient to produce the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can be connected) I <U+017F>ay in its expan<U+017F>ion, or the receeding of its
Parts from the place where the Fire is begun, it carries off the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the combu<U+017F>tible Matter, that are <U+017F>eparated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no longer combu<U+017F>tible, and <U+017F>o there's more room for
the <hi>Igneous</hi> Particles to move on; as is evidently <U+017F>een in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Furnaces, where the <U+017F>trength of the Fire, depends on the
quick carrying off the Smoak, which is done by a <U+017F>tream of
Air pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing thro' the Bodies in combu<U+017F>tion, and carrying off tho<U+017F>e
Particles that would hinder the Motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Bodies: The
Air where the Fire is being rarify'd, that below being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd,
expands it <U+017F>elf into the place where is mo<U+017F>t room, and
other Air <U+017F>ucceeds it, (the Air being more dilated the higher it is)
the more compre<U+017F>s'd Air <U+017F>till pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing that way; <U+017F>o <U+017F>till the <U+017F>tronger
the Fire, the <U+017F>tronger the Draught of Air, and the fa<U+017F>ter the <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Parts that would hinder the motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Bodies are
removed. But the Life of Man requires Air, not to blow a Fire,
carry off Soot, or di<U+017F>place A<U+017F>hes, much le<U+017F>s as a Fewel for a
Fire; but be<U+017F>ides many other Ends and U<U+017F>es, chiefly to continue
and cary on the Circulation of the Blood: Which I take to be done
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59081:30"/>
after this manner, The Air by its Ela<U+017F>tick Property, ru<U+017F>hing into the
Lungs, upon the dilation of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> expands them, and thereby
<U+017F>ets the <hi>Sanguiferous</hi> Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els free and right for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the
Blood out of the right Ventricle of the Heart into the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>a,</hi>
at the ri<U+017F>e of which, there are Valves to hinder its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age
back again; this Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el and the <hi>Arteria veno<U+017F>a</hi> by their <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es</hi>
being fill'd with Blood, the Thorax is again contracted, the Air
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed out, and the Lungs fall together; whereby the Blood-Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
are pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: But the fore<U+017F>aid Valves hindring its going back,
it is drove into the Left Ventricle of the Heart, whence it cannot
return into the Lungs, by rea<U+017F>on other Valves hindering it; the
Thorax being again dilated, and the Lungs by the Air ru<U+017F>hing in
expanded, and the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, who<U+017F>e Blood was pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed out into the
Left Ventricle of the Heart, again free; the Blood flows into them
again from the Right Ventricle, by which filling and emptying of
the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Lungs, the Blood is as it were pump'd and
carried along in its Circulation: And is there as it were ground,
its adhering Globules <U+017F>eparated, and divided from one another,
its Heterogeneous Particles more exactly mix'd, and <U+017F>o is attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and made more capable of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els thro'
the whole Body. So that the principal rea<U+017F>on, why a Man can't
live long without Air, is becau<U+017F>e the Blood can't otherwi<U+017F>e cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
through the Lungs which way it mu<U+017F>t go; which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears from the con<U+017F>ideration of a Child unborn, who lives
divers Months without re<U+017F>piration, the Blood being carried on
by the force of the Circulation of the Mothers Blood through the
<hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> from the Right to the Left Ventricle of the Heart;
which is <U+017F>top'd when the Child is born, and becomes a di<U+017F>tinct,
and <U+017F>eparate Animal, needing a force of its own to carry on the
Circulation. The rea<U+017F>on why Per<U+017F>ons are often kill'd in Mines,
is not becau<U+017F>e there is no Air, it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible almo<U+017F>t to keep
it out, but that they <U+017F>ometimes breath in with the Air Ar<U+017F>enical,
Sulphurous, or other noxious Fumes, of which one would think
a <hi>Profe<U+017F>s'd Chymi<U+017F>t</hi> could not be ignorant: But you may <U+017F>oon try;
the Fumes of <hi>Antimony, Ar<U+017F>nick,</hi> or the beloved Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi>
<U+017F>teaming from enkindled Brim<U+017F>tone drawn into your Lungs, will
in a little time be found no good Fewel for your <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Bioly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chnium.</hi>
As to your Argument from Heat and Warmth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants
of Fire, and in the Body of Man. I An<U+017F>wer, Heat is
mo<U+017F>t certainly the concomitant of Fire, and al<U+017F>o brisk Motion, but
as you confe<U+017F>s all brisk Motion is not Fire; <U+017F>o I <U+017F>ay, all Heat and
Warmth is not Fire, and the briske<U+017F>t Motion in the Body of Man,
either in Health or Sickne<U+017F>s, is not brisk enough to make a real
Fire in the weake<U+017F>t degree. And tho' you can't <U+017F>ee how Heat
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59081:31"/>
and Warmth could be <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd without a Fire; you may as well
<U+017F>ay, you can't <U+017F>ee how a Man can walk unle<U+017F>s he be running.
Warmth, Heat, and Fire it <U+017F>elf, is nothing but meer Motion in
<U+017F>everal degrees and manners, and wherever there is motion there
is <U+017F>ome degree of Warmth, tho' we may not perceive it, for
there is no <U+017F>uch thing as ab<U+017F>olute cold unle<U+017F>s where all things are
in ab<U+017F>olute re<U+017F>t, which place would be hard to find. Whatever
Heat, or Warmth is cau<U+017F>ed in Fluids, is cau<U+017F>ed by mere Motion,
even where they are <U+017F>et over a Fire, but the nature of watry
Bodies, <U+017F>uch as the Liquors in Man, will not admit a real Fire or
Flame to be mixed with, and continue in them; and tho' by
Motion they may be brought to a Heat incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the Life
of the Body; yet this very Motion is not Fire. But doubtle<U+017F>s
the Heat in Man's Body is cau<U+017F>ed by <U+017F>ome kind of Motion, and
probably a fermentative one; the Blood and other Liquors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
divers <U+017F>alts and Oily particles may well be thought <U+017F>o to
move together, as to cau<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t Heat in the Body of
Man. I confe<U+017F>s a meer Oyl, and <U+017F>ome very <U+017F>trong <hi>Acid</hi> Spirits, will
by their mixture be enkindled into a real Flame, but there never
is nor can be <U+017F>uch a mixture flow in the Veins of a living Man;
<U+017F>o there is never Heat enough to enkindle the mo<U+017F>t inflammable
Bodies. You may take <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> without any fear of its being
<U+017F>et on fire in your Belly, which tho' as little Heat would enkindle,
yet not immerg'd in a watry Liquor, or without the <U+017F>ufficient
acce<U+017F>s of Air; for which very rea<U+017F>on there can be no Fire in the
Blood. And <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> it <U+017F>elf, tho' <U+017F>o apt to be enkindled, I have
known lie for a Month, and might have done as long as one
would, in a Gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>eal'd up without any Water, or the Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and not at all take Fire. The continuance of our Heat
is very ea<U+017F>ily conceived to be by a continual <U+017F>upply of <hi>Saline,</hi>
and <hi>Oleous Particles</hi> apt to jo<U+017F>tle again<U+017F>t one another in a watry
Liquor, and move <U+017F>ufficiently to keep us warm. We know that
divers Liquors mix'd together, will cau<U+017F>e a Heat, even where
there is nothing inflammable in either of them. It has been found
by experience, that the heat of hot Springs proceeds from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Bed where are Salts of divers natures, which the Water
coming to di<U+017F><U+017F>olves, and <U+017F>o their Motion produces the Heat, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like that, produced by pouring Water upon Lime, which
I think no Man in his Wits can a<U+017F>cribe to a Fire or Flame in the
Water. That you <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome Fluids the brisker moved are the
colder, is your mi<U+017F>take; that a River is not colde<U+017F>t in the current
appears from this, that the Current is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon froze; and tho'

of a Burning-gla<U+017F>s, are in a po<U+017F>ture to cau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation, when
an Inch di<U+017F>tant from the <hi>Focus</hi> they have not <U+017F>uch an united
force. As to your maxim, <hi>There is no Smoak but there is <U+017F>ome Fire,</hi>
I an<U+017F>wer, the <U+017F>teams of our Bodies are not Smoak, nor if you
could catch them, would they have a Grain of Soot, but are
very little be<U+017F>ides Water, as I could <U+017F>hew any body by a method
whereby one may collect, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight Ounces,
or more of Sweat from a Man at any time: And Water we all
know is rarified, and carried up by a very <U+017F>mall heat, as is <U+017F>een
in the colde<U+017F>t Weather, and the Water rarified by the Sun, will
appear <U+017F>omewhat like <U+017F>moak. As for the <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus,</hi> it is not an
Animal Fire, or any Fire at all till enkindled; when <U+017F>et on fire
nothing burns fiercer, or burns out <U+017F>ooner, otherwi<U+017F>e it is but
a very inflammable Sulphur, or Fuel apt to take fire, being not <U+017F>o
much as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly warm till enkindled. And to the difference you
fancy between this Animal Fire, as you call it, and the common:
I An<U+017F>wer, <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> will not have the properties of Fire after
immer<U+017F>ion, or before, unle<U+017F>s its Particles are excited by <U+017F>ufficient
Motion; and <U+017F>o will other Combu<U+017F>tible Bodies be enkindled by
<U+017F>ufficient Motion after Immer<U+017F>ion, yea <U+017F>ome incombu<U+017F>table Bodies
as a Flint, and a Steel by a brisk Friction will give fire, or a piece
of Iron by vigorous hammering light a Match, never the le<U+017F>s for
being immerg'd. But Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> were his <hi>Biolychnium</hi> under Water
but one Week would never burn again, without a miracle, or the
application of <U+017F>ome enkindled matter. Farther, <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> may ea<U+017F>ily
be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be extracted from Animal Sub<U+017F>tances without being
thought to be actually in them, and tho' I grant that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
in them, I deny that it was formally: For the Particles
that compo<U+017F>e this Artificial Compound were di<U+017F>pers'd, and mix'd
with others, and <U+017F>o compo<U+017F>ed no <U+017F>uch Body, but are brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by Art, and <U+017F>tuck to one another, and then are in that
<U+017F>tate call'd <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus,</hi> and may be <U+017F>eparated again as ea<U+017F>ily, and
then are not <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus.</hi> As Gla<U+017F>s of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or Lead was not
really Gla<U+017F>s in tho<U+017F>e Bodies before the Operation of the Fire, but
made by it, and they may be reduced again to <hi>Antimony,</hi> and
Lead, as they were before, and then are no Gla<U+017F>s. Yea <U+017F>ome
products of Art were not <U+017F>o much as materially, as to their
whole, in the matter wrought upon by the Fire, as <hi>Zink</hi> Lead,
and <U+017F>ome other Bodies <U+017F>ome way operated on without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
will not only give Bodies of quite another form, but will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59081:32"/>
be increa<U+017F>ed in weight con<U+017F>iderablely. <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> is an <hi>Acido-Sulphurous</hi>
Sub<U+017F>tance you <U+017F>ay, I <U+017F>ay rather an <hi>Acido-oleous;</hi> for
<hi>Sulphur</hi> is a Body compounded of an <hi>Acid,</hi> and an Oyl, and to
<U+017F>ay <hi>Acido-Sulphurous</hi> is allone, as to <U+017F>ay, <hi>Acido Acido-Oleous.</hi> And
if the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of Animal Fires were a Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi> and
<hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> a Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi> it will follow only, that <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi>
may be a <hi>Pabulum</hi> for Animal Fires (were there any) and not
the Animal Fire it <U+017F>elf. Common <hi>Sulphur, Tallow, Pitch,</hi> abound
with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> you <U+017F>ay; That is <hi>Sulphur</hi> abounds with <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and is inflammable: A Wit! Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> abounds with Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> and
is <U+017F>our; this is deep! <hi>Tallow</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> abound with <hi>Brim<U+017F>tone</hi> too
you fancy, but I'm <U+017F>ure you never got any <hi>Brim<U+017F>tone</hi> from them,
nor can there be any got without the Addition of an <hi>Acid,</hi> if then.
But whether there can be any <hi>Pho<U+017F>phorus</hi> made of the<U+017F>e? I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
yield, there cannot by any Artifice known to Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> but
there are very many things done by Artifice unknown to him.
But you <U+017F>aid Sir, a little before, that <hi>Pho<U+017F>porus</hi> might be got from
all Animal Sub<U+017F>tances; yet now it cannot be got from <hi>Tallow,
&amp;c.</hi> by any Artifice; but you forgot again, that <hi>Tallow</hi> is an
Animal Sub<U+017F>tance; it <U+017F>lip'd your memory, being a grea<U+017F>y body.
Upon <U+017F>troaking of Cats in the dark, fla<U+017F>hes of Fire will follow,
you <U+017F>ay. Your Pu<U+017F>s perhaps may <U+017F>erve you to <U+017F>trike Fire with,
but it will only prove a <hi>Ignis fatui,</hi> which no Wi<U+017F>e Man
would call a Fire, or think actually in the Animal as its Vital
Principle, any more than the <U+017F>hining of a dead and <U+017F>tinking
Whiting, or of a piece of rotten Wood can be thought their life,
or a real Fire. For tho' in the<U+017F>e there is a light; yet there is
wanting the other qualification a burning Heat, as your A<U+017F><U+017F>ertions
Sir, commonly want two things, without which conjunct they
cannot be more than uncertain Fancies, <hi>viz.</hi> Experiment and
Rea<U+017F>on, whereby you <U+017F>hould have examined the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

               <p>By Principles, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, you mean the <U+017F>ame as <U+017F>ome others
do by Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Simple Bodies, of which, all Compounds
are <U+017F>uppos'd to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and into which, they may at la<U+017F>t be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd.
To which, I an<U+017F>wer, That neither the<U+017F>e Five Things
you call Principles, and would have us believe New, and rather
of your Invention, than of Doctor <hi>Andre</hi>'s, nor the Five old ones
(as you call them, between which and yours there is but little
difference) are indeed, the Elements, or Principles of Compound
Bodies, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>olve their <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s: Which may
appear by a little Con<U+017F>ideration. But in the fir<U+017F>t place, I <U+017F>hall
ob<U+017F>erve, that your divi<U+017F>ion of Principles into Active and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive,
is not good, or allowable any farther, than as a compliance with an
improper and vulgar way of <U+017F>peaking: For in <U+017F>trict Speech, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be <U+017F>aid to do, or be Active, but what has a Will, and
tho<U+017F>e Bodies by which we receive the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions on our
Sen<U+017F>es, and have thence been call'd Active, have indeed no more
Will than the other, that's none at all: To be figured, and mov'd
(which is all that belongs to Body) in what manner <U+017F>oever, is not
to Will. As for Earth, I <U+017F>hall next ob<U+017F>erve, That, that which you
call Earth, is not that which is properly call'd the Earth: Your
Earth or <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> being as different almo<U+017F>t, as the Bodies in
which it's found, and con<U+017F>equently not <U+017F>imple, but it <U+017F>elf a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.
That which is properly call'd the Earth, is the Quick-Sand,
of which and Water, this Globe chiefly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts; it being
the Ba<U+017F>is of other Bodies, and <U+017F>eems to be a Body con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of
<hi>Homogeneal</hi> Particles. And as to the Water that is mov'd thro'
the <hi>inter<U+017F>tices</hi> of the<U+017F>e Sands, and is found in the Pores of many
Bodies, and the Air that al<U+017F>o ru<U+017F>heth into all Porous Bodies,
where it can have pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and compa<U+017F><U+017F>eth them about; they are as
it were the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Bodies, them<U+017F>elves probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting
of their peculiar <U+017F>imilar Particles, and are not to be thought
Elements of other Bodies. For in<U+017F>tance, Wood though it is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and <U+017F>ome of its Pores hold Air, <U+017F>ome Water; yet they are
not to be call'd Elements of the Wood, any more than Water
running in a Leaden-Pipe, or Air within the Walls of a Hou<U+017F>e,
are to be called Elements of Lead, or of the Hou<U+017F>e.
The Air, and Water, I <U+017F>ay, are the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of the Particles of
Compound, and changeable Bodies, carrying them to and fro, in
the Production of all the changes we <U+017F>ee them undergo. But to
come to your <U+017F>uppos'd Principles, they will appear not to be the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59081:33"/>
Principles or Elements of Compound Bodies, from the<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Fir<U+017F>t, Whatever are <U+017F>uppos'd as Elements, or
Principles of mix'd Bodies ought <U+017F>ome way or other to be
prov'd really, and actually to Exi<U+017F>t in the Compounds as Parts of
them. 2. They ought to be unchangeable, and con<U+017F>equently
<U+017F>imple Bodies them<U+017F>elves. As to the fir<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>ay, the<U+017F>e Bodies you
call Principles, are not, nor ever were (that we know of) prov'd
<U+017F>o much as likely to Exi<U+017F>t in, and make up <U+017F>ome mix'd Bodies, or
us Principles to be in any. For in<U+017F>tance, Gold is a Body in which
you cannot demon<U+017F>trate, that there is one Grain of <hi>Acid,</hi> or Oyl,
or of <hi>Alkali</hi>-Salt, no nor of Water, or of <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> <U+017F>o far it is
from being to be thought a Compound of your Five Principles.
But I remember, you have a<U+017F><U+017F>erted, <hi>That Gold is nothing but a pure
Acid and Sulphur,</hi> which you <U+017F>aid, <hi>has been made appear, by <U+017F>ome of
the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trict enquirers into Nature's Secrets.</hi> But who tho<U+017F>e were
you won't tell us: But upon this <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, your Five Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are excu<U+017F>ed here. <hi>And the more Acid with Sulphur, any thing
has. the more perfect it is,</hi> you <U+017F>ay. By Sulphur, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, you
mean an inflammable Sub<U+017F>tance, and according to this Fancy, <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone</hi>
which is all <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> would be as perfect as Gold, and
perfecter too, for I'm <U+017F>ure, you never <U+017F>aw any thing inflammable,
or <hi>Acid</hi> in Gold. But the rea<U+017F>on of this your Opinion, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e,
is this, you have a very great kindne<U+017F>s for <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
as much for Gold; therefore Gold is <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur.</hi> Again, you
<U+017F>hall take Chry<U+017F>tal, Talk, Diamonds, Pearls, Mercury, Silver, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Bodies, I might name, and your <U+017F>trict enquirers into
Nature, Dr. <hi>Andre,</hi> and all to help you, <U+017F>hall not be able to <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
any two of your Principles from them. Again, many of tho<U+017F>e
Bodies from which <U+017F>ome, or mo<U+017F>t, of tho<U+017F>e your Principles are
got, may not without <U+017F>ufficient ground, be thought not actually
to contain them <U+017F>uch as they are produc'd, but that they are New
Products, not as to Matter, but as to Form; re<U+017F>ulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
of more <U+017F>imple Particles united together by the violence of
the Fire. As for <hi>Acids,</hi> we well know, there are apparent ones,
Naturally in <U+017F>ome Bodies, Animal and Vegetable, and from others,
produc'd by Art; but even from tho<U+017F>e Bodies, I can ea<U+017F>ily get an
<hi>Alkali</hi> in<U+017F>tead of an <hi>Acid,</hi> when I plea<U+017F>e, without any addition,
merely by the different ways of Working. For in<U+017F>tance, I will
take a quantity of a Green Herb, and divide it into two parts, from
one half I will get an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, from the other half a Volatile
<hi>Alkalous</hi> Salt, merely by Di<U+017F>tillation. So likewi<U+017F>e, I will get a
large quantity of fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> and none or very little Volatile
<hi>Alkali,</hi> or a larger quantity of volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> and little or
no fix'd, which I plea<U+017F>e, from the <U+017F>ame Herb, without any
addition, merely by the different ways of Operating. From
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59081:33"/>
the<U+017F>e and many other Con<U+017F>iderations of Things well known to
Chymi<U+017F>ts, it's highly probable, the<U+017F>e Bodies are rather Products
made by Combinations and Alterations, than the <U+017F>imple Elements
of Bodies. And your a<U+017F><U+017F>erting, That <hi>if Alkali were the product of
Fire, the Caput Mort. burnt again, would produce more Alkali,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak: For the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> has not the matter left whereof to
make it. 2. Principles ought to be unchangeable, or el<U+017F>e they
cannot be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>imple Bodies, but <hi>Acid, Alkali,</hi> Oyl are
changeable. As for an <hi>Acid,</hi> I can change it into an Oyl, or into
an <hi>Alkali.</hi> Oyl I can change into an <hi>Acid,</hi> and into Oyl again,
or into an <hi>Alkali. Alkali,</hi> I can change into an <hi>Acid,</hi> and
then that <hi>Acid,</hi> into an <hi>Alkali</hi> again. Which things are <U+017F>o well
known to all that de<U+017F>erve the name of Chymi<U+017F>ts, I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es; and as for tho<U+017F>e that don't under<U+017F>tand Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try,
it is be<U+017F>ides my purpo<U+017F>e, here to teach them. But as for
you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' you may think your <U+017F>elf uncapable of being
Tran<U+017F>muted into an <hi>Alkali</hi>-Doctor, becau<U+017F>e <hi>The making Acids Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and Alkalies Acids, is contrary to your Experience, or the producing
Alkalies or Acids out of tho<U+017F>e Bodies, in which they did not Exi<U+017F>t:</hi> I
can <U+017F>hew you <U+017F>uch an Experiment at any time, and then you are
oblig'd upon your Word, <hi>to own your <U+017F>elf my humble Servant.</hi> As
to the Accounting for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Natural Bodies from <hi>Acid,
Sulphur, Alkali,</hi> &amp;c. they will <U+017F>oon appear too narrow, and in<U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
(e<U+017F>pecially if we could take them for <U+017F>imple Bodies) to any
Con<U+017F>iderate Per<U+017F>on that does not <U+017F>erve an Hypothe<U+017F>is. I challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man for in<U+017F>tance to give me a rea<U+017F>on of the following <hi>Phaenomona,</hi>
from the mixture of any of your Principles. Fir<U+017F>t in Vegitable,
or Animal Poy<U+017F>ons, how a very <U+017F>mall quantity of matter, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not the hundredth part of a Grain <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
various, and <U+017F>uddain effects from any mixture of <hi>Acid, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the<U+017F>e in them<U+017F>elves may be took <U+017F>eparate,
yea or conjunct, however we can joyn them again in con<U+017F>iderable
quantities without any harm. What Hypothetick could ever make
a mixture of <hi>Acid, Alkali,</hi> Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have the effects of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
or of a Cathartick Drugg, that I have known work <U+017F>o vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
as to bring a Man exceeding weak, by only holding it in
his Mouth a Minute or two, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>pitting it out. The <U+017F>ame
may be <U+017F>aid of <hi>Specificks,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> him<U+017F>elf in a little
fit of con<U+017F>ideration, has own'd, <hi>There are many that are niether</hi>
Alkalies <hi>nor</hi> Acids, <hi>yet <U+017F>eldom fail of curing Di<U+017F>tempers. Should he
deny the Doctrine of Specifiks,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>he <U+017F>hould deny matter of fact,
which he promi<U+017F>es never to do, till he is totally deprived of his Rea<U+017F>on:</hi>
And gives us <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tances of the Operations of <hi>Specificks,</hi> which
cannot be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to proceed from their being <hi>Acids</hi> or <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
Another In<U+017F>tance wherein the<U+017F>e Principles will be found
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59081:34"/>
<U+017F>hort, is the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Magneti<U+017F>m; to name one thing, Take
a Load-<U+017F>tone and rub one end of a poi<U+017F>ed Needle on the North
Pole of the Stone, you will find that Point will be attracted to
the <U+017F>ame Pole when ever it is brought near it: But offer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Needle to that <U+017F>ame Pole, it will be driven from
the Stone as much as the other rub'd end is attracted; but force
the end that is driven off, to the North Pole of the Stone, and
keep it there <U+017F>ome time, it will be attracted as much as it was
driven away before, and the end that was fir<U+017F>t attracted will be
driven away. Now here can be no conceivable alteration of the
proportions of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> or any other of your <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
Principles in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, by the bare contract of the Needle
and Load-<U+017F>tone, and this done at plea<U+017F>ure, without the lea<U+017F>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the texture of the Needle or Load-<U+017F>tone. Again the
gravity of Gold can no way be accounted for, by <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
how<U+017F>oever of your Principles; this Mettal being heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than either of them, more than as twenty to three, <U+017F>o far is
it from con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of meet <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as Mr. <hi>A<U+017F>s-Ey'd</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>eydly
a<U+017F><U+017F>erts; The heavie<U+017F>t <hi>Acid</hi> commonly known being lighter than
this Metal about eighteen times, and <hi>Sulphur</hi> not much heavier.
Now it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that two light Bodies <U+017F>hould compo<U+017F>e a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
one. I might recite many other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Bodies no way
to be accounted for by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed Principles; as in Colours in
the Rain-bow, in the pri<U+017F>me and even permanent ones, as in the
foremention'd Metal, which cannot receive its colour from things
which on the account of their lightne<U+017F>s, can be no Ingredients of
it. I might al<U+017F>o demand the rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ounds, their Harmonies
or Di<U+017F>cords; but I <U+017F>hould tempt our Hypothetick Oracles in vain.
But I think I have more rea<U+017F>on to conclude, that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of Bodily Nature, or the different Ideas we receive from Bodies
depend upon, or re<U+017F>ult from a far greater difference, and variety
of Figures, Sizes, Textures, and Motions of the Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
created at the beginning, of all Sorts and Sizes to us innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
From the Adhe<U+017F>ions and Combinations of <U+017F>ometimes more,
<U+017F>ometimes fewer of the<U+017F>e Simple Particles, all the varieties of mix'd
Bodies re<U+017F>ult. Where there are Particles together, who<U+017F>e Figures
are more or le<U+017F>s apt for Motion, there is a Body more or le<U+017F>s flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id.
Where the Particles hang together, and are more or le<U+017F>s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
for motion, there is a Body more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>olid. Where are
fewer of the Simple Particles, there is a Body le<U+017F>s compounded.
Where there are more <U+017F>orts of differing Particles, there the Body
is more compounded. Where there is a congeries of Particles
of one Figure, there is a Simple Body; as probably the Particles
of Air and Water may be, tho they do not touch one another
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59081:34"/>
exactly, or re<U+017F>t together, and <U+017F>o are porous and fluid, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of receiving other Bodies into their Pores. And perhaps <U+017F>ome
other Bodies, who<U+017F>e Particles firmly adhere, and <U+017F>o are call'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
may al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of <U+017F>imilar Particles. This innumerable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is large enough to make all the mo<U+017F>t odd properties of Bodies.
The Divi<U+017F>ions and Combinations of the<U+017F>e Simple Particles by Art
(tho' perhaps <U+017F>eldom or never divided into <U+017F>ets Similar or Simple)
is that whereby all the Artificial new re<U+017F>ulting Bodies are made.
But a <U+017F>ingle Particle, let it be of what Figure or <U+017F>ize it will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed capable to be divided; becau<U+017F>e it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of
pure Matter continuous, and not of Parts meerly contiguous; and
<U+017F>o there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or room for any other Body to come in
to divide it, as there is between the contiguous parts of Matter.
And tho' the lea<U+017F>t Particle in Nature might be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
or Imaginarily divi<U+017F>ible; yet really and Phy<U+017F>ically the
greate<U+017F>t Particle cannot be <U+017F>o thought; tho' <U+017F>ome incon<U+017F>iderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a<U+017F><U+017F>ert a Phy<U+017F>ical infinite Divi<U+017F>ibility. I <U+017F>hould her leave your
Principles to their Ma<U+017F>ter; with the<U+017F>e few Con<U+017F>iderations, but that
poor <hi>Alkali</hi> is <U+017F>o abu<U+017F>ed by you, there needs a word or two here

<U+017F>oft and tender Matter: Man's Mind is a fooli<U+017F>h and violent

would have de<U+017F>troy'd even <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, could they have
been, where was no culpable defect in Wi<U+017F>dom and Goodne<U+017F>s;
without <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing a Principle of Death. As Chri<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in
whom there was no Sin, was found capable of Bodily Mi<U+017F>eries,
and a Violent Death. Swords and Pi<U+017F>tols, and other the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Man's Cruelty, are not the only things, whereby a Man's
Life may be de<U+017F>troy'd in a <U+017F>hort time, but the mo<U+017F>t innocent

As I once knew a Woman by eating Bread very freely, got <U+017F>uch
a Di<U+017F>temper, that broke out in large Boils in many parts of her

where one Per<U+017F>on dies by the abu<U+017F>e of the Creature <hi>Alkali,</hi> there
are ten that lo<U+017F>e their Lives by your beloved Principles <hi>Acid</hi> and

find, that tho' <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> are both good Creatures, ordain'd

                  <hi>Acids</hi> hinder Putrefaction, and reduce things from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
already Putrify'd, and <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be great Medicines: For
there's no Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e but proceeds from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of Putrefaction of

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59081:36"/>
Animal Sub<U+017F>tances from Corruption and Stench, and if Dead,
Bodies were full of <hi>Acids,</hi> it is difficult to conceive how they
could <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon Putrefie; nay, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible they <U+017F>hou'd. For
<hi>Acids</hi> can't undergo Putrefaction. And the more perfect, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
any Vegitable is, the greater quantity of <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
it affords, and the le<U+017F>s of excrementious <hi>Alkali: Alkalies</hi> pre<U+017F>ently
cau<U+017F>e Rottenne<U+017F>s and Putrefaction in Animal Sub<U+017F>tances, as may
be <U+017F>een in making of Glovers Leather: Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> a Glover of
<hi>Worce<U+017F>ter,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t Ingenious Man, perhaps, that ever was of his
Trade, he being (which is very <U+017F>trange for a Man of <U+017F>o Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
a mean Trade) a curious Phylo<U+017F>opher; tells me, that in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Leather, they fir<U+017F>t throw their Skins into a Pit fill'd with a
<U+017F>trong <hi>Alkalious lixivium,</hi> which makes them in a manner Rotten:
After they make a <U+017F>trong <hi>Acid</hi> Solution, into which they throw
their almo<U+017F>t rotten Skins, which again reduces them to their
Texture; nay, makes them firmer than they were at fir<U+017F>t.
From whence it may be naturally inferr'd, that <hi>Alkalies</hi> break
the Texture, and de<U+017F>troy the parts of Animal Sub<U+017F>tances, and
moderate <hi>Acids</hi> pre<U+017F>erve them, and re<U+017F>tore them to their Tone
and Texture, when they are before <U+017F>poiled by <hi>Alkalies.</hi> Nay,
<hi>Alkali</hi> is the onely de<U+017F>troyer of all Bodies, and what brings
them to a <U+017F>tate of Putrefaction and Corruption. Again, <hi>Acids</hi>

Liquors, as is too well known by the Brewers of this
Town. <hi>Alkalies</hi> are the cau<U+017F>e of all Praeternatural Heats in

<hi>Acids</hi> are the only things that quench Thir<U+017F>t. Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is
one of the be<U+017F>t Medicines known, in continual Feavers. <hi>Acids</hi>
are the mo<U+017F>t Effectual things in the World to ea<U+017F>e Pains, and if
Pain be cau<U+017F>ed by <hi>Acids,</hi> it is by giving them in too <U+017F>mall
a quantity. <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> is Cau<U+017F>tick, and burns the Skin. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

An Ingenious Per<U+017F>on, not long <U+017F>ince, who had formerly

the Transfu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors into the Veins of

               <p>How <hi>Acids</hi> hinder Putrefaction in Animal Sub<U+017F>tances, any
one may <U+017F>ee by ea<U+017F>ie Experiments; Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or Spirit of
<hi>Nitre.</hi> pour'd upon the red part of Blood, pre<U+017F>ently turns it into
a black Corruption, and the <hi>Serum</hi> into a white purulent Matter:
So Leather, Bladder, Fle<U+017F>h, Tendons, Skin, have their Texture
de<U+017F>troy'd by the<U+017F>e <hi>Acids,</hi> and are Rotted and turn'd into a puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Matter; yea, the very Bones are di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd by <hi>Acid</hi> Liquors:
So far are <hi>Acids</hi> from hindering the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the Texture of
Animal Sub<U+017F>tances; much le<U+017F>s will they do the Miracle of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
things already Putrefy'd, from Putrefaction, and <U+017F>o, being
<U+017F>uch great Medicines. And as incon<U+017F>iderate, have you <U+017F>hewn your
<U+017F>elf Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> in a<U+017F><U+017F>erting all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to proceed from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort
of Putrefaction of the Fluids of our Bodies: For if there be ever
any <U+017F>uch thing as Putrefaction in the Juices of the Body, it can't
be reckon'd the Cau<U+017F>e from whence a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeds; but
the Effect or Product of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: But there are many Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es,
where there has not been one Rational Argument, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Experiment given to per<U+017F>wade a Putrefaction of Humours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<U+017F>o call'd, <U+017F>o much as an Effect. The difficulty of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dead Bodies impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be Putrefy'd, if full of <hi>Acids;</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Mr. <hi>Acid:</hi> Others know very well, that even tho<U+017F>e Animals
that abound <U+017F>o much with <hi>Acid,</hi> that in Di<U+017F>tillation, they will
yield one half of their weight of a <U+017F>trong <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
Putrefie, and that as <U+017F>oon, or <U+017F>ooner, than <U+017F>ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abounding with <hi>Alkali.</hi> And that a Man's Body may be kept
without Putrifaction, or Stench a Thou<U+017F>and Years, without the
help of <hi>Acids:</hi> Yea, <hi>Alkalies</hi> them<U+017F>elves, we know, are great
Pre<U+017F>ervatives of Fle<U+017F>h and Blood, if u<U+017F>ed in due quantity, from
Corruption and Stench: As the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> tells you,
in his Book <hi>Of Humane Blood,</hi> pag. 142. Where twelve Drachms
of Blood, were put up with two Drachms of Spirit of Blood, and
was thereby pre<U+017F>erv'd a Year, of a florid colour, almo<U+017F>t totally
Fluid, had no ill Scent, or any <U+017F>ign of Putrefaction, and it
would no doubt, have pre<U+017F>erv'd it much longer. In which Book,
he al<U+017F>o gives an account, of divers con<U+017F>iderable good Effects of
the u<U+017F>e of the Spirit of Humane Blood, as a Medicine, inwardly
and outwardly, in in<U+017F>tances too long here to be recited; and tells
you, <hi>pag. 206.</hi> That Volatile <hi>Alkalies</hi> in general, had been pro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perou<U+017F>ly
u<U+017F>ed in Phy<U+017F>ick in <hi>England,</hi> <U+017F>ince the Year 1656. about
which time, he had the good Fortune, to contribute <U+017F>o to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them, as to bring them by degrees into reque<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ees
<U+017F>mall cau<U+017F>e to doubt, but that they would be more generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem'd,
and employ'd. The Judgment of which every way
Learned Per<U+017F>on, can hardly be oppos'd to a young <hi>Medica<U+017F>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59081:37"/>
without dimini<U+017F>hing him. The truth of who<U+017F>e Narratives, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, known to him, are beyond que<U+017F>tion, to any that
knew him, as I not only well did, but was either an A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant, or
Beholder in the making tho<U+017F>e Experiments, that are the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
of that U<U+017F>eful Book <hi>of Humane Blood.</hi> To this may be added, the
method of Pre<U+017F>erving Dead Bodies of Dr. <hi>Gabriel Clauder,</hi> recited
in the <hi>Memorials for the Ingenious, Oct. 30. 1882.</hi> Which is with
a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Oak</hi> A<U+017F>hes, and <hi>Sal armoniack,</hi> in which, both a
fix'd and volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> are conjoin'd, and found to go beyond
mo<U+017F>t former Methods of Embalming. And tho' <hi>Acid</hi> Salts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
won't undergo a proper Putrefaction; yet Vegetables, that
yield mo<U+017F>t of <hi>Acid,</hi> and Oyl in Di<U+017F>tillation, will Rot as <U+017F>oon, or
<U+017F>ooner than <U+017F>ome others: Yea, Crabbs, Oranges, and Lemons,
every Boy knows, will Rot <U+017F>ooner than <U+017F>ome Apples that are not
<U+017F>our, and many of tho<U+017F>e Vegetables that yield mo<U+017F>t <hi>Acid,</hi> by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will yield the greate<U+017F>t quantity of fix'd <hi>Alkali;</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
is as far from being capable of Putrefaction as any <hi>Acid,</hi> or of
Rotting the Coal in which it lies; tho' it has lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>uppos'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving
<hi>Acid.</hi> But the chief ground of your Belief, that <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
will pre<U+017F>ently Rot and Putrefie Animal Sub<U+017F>tances; I find, is a
<U+017F>tory you heard (but could not well remember) from your curious
Philo<U+017F>opher and Country-Man, Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> the Glover of <hi>Worce<U+017F>ter,</hi>
who may be a good Glover, for ought I know; but I'm <U+017F>ure,
you have not learn'd Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of Leather of him (whether it be
his fault or yours) any better than you did <hi>Pharmacy</hi> of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
the Apothecary. As for Philo<U+017F>ophy, whether the Glover or
you be the Ma<U+017F>ter, I know not, but probably he might teach you
the Four Years, you out-did the Apothecary; but I believe you
are both Philo<U+017F>ophers of the <U+017F>ame Pitch. But as to Leather-Dre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing,
the <U+017F>trong <hi>Lixivium</hi> you talk of (to help your Memory) I tell
you is <hi>Lime,</hi> which is not u<U+017F>ed to Rot the Skins, in order to make
them the <U+017F>tronger (the Glover knows better) but to get off the
Wool, or Hair. And tho' by letting the Skins lie in the Lime-Pit
too long, they may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be <U+017F>poiled beyond the recovery of
all the <hi>Acids</hi> in the World; yet we all know, that Lime-Water is
but a mild <hi>Alkali,</hi> and a Medicine of great u<U+017F>e in Chirurgery, and
is <U+017F>o far from having any cau<U+017F>tick, or violent Effect, on Living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
that it may be <U+017F>afely, and to good purpo<U+017F>e u<U+017F>ed even in <hi>Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmicks,</hi>
being a mild Remedy not <U+017F>o much as making the Eye,
that mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Part, to <U+017F>mart; and not only <U+017F>o, but may
be u<U+017F>ed to good purpo<U+017F>e inwardly in <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>tempers, without any
fear of rotting one's Belly, or making Leather of it; tho' you give
an <hi>Acid</hi> afterwards. But what you take for the <hi>Acid</hi> Solution,
I am not certain, whether the infu<U+017F>ion of Bran they u<U+017F>e, or the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59081:37"/>
                  <hi>Allum</hi>-Water. The fir<U+017F>t we know becomes very <U+017F>our, and if the
Skins lie in it too long, will indeed rot and <U+017F>poil them beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
but the <hi>Allum</hi> is not an <hi>Acid,</hi> as you may find by its turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green, which it will <U+017F>oon do; nor has it
any of the Effects of an <hi>Acid:</hi> For tho' an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit may be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>till'd
from it, there's no <U+017F>uch heat in Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of Leather, as can
<U+017F>eparate the <hi>Acid</hi> from the Chalkey Sub<U+017F>tance, with which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<U+017F>aturated, and made uncapable of having any operation as
an <hi>Acid</hi> upon the Skins. But <hi>Allum</hi> is u<U+017F>ed in making of Leather,
on the account of its A<U+017F>tringency to make the Skins more compact,
and the <hi>Acid</hi> before u<U+017F>ed, is wa<U+017F>h'd out, and not left in the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Pre<U+017F>ervative again<U+017F>t Corruption, which every Body
may ea<U+017F>ily try, and <U+017F>ee <U+017F>oon brought upon Leather, by even a
mild <hi>Acid;</hi> <U+017F>o far is your Inference from being Rational, or grounded
upon Experiment, That <hi>Alkalies</hi> break and de<U+017F>troy Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances:
But <hi>Acids</hi> do the Miracles of reducing them when rotted
and <U+017F>poil'd, <hi>a priviatione ad habitum,</hi> or from Rottenne<U+017F>s to Integrity.
And let me ask you here Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> if you are <hi>Mentis compos,</hi> if all <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies</hi>
break the Texture, and de<U+017F>troy the Parts of Animal Sub<U+017F>tances;
How does the Bladder, the Veins, the <hi>Ve<U+017F>ica Fellis,</hi> &amp;c. hold out
forty, fifty, <U+017F>ixty, <U+017F>eventy Years, again<U+017F>t this Corrupter in Sickne<U+017F>s,
and in Health, and come to be found <U+017F>trong, and entire after
Death? And how do the Bones that have no <hi>Acid,</hi> but abound with
<hi>Alkali,</hi> remain <U+017F>o firm, and entire; when the Coffins made of Oak,
or the more re<U+017F>inous Fir with all their <hi>Acids</hi> and Oyl, are rotten
and con<U+017F>um'd? But what follows, That <hi>Alkali</hi> is the onely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troyer
of all Bodies, and that which brings them to a State of
Putrefaction, and Corruption, is <U+017F>o Extravagant, one might <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
you delirious; but I would ask you, if out of your Paroxy<U+017F>me,
did you ever <U+017F>ee Gold, Silver, Stones, Sand, to which <hi>Alkali</hi>
is <U+017F>trictly bound in <hi>Gla<U+017F>s, Mercury,</hi> and a Thou<U+017F>and other Bodies I
might name, de<U+017F>troy'd and brought to a State of Putrefaction by
<hi>Alkalies?</hi> Could you prove your Words, you would per<U+017F>wade us,
that <hi>Alkali</hi> is the univer<U+017F>al Di<U+017F><U+017F>olvent, and that Fire de<U+017F>troyeth
nothing. Well but another mi<U+017F>chief of <hi>Alkali</hi> is it excites Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in fermentable Liquors: I tell you 'tis well it will do <U+017F>o, and
that the Brewers know it; for we <U+017F>hould have but bad Drink without
Fermentation: But I know, you are no Ma<U+017F>ter-Brewer, any more
than a Ma<U+017F>ter in Leather-Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing; if you were, you would know,
you could have no Vinegar without Fermentation, and that no
Liquors can Ferment, but tho<U+017F>e wherein are Materially both <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
and <hi>Acid,</hi> and that all Fermentable Liquors, at length turn <hi>Acid.
Alkalies</hi>
again, <U+017F>ay you, are the cau<U+017F>e of all Praeternatural Heats;
I an<U+017F>wer, not till they meet with <hi>Acids,</hi> which may as well be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59081:38"/>
<U+017F>aid, to be the cau<U+017F>e of the Heat excited between them, as the
<hi>Alkalies.</hi> Vinegar may be good in Inflammations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <U+017F>o may
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> <U+017F>ay I, which I have u<U+017F>ed with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in the <hi>Eri<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas.</hi>
Neither are <hi>Acids</hi> the only things will quench Thir<U+017F>t: For
Water is the only thing Nature requires, to allay a Natural
Thir<U+017F>t, which is nothing but the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the <hi>Latex</hi> being deficient;
and Thir<U+017F>t in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, is <U+017F>ooner allay'd by <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other
neutral Salts, than by all your <hi>Acids.</hi> Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> may be the
be<U+017F>t Medicine in continual Feavers, you know, in the World, I
will grant; but I know a better, and it is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and <U+017F>uch an
one, as you ne'er <U+017F>aw. As for ea<U+017F>ing Pain by <hi>Acids,</hi> let any one
try on a <hi>Cancer,</hi> or other painful Sore, or on a Wound: You may
try your Tincture, as you call it, but try it on your own Fle<U+017F>h, and
you will <U+017F>oon be convinc'd of the contrary, and the more you u<U+017F>e
the wor<U+017F>e; unle<U+017F>s you mortifie the Part, then indeed, the pain is <U+017F>o
far over, as the Mortification goes. But as to inward Medicines, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Body knows, a little <hi>Opium,</hi> will do more in ea<U+017F>ing Pain, than
a large quantity of <hi>Acid;</hi> if it were true, That <hi>Acid</hi> would ea<U+017F>e
Pain, and <hi>Opium</hi> does not ea<U+017F>e Pain by any Acidity in it, as is ea<U+017F>ily
demon<U+017F>trable. But I have found by long Experience, on my <U+017F>elf, and
others, That <hi>Alkalies,</hi> in <U+017F>ome Ca<U+017F>es, are more powerful to ea<U+017F>e
Pain, than almo<U+017F>t any thing el<U+017F>e; as in the Tooth-Ach, which I have
been often troubled with. Strong fix'd <hi>Alkalies,</hi> every Body knows,
apply'd alone to the Skin, are Cau<U+017F>tick, and <U+017F>o are <hi>Acids,</hi> as Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi>
Butyr of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and the <hi>Lunar</hi> Cau<U+017F>tick. But no <hi>Alkalies</hi>
are to be taken inwardly without being Diluted with an <hi>Aqueous Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle;</hi>
being too keen for the Parts they are to pa<U+017F>s: So are <hi>Acids,</hi>
which without being given in a <hi>Vehicle</hi> that mitigates them, will
even corrode the Mouth, <hi>Pharynx</hi> and Stomach; and both <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
and <hi>Acid,</hi> imoderately and unduely given, will deprave the
Stomach. For I have known tho<U+017F>e troubled with <U+017F>our Stomachs,
yet want an Appetite, as well as a good Dige<U+017F>tion. That you <U+017F>ay,
<hi>Alkalies</hi> being convey'd into the Blood, and breaking its <hi>Globules,</hi>
cau<U+017F>e <hi>Scorbutes, Rheumati<U+017F>mes,</hi> &amp;c. is but mere fancy (if it be <U+017F>o
much) without ground: For you ne'er <U+017F>aw, or heard of any of
tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, caus'd by giving <hi>Alkalies.</hi> As for the injection of
Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> into the Veins of a Dog, making him brisk and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> into the other Dog's Veins, making him
heavy, and at la<U+017F>t killing him: You warily conceal who the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Per<U+017F>on was; but we have the <U+017F>ame Story in <hi>Etmuller</hi>'s Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
<hi>de Chirurgia Infu<U+017F>oria,</hi> Cap. 10. And he was a more Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious
Per<U+017F>on, than to embrace the Doctrine of <hi>Acids,</hi> or <hi>Alkalies</hi>
either, or any <U+017F>uch little Hypothetick fancy of a <hi>Tyro,</hi> and Dy'd
too long agoe, to be one of your Di<U+017F>ciples; as you would willingly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59081:38"/>
have us believe, the Ingenious Per<U+017F>on to be. But he does not
tell you, that he made the Experiment him<U+017F>elf, but relating the
pernicious Effects of the Infu<U+017F>ion of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> from <hi>Fraca<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
he <U+017F>ubjoins that of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> not killing, but <U+017F>eeming to
make the Dog hungry. And this Relation, <U+017F>ays he, may <U+017F>eem
<U+017F>trange, to him that con<U+017F>iders the great affinity of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi>
and Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that they <U+017F>hould produce <U+017F>uch different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
But being animated, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by a certain Friend, I made
the Experiment, and injected <hi>
                     <g ref="char:dram"><U+0292></g>j.</hi> of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur per Camp.</hi> in <hi><U+2125>j.</hi>
of Water, and having made a convenient <hi>Ligature,</hi> let the Dog
loo<U+017F>e; from whence he <U+017F>oon began to have a <U+017F>hort Breath, and to
be troubled with <hi>Convul<U+017F>ions,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially of his Mouth, with a great
deal of Froth, which continu'd till he was as it were <U+017F>trangl'd,
and <U+017F>o Dy'd in half an Hour's time, a great deal of thin red Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flowing out of his Mouth, when he was Dead, with a great
deal of Froth <U+017F>wimming upon it. He gives a particular Account of
what various Di<U+017F>orders were found in Di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting him, too long here
to Relate; but he concludes thus, It <U+017F>eems that the Blood by the
injection of the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> being made thick, unfit for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
<U+017F>tagnated in the Lungs, and there by the Motion of the
Air was turn'd into Froth, and Red <hi>Serum,</hi> and being driven on
into the <U+017F>maller Arteries, and thence into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> nothing
could Circulate through the Lungs; from whence the <hi>Vi<U+017F>cera,</hi> and
greater Branches of the Arteries were found empty. So far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
is the Account of this Experiment he made him<U+017F>elf, from
what he had, as a Relation, which we may therefore que<U+017F>tion.
But as for Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> whereby another Dog was Kill'd, not
mentioning the quantity injected; he tells us, the Blood was
made very Red, and more Fluid, than u<U+017F>ual: From whence
<U+017F>aies he, it appears, that too much coagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation of the Blood, like
as too much Di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of it, does Kill. He al<U+017F>o gives an Account of
the Injection of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and Sp. of <hi>Nitre;</hi> both which <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kill, Coagulating the Blood: And from all which, every Man
that can rea<U+017F>on, may certainly conclude, that the thinning of the
Blood by <hi>Alkalies</hi> can't be the Cau<U+017F>e of of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. And
you Mr. <hi>Alkali,</hi> as <U+017F>harp as you would <U+017F>eem, I believe, will find
it yet more difficult <U+017F>till, to make your fancy of <hi>Alkali's</hi> being

               <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing I begin with, is the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> that fatal
Di<U+017F>temper to Three Kingdoms, and even to all <hi>Europe</hi> in that by
the means of it, God was plea<U+017F>ed to deprive us of a Prince<U+017F>s who<U+017F>e
worth was <U+017F>uch, as a <U+017F>ufficient value can never be <U+017F>et upon it, or Lo<U+017F>s
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59081:39"/>
<U+017F>ufficiently Lamented. 'Tis the common Practice of Nur<U+017F>es, and
the generality of Practitioners, as <U+017F>oon as they perceive the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of this Di<U+017F>temper, to give <hi>Ga<U+017F>coin's,</hi> Counte<U+017F>s of <hi>Kent</hi>'s <hi>Lapis
de Goa,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other Te<U+017F>taceous Powders, known <hi>Alkalies:</hi> The
one Party to drive the malignity from the Heart, in which it's
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any malignity to lodg, more than in any other Part,
by rea<U+017F>on the Blood moves at lea<U+017F>t tentimes fa<U+017F>ter through the Heart,
than any other Part, the Lungs excepted: For the Cavities being
large no Stagnation is to be feared; but if any where, it is in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Parts, where the Blood moves <U+017F>lowly. The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ort, give
them to correct the Acidity, they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e to be in the Blood. Now
I could never hear of any one, that by Analizeing the Blood in
the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> could find the lea<U+017F>t foot<U+017F>teps of <hi>Acidity</hi> (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hinted) but on the contrary, it appears after many tryals,
That the Blood of <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>ons, does more abound with <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Particles than that of <U+017F>ound People: So in this Ca<U+017F>e, the giving of
<hi>Alkalies</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uperfluous, if not highly pernicious. The
Cau<U+017F>es of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> with mo<U+017F>t other Feavers, and acute
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e to be from a quantity of <U+017F>uch Particles, being
<U+017F>ome way or other admitted into the Blood, which being Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous,
or of a quite different Texture from that of the Blood,
and <U+017F>o not capable of being mixed with it, cau<U+017F>es a hurry and
di<U+017F>order. Now a <hi>Feaver</hi> always preceeds the eruption of the
Pu<U+017F>tles, and when the Heterogeneous Particles are thrown out to
the <U+017F>urface, then the <hi>Feaver</hi> cea<U+017F>es. Now to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t Nature in
throwing out the<U+017F>e Heterogeneous Particles, which they pretend,
are hindred by <hi>Acids</hi> in the Blood, they give Te<U+017F>taceous Powders,
and other <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> which <U+017F>eldom fail of their intention, of
throwing out large quantities of Pu<U+017F>tles, more than Nature is able
to bring to maturity, and if <U+017F>hedoes chance to Cope with them, is
the only occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>poiling <U+017F>o many Angelick Faces, we every
Day ob<U+017F>erve. But that is not all, but by <hi>Alkalies</hi> the <hi>Globules</hi> of
the Blood are broken; when as the Excrementitious <hi>Serum</hi> only,
ought to be <U+017F>eparated, according to the Rules of Nature, and not
the lea<U+017F>t Drop of Blood, when in its Natural State, and its <hi>Globules</hi>
unbroken. But by the means of <hi>Alkalies</hi> the Globules being
broken, are made capable of being receiv'd into the cutaneous
Glands, which is the occa<U+017F>ion of the purple Spots in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
and <hi>Feavers,</hi> which ne'er fail of being the certain Progno<U+017F>ticators
of Death. But this is not all, tho<U+017F>e broken <hi>Globules</hi> getting into
the <hi>Maeanders</hi> of the Brain, hinder the motion of the Animal Spirits
through the Nerves, and cau<U+017F>e <hi>Deliriums,</hi> and all tho<U+017F>e fatal Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Brain too frequently <U+017F>een: Likewi<U+017F>e the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of being contained in its proper Channel, is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
of violent Bleedings, bloody-Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None of the be<U+017F>t

Symptoms. Be<U+017F>ides, by their <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> quality they wa<U+017F>te the
<hi>Serum</hi> that there is not <U+017F>ufficient left to <U+017F>upply and bring to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the Pu<U+017F>tles, tho<U+017F>e Medicines alone had thrown out: So about
the <hi>9th. 11th.</hi> or <hi>13th.</hi> Day, the Pu<U+017F>tles fall, and the <hi>Acrid</hi> Matter
being ab<U+017F>orb'd into the Veins, Cau<U+017F>es <hi>Secondary Feavers,</hi> of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Con<U+017F>equence: The <hi>Small Pox</hi> requires the giving as few Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
as any Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e what<U+017F>oever, unle<U+017F>s in extraordinary Ca<U+017F>es:
Yet the Eye of a careful Phy<U+017F>ician, is as convenient as in any. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I have heard <U+017F>ome complain, <U+017F>uch a Doctor had <U+017F>o many
Fees, and yet never Wrot a Bill: But let me tell them, in many Ca<U+017F>es,
e<U+017F>pecially in this, the Phy<U+017F>ician de<U+017F>erves his Fees better for not
Writting at all, than for <U+017F>o doing. In this Di<U+017F>temper, <hi>Acids</hi> are the
things skilfully and timely given, which I have <U+017F>een not only by
my own, but other Great Men's Practice, to be the onely <U+017F>afe,
effectual, and never erring Medicines. And why <U+017F>hould we fly to
<hi>Acids</hi> Chymically prepar'd, when Nature has provided Oranges and
Lemons, Citrons and Limes, which an<U+017F>wer our intentions? For in
Five Hundred, at lea<U+017F>t Patients I have had, of all Qualities to do
with in this Di<U+017F>temper, where I have been call'd in the beginning,
I don't know, that I have had one that has Dy'd, or been Disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd:
Nay, <U+017F>ome that have been brought into ill Cirum<U+017F>tances
by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I have retriev'd from the Jaws of Death by proper
<hi>Acids.</hi> To allay the hurry of the Blood, and to confirm its Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I give Juice of Oranges, Lemons, Limes in Barley-water, or
Small-Beer, acidulated with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Vinegar, or Verjuice
Po<U+017F><U+017F>et-Drink: If the Brain be di<U+017F>turb'd, and the Patient Delirious,
I find it ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to let Blood in good quantities, and
u<U+017F>e more powerful <hi>Acids,</hi> which <U+017F>ets all to rights. So the method
I take in the Cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, being according to Nature's
Dictates, is <U+017F>hort and ea<U+017F>ie: It being in the Cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
as in the accounting for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature; they that go
upon fewe<U+017F>t Principles, generally Di<U+017F>cover mo<U+017F>t of her Secrets,
and can give the be<U+017F>t Account of them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> has been Fatal to <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Princes, more than
once; tho' not <U+017F>o much in it <U+017F>elf, as through the ill Practice of
Ignorant, or wor<U+017F>e Phy<U+017F>icians: But that God <U+017F>hou'd be pleas'd
with any Evil, be the Cau<U+017F>e, or Sender of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or the Taker
away of any <U+017F>uch Good, whereby Obedience to his Laws, might
be promoted; I think, cannot be believ'd, but by incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Sinners, looking on God, as if he were like them<U+017F>elves. If I
did believe, that the Sickne<U+017F>s of him that is Sick, and the Death
of him that Dies, were the po<U+017F>itive Will of God, I think, I <U+017F>hou'd
be wicked, as well as fooli<U+017F>h, in endeavouring to Heal. But it's
common with Phy<U+017F>icians, when through their Ignorance, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59081:40"/>
or other fault the Patient Dies, injuriou<U+017F>ly to <U+017F>ay, God
took them away, and dareingly to lay their own faults upon their
Maker. As for Nur<U+017F>es giving Te<U+017F>taceous Powders to drive Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
from the Heart, I have nothing to <U+017F>ay, towards their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
'Tis Phy<U+017F>icians bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to look to them, that they
onely obey their Directions, and do their proper Office: Nur<U+017F>es
know not what Malignity is, and you need not prove to them,
that there can't be Malignity in the Heart, any more than any where
el<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>o likely, as in the Extremities. But the Rea<U+017F>on you give,
tho' it might <U+017F>erve Nur<U+017F>es (who may believe any thing) if you
offer it to Phy<U+017F>icians, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Blood moves ten times fa<U+017F>ter
through the Heart, than any other Part (but the Lungs) <U+017F>hews
your great Ignorance and incon<U+017F>ideratene<U+017F>s. If you but count
the Pul<U+017F>es of your Heart and Wri<U+017F>t, you will <U+017F>oon find your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>take:
And if the Blood <U+017F>hou'd move fa<U+017F>ter through the Heart
(as you fancy) than through other Parts, it Circulation could not
continue, the Fountain being empty'd fa<U+017F>ter, than again <U+017F>upply'd.
As for the u<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e Powders, you call Te<U+017F>taceous, by Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
whom you honourably place, Second to Nur<U+017F>es, and I <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
Third to your <U+017F>elf, I think, none of them <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>h, as to
give them to correct <hi>Acidity</hi> in the Blood, any otherwi<U+017F>e, than by
<hi>Ab<U+017F>orbing</hi> it in the Stomach. [And Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> him<U+017F>elf once told
us, <hi>That none pretend Crab's-Eyes, Pearl, Corral,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be u<U+017F>eful
any farther, than to ab<U+017F>orb</hi> Acids <hi>in the Stomach,</hi> where we know,
and you grant, it is <U+017F>ometimes too much,] and <U+017F>o hindring a <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Veins: Where tho' you could never find any,
I have told you the Rea<U+017F>on before, and how it's Demon<U+017F>trated,
that there is an <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood. I have al<U+017F>o an<U+017F>wer'd already,
your A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion that the Blood of Per<U+017F>ons in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> abounds
more with <hi>Alkali,</hi> than the Blood of Sound Per<U+017F>ons: To which,
I farther add, this Ob<U+017F>ervation, That I have <U+017F>een the Sweat and
<hi>Serum</hi> of a <U+017F>ound Per<U+017F>on, turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green readily;
when the very <hi>Ichor</hi> and Corruption in the Pu<U+017F>tles of the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> would hardly di<U+017F>colour it: On which account it appears,
there was not <U+017F>o much <hi>Alkali,</hi> or <U+017F>o little <hi>Acid,</hi> as in the Sound
Per<U+017F>ons. And contrary to your Accu<U+017F>ation of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
I <U+017F>ay, I have never found the giving of <hi>Alkalies</hi> in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper,
in the lea<U+017F>t hurtful, but very beneficial, if duly given;
and I have u<U+017F>ed <hi>Alkalies</hi> here, more than any other Medicines,
and never had one Patient Dye, or Deform'd, in two Seven Years
Practice. But if the Cau<U+017F>e of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and of mo<U+017F>t <hi>Feavers,</hi>
as you affirm, be from Particles admitted into the Blood, which
are of <U+017F>o Heterogeneous, or different a Texture from that of the
Blood, as that they are not capable of mixing with it; then it will
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59081:40"/>
certainly follow, that the<U+017F>e <hi>Morbifick</hi> Particles in tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,
are not <hi>Alkalies; Alkealies</hi> being Homogeneal to, mixable with,
and requi<U+017F>ite in making up the Natural and <U+017F>ound Texture of the
Blood: There being no Blood from whence they may not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in great quantity, and the <hi>Globules,</hi> or Red part of the Blood
yields a greater proportion of <hi>Alkali,</hi> than the <hi>Serum.</hi> And thus
you have unwarily thrown down, what you had Built before.
But here is another Cramper, <hi>viz.</hi> How any Particles that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being mix'd with the Blood, <U+017F>hou'd (as you <U+017F>ay) be
admitted into it, and flow with it: None but your <U+017F>harp <U+017F>ight can
<U+017F>ee this. As for the hurry of the Blood, or <hi>Feaver,</hi> Caus'd as
you <U+017F>ay. by tho<U+017F>e unmixable Particles, being mix'd with it. I <U+017F>ay,
fir<U+017F>t it's certain. That Blood naturally contains, or yields abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more <hi>Alkali</hi> than <hi>Acid:</hi> Now the <hi>Alkali</hi> alone cannot be put
into a hurry, or fermentative Motion, and <U+017F>o grow too Hot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the <U+017F>mslle<U+017F>t quantity of <hi>Acid,</hi> cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>o to do; but more
<hi>Acid</hi> added may produce a greater Heat; as any Body may <U+017F>ee, by
mixing <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alkalies.</hi> Now the<U+017F>e <hi>Acids</hi> (which probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are a tenth to the <hi>Alkali)</hi> being <U+017F>ubdued, and having lo<U+017F>t their
Force by being coagulated with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> <U+017F>tick in the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
here and there, and cau<U+017F>e little Inflammations, and at length
Suppurate, which when they are once thus fix'd, the <hi>Feaver</hi>
cea<U+017F>es. Now to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t Nature in Precipitateing, and <U+017F>ubduing
the<U+017F>e <hi>Acids,</hi> rather than <U+017F>ome unknown, unmixable Particles; the
mo<U+017F>t Rational, and Experienced Phy<U+017F>icians have given Te<U+017F>taceous
Powders, and other <hi>Ab<U+017F>orbents</hi> to hinder <hi>a</hi> <U+017F>upply of them from the
Stomach, the chief <hi>Officine</hi> of Praeternatural <hi>Acids,</hi> and al<U+017F>o vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>e
penetrating, and <hi>Diaphoretick Alkalies</hi> to help to <U+017F>ubdue them
already too abundant in the Blood. Which things, as you (<U+017F>hall I
<U+017F>ay ingenuou<U+017F>ly or unwillingly) confe<U+017F>s <U+017F>eldom fail of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of throwing out plentifully the <hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter which
Nature is more able to bear, and bring to maturity in Pu<U+017F>tles in the
Skin than to Cope with in the Blood, there detain'd through the
weakne<U+017F>s of Nature wanting help, or by <hi>Acids</hi> given hindering
the Eruption. And tho' in gro<U+017F>s Bodies (which you your <U+017F>elf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckon
have always more <hi>Acid,</hi> having more Fat) the large quantity
thrown out to the Skin, oft <U+017F>poils tho<U+017F>e Angelick Faces, you <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o
tender of, to get the Ladies Favor; yet the not coming forth of this
<hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter, often makes a greator <U+017F>poil of the whole Bodies
of tho<U+017F>e Angels, laying their Beauty in the Du<U+017F>t. But as few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
chu<U+017F>e rather to Die with a <U+017F>mooth Face, than Live with a
rough one; <U+017F>o it's the Phy<U+017F>ician's part, rather to take care of Life,
than Beauty: And it had been well it had been <U+017F>o in the Ca<U+017F>e of
that Prince<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e inward Form, tran<U+017F>cended that of her Face;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59081:41"/>
who<U+017F>e fair Soul, wou'd have been Con<U+017F>picuous thro' a rougher
Skin, and no le<U+017F>s u<U+017F>eful; had not her Life been thrown out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of the <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter. As for the breaking of the <hi>Globules</hi> of
the Blood you talk <U+017F>o much of; it is mere fancy, grounded upon no
Experiment. The attenuation of the Blood made by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as
al<U+017F>o by the working of the Lungs, is not to be thought a breaking
of the <hi>Globules;</hi> but rather a <U+017F>eparation of them from adhering
together, whereby they are more equally mix'd with the <hi>Serum:</hi>
Thence al<U+017F>o the Blood becomes more florid, the <U+017F>urfaces of tho<U+017F>e
little round Bodies, when more disjoin'd, being capable of reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Light. Nor is the Extrava<U+017F>ation of the Blood, at any
time, to be attributed to the breaking of the <hi>Globules,</hi> and making
them <U+017F>mall enough to pa<U+017F>s out of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which at the <U+017F>ame
time <U+017F>ufficiently contain the <hi>Serum,</hi> who<U+017F>e Particles are perhaps a
Thou<U+017F>and times <U+017F>maller than the <hi>Globules,</hi> tho' you <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
every one broken into Twenty pieces: But rather from <U+017F>ome
breach of the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, from <U+017F>ome Corro<U+017F>ion, or other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
either from without, or from the rapid Motion of the Blood.
Neither is the <U+017F>toppage of the Animal Spirits, from what cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>oever, to be thought to produce Deliriums, and <U+017F>uch like Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es:
But on the contrary, their over <U+017F>wift Motion from too great
Heat. The <U+017F>toppage of the Nerves, if there be any <U+017F>uch thing
is more like to cau<U+017F>e <hi>Pal<U+017F>ies, Lethargies, Apoplexies,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Serum</hi>
is not wa<U+017F>ted too much by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> or other <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> if given
with Di<U+017F>cretion; and <U+017F>o admini<U+017F>ter'd, they prevent the falling of the
Pu<U+017F>tles, and return of the <hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter. As to the few Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
you <U+017F>ay, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> requires, I readily agree that it
requires fewer than are commonly given, and <U+017F>o do all other Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es:
For the giving of many Medicines, as is the Cu<U+017F>tom of
Pre<U+017F>cribers, is a Practice wherein the Phy<U+017F>ician will for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
uncertain, whether he do good, or none, or harm, and by
what: The Judgment, and Care of a Phy<U+017F>ician in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, I
agree, is al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and the Patient had better hire <U+017F>ome
Practitioners, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>owr Doctors, to do nothing, than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turb
and hinder Nature in throwing on the <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter, by
large and improper Pre<U+017F>criptions. As for <hi>Acids</hi> being the onely
<U+017F>afe, effectual, and never failing Medicines, as you <U+017F>ay, you have
<U+017F>een by your own, and other Great Men's Practice: I mu<U+017F>t tell
you, tho' you reckon your <U+017F>elf among Great Men, That many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
Greater in all commendable Greatne<U+017F>s, than you, or any other
of your great Crabb-Tree-Heads, have had better <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinion and Practice. I my <U+017F>elf can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that <hi>Alkalies</hi>
are Medicines, in this di<U+017F>temper a Judicious Phy<U+017F>ician can hardly
want. For as the Ebullition, and Expul<U+017F>ion are not to be too much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59081:41"/>
promoted, or ha<U+017F>tily carryed on; <U+017F>o when they are too <U+017F>low, they
ought to be excited, and ha<U+017F>tened, which may well be done
by volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Medicines. A Judicious Phy<U+017F>ician will not
give <hi>Alkalies,</hi> or <hi>Acids</hi> he knows not why, only becau<U+017F>e they are
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> or <hi>Acids,</hi> or follow always one Intention, the retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the motion of Nature, or allaying the hurry, as you do
Great Sir, with your Oranges and Lemons, Crabbs and Limes,
which tho' they ate milder, than <U+017F>ome Chymical <hi>Acids;</hi> yet a
drop or two of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in an <hi>Aqueous</hi> Vehicle may be a
milder <hi>Acid</hi> than the Juice of Oranges or Lemons taken alone.
As for your boa<U+017F>t, that in Five hundred Patients in this Di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of all Qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Tinkers, Coblers, and their Con<U+017F>orts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom you
have <U+017F>old your Lemons, and Oranges, not one died, or was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured;
you may as well be believed as the Quack, who <U+017F>aid in
his Bills, among<U+017F>t other Brags, that he had been Coun<U+017F>ellor to
the Coun<U+017F>ellors of Twenty Chri<U+017F>tian Kings: When there are not
<U+017F>o many in the World. Nor have you ever had a quarter <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Patients <U+017F>ick of this Di<U+017F>temper. And you might have told us
of retrieving from the Belly of Death, as well as from the Jaws
thereof, <U+017F>ince <hi>you believe People expect you <U+017F>hould make them Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
But truly it's unlikely you <U+017F>hou'd do <U+017F>uch Miracles, e<U+017F>pecially
in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, when you endeavour nothing but to hinder the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature, or to allay the hurry, as you call it, which truly is
not a method according to Natures Dictate's: Short it is indeed,
and may be a <U+017F>hort way to the Grave, and ea<U+017F>ie it is, for the
Doctor to give always the <U+017F>ame things; but often very unea<U+017F>ie for
the Patient. But if tho<U+017F>e that go upon the fewe<U+017F>t Principles in
di<U+017F>covering Nature's <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> di<U+017F>cover mo<U+017F>t of her Secrets, and
can give the be<U+017F>t Account of them, as you <U+017F>ay, then tho<U+017F>e that
have but two Principles, as Figure and Motion, <hi>Alkali</hi> and <hi>Acid,
Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> are like to outgo you Sir, for you creep upon
Five Legs. As for your ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Letting Blood in
good quantities, where the Patient is Delirious, and the Brain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbed,
it's ab<U+017F>olutely Dangerous, and were well let alone for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sedatives, for it oft proves pernicious in this Di<U+017F>temper: As
in the Ca<U+017F>e of the be<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F>s <hi>England</hi> ever had: Neither <hi>Alkali,</hi>
nor <hi>Acid,</hi> was <U+017F>o effectual towards terminating the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as the
Officious Lance, weakning, and di<U+017F>turbing the Motion of Nature.
But methinks we have been long on this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, What <U+017F>hall we
have next.</p>

               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>I come to the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> where I expect the cry of all Mankind
will be again<U+017F>t me, what <U+017F>ay they, is there no <hi>Acidity</hi> in the Blood,
the occa<U+017F>ion of tho<U+017F>e breakings out of Scabs, Pimples, Botches,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59081:42"/>
and of wandring Pains? Have Patience, and I will make it appear
tho<U+017F>e Symptoms come from <hi>Lixivious Alkalous</hi> Particles, and Fir<U+017F>t, it
appears, That the Blood of <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Per<U+017F>ons, has more volatile <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
than that of Sound Per<U+017F>ons, be<U+017F>ides, a quantity of <hi>lixivious</hi>
fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> which I could never find in Sound Per<U+017F>on's Blood.
Another Argument is, that I have been told that Seamen having
had the <hi>Scurvey</hi> in long <hi>Ea<U+017F>t-India</hi> Voyages, Landing at <hi>Cadis,</hi> have
by Eating of Lemons and Oranges, been <U+017F>oon perfectly Cured:
But in the<U+017F>e Cold Countries, we are forced <U+017F>ometimes to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
to more powerful <hi>Acids:</hi> Some object that more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<U+017F>altne<U+017F>s is found in the Blood of <hi>Scorbuticks,</hi> which they take
to be an <hi>Acidity,</hi> but in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Acidity,</hi> if they will enquire, they
will find it to be a <hi>Lixivious Alkalous</hi> one. And here I <U+017F>hall in<U+017F>ert
a Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I have found of extrrordinary u<U+017F>e in
inveterate <hi>Scurveys. Take White Fowers of Antimony <U+2125>viij. vol. <U+017F>p. of
Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. dige<U+017F>t 14 Days, decant it, then Di<U+017F>till off half the Liquor,
and keep the remains for u<U+017F>e.</hi> The Spirit of <hi>Tartar</hi> is made thus,
<hi>Ren: Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr>xx. Di<U+017F>till it in an Iron-Pot with a Moor's-Head, with a
large Worm fitted to a Tub of Water: Di<U+017F>till by degrees as long as any
thing will come over, take out the Caput Mort. Calcine it to Greyne<U+017F>s,
put <abbr>lb</abbr>iij. of it into a Cucurbit, pour on it the Spirit freed from the
Oyl, draw off half, with a moderate Fire, pour out the remains as u<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s:
put <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. more of the Caput Mort. on which pour the Spirit drawn
off, and with a gentle Fire draw off half, which keep for u<U+017F>e.</hi> It is a
Noble volatile Spirit, and as Noble a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> as I have met with.
Of the Tincture, I give Four, Six, Eight, or Ten Drops, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Evening, in a <U+017F>trong Decoction, or infu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Juniper.</hi>
Berries half a Pint. This an<U+017F>wers every thing <U+017F>aid of a true

               <p>If the cry of all Mankind be again<U+017F>t your Opinion of the
<hi>Scurvey,</hi> it is no good <U+017F>ign you are in the right; for we know
your capacity too well, to believe you wi<U+017F>er than all Men. And
you have never yet made it appear, that the Blood of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed
Per<U+017F>ons abounds with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> more than that of the <U+017F>ound
People. You have not made <U+017F>ufficient tryals, nor been aware
of the difficulties of finding the true Quantities of the Products
of Blood, nor have you demon<U+017F>trated, That there is any thing
Lexivious in the Blood of Scorbuticks. A <hi>Sal<U+017F>um</hi> more or le<U+017F>s
may be found in the Blood of both <U+017F>ick and healthy Per<U+017F>ons,
and probably more in the Blood of tho<U+017F>e that have the <hi>Scurvey;</hi>
which po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly a Man of ha<U+017F>ty conclu<U+017F>ions (as Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> <U+017F>o oft
<U+017F>hews him<U+017F>elf to be) may take it for an <hi>Alkali;</hi> becau<U+017F>e it will
turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> green, as common Salt, and <U+017F>ome other
<hi>Sal<U+017F>ums</hi> will do, and for a Lixivious, or fixed one; becau<U+017F>e it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59081:42"/>
does not ri<U+017F>e ea<U+017F>ily in the Fire. But if you knew how to work,
you would find an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit come from it in Di<U+017F>tillation, as
from <U+017F>ome other things you take to be <hi>Alkalies.</hi> But a Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Salt, as you have acknowledged, is the Product of Fire,
and the Fire in the Blood is nothing but a hot fancy, that
makes no a<U+017F>hes. But you mu<U+017F>t make u<U+017F>e of another Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can get any fixed Salt, or Volatile either out of the
Blood. But if you could produce <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>ulting body as
a fixed <hi>Alkali,</hi> by burning the Blood, or other parts of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick,
or other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed Per<U+017F>on<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> it would not prove, That an
<hi>Acid,</hi> was not actually therein before, or that this <hi>Alkali</hi> was:
For I have never found a Lixivious Salt, <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in any Animal Sub<U+017F>tance, as where there was a manife<U+017F>t
and plentiful <hi>Acid;</hi> nor will any other Sub<U+017F>tance as far as I
have ob<U+017F>erved, yield <U+017F>o much fixed <hi>Alkali</hi> in burning, as
tho<U+017F>e that otherwi<U+017F>e, give mo<U+017F>t <hi>Acid</hi> and Oyl. As for your
Scorbutick Seamen cured at <hi>Cadis</hi> (if the Story be true) it
may be more rationally thought they were recoverd by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fre<U+017F>h Meat, and drinking Generous Wine, than by
Oranges and Lemons, unle<U+017F>s they had been the only things
they fed upon. Your preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> you <U+017F>ay, you
have found of <U+017F>uch extraordinary u<U+017F>e in inveterate <hi>Scurveys,</hi>
<U+017F>hews your Ignorance in Chymi<U+017F>try, and argues again<U+017F>t you,
doing all that a true <hi>Panacaea</hi> can be <U+017F>aid to do, if any one can be
<U+017F>o all-believing as to credit you, when <hi>no one Acid</hi> (as you have

that you never <U+017F>aw a fixed <hi>Acid</hi> in your life] but your <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi>
does all things, and yet if made according to your Pre<U+017F>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no <hi>Acid:</hi> For tho' the <hi>Tartar</hi> by Di<U+017F>tillation yeilds an
<hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, yet the pouring it on the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tilling
off but half twice the fixed <hi>Alkali</hi> retains the <hi>Acid,</hi> and
<U+017F>ends up only a Phlegmatick Liquor, which is a very poor
<hi>Men<U+017F>iruum;</hi> the greate<U+017F>t Vertue remaining behind, tho' Mr.
<hi>Chymi<U+017F>t</hi> throws it away as u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s: But as your Liquor may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<U+017F>ome Particles of the Flowers of <hi>Antimony</hi> when dige<U+017F>ted
together, <U+017F>o as it is Vomitive, it may do <U+017F>omething on
that account, but not as an <hi>Acid;</hi> the Vomitive qualitiy of
<hi>Antimony</hi> depending on <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e; but giving it with
half a Pint of the Decoction, or infu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi>
<U+017F>poils the credit of the other things; the <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> ju<U+017F>tly
claiming the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>hare in the Cure, if it do one. But

               <p>It has been con<U+017F>tantly handed down from Generation to
Generation, that the <hi>Gout</hi> is a Di<U+017F>temper not to be cured, and in
<U+017F>pight of the noi<U+017F>e the la<U+017F>t Age has made of Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy,
no Man ever went out of the common Road, to try
whether that were true or fal<U+017F>e: But now it do's evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear that the <hi>Gout</hi> is not <U+017F>uch a Fury, but that it may
with ea<U+017F>e be overcome by proper and powerful <hi>Acids.</hi> Now
if my Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors have been <U+017F>o notoriou<U+017F>ly Ignorant, as to the
Cau<U+017F>e and Cure of common Di<U+017F>tempers, it is not unrea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe they have been <U+017F>o in others: Nay, they have
been <U+017F>o. And the rea<U+017F>on why People have hitherto in vain
attempted the Cure of the <hi>Gout,</hi> has been from their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
again<U+017F>t <hi>Acids,</hi> which only can do <U+017F>ervice. What would not
People give to <U+017F>ave their Lives, and be free from pain? Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians
as the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tands can do neither with any certainty;
but by making multitudes of Experiments upon the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I can lay down, the ca<U+017F>e may be altered. If People were
once <U+017F>atisfied, That the abounding of <hi>Alkalies</hi> is the cau<U+017F>e of
the <hi>Gout,</hi> it follows that <hi>Acids</hi> are the only proper things to
correct it. That the <hi>Gout</hi> is cau<U+017F>ed by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> may appear
from the Chalky <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance generated in the extreme Parts,
which is generated in the time of the Fit only, and is a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Homogeneal Particles, Particles of one determinate Figure,
by rea<U+017F>on the Fire won't totally de<U+017F>troy its texture; which
were it a Body compos'd of Particles of different Sizes and
Figures (which are what we Chymi<U+017F>ts call Heterogeneous ones)
the Fire would de<U+017F>troy it. And that they are <hi>Alkalous,</hi> none I
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e will di<U+017F>pute, they an<U+017F>wering all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that
mo<U+017F>t known <hi>Alkalies</hi> will do, <hi>viz.</hi> cau<U+017F>e an Ebullition with
<hi>Acids,</hi> and when calcin'd turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> green, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(tho' not always) will do it without. I take notice few
People are troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> but tho<U+017F>e who drink much
Wine, or other generous Liquors, abounding with Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
The<U+017F>e Spirits meeting with Volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salts, by
means of the Salt the Vinous Spirit is coagulated into what <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
calls <hi>Offa Alba,</hi> which not being capable of moving through
the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, cau<U+017F>es Ob<U+017F>tructions and Pains, and by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Terre<U+017F>trious Particles, is turned into the Chalky Sub<U+017F>tance,
I cannot agree with tho<U+017F>e Gentlemen, who a<U+017F><U+017F>ert all Pain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a Solution of Continuity. I don't argue, that there
is no Pain prooceeds from a Solution of Unity, but there are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pains where the Union is entire, as in a blow with a blunt
thing. But I lay it down as a po<U+017F>itive A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, that all Pain
is cau<U+017F>ed by a Stagnation of Juices, cau<U+017F>ing a Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59081:43"/>
                  <hi>Membranes:</hi> But as the Stagnation is greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er, and as the
Stagnating Matter is more or le<U+017F>s <hi>Acrimonious,</hi> <U+017F>o is the Pain great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or le<U+017F>s, but there is no Pain in any part without Stagnation.
People have more rea<U+017F>on to believe there is a Solution of Unity
in the <hi>Pal<U+017F>ie,</hi> where there is a vi<U+017F>ible Con<U+017F>umption, tho' there,
they are altogether void of Sen<U+017F>ation. The Medicines I u<U+017F>e are
few, and mo<U+017F>tly well-known, but never u<U+017F>ed in the manner I
have done: The general Ba<U+017F>is of them is the <U+017F>ame, they being
all <hi>Acids;</hi> and my Medicines will put no force upon Nature, have
no hazard, but <U+017F>trengthen all the Parts. I have given as clear
hints, nay clearer than ever were given of the Cure of the <hi>Gout,</hi>
which has hitherto been vainly attempted, but my method will
as certainly Cure the <hi>Gout,</hi> as the <hi>Cortex, Agues,</hi> or <hi>Opium</hi> make
Sleep, and I have known it fail but two or three times, and

That nothing but <hi>Acids</hi> can do any <U+017F>ervice in the <hi>Gout,</hi> is an a<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Sirs, if you are Wi<U+017F>e, come to their Ma<U+017F>ter him<U+017F>elf, he can

his Lilly, White Vinegar. it may be a great while e'er many of
the People call'd Phy<U+017F>itians come to be <U+017F>atisfied, that the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Alkalies</hi> is the cau<U+017F>e of the <hi>Gout;</hi> but if they were, it will
not follow on your Hypothe<U+017F>is, that <hi>Acids</hi> are the onely proper
Correctors of it. We will <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that in the <hi>Gout,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, there is too much <hi>Alkali</hi> in the Blood: What is to be
done? Why, it ought to be carry'd off by the <hi>Emunctories,</hi> <U+017F>ay you.
By what means? By <hi>Acids</hi> <U+017F>ay you. How can <hi>Acids</hi> do it? Why,
they are contrary to <hi>Alkalies,</hi> <U+017F>ay you, and fight them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they meet, conquer them, and make them quit the Field.
No <U+017F>ay I, 'tis a mi<U+017F>take, they are not contraries, or Enemies, but as
good Friends as any old Sweet-hearts, <U+017F>eparated again<U+017F>t their wills.
They rejoice when they meet fall a Dancing till they are hot again,
&amp; when tired they lie down together in mutual and clo<U+017F>e embraces,
and are <U+017F>o wedded by the Law of Nature, that they will not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd,
unle<U+017F>s one of them can be tempted to Adultrey; then indeed
the other does not beat, but leave its Companion with di<U+017F>dain.
Your Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Helmont</hi> tells you. There are no contraries in Nature
(he means Bodily Nature) but contrariety is only in Wills: And
he gives you good Rea<U+017F>on, for what he <U+017F>ays: But could <hi>Alkalies</hi>
and <hi>Acids,</hi> any way be <U+017F>aid to be contrary, What then? It don't
follow, that one mu<U+017F>t needs thru<U+017F>t the other out of Doors; and
if they did, one would think the <hi>De<U+017F>troyer of all Things,</hi> being too
much for the other, mu<U+017F>t thru<U+017F>t it out: What is <U+017F>tronger than
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59081:44"/>
                  <hi>Death.</hi> But experience tells us, that whereever they meet, they
<U+017F>o combine that they are both harder to be drove out, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them <U+017F>ingle. You have an in<U+017F>tance in <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi>
made of the <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> and Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rine;</hi>
which <hi>Alkali</hi> alone is <U+017F>o Subtil and Di<U+017F><U+017F>ipable, that it will fly
with the lea<U+017F>t heat, and is hardly kept without wa<U+017F>ting, except
with well fitted Gla<U+017F>s-<U+017F>topples; but combin'd with Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi>
they are coagulated together into a Body, that will be kept open
without any lo<U+017F>s of Sub<U+017F>tance, if urg'd with heat will indeed fly
but together, and that not without a con<U+017F>iderably <U+017F>trong Fire.
But if the Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> be united with <U+017F>ome <hi>Acid</hi> that is not
coagulable into a Body, it will neverthele<U+017F>s be rendred le<U+017F>s Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
requiring a greater Fire to rai<U+017F>e it, than it did alone. Now
if <hi>Alkalies</hi> and <hi>Acids</hi> can be thought to meet <U+017F>o copiou<U+017F>ly in the
Blood, as to make what you call a Conflict, but I with better
rea<U+017F>on term a Dance or Playing together, and produce an ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Heat; that Heat may de<U+017F>erve the name of a <hi>Feaver,</hi>
and be a di<U+017F>turbance in the Vital <hi>Oeconomy</hi> equally, whether it be
a Dance, or a Fight, if there be too much of the Sport; and
the<U+017F>e two Bodies combin'd, e<U+017F>pecially if the <hi>Acid</hi> be of any
con<U+017F>iderable quantity, will be le<U+017F>s apt to be carried off by Tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration,
than the one of them ever <U+017F>o abundant. But if there
cannnot be <U+017F>o much <hi>Acid</hi> pour'd in, as to make an Efferve<U+017F>cence
and Coagulation with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> which is in Sikne<U+017F>s, and ought to
be in Health abundantly more than the <hi>Acid</hi> can be; yet the <hi>Acid</hi>
may have this effect, as to thicken, and hinder the motion of, the
Blood, and thereby render it more unapt to di<U+017F>charge the <hi>Alkali;</hi> if
we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it ought to be di<U+017F>charged. And that <hi>Acids</hi> do coagulate
and thicken the Blood, we have often <U+017F>een upon tryal with Oyl
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as well as Oyl of <hi>Vitriol:</hi> So far is <hi>Acid</hi> from being the
thing, much le<U+017F>s the only thing that can di<U+017F>charge, and drive out
your fancied noxious, and to be di<U+017F>charged <hi>Alkali.</hi> And tho'
<hi>Acid</hi> may be proper enough in <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, where the Blood is
too thin and moveable to thicken it; yet in <U+017F>uch Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es as <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys,
Rehumati<U+017F>ms</hi> and <hi>Gout,</hi> where the Blood is already too thick,
and apt to Coagulate, and <U+017F>tick in the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; the making
it thicker by <hi>Acids</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be improper, contrary to all Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Cure. The Chalkey <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance generated in the Fits
of the <hi>Gout,</hi> does not prove the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>ed by <hi>Alkalies</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by <hi>Acids:</hi> For <hi>Alkalous Salts</hi> when in <U+017F>olution, are not
Coagulated alone, but by meeting with <hi>Acids;</hi> except by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the humidity they are di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in, which can't be <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
here. Neither is the <hi>Creta</hi> a Salt, and were it as you <U+017F>ay
produced of the Volatile Salt of the Blood and Homogeneal, it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59081:45"/>
mu<U+017F>t be all Salt. But you never <U+017F>aw a Salt in<U+017F>ipid, or a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
one con<U+017F>tant in the Fire, as you <U+017F>ay this matter is. Nor are
all Bodies con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of Particles of different Sizes, and Figures
(which is what you are <U+017F>o kind as to tell us you Chymi<U+017F>ts mean
by Heterogeneous) totally de<U+017F>troy'd by the Fire, as you may <U+017F>ee
in Bricks, Bones, Gla<U+017F>s, Metals and a Thou<U+017F>and things. But
the Podagrick Matter, as <hi>Kerking</hi> tells us, <hi>Spicileg</hi> Obj. 28. by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tillation
yields a Spirit of a middle nature, between Spirit of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
and Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniak</hi> more <hi>Acid</hi> than one, and more
mild than the other, and an Oyl very like Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> leaving
a fixed Salt in the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> much like Salt of <hi>Tartar:</hi> Where
are your Homogeneal Particles Sir? But the abounding of <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
right or wrong you will have it, is the cau<U+017F>e of the <hi>Gout.</hi> But
how I pray you Sir, after what manner? Why, few are troubled
with the <hi>Gout,</hi> <U+017F>ay you, but tho<U+017F>e that drink Vinous Liquors; and
<U+017F>o the Blood abounding with Vinous Spirits, the<U+017F>e Vinous Spirits
meeting with Volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salts, are by the <hi>Alkali</hi> Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into what <hi>Helmont</hi> calls <hi>Offa Alba;</hi> which not being capable
of moving thro' the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els cau<U+017F>es Ob<U+017F>tructions and Pains,
and by the addition of Terre<U+017F>trious Particles, is turned into a
Chalkey Sub<U+017F>tance. Now <hi>John</hi> I have caught you, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come off your Contradiction, but by begging Pardon on the
account of your <hi>very Treacherous Memory.</hi> The Chalkey Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
was but now a collection of Homogeneal Particles (that is,
Particles of one determinate Figure, as you plea<U+017F>ed to Engli<U+017F>h it
for us) but now it is a Compound of a Vinous Spirit, an <hi>Alkali.</hi>
Salt, with an addition of an Earthy Matter. This is the re<U+017F>ult of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Experiments</hi> no doubt; the<U+017F>e are <hi>Grounds to build your
Practice upon, whereby you are able to do more than other People,</hi>
that is, than all the Phy<U+017F>icians of all Ages. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you
for all that, that you gros<U+017F>ly mi<U+017F>take <hi>Offa Alba,</hi> not knowing what
it is. But I tell you, it is not a Coagulation of a Vinous Spirit,
but a Precipitation of the Urinous Salt out of its Phlegm, by the
affu<U+017F>ion of the Vinous Spirit; but unle<U+017F>s the Vinous and Urinous
Spirits be both <U+017F>trong it will not do; nor will all Urinous Spirits
make the <hi>Offa Alba.</hi> The rea<U+017F>on of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> where it
<U+017F>ucceeds is this, The Volatile Salt not being Soluble in <U+017F>trong
Spirit of Wine, and having but little Phlegm of its own, more
than what will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it, the Vinous Spirits being apt to
mix with that Phlegm, fills its Pores, and <U+017F>o it lets fall the
Salt. But it's impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find a Livings Man's Blood <U+017F>o
<U+017F>trongly <hi>Alkalous,</hi> as that there <U+017F>hould be but ju<U+017F>t enough
<hi>Latex</hi> to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Salt: Nor were it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, can there be
added Vinous Liqours in quantity, and <U+017F>trength enough to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59081:45"/>
make <U+017F>uch a Coagulation. We Phy<U+017F>itians all know, Mr. <hi>Chymi<U+017F>t,</hi>
that the Blood never abounds <U+017F>o much with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salt, as to
make <U+017F>o much as a weak Spirit, nor can the Spirit of the Wines
we drink, be <U+017F>eparated from the Phlegm in our Bellies, nor can
we drink Vinous Spirits <U+017F>trong enough to Coagulate an <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Spirit. Moreover, this <hi>Offa Alba</hi> which <hi>Helmont</hi> talks of, is <U+017F>o
very Subtil and Volatile, that it would ea<U+017F>ily find pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and
be carried off through the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Pores by a gentle Heat, and
would be <U+017F>o far from Coagulating into a Chalkey Sub<U+017F>tance, as that
it is a good Medicine to thin the Blood, and hinder Coagulations;
as al<U+017F>o very beneficially u<U+017F>ed externally in pains, of the <hi>Gout</hi> it
<U+017F>elf. As for Rain tho' you grant <U+017F>ome Pain, may proceed from
a Solution of Continuity; yet you can't agree with tho<U+017F>e that
<U+017F>ay, all Pains do: But there are violent Pains where the Union
is entire as in a Blow with a blunt thing. Truly Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you are
a Man of a blunt Under<U+017F>tanding, for all you have a <U+017F>harp Name,
or el<U+017F>e you would ea<U+017F>ily perceive, that in any Blow that is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
there is a violent<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure made upon the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which
bur<U+017F>ts them, and forces the Blood out of them; which is the
cau<U+017F>e of the Blackne<U+017F>s often following Blows, and there can be
no Extrava<U+017F>ation without a<U+017F>olution of Unity more or le<U+017F>s. So
all violent di<U+017F>tentions, all Corroding Matters make Solutions of
Unity, breaking <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>mall Fibers, at which we have the
Sen<U+017F>ation of Pain. But your po<U+017F>itive A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, that all Pain is
cau<U+017F>ed by a Stagnation of Humours, and thence a Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion

of Blood into a Part, cau<U+017F>e the Swelling and Di<U+017F>tention of

Fibers? And are not Wounds both Inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many Parts pre<U+017F>ently painful, where we can <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e no pre<U+017F>ent
Stagnation? If you cannot <U+017F>ay no, and <U+017F>new us better Rea<U+017F>on
than you have done yet, we <U+017F>hall hardly be of your opinion, That
all Pain proceeds from Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Membranes.</hi> As for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly<U+017F>is,</hi>
tho' it <U+017F>ounds <U+017F>omething of Solution; yet <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing you

to be a Solution of Continuity, and rather take it to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of the proper and natural Ten<U+017F>ion of the In<U+017F>truments of

far from Truth, that they do the contrary, as any one may <U+017F>ee

you, or <hi>Helmont</hi> either knew, who charg'd him not to exceed

none will therefore expect to Cure all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es by them. But Mr.

found it abound more with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles, than that of <U+017F>ound
Per<U+017F>ons, from which alone it may be inferr'd, That it proceeds
not from <hi>Acids,</hi> but from <hi>Alkalies.</hi> But it may be objected,
Whence comes the <U+017F>izyne<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity of the <hi>Serum,</hi> if not from
<hi>Acids?</hi> Every Body that knows what <hi>Hart's Horn</hi> is, knows that
the rea<U+017F>on of its making Gelly, is from its abounding with Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Alkalous</hi>-Salts: For the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, Calves-Feet and <hi>I<U+017F>ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<U+017F>s</hi>
make Gellies. And if the <hi>Vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity</hi> of the Blood can be taken
off, this Di<U+017F>temper vani<U+017F>hes: But this is not to be done by
<hi>Alkalies;</hi> but by proper <hi>Acids,</hi> <U+017F>uch as the foremention'd Tincture
of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Chalybeats.</hi> But People will <U+017F>ay, I have caught
my <U+017F>elf in a Trap, when I bring <hi>Chalybeates</hi> in as <hi>Acids;</hi> when all

make as great an <hi>Efferve<U+017F>cence</hi> with all <U+017F>orts of <hi>Acids,</hi> as any of the
<hi>Alkalies.</hi> From this difficulty, I <U+017F>hall endeavour to extricate my
<U+017F>elf, and to prove, That Iron or Steel till it be converted into

                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> (and every Body will allow <hi>Vitriol</hi> to be an <hi>Acid)</hi> can't act upon
the Blood and <hi>Serum</hi> to cau<U+017F>e an alteration, nor any way enter into
the Veins and Arteries: Skillful Practitioners before they give
<hi>Steel</hi>-Medicines, ask their Patients, Whether they have any <hi>Acidity</hi>
in their Stomachs (where I allow <hi>Acids</hi> <U+017F>ometimes abound exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly)
and if they are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any <hi>Acidity</hi> there; then they give
<hi>Iron</hi> without any Preparation, which by the <hi>Acid</hi> in the Stomach,
is turn'd into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <U+017F>o made capable of being carry'd into
the Blood: Whereas had it been before <U+017F>atiated by Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it had had no Effect at all: If there be no <hi>Acidity</hi> in the
Stomach, it is carry'd off by Stool, and not admitted into the Blood.
And mo<U+017F>t of the Preparations of <hi>Steel,</hi> I know of, good for any

<hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood; but if you had any Con<U+017F>ideration, you
wou'd not think, divi<U+017F>ion into <U+017F>maller Parts, is the way to thicken.
But perhaps <hi>Alkali</hi> is <U+017F>uch a bad thing as to thicken, and make
thin both, according as there may be Mi<U+017F>chief done: Being the
De<U+017F>troyer or Executioner of all things, has more ways of Killing
than one; As <hi>Acids</hi> will thicken and make thin, when you wou'd
have them. But as for <hi>Hart's-Horn, I<U+017F>ing-gla<U+017F>s,</hi> Calves-Feer, if it
be from <hi>Alkalies</hi> that they make Gellies: Why, don't other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Sub<U+017F>tances abounding as much, and more with <hi>Alkali</hi> make
Gellies as well as the<U+017F>e? And why do Vegitables (that you <U+017F>ay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
mo<U+017F>t with <hi>Acids)</hi> make Gellies, as well as <hi>Hart's-Horn,</hi> &amp;c.
as we <U+017F>ee in <hi>Mallow-Roots, Comfrey, Quince-Seeds,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<U+017F>ity</hi>
of the Blood is to be taken off by proper <hi>Acids,</hi> you <U+017F>ay:
But I have <U+017F>aid enough already of the contrary Effects of <hi>Acids,</hi> to
<U+017F>hew your Mi<U+017F>take in this Opinion, and Ignorance in relation to
your Tincture of <hi>Antimony:</hi> But as for <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> People may well
<U+017F>ay you have caught your <U+017F>elf in a Trap, by bringing in <hi>Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beats</hi>
as <hi>Acids;</hi> for every Phy<U+017F>ician knows, That Metals, e<U+017F>pecially
<hi>Iron,</hi> blunt and Ab<U+017F>ord <hi>Acids</hi> making an <hi>Efferve<U+017F>cence</hi> with them,
and are di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd by them. But let us <U+017F>ee how you get out of
this Trap? Why <hi>Iron</hi> <U+017F>ay you (as you told us once before) can't
act upon the Blood and <hi>Serum,</hi> nor enter the Veins and Arteries,
till turn'd into <hi>Vitriol.</hi> How prove you this Sir, that Iron won't
be admitted into the Blood till turn'd into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and that it
will then? It is only becau<U+017F>e you fancy <U+017F>o, for you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<U+017F>hew'd us by any good Experiment, that Iron either unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
or turned into <hi>Vitriol</hi> will pa<U+017F>s into the Blood. But if
<hi>your <U+017F>queemi<U+017F>h temper</hi> would have <U+017F>uffer'd you to meddle with the
Subject, you might have took a <hi>T</hi>—<hi>d,</hi> and a like quantity of
Blood from <U+017F>ome of your Patients under a Steel-cour<U+017F>e: Fir<U+017F>t of
unprepared Iron, then of Iron prepared with <U+017F>ome of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Acid Men<U+017F>truums;</hi> from one of a <U+017F>owr Stomach; from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without a <U+017F>owr Stomach, and have got <U+017F>ome body that
knows how to reduce Mettals to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you (your wonderous
Friend Mr. <hi>Stringer,</hi> <U+017F>ure would not have denied his help) and
when you had <U+017F>een which way the Iron goes, you might have
been confidently po<U+017F>itive, or mode<U+017F>tly <U+017F>ilent, or have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that Phy<U+017F>icians do not give Iron <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it will pa<U+017F>s into
the Blood, but to ab<U+017F>orb <hi>Acids</hi> in the Stomach and Bowels, and
to hinder them from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into the Blood, which if they were
z<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59081:49"/>
turned into <hi>Vitriol</hi> by <U+017F>owr Stomachs (which I believe has not
been proved) and <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily carried into the Blood, and
could act there as <hi>Acids,</hi> would fru<U+017F>trate the Phy<U+017F>icians intention,
who only aimes at cutting off a <U+017F>upply of <hi>Acid</hi> from the Stomach
the grand <hi>Officine</hi> thereof. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e Iron either unprepared,
or turned into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> will or will not pa<U+017F>s into the Blood, What's
this towards proving Iron an <hi>Acid?</hi> Why Iron may be turned
into <hi>Vitriol</hi> by an <hi>Acid?</hi> Tarbox, Iron is an <hi>Acid:</hi> Here's Logick
for you Sirs: Or, the <hi>Acid</hi> in <hi>Vitriol</hi> is an <hi>Acid,</hi> therefore the
<hi>Alkali</hi> in <hi>Vitriol</hi> is an <hi>Acid.</hi> You might as well <U+017F>ay, the Volatile
Salt of Urine is an <hi>Acid,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Spirit of Salt which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied,
and coagulated with it in <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> while <U+017F>eparate
was an <hi>Acid.</hi> But <U+017F>ay you, every Body allows <hi>Vitriol</hi> the whole
Compound to be an <hi>Acid;</hi> and therefore you infer, that Iron one
of the Ingredients is an <hi>Acid.</hi> I An<U+017F>wer, Neither is the Premi<U+017F>s
alow'd, nor your Con<U+017F>equence Natural. I deny <hi>Vitriol</hi> the whole
Compound to be an <hi>Acid,</hi> it being but a Neuter, and the <hi>Acid</hi> in
it never acts as an <hi>Acid</hi> in this form; being ab<U+017F>orb'd, <U+017F>heath'd,
and <U+017F>poil'd of its <hi>Acid</hi> force (the Compound being but a <hi>Sal<U+017F>um)</hi>
till <U+017F>eparated again, which cannot be but by a Fire great enough
to calcine an A<U+017F><U+017F>-eyed Chymi<U+017F>t's Bones. As for your Argument,
That Steel may be an <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' it makes an efferve<U+017F>cence with
<hi>Acids;</hi> becau<U+017F>e all <hi>Sulphurs</hi> mixed with <hi>Acids</hi> will do the like: I
<U+017F>ay, that all but Ignorant <hi>Tyros</hi> know the contrary; that no <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs</hi>
properly <U+017F>o call'd, <hi>viz. Brim<U+017F>tones</hi> will make an efferve<U+017F>cence
with <hi>Acids,</hi> or be ea<U+017F>ily touched by them. Some Oyls indeed
will grow hot, and make an efferve<U+017F>cence with <U+017F>ome <hi>Acids</hi> even
to a Flame, but not all with all, as is well known. But as for
Metals. I tell you, you never <U+017F>aw a <hi>Brim<U+017F>tone,</hi> much le<U+017F>s an Oyl
extracted, or <U+017F>eparated from them in your Life; tho' 'tis pa<U+017F>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pute
with you, and <U+017F>o we need not argue <hi>Sulphur</hi> to be an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali:</hi>
But we cannot think it an <hi>Acid</hi> unle<U+017F>s we deny our Sen<U+017F>es,
much le<U+017F>s are tho<U+017F>e Oyls that will grow hot with <hi>Acids</hi> to be
thought <U+017F>o. But I think you have caught your <U+017F>elf in another
Trap, by allowing <hi>Acids</hi> <U+017F>ometimes to abound exorbitantly in the
Stomach, which exorbitant abundance of <hi>Acids</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
a Di<U+017F>order or Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e (as you el<U+017F>ewhere confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed) as well as
exorbitant <hi>Alkali,</hi> and <U+017F>o all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are not from too much
<hi>Alkali.</hi> But I believe there is never more exorbitant <hi>Acid</hi> in
the Stomach or any where el<U+017F>e, than in the Patient, who is <U+017F>o
unhappy as to fall into the hands of Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> who tho' he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<hi>The Heart-burn cau<U+017F>ed by</hi> Acids, yet <hi>ab<U+017F>orbents are far
from being u<U+017F>eful in this ca<U+017F>e,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>but the Heart-burn is as often

                  <hi>All Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are cau<U+017F>ed

yet Alkalies <hi>are far from being u<U+017F>efull, but the Heart-burn is as

is not oftener than by <hi>Alkalies</hi> which Cure it <U+017F>ometimes, tho'
they are far from being u<U+017F>eful: So in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, if you come
to Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t be Cured by that which does it no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Man will think <hi>Acids</hi> <U+017F>o far from being u<U+017F>eful to Cure a
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e from too much Acidity, that he will account it no le<U+017F>s

Contradictions can't be the faults of a <hi>Treacherous Memory,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the want of Wit. Well, as to <hi>Mars,</hi> again all the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it you know good for any thing are made by <hi>Acids.</hi>
That may be I confe<U+017F>s, if the Pe<U+017F>tle and Mortar are <hi>Acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truums;</hi>
but I tell you <hi>John</hi> I know good Preparations of <hi>Mars</hi>
not made by <hi>Acids,</hi> and yet the Body of <hi>Mars</hi> open'd more than
by any of your great <hi>Acid Men<U+017F>truums.</hi> But if no preparations
of <hi>Mars</hi> were good for any thing but tho<U+017F>e made with <hi>Acids,</hi>
why do you u<U+017F>e others, and <U+017F>o trap your <U+017F>elf again? That which
you give us the proce<U+017F>s of is not made by an <hi>Acid; Sal Armoniack</hi>
being no <U+017F>uch thing, but a Compo<U+017F>ition of Sea-Salt and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<hi>Alkali</hi> of Urine; the Sea-Salt it <U+017F>elf being no <hi>Acid</hi> while

well examined them, you find them mo<U+017F>t Noble</hi> Acids. Sure your

or you have forgot your Rule, <hi>That what<U+017F>oever in Di<U+017F>tillation yields
a greater quantity of Alkali, is an Alkali, et Vice Ver<U+017F>a;</hi> or I believe,
it wou'd not do here; for you may Di<U+017F>till <hi>Steel,</hi> and Twenty
things more, long enough before you can get either <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Alkali</hi>
to come over: Nor could you prove by this Rule, That <hi>Cinnaber</hi>
is an <hi>Acid,</hi> which you <U+017F>o mightily commend in this, and other

eat Fle<U+017F>h as we do, I can't imagine what they would have done
for Salt. For <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hypothe<U+017F>is true, which I <U+017F>ee
no rea<U+017F>on to doubt of, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e their Rivers mu<U+017F>t have been void
of Saltne<U+017F>s; and for them to have eaten Meat without Salt, mu<U+017F>t
have prejudic'd their Healths, and <U+017F>hortned their Lives. As we
<U+017F>aw in the <hi>Iri<U+017F>h</hi> Wars, by eating Meat without Salt, whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were <U+017F>wept away by Fevers and Fluxes. Now the <hi>Antidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvians</hi>
eating Vegetables, had no need of Salt; there being a <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity of <hi>Acidity</hi> in them to confirm the texture of their
Blood. Farther note the efficacy of Salt-water, to prevent the
dreadful Symptoms of per<U+017F>ons bitten with mad Dogs. On which
occa<U+017F>ion al<U+017F>o, a Child at <hi>Worce<U+017F>ter</hi> was cur'd of a <hi>Tympanitis</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dipt with others, al<U+017F>o bitten by a mad Dog; who not many
hours after <U+017F>he was dipt, pi<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>everal Quarts, and was perfectly
cured. And a Per<U+017F>on in <hi>Hereford<U+017F>hire,</hi> I am told, has cured <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
by the <U+017F>ame method. Common Salt, I allow, will excite Thir<U+017F>t
not <hi>quatenus Acid;</hi> for Spirit of Salt will take it off: But I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
you, I have <U+017F>tumbled more at this thing of Common Salt's exciting
Thir<U+017F>t, than any thing el<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ides, and therefore have <U+017F>par'd no
Co<U+017F>t to find the Rea<U+017F>on; but at la<U+017F>t, after much Labour and
Sweat, I found there was no Salt but had more or le<U+017F>s of a damn'd
thing call'd <hi>Bittern</hi> mix'd with it. Now this <hi>Bittern</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t
corroding fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> in nature; and tho it be incon<U+017F>iderable in
quantity, in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Acid,</hi> yet it will fix it <U+017F>elf on the Parts
after the <hi>Acid</hi> of the Salt is all di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, and <U+017F>o excite Thir<U+017F>t.</p>

               <p>It is <U+017F>o far from being allow'd by all, that <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> is an
<hi>Acid,</hi> that I know none that can ta<U+017F>te will allow it, except you
Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> who are either re<U+017F>olved to deny your Sen<U+017F>es to <U+017F>erve
your Hypothetick Fancy, or have <U+017F>o us'd your Mouth to <hi>Acids,</hi>
you can ta<U+017F>te nothing el<U+017F>e; as Per<U+017F>ons in <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>tempers
ta<U+017F>te every thing bitter. But let the healthy Country-man ta<U+017F>te
it, and I will engage he will not <U+017F>ay 'tis <U+017F>owr. That it may be by
the Fire changed into a <U+017F>owr Liquor, is no better an Argument,
that it is now <U+017F>owr<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> than that Sugar, becau<U+017F>e it may be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vinegar, is Vinegar; or into an <hi>Alkali,</hi> is an <hi>Alkali</hi> already; or
that an A<U+017F>s-ey'd Doctor is a wi<U+017F>e man, becau<U+017F>e po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he may learn
Wit. It is not true, that tho<U+017F>e that eat Fle<U+017F>h can't live without
Salt: for not only divers kinds of Animals that live wholly on Fle<U+017F>h
eat no Salt, but abundance of People in <hi>North-America,</hi> who live
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59081:53"/>
very healthy, and <U+017F>trong, and mo<U+017F>tly upon Fle<U+017F>h, have no Salt a tall;
as <hi>Hennipen</hi> tells us in his late account of tho<U+017F>e Parts, and I don't
que<U+017F>tion but we might do the <U+017F>ame were we accu<U+017F>tom'd to it,
without hurting our <U+017F>elves by <hi>Alkali.</hi> Neither do we u<U+017F>e Salt to
lock up <hi>Alkali</hi> in Fle<U+017F>h, which it will not do; <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> no way
uniting with, or retaining volatile <hi>Alkalies,</hi> except it is fir<U+017F>t turn'd
into on <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit; as you may ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee, either by di<U+017F>tilling <hi>Salt-meat,
<g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rine,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> and a volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> mix'd together.
But we u<U+017F>e Salt to pre<U+017F>erve and reli<U+017F>h our Meat, neither of which
would be done by its <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit. Nor can the <hi>Longevity</hi> of the
<hi>Antediluvians</hi> be a<U+017F>crib'd to their living upon Vegetables, much le<U+017F>s
from an <hi>Acid</hi> in them, when all Vegetables that are commonly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
turn into an <hi>Alkalous</hi> Chyle. And if living upon Vegetables
would <U+017F>o much conduce to long Life, why have not <U+017F>ome in our
time, who would eat nothing el<U+017F>e, lived longer, or at lea<U+017F>t more
healthy, than others? And tho you, not doubting of <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe<U+017F>is,
can't imagine what they would have done for Salt before
the Flood, yet I and others, not doubting of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi>'s Hypothe<U+017F>is,
can very well imagine, That they might have had Salt to reli<U+017F>h di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<U+017F>orts of Vegetables, as well as for other u<U+017F>es, from the Sea,
from Fountains, or from the Rock the original of that u<U+017F>eful Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
As for the Cure of Per<U+017F>ons bit by mad Dogs, by dipping; it
cannot be well thought to depend upon the Saltne<U+017F>s of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
much le<U+017F>s on the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>Acidity</hi> of the Salt: If it did, why
would not the drinking Salt-water, or Spirit of Salt, or wa<U+017F>hing
with them, rather do the Cure; which has not been found ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.
But the rea<U+017F>on of this, is more rationally thought to lie
in the blotting out and de<U+017F>troying, or preventing the Idea of
Rage, by the contrary Idea of Fear impre<U+017F>s'd upon the Spirits of
the Per<U+017F>ons bit. Which is apparent from the manner of dipping,
as I have had the Account from Per<U+017F>ons dip'd; which is till the
Per<U+017F>on has an apprehen<U+017F>ion or fear of being drowned: Therefore
they dip <U+017F>ome twice, <U+017F>ome thrice, more or le<U+017F>s, as they find them
fearful, or courageous. On the <U+017F>ame account, dipping might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Urine, and <U+017F>o do <U+017F>omething towards curing the Drop<U+017F>y. And
I believe the inducing a contrary Idea, would be a more effectual
way of curing other <U+017F>orts of Madne<U+017F>s, than any of the common
Methods; if Phy<U+017F>icians would give them<U+017F>elves to con<U+017F>ider of, and
put in practice the <U+017F>everal ways, and means by which it might be
done. I agree with you, That Salt does not excite Thir<U+017F>t <hi>quatenus
Acid;</hi> becau<U+017F>e that would be to do it <hi>quatenus</hi> what it is not; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it do it <hi>quatenus Alkali.</hi> And tho it has co<U+017F>t you <U+017F>o
much Money and Sweat, to re<U+017F>olve this <U+017F>tumbling Que<U+017F>tion, you
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tumble, and Sweat again, or remain under a Mi<U+017F>take. For
the Damn'd thing <hi>Bittern</hi> (to repeat your Beaui<U+017F>h Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion) is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59081:54"/>
not where, and what you <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it: Fir<U+017F>t it is not in all Salt;
for it is that which will not <U+017F>hoot with the Salt into regular Grains,
and if Boyl'd up, will not continue in a dry Form, but runs into a
Liquour in the open Air. Therefore that Salt that is <U+017F>hot into its
proper Chry<U+017F>tals and keeps dry, has no <hi>Bittern.</hi> But if this won't
do, Di<U+017F>till your Salt into an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit, and then you will be <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
there is no fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> in it: Turn this Spirit into Salt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the <U+017F>ame in quantity and Quality (as every Chymi<U+017F>t knows
how) and this Salt <U+017F>hall make you as Thir<U+017F>ty, as any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt. Secondly <hi>Bittern</hi> it <U+017F>elf is not the mo<U+017F>t corroding fix'd.-<hi>Alkali</hi>
in Nature, for tho' it will turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green (as
<hi>Allum</hi> al<U+017F>o doth) more readily than Common-Salt; yet it is not
corroding as an <hi>Alkali,</hi> as any one may Try by Ta<U+017F>ting it, and the
milde<U+017F>t fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> and they will find a difference, much more
between this and the mo<U+017F>t Corroding ones: Nor is it a fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi>
for it will ri<U+017F>e in the Fire, and come over good Spirit of Salt, even
<hi>per<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

a white in<U+017F>ipid Earth, which will not <U+017F>o much as make an <hi>Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cence</hi>
with <hi>Acids;</hi> Neither will <hi>Bittern</hi> fix it <U+017F>elf on the Parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Salt is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, for it's di<U+017F><U+017F>olved much <U+017F>ooner than Salt it
<U+017F>elf. Thus you <U+017F>ee Sir, by a little Skill in Chymi<U+017F>try your Damn'd
fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> is become a Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Volatile <hi>Acid.</hi> But <hi>Bittern</hi> in its
Natural Form ju<U+017F>t Boyl'd up into a dry Form is but a <hi>Sal<U+017F>um,</hi> not
fermenting with <hi>Acids</hi> much more than Common-Salt will, and
may be taken in as large a quantity as Common-Salt, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
no more Thir<U+017F>t than that does. But you are <U+017F>uch a Slave to
your Hypothe<U+017F>is, that every ill Effect mu<U+017F>t needs be attributed to
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> even as far as to make Poy<U+017F>ons <hi>Mortiferous</hi> merely as

Now if the Poy<U+017F>on of the Viper did con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a volatile <hi>Acid,</hi> as

not follow, That the Venom of Vipers is an <hi>Alkali.</hi> For if an
<hi>Acid</hi> has done <U+017F>ome things towards the Cure of the Bite, in one
or two Ca<U+017F>es, you can't deny but that <hi>Alkalies</hi> have done it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
For tho' in <U+017F>ome Ca<U+017F>es <hi>Acids</hi> were u<U+017F>ed, they were not u<U+017F>ed
alone, and <U+017F>o could not certainly demand the Credit of the Cure.
But you have many Ca<U+017F>es, where the Volatile Salt u<U+017F>ed without
<hi>Acids</hi> Cured. Can it be <U+017F>uppos'd Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> Salts did the
Cure, if the Poy<U+017F>on were nothing but a Volatile <hi>Alkali?</hi> Or, did
you ever <U+017F>ee any Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> in <U+017F>o little (yea or in a large) quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59081:55"/>
put into a Wound, and produce <U+017F>uch dire Effects? No, the
Infu<U+017F>ion of Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> in an Hundred times the quantity into
the Veins will not do it, or <U+017F>o much as cau<U+017F>e a Di<U+017F>order. Can the
Poy<U+017F>on of Vipers con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a Volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> and their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
abound therewith, and yet their Fle<U+017F>h be whol<U+017F>ome Food? No
<U+017F>urely. Can the Poy<U+017F>on of Vipers con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and yet
be Cured by an <hi>Alkali?</hi> And that even by an outward Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As I my <U+017F>elf have <U+017F>een in the following Experiments I <U+017F>ome
Years ago was A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant in the making of, at the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s, which were made upon Pullets and Pigeons, thus<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
We pluck'd the Feathers off the Brea<U+017F>t of one of them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Viper when he was enrag'd, we cau<U+017F>ed him to Bite; letting
the Fowl go, he Dy'd in three or four Hours. Then we took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
and caus'd him to be Bitten in like manner, by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Viper, and apply'd the Viper-Stone to the Wound, which
not only prevented Death, but all the dire Sypmtoms the other
Fowl Dy'd with; which Stone being taken off after <U+017F>ome time,
the Wound was Healed by ordinary means. Now this Stone is
an <hi>Arid</hi>-Body, making an Efferve<U+017F>cence with <hi>Acids,</hi> which could
not have <U+017F>uch great Effects in the Biting of Vipers, if the Poy<U+017F>on
were an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and to be de<U+017F>troy'd by an <hi>Acid.</hi> But tho' the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of the Viper can't Rationally be thought to be an <hi>Alkali;</hi> yet
neither do I think this Poy<U+017F>on con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in an <hi>Acid.</hi> Tho<U+017F>e Per<U+017F>ons
that have ventured to Ta<U+017F>te the Liquor in the Viper's Gums, tell
us nothing of any Acidity, or Alkalous Ta<U+017F>te, nor give us any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments

we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch Mortal Effects of <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall quantities of either <hi>Acid,</hi> or

<hi>Lemery,</hi> I confe<U+017F>s, is of the Opinion that the Poy<U+017F>on, of the Viper
is an <hi>Acid;</hi> but he (nor no Mortal I believe) has any <U+017F>uch <hi>Jargon</hi>
as you fal<U+017F>ly accu<U+017F>e him of, who is a Man capable of Teaching you
<hi>Pharmacy</hi> this Seven Years yet. To <U+017F>hew how gro<U+017F>ly you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>ed
him, I will recite his Words in this matter: I conceive, <U+017F>ays
he, what they call the Venom of Vipers, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts only in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Acid</hi> Volatile Salts, which the Animal throws out when it
Bites, and the<U+017F>e Salts pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into the Veins and Arteries, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Blood and hinder its Circulation, and the cour<U+017F>e of the
Animal Spirits, even as it happens when an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor is Syring'd
into a Vein, which may be <U+017F>ufficient to explicate all the Accidents
which happen upon the Biteing. And afterwards <U+017F>aies he, The
difference between the Effects of an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor <U+017F>yring'd into the
Veins, and tho<U+017F>e of the Venom of Vipers is this, an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor
being immediaiely infus'd into a large Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el fixes all the Blood of
a <U+017F>udden, and cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>trong <hi>Convul<U+017F>ions,</hi> which are follow'd <U+017F>hortly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59081:55"/>
with Death: Whereas the <hi>Acid</hi> Salts that flow from the Viper
when he Bites, do not Work <U+017F>o quickly; their Acidity being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as that of an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, and have long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F><U+017F>age
into the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood: And there's one Circum<U+017F>tance, adds
he, which makes my Application <U+017F>till more probable, That the
be<U+017F>t Remedics u<U+017F>ed for <U+017F>uch as are Wounded by Vipers, are tho<U+017F>e
that de<U+017F>troy <hi>Acids,</hi> and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Coagulation of the Blood, as
Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi>-Salts drawn from Animals. But to under<U+017F>tand this
more fully, continues he, it's fit to con<U+017F>ider <U+017F>everal things, Fir<U+017F>t,
Vipers are more fill'd with Volatile Salts than other Animals, and
<U+017F>o not think it <U+017F>trange that they throw out much of it in their
wrath. Secondly, Tho' the<U+017F>e Salts turn <hi>Alkalies</hi> by Di<U+017F>tillation,
they are <hi>Acids</hi> in their own Nature, before the Fire works upon
them, as I have <U+017F>aid when I <U+017F>poke of the Principles. Thirdly, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are covered with a clo<U+017F>e compact Skin; <U+017F>o that the Salts they
contain do Circulate and Subtilize much better, and do Evaporate
le<U+017F>s than other Animals. Fourthly, The <U+017F>hape of the Viper being
long, <U+017F>traight, and round, like a <U+017F>mall Gun, the Salts they throw
out in the Biting are driven with much more violence, than if they
came from a more open place. Fifthly, The two long Teeth of
the Viper being <U+017F>traight and <U+017F>harp, make deep Wounds, but which
<U+017F>hut up <U+017F>o quickly, the <hi>Acid</hi>-Salts which enter, have no pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to
come out. But it may be Objected farther, <U+017F>aies he, If the Venom
of Vipers proceed from their Volatile Salts, then the Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<U+017F>hou'd increa<U+017F>e, rather than Cure the Malady. An<U+017F>wer, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salts which flow from Living Vipers, and enter the Fle<U+017F>h by
the Bite, are very different from tho<U+017F>e drawn by the Fire from
Dead ones, which are taken at the Mouth, the fir<U+017F>t are Naturally
pointed, <hi>Acid,</hi> and Coaglating; the others have been blunted by
the Fire, and rendred Poreous, are <hi>Alkalies,</hi> very Rarifying, or
Di<U+017F><U+017F>olving, <U+017F>o are qualifyed to break and de<U+017F>troy the fir<U+017F>t. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Volatile Salt of Vipers taken at the Mouth, has another
determination then that which enters the Fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>o produces
different Effect; not being forc'd in its Motion, <U+017F>preads every where,
and di<U+017F><U+017F>olves the Coagulum the other had made in the Blood. Thus
much I have Tran<U+017F>cribed, not for the <U+017F>ake of <hi>Lemery's</hi> Opinion,
<U+017F>eeing no ground to believe the Viper abounds with <hi>Acid</hi> Salts, but
out of love to Ju<U+017F>tice, that it may be <U+017F>een how the Abu<U+017F>er of all
his Betters, has abu<U+017F>ed this Author in particular. But I have one
thing more comes into my Mind to tell you of, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> <U+017F>ince we
are Talking of Wounding, which is that I have heard, you have
formerly Boa<U+017F>ted great Things in Chirurgery, and have Wrot a

Chirurgicum,</hi> and it's Built upon a pair of Medicines, the one Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the other External, which I did not think fit to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
But here lies my Misfortune common to all tho<U+017F>e who make
new Di<U+017F>coveries; a great many believe the Truth of what I <U+017F>aid,
that my Medicines will perform what I promi<U+017F>ed; but among<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e who believe matter of Fact, many <U+017F>ay, This Man was not

New, and will <U+017F>tand the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t Te<U+017F>t, and I am certain my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines

by former Applications, and that with much greater <U+017F>peed and

                  </gap> Methods of Chirurgeons in the
Cure of Wounds, wherein they hinder and oppre<U+017F>s Nature in her
regular Operations, let a Wound be made where it will, and how,
whether by Cutting, or Contu<U+017F>ion, it matters not, the Nutritious
juice is brought immediately to the extremities of the wounded
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Now all the Medicines made u<U+017F>e of in the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Chirurgery relax the divide Fibers, that they can't
retain the Nutritious Matter, but let it pa<U+017F>s into the Wound, where
by the <U+017F>ame Medicines it's turned into the Sub<U+017F>tance commoly call'd

only are occa<U+017F>ion'd all tho<U+017F>e ill Symptoms that attend

truth of which, the nature of a <hi>Feaver</hi> is <U+017F>ufficient to confirm,
which is in the Terms of many great Men nothing but a <hi>Nixus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae</hi>
to throw off its Enemy. And a Late Learned Author in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>e
of Intermitting <hi>Feavers,</hi> the only Rational Piece in my Opinion
that ever was Writ upon that <U+017F>ubject, plainly makes it appear, That
the Seat of <hi>Agues</hi> is in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, from whence at
certain Periods of time, the Matter is thrown off by the Nerves to
all the Parts of the Body, which cau<U+017F>es the coldne<U+017F>s; this Matter
afterwards received into the Blood by the Capillary Veins being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to it, puts it into a violent motion, which cea<U+017F>es
not till the matter is thrown off by the Pores. Now after the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
have generated Matter (tho' many times in<U+017F>tead thereof
they cau<U+017F>e Mortifications) they then u<U+017F>e mundifying Medicines,
and when Nature is oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, leave her to do her own work. This
is their practice in External Wounds, but what is to be expected
where the Lungs, Liver, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wounded? Here they own
their Medicines in<U+017F>ufficient, and if any <U+017F>o wounded chance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
they count it almo<U+017F>t miraculous. But I leave it to every
Man's judgment which method is be<U+017F>t to be confided in, either
that where <U+017F>carce one in ten mi<U+017F>carieth as in mine, or where
not one in ten recovers as in the Common Method of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons:
Be<U+017F>ides there remains another thing, that is when any large
Blood-Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el is wounded how to <U+017F>top the Flux of the Blood
which they can't do without actual, or potential Cauteries, who<U+017F>e
inconveniences every body knows; and <U+017F>trict bandage often cau<U+017F>ing
Mortifications. But the methods I u<U+017F>e are <U+017F>hort and ea<U+017F>ie, thus; I
make a <U+017F>olution of my Powder in Water, or for want of it in
Urine, and <U+017F>quee<U+017F>e or inject with a Syring into the Wound if it
be deep, then clo<U+017F>e the Wound, and if large, <U+017F>tich it up and lay
a Pledget upon it. If any large Artery be cut, I hold the Pledget
clo<U+017F>e with my Hand till the Flux of Blood cea<U+017F>es which will be
in a <U+017F>mall time; then bind it on with an ea<U+017F>ie ligature, and give
my Tincture in Wine. Now to prove my Medicines agreeable to
the nature of Humane Bodies, and of that Juice by which I conjecture
the Body is nouri<U+017F>hed, and more efficacious than the Medicines u<U+017F>ed
by Chirurgeons, the following Arguments will evince. 1. They
never cau<U+017F>e Pain unle<U+017F>s ju<U+017F>t at the Application, and that very little
more than would be cau<U+017F>ed by-Spring Water. 2. No Pain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
3. If there has been Pain before, it has been taken off in
a <U+017F>hort time. 4. There has never been any <hi>Feavers</hi> be the Wound
external or internal. 5. All inci<U+017F>ed Wounds are cured if timely
u<U+017F>ed in a few days time, without Suppuration: Gun-<U+017F>hot Wounds
in fle<U+017F>hy parts are cured after the <U+017F>ame manner, only require longer
time. And by my Medicines mo<U+017F>t wounds within the Cavity of
the Body may be cured with all the ea<U+017F>e imaginable. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance

before ever Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> was heard of, I my <U+017F>elf have healed
Wounds, and that in the Joynts, without Pain, Sorene<U+017F>s or
Corruption, by Medicines that might be taken inwardly in
con<U+017F>iderable Do<U+017F>es. But <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> or any <U+017F>ort of Corro<U+017F>ion
of Copper with common <hi>Acids</hi> will cau<U+017F>e Pain, and Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Wounds, and thence <hi>Feavers.</hi> Let any body try it
on him<U+017F>elf, and he will be <U+017F>atisfied. Now what will cau<U+017F>e
Pains and <hi>Feavers,</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be of a Heterogeneous Nature,
and I <hi>po<U+017F>itively believe,</hi> that it was from your Medicine, that your
Patients in <hi>Flanders</hi> had <U+017F>o many ill Symptoms. Nature <U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tho' in vain to ca<U+017F>t out the extraneous body of Corroded
Copper, far more mi<U+017F>chievous than Lead or Iron, with which
Soldiers more mercifully wound one another. That a <hi>Feaver</hi> is
<hi>Nixus Naturae</hi> to throw off its enemy might perhaps be believed
as a great fancy of Great Men, if they could tell us who <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is. The Late Learned Author of the Treati<U+017F>e of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Feavers,</hi> if what you <U+017F>ay be true, <U+017F>eems to be a Man of
great Brain, and the Seat of <hi>Agues</hi> by him di<U+017F>cover'd, a Witty
Invention: I wi<U+017F>h you had named him, that I might have <U+017F>een
al<U+017F>o what he makes the matter of the<U+017F>e <hi>Feavers.</hi> I fancy they
mu<U+017F>t be Maggots, who every time they di<U+017F>charge their Bellies
after repa<U+017F>t, drop down their Excrements through the Nerves,
which being of an <hi>Alkalous</hi> Nature di<U+017F>olved in the <hi>aqucous</hi> Vehicle
of the <hi>Succus Nervo<U+017F>us</hi> cau<U+017F>es cold, but being received into the
Blood, and Heterogeneous to its <hi>Acid,</hi> cau<U+017F>es a Fermentation and
Heat, till the Excrementitious <hi>Alkali</hi> is ca<U+017F>t out by the Pores.
But as for the Chirurgeons when they have generated Matter;
then, for want of <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> they mundifie, and <U+017F>o leave Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> prevents all, and helps all, but I
believe Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s direction, I would <U+017F>ay his Word is the chief
thing in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. Another Man u<U+017F>ing it will do or tell of

Lungs, Liver, Guts? Why here a recovery is counted a Miracle
by the Ignorant Chirurgeons, who know nothing of the new di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<hi>Roman Vitriol.</hi> But let any Man judg which method is
be<U+017F>t, that which depends upon <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> alone, u<U+017F>ed alike
in all differences of Wonds, or that which relies on all <U+017F>orts of
Medicines in the Hands of Arti<U+017F>ts: Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> <U+017F>ays in the fir<U+017F>t me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
not one in ten mi<U+017F>caries, in the la<U+017F>t not one in ten reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

well atte<U+017F>ted Experiments,</hi> you ever cured any one Wounded in
tho<U+017F>e Parts; <U+017F>o far are you from curing Nine in Ten. If you
could have done what you pretended, I can never believe you
would have left your famous Practice. As for <U+017F>topping of Blood,
you know well where your <hi>Vitriol</hi> has failed, but let any one that
has a mind to be <U+017F>atisfied of its Vertue try it. But you abu<U+017F>e
others to <U+017F>ay, they can't <U+017F>top Blood without actual or potential
Cauteries Actual Cauteries are <U+017F>eldom u<U+017F>ed, or any potential
greater than calcined <hi>Roman Vitriol.</hi> But we know better things,
Medicines that may be taken inwardly, they are <U+017F>o mild and
whol<U+017F>om, that will <U+017F>top Blood with much more ea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>peed <U+017F>afety,
and heal far better when that is done, than your calcin'd <hi>Vitriol;</hi>
tho' we never thought fit to Quack with them. Be<U+017F>ides every
Chirurgeon who de<U+017F>erves the Name, can <U+017F>top Blood in many
ca<U+017F>es without any Medicines at all. That your Medicines are as
agreeing to the Nature of Human Bodies, and the juice by which
they are nouri<U+017F>hed as Copper is to Fle<U+017F>h, and Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> to
Blood; I readily grant, but that they are indeed friendly, your
Practice has not proved, we have only your bare A<U+017F><U+017F>ertions,
