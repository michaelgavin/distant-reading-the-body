            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF, according to the ancient Sentence of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> Man was bred and born for the publick good of his Neighbour: what greater <U+017F>ervice may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in rea<U+017F>on to be performed for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, then to <U+017F>tudy the health of its People; and the pre<U+017F>erving their parts in vigour, form and beauty? And as the Learned and prudent <hi>Plutarch</hi> declares, that man had life given him from his Maker for Knowledge <U+017F>ake, the which doth as well procure Renown to his Name, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Vertues into Action: <U+017F>o daily Experience doth evince, that the Indu<U+017F>trious hands, and unwearied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of men of worth and Learning, have been of great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, u<U+017F>e, and benefit to all ages. And may we not well grant the <U+017F>ame of Chirurgery? where we may with plea<U+017F>ure and admiration view and behold, how variou<U+017F>ly man, being either wounded, inci<U+017F>ed, pricked, battered, contu<U+017F>ed, or the like, is brought into a good form and <U+017F>hape by this excellent Art. It is he alone that can check fear in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and bani<U+017F>h danger by his Judgment; foretell Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and prevent accidents: he is as well the Comfort in the Field, as a Friend<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in the City. It is by his practice and Art that divided parts are united, it's his Skill that keeps them thus united. And as <hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>aith, we <U+017F>tand as much

in need of his help as we do of Water or Fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap>. And for this rea<U+017F>on was it, that the Ancients taught their Scholars this Art of Chirurgery in their Schools, from whence al<U+017F>o they learned their fir<U+017F>t rudiments and In<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
            <p>And <U+017F>ince my pre<U+017F>ent task wholly relates to Wounds, I <U+017F>hall divide them into general and particular Di<U+017F>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es. To the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o have I adjoyned Gun-<U+017F>hot Wounds, and a particular di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of all kinds of Wounds of the Head, thence accompanying this Treati<U+017F>e with Wounds in particular, <hi>(viz.)</hi> <U+017F>uch as in their order may be <U+017F>aid to fall from thence to the Foot. And as every of the<U+017F>e do carry with them many differences, forms, <U+017F>hapes, and habits, it <U+017F>hall be my pre<U+017F>ent endeavour to acquaint the Young Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, how to provide and arm him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e, and with what nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary In<U+017F>truments he may perform this task, and to conquer and cure the direfull Symptoms which attend many Wounds, which may inflict or accompany <U+017F>ome parts of the Body. And that I may place him in his right Tract, which may conduct him to the true and well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the<U+017F>e: the<U+017F>e four things will nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily fall under our Confideration, being very proper engins in their places to be u<U+017F>ed in Wounds, and the<U+017F>e are <hi>Ligatures, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Bol<U+017F>ters</hi> and <hi>Pledgets,</hi> of each of which a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular re<U+017F>pect is to be had, for they all require a right Order in their applications, both as touching their long or <U+017F>hort continuance at the part, a <U+017F>light pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by of which, doth very often prove detrimentall.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ligature</hi> and its two Species.</note> And fir<U+017F>t as touching <hi>Ligature,</hi> of this there are propo<U+017F>ed two contrary Species, the one to be made more <U+017F>trict, whil<U+017F>t the other may be made more loo<U+017F>e. And the<U+017F>e two have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity of parts allowed them, <U+017F>ome parts being property <U+017F>aid to be thick, and others called thin or rare. That part is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thick which is covered both with <hi>Bol<U+017F>ters</hi> and <hi>Roulers,</hi> the<U+017F>e appointed both for keeping the part warm, and al<U+017F>o for making it more firm: that called or <U+017F>aid to be rare or

loo<U+017F>e, which onely bindeth, not covereth. And the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o are to be con<U+017F>idered according to the Times of the year, in which they are u<U+017F>ed or <U+017F>aid to be applyed. Thus Winter time does generally allow to make more u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e then the Summer. Three fingers breadth for them is a very good allowance. Tho<U+017F>e <hi>Ligatures</hi> are generally accounted be<U+017F>t which are made and applyed mo<U+017F>t naturally, and tho<U+017F>e do for the mo<U+017F>t part expre<U+017F>s the greate<U+017F>t honour to the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon which are mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>itely performed by him. This made Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirm, that good <hi>Ligature</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eye, as well as give the Patient <U+017F>atisfaction.</p>
            <p>The next two <U+017F>hall be <hi>Section</hi> or <hi>Inci<U+017F>ion,</hi> and <hi>Cautery</hi> or <note place="margin">Inci<U+017F>ion <hi>and</hi> Cautery.</note>

To the well doing of which, the prompting of convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments and Medicines do much conduce, every one of which is to be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed in its proper Orb and Sphere, not hindring or detarding one another. Then are the<U+017F>e to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in their right method and form.

In places which are not <U+017F>o perillous, where the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els lie deep, and the bloud not <U+017F>o apparently contained, we may venture on larger In<U+017F>truments.

As to the parts affected, the<U+017F>e are evident enough from the property of accidents, which they <U+017F>hew: and where all the<U+017F>e are found out, the Cure goes on with <U+017F>peed and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; for <hi>Galens</hi> Proverb is very true, <hi>Dimidium facti, qui bene coepit, habet.</hi> And he that thus <U+017F>oweth the <U+017F>eeds of his Art may well expect to reap a plentifull Crop of Honour and advantage to him<U+017F>elf, as well as Ea<U+017F>e and Comfort to his Patient.</p>

And after the<U+017F>e be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to take this as a true definition of a Wound, <hi>That it is a Solution of Continuity bloudy or cruent, and recent, made newly in the Fle<U+017F>h by <U+017F>uch an In<U+017F>trument as hath a power to occa<U+017F>ion a divorce of parts formerly united.</hi> There are <U+017F>everal differences of Wounds, and the<U+017F>e are either taken from their cau<U+017F>es by which they are occa<U+017F>ioned, or from their accidents wherein they are <U+017F>cituated. The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es may be allowed to be with, or without life: with life, as occa<U+017F>ioned by the biting of <U+017F>ome venomous Bea<U+017F>t, or other <U+017F>uch like Creature; without life, happening by <U+017F>ome Sword, Stone, Blow, Arrow or the like. The Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation doth afford and allow various Differences, as <U+017F>ome Wounds happening in the Simple parts, others in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick. Under the Simple parts may be reckoned both the Sanguine and Spermatick, and to the<U+017F>e do relate Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles, Nerves, Veins and Arteries. Tho<U+017F>e we more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call the Organick parts, which are nearer related to the whole bulk. Others thereof belonging more directly to <U+017F>ome particular Member thereof. Now Wounds of the whole Trunk are generally allowed the<U+017F>e, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as being of the Head, Neck, Brea<U+017F>t and Belly.

The Differences of Wounds, as <hi>Avicen</hi> offereth in <hi><U+017F>ecund. Fenn. prim. Canon.</hi> are taken from their varieties of Solution.</p>
               <p>The Di<U+017F>criminances of Wounds are taken either from the re<U+017F>pect of the Subject, as <hi>Galen</hi> writes 3 <hi>Art. parv.</hi> as <U+017F>ome Wounds happening in a Homogeneous, others in a Heterogeneous part; or from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, in which re<U+017F>pect it is called a Simple Wound; as he al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erveth <hi>Tertio Method.</hi> to which neither Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e nor any other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome is complicated. On the contrary he alloweth that to be a Compound, to which <U+017F>omewhat is connexed or adjoyned: as you may <U+017F>ee in 4 <hi>Method.</hi> Or they are taken from the quantity which is <U+017F>olved and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but of the<U+017F>e more at large in their proper places. Wounds al<U+017F>o may be made either by Puncture, Inci<U+017F>ion, Ruption, or Contu<U+017F>ion. Tho<U+017F>e called Punctures, which are made by Thru<U+017F>ts with Swords, Pikes, Knifes, Daggers, and <U+017F>uch <U+017F>harp pointed In<U+017F>truments.

As the native <note place="margin">Generall Rules.</note>Heat is to be pre<U+017F>erved by a good Diet, and well ordering the Body. Where the Bloud is vitiated, this is to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and corrected by Purging. Where it flows too much, this is to be repelled, revelled, or derived, and the like.</p>

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does propo<U+017F>e two <U+017F>orts of Wounds: the one he calls Simple, the other Compound. The Simple he calls Solution of Continuity, having no other Affect joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, perplexed with no Fluxion, not abounding with any ill Juice, or undermined with any <hi>Intemperies,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent Cavity or Lo<U+017F>s of fle<U+017F>h. A Compound Wound, on the contrary, hath the repute of Lo<U+017F>s of fle<U+017F>h,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59608:20"/>
an adjunct Cau<U+017F>e, Affect, or Symptome. A Simple wound taken therefore in its prime <U+017F>en<U+017F>e does onely require De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iccation. A Compound, to which may be annexed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<U+017F>ion, hath al<U+017F>o a mixture of Inflammation; and this hindreth Union and Agglutination. In this ca<U+017F>e therefore the Chirurgeon is fir<U+017F>t to cure the Inflammation, then to proceed to the Wound. Green wounds, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, are but <U+017F>mally inflamed, if Matter may be procured: for Wounds do onely then inflame, when they do not <U+017F>uppurate. For they <U+017F>uppurate by a <U+017F>trange Bloud, and Heat, untill the putrefying Wound occa<U+017F>ioneth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matter. And if Exition be not made for this Matter, it being <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, it excites Inflammation about the wounded part, and breeds and begets an ill Habit therein, and rendreth both the Wound and its neighbouring parts <U+017F>ordid and corrupt.</p>
               <p>The chief Intention in curing a Simple wound is De<U+017F>ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, this being mo<U+017F>t proper for the purpo<U+017F>e: and whereas the whole Body does abound with moi<U+017F>t Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure are to be dried up by Ab<U+017F>tinence, and a thin Diet. Where any part of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> is inci<U+017F>ed, no Oleaginous medicine can take place: for this ea<U+017F>ily penetrates and entereth the Pores of the skin, and does there create a Moi<U+017F>ture, in <U+017F>tead of De<U+017F>iccation or Drine<U+017F>s; and may therefore be allowed rather to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then <U+017F>et forward the Cure. But this chiefly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a Simple wound, and <U+017F>uch as is <U+017F>uperficiall: but our Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e doth mo<U+017F>tly tend to other Wounds, where the chief Scope and Intention is to unite tho<U+017F>e Parts which are divided; which thing is performed by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>(viz.)</hi> by Stopping the Flux of bloud, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Inflammation thereby; Removing all <U+017F>trange and extraneous Bodies; Bringing the Lips of the Wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Maintaining their Union; Keeping their Sub<U+017F>tance and Temper entire; and Preventing all future Accidents.

               <p>AS the Heart is the chief Watch of man's Life, who<U+017F>e pul<U+017F>efying wheels do give motion, life and vigour to it, by having adjoyned and allowed it its main Spring of Bloud which is given it from the Arteries, which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thence en<U+017F>uing do operate as the chief Workman therein, and without which Man would <U+017F>oon run into di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution; and as the Bloud is the Trea<U+017F>ure of Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Life appears but as a dead clod: <U+017F>o ought we to <U+017F>tudy its continuance with us, and in large Fluxes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ioned either by Inci<U+017F>ion, Ruption, or Divi<U+017F>ion of any large Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, with care and diligence to <U+017F>tudy its <U+017F>peedy re<U+017F>erve, by applying <U+017F>uch Medicines as may command a quick ob<U+017F>truction of this Haemorrhagy. The Wound which we intend to treat of in this place is not of the large Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells, being either inci<U+017F>ed or lacerated: but when the <U+017F>maller Veins are inci<U+017F>ed, this Flux is to be <U+017F>peedily <U+017F>topped, unle<U+017F>s it <U+017F>pontaneou<U+017F>ly and timely do re<U+017F>train and check it <U+017F>elf.</p>

For if the Patient be of a Sanguine Complexion, corpulent Habit, having large Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells, and it be Summer-time, here the Patient may be permitted to bleed plentifully, both for preventing Inflammation, and Fluxion, and Fever.

               <head type="sub">Of Removing extraneous Bodies.</head>
               <p>THE next duty and Intention of a Chirurgeon is to remove all extraneous Bodies, which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to hinder Union and Conjunction of the parts di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. And that every thing herein may be acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rea<U+017F>on, Judgement and Art, we are fir<U+017F>t to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Shape and form of the In<U+017F>trument which is thus lodged: and this may be collected and gathered from the Contemplation of the nature and diver<U+017F>ity both of the hurt Parts, and al<U+017F>o of the Matters therein fixed. And the<U+017F>e two being con<U+017F>iderately weighed and under<U+017F>tood, the third thing, which next doth offer it <U+017F>elf, is the true method of Extracting the<U+017F>e. And becau<U+017F>e the Matter and Sub<U+017F>tances hereof may be various, as being made either of Wood, Iron, Gla<U+017F>s, Bone, Bra<U+017F>s, Lead, or the like; and their Figures as diver<U+017F>e, being <U+017F>aid to be either Long, Round, Square, or Flat; and whereas their Number is different, being One or Many, Simple or Compound; and their Magnitude is various, being Greater or Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e, their Habits being as <U+017F>trange, <U+017F>ome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows made with <U+017F>harp Iron heads fixed to them, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave In<U+017F>truments, and the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o differing in their vigour and faculty, <U+017F>ome being <U+017F>ent with, others without poi<U+017F>on: The<U+017F>e and every of the<U+017F>e ought to be well con<U+017F>idered. But expect more hereof in <hi>Gun<U+017F>hot-wounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lays this down as a Maxime, That he who would deal with Wounds aright, ought well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand the Diagno<U+017F>tick part of his Art, before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the Therapeutick; and al<U+017F>o to be well skilled in the nature of the Parts, before he pre<U+017F>cribes a Rea<U+017F>on for a Cure: it being one of his greate<U+017F>t Ornaments, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59608:22"/>
which Wounds are curable, which are incurable, and which are difficult to cure. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew the In<U+017F>truments, and farther di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of them, at the end of this Chapter; and proceed for the benefit of the young Chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>He is to ob<U+017F>erve and take notice, that in Extraction of extraneous Bodies, he well con<U+017F>ider the Shape and figure of the In<U+017F>trument or other Body which is to be extracted, and how deep it hath penetrated; and being well skilled in Anatomy, he may ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tand the frame of the Parts wherein the Weapon is infixed: that hereby he may with more plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F>s, and le<U+017F>s fear, wi<U+017F>ely undertake the Patient, to his own credit, and the Patient's ea<U+017F>e and comfort. And to every of the<U+017F>e he is to under<U+017F>tand that he hath the<U+017F>e four things adjoyned: as fir<U+017F>t, to know when it is mo<U+017F>t fit to extract the<U+017F>e Bodies; next, what way is the be<U+017F>t for their Extraction; then, what Figure is mo<U+017F>t proper; and then, what In<U+017F>truments mo<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>ite for the performing of the<U+017F>e. I <U+017F>hall enlarge a little upon each of the<U+017F>e, they being very materiall for the young Chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>If the pain be intolerable, and the infixed Weapon may commodiou<U+017F>ly and with <U+017F>afety be drawn forth, if it be <U+017F>o loo<U+017F>ely fixed as by a <U+017F>mall moving it will <U+017F>eparate from the Part, draw this forth at the fir<U+017F>t, for hereby you will both ea<U+017F>e pain, and procure re<U+017F>t to your Patient. If the Weapon be poi<U+017F>oned, deferre not Extraction, for this bringeth the whole Bulk into di<U+017F><U+017F>olution: and therefore though you are forced through Nerves, Veins, or Arteries, to cut your way, yet this is not to be delayed. And that the young Chirurgeon may not mi<U+017F>take herein, he may know the Fle<U+017F>h poi<U+017F>oned by a Weapon thus; it is of a <U+017F>trange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, it appears pale, <U+017F>ublivid, and as it were dead: in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es he ought to <U+017F>carify untill he meeteth with fre<U+017F>h bloud; and this he is to do untill the Poi<U+017F>on be removed. After which he is to apply a Cupping-gla<U+017F>s, which is the be<U+017F>t In<U+017F>trument for the calling of this forth. Be<U+017F>ides the former token, you will find it attended and accompanied
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59608:23"/>
with extraordinary Pains, with Inflammations and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Girdings, e<U+017F>pecially about the wounded parts, with a Heavine<U+017F>s and <hi>Torpor</hi> of the whole Body, and with <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi> and Alienation of mind. And be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e, the Wound hath an odd Smell with it: and the Weapon that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, (if poy<U+017F>oned) when drawn forth, and after ca<U+017F>t into the fire, doth upon its burning turn black, and <U+017F>end forth a foetid Smell. And therefore in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, where Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of life is <U+017F>o much threatned, we ought to u<U+017F>e all our Experience and Rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>torm the force of this Enemy, and batter down and overcome with convenient Medicines the vigour of its virulency. But of this expect more al<U+017F>o in <hi>Gun<U+017F>hot-Wounds.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides this al<U+017F>o, in the ca<U+017F>e of a large Flux of bloud, which may al<U+017F>o put the life of man into jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy, here are we to <U+017F>top our hands: if horrible Pain, <hi>Syncope</hi> or Convul<U+017F>ion appear, delay your Extraction.</p>
               <p>As touching the way and method how to doe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the<U+017F>e; That in the eye of all men mu<U+017F>t be allowed to be tran<U+017F>acted the be<U+017F>t, which is done with mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>And as to the Figure; If po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, gain the true figure of its Entrance, for this does make the Extraction more ea<U+017F>y.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e and <U+017F>uch other matters as may more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly be here pre<U+017F>ented <U+017F>hall appear in <hi>Gun<U+017F>hot-Wounds.</hi>

               <p>And <U+017F>ince I have already declared to you how the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man may be variou<U+017F>ly a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted by diver<U+017F>ity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments, I have here al<U+017F>o expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in this following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure how his Parts may be contu<U+017F>ed, punged, inci<U+017F>ed and lacerated, by Clubs, Stones, Swords, Pikes, Faulchions, Arrows, Shot, and the like: again<U+017F>t which, on the contrary <U+017F>ide, I have al<U+017F>o delineated <U+017F>uch commodious In<U+017F>truments, as are and have been allowed as mo<U+017F>t proper for the Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and di<U+017F>charging of the <U+017F>ame out of the wounded parts. And that every thing may be done and performed according to Rea<U+017F>on and Art, as touching the Extraction of Weapons or any other extraneous Bodies out of the Body; We are fir<U+017F>t to enquire after the In<U+017F>truments which are to execute
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59608:23"/>
this: and the<U+017F>e ought to be accommodated to the Part, the which does require their aptne<U+017F>s for the occa<U+017F>ion, both as touching their Figure and Shape. And becau<U+017F>e, as we have already noted, it is requi<U+017F>ite for the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>truments to be of various and <U+017F>undry Shapes, we ought to <U+017F>tudy a mo<U+017F>t exact Form of them for compleating this Intention. And here among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ent you with the<U+017F>e following, whereof in the next Leaf you have the true Shapes and Forms. And the fir<U+017F>t which does offer it <U+017F>elf is <hi>Terebellum,</hi> this being an In<U+017F>trument, as you may <U+017F>ee, let into another, the which having a thin and pointed Screw at its end, may take hold of a Bullet, Splinter of Wood, Bone, or the like; and having once entered it, it brings it away with it. This is marked at the Letter <hi>A.</hi> The <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a Hook to draw forth any Matter or Bone which lies <U+017F>uperficially. This is marked at <hi>B.</hi> The third is a large pair of <hi>Forcipes</hi> with Teeth, hollowed in the middle, the more apt for catching hold of any Bullet, Shot, or any other <U+017F>uperfluous matter. This is marked with <hi>C.</hi> The other pair of <hi>Forcipes</hi> are made without Teeth, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low al<U+017F>o; and this is a very ready In<U+017F>trument for laying hold of a Bullet, having both allowed them <U+017F>trong Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the more prompt extraction of any Body. And this is marked with <hi>D.</hi> The la<U+017F>t is called a pair of dented Cranes-bills, being bent or bowed, accommodated chiefly for deep Wounds; and being more <U+017F>lender then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, may with more ea<U+017F>e enter into the Orifice of the Wound. And this is marked at the Letter <hi>E.</hi>

               <p>The Weapon being extracted, what your next Intention is, <U+017F>hall be more at large declared in my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hot-wounds,</hi> this being but as a part and ab<U+017F>tract thereof.</p>

And therefore in this ca<U+017F>e give me leave to premi<U+017F>e, that in large Wounds, Purgation is very proper, and that in the<U+017F>e three re<U+017F>pects; both as touching the Excellency of the Part, the greatne<U+017F>s of the Affect, and the Malignity of the matter, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes. Oyl here ought not to be applied to the<U+017F>e Wounds, for it does both humect and relax: Sarcoticks and Driers being mo<U+017F>t proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines here to be u<U+017F>ed. Be<U+017F>ides this, Oyl rendreth the Wound more <U+017F>ordid and putrid. After this, we are to <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the naturall Temper of the Part; and where it is once e<U+017F>tranged by Air, Meats, Drinks, Evacuation and Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sleepings and Watchings, and the like, the<U+017F>e are to be corrected and amended. As for example, if a Wound do prove very moi<U+017F>t and <U+017F>ordid, and <U+017F>endeth forth much Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, here are we to <U+017F>tudy its Alteration, drying this up by a <U+017F>lender Diet, Purging, and the like.</p>
               <p>To this al<U+017F>o belong the diver<U+017F>ity of Excrements which do u<U+017F>ually accompany Wounds; and the<U+017F>e are of three

The cau<U+017F>es which generate the<U+017F>e three are held to be the naturall or unnaturall Heat; the fir<U+017F>t being the cau<U+017F>e of Dige<U+017F>tion, whereby a laudable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is generated, the unnaturall heat working up moi<U+017F>ture with it, <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>eth Putrefaction, and that ill <U+017F>mell we generally do perceive.</p>

Suppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the bloud, which is done by the Needle drawn through either Lip in form of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's Suture, is by <U+017F>ome called <hi>Sutura continuata:</hi> by this the Bloud is ea<U+017F>ily depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. This is generally u<U+017F>ed in Wounds of the Guts, or when any large Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

The Fir<U+017F>t is done by the Needle being drawn through each Lip by the right hand, holding and placing the <U+017F>tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Quill with the left, hereby making the Lips of the Wound equall. The Second is performed by taking divers Stitches, <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from each other, through the length of the Wound, bringing the Wound to a proportionate evenne<U+017F>s: and in every of the<U+017F>e Stit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the ends of the Thread are to be cut off near to the Knots. The Third <U+017F>pecies is performed by drawing the Needles through each Lip, and then by the <U+017F>ame Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice drawing them back again, and <U+017F>o by degrees bringing the Lips of the Wound clo<U+017F>er, by annexing them to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, the which by twi<U+017F>ting the Silk thereon may by degrees clo<U+017F>e up the Lips of the Wound.

And in all Sutures take this Ob<U+017F>ervation with you, that before you make any Suture, <note place="margin">Ob<U+017F>ervar.</note>you do deterge all the concreted Bloud in the Wound, both for preventing Inflammation, and furthering Agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination. The time of leaving the Sutures off, is, when Union is perfected, or Agglutination made: the which do vary, according to the largene<U+017F>s of the Wound, and in re<U+017F>pect of the Habit of the body. In great and tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e Wounds they are generally kept for eight days; in <U+017F>mall Wounds, not above three in <U+017F>ome.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Chapter, with acquainting you of the three U<U+017F>es of Suture. For it is u<U+017F>ed either for Agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of Wounds; and this is called the Incarnative Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or to keep the <U+017F>uperficial parts of the Wounds in a rea<U+017F>onable di<U+017F>tance from each other; and this is called the Retentive Suture: or to <U+017F>top the Flux of bloud; and this is termed the Suppre<U+017F><U+017F>ive Suture. Thus have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon the Joyning of the Parts <U+017F>eparated and divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. We next proceed to the Eighth Chapter.</p>

               <p>WE come now to the Fourth and Fifth Intentions: and becau<U+017F>e it oft falls out that <U+017F>ome Heterogene Sub<U+017F>tance does happen within the Lips of the Wound, as Hair, Dirt, Oyl, and the like, the which do hinder Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, this with care is to be prevented; and that we may truly <U+017F>tudy the defence of the wounded Part, and keep it from harms, there is required much care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<U+017F>try. For we may wi<U+017F>h Union in Wounds, which is Nature's work; but may mi<U+017F>s of our aim, if the Temper of the Part be not <U+017F>ound. The Body al<U+017F>o being weak, Nature does very readily throw down her Excrements to the wounded Part; whence doth ari<U+017F>e a Dy<U+017F>cra<U+017F>y both of temper and humour. Be<U+017F>ides which, the Part being it <U+017F>elf much weakned, there cannot in any rea<U+017F>on be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a good Nutriment, and hence mu<U+017F>t follow Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which not being well driven out from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part, there mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently be created a moi<U+017F>t Intempereity therein. And be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e, by rea<U+017F>on of this Intempereity, expect no fair clo<U+017F>ure of the Lips of the Wound, this Matter inwardly lodged creating a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of <hi>Sanies,</hi> which hath force and vigour enough to create a Dy<U+017F>cra<U+017F>y.</p>
               <p>And that we may therefore be armed again<U+017F>t all the<U+017F>e troubles, the<U+017F>e Sarcotick and Incarnative Medicines <U+017F>hould be of a cold faculty, that they may repell the Matter which flows; al<U+017F>o drying, and that in the <U+017F>econd degree,

We of late, according to a more modern practice, do u<U+017F>e this method after the Suture, fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>prinkling on the re<U+017F>trictive Powders, then covering them with <U+017F>ome drying and agglutinative Empl. as <hi>Diapalma, De minio,</hi> and the like: upon which we apply convenient Boul<U+017F>ters, and conclude the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing with convenient Rowlers.</p>
               <p>Now of this <U+017F>ort of Colletick Medicines we have very many, both <U+017F>imple and compound, <U+017F>et down for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.

               <p>WE are now come to the la<U+017F>t Intention, which is the Correction of Accidents: and the<U+017F>e are very various, and do as diver<U+017F>ly happen in large and deep Wounds, and do keep up Solution of Continuity. And the<U+017F>e are allowed to be nine in number: as Pain, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Haemorrhagy, <hi>Delirium,</hi> Fainting, Fever, Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Pal<U+017F>ey, and Convul<U+017F>ion. And the<U+017F>e as they are Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms in re<U+017F>pect of their greatne<U+017F>s and vehemency, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o in many ca<U+017F>es do they threaten Death. The Correction of the<U+017F>e Symptoms is to be as much regarded as the Cure of the Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">I. Pain.</note> And Fir<U+017F>t therefore, as touching Pain, this by <hi>Galen,</hi> 2. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 12. <hi>Meth.</hi> is allowed to be a <U+017F>ad and heavy <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of change, following a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as a <U+017F>hadow doth a <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance. This mo<U+017F>t generally is the cau<U+017F>e of Fluxion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Faculties, be the temper and habit of the Body formerly never <U+017F>o good: it being Pain's chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to attract Inflammation, by <U+017F>tirring the Humours into a Combu<U+017F>tion: and it falls here as in other ca<U+017F>es, the weake<U+017F>t is <U+017F>een to go by the wall. For generally the wounded Part is forced to <U+017F>ee what<U+017F>oever Pain puts to it. And therefore is it accounted a great Intention in the Chirurgeon, to allay the fury of this Enemy, and quell this trouble<U+017F>ome authour of Fluxion. And here ought he al<U+017F>o to remove his Medicines very often, le<U+017F>t by their too
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59608:29"/>
long <U+017F>tay Pain be excited. Then is he to enquire into the cau<U+017F>e and occa<U+017F>ion of this Pain; and the Species and way of the Humour by which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth, and which way Nature intends it; and here with her to join his adjutant helps for its remove.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The Second enemy we meet with is Inflammation: and this ofttimes is occa<U+017F>ioned by Pain, and <U+017F>ometimes by the Unadvi<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s, Neglect and Ignorance of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, when by too <U+017F>trict Ligatures he maketh a great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Pain, creating an interception of Spirits, and an extinction of native Heat, purcha<U+017F>ing hereby a fair way for a Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> Inflammation al<U+017F>o is most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared in Wounds of the Nerves, Cartilages, and the like; or where but a <U+017F>mall Flux of bloud does follow the Wound. In which ca<U+017F>es the Chirurgeon is to breath a Vein, and to take away a plentifull quantity of Bloud: for hereby he doth repre<U+017F>s the Heat, and extingui<U+017F>h the Flame. If Cacochymy offend, correct and amend this by convenient Purgings, and lenifying Medicines, a good order of Diet, and <U+017F>uch as may temper the Bloud, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Patient to <U+017F>hun all manner of Perturbations, which may create or <U+017F>tir up any Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions within him. If Inflammation happen by the puncture of a Nerve, or an inci<U+017F>ion thereof, wholly divide it; for it is better that Part <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e its motion, then that the whole Body <U+017F>hould be robbed of its life, as well as of its <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> I have been very plentifull in the Third already, and <U+017F>hall therefore remit you thither for this. Save onely by the way, when you come to Wounds of the Veins and Arteries, I <U+017F>hall there enlarge <U+017F>omewhat more thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Fainting.</note> As touching <hi>Syncope</hi> or <hi>Lipothymia, Galen,</hi> 12. <hi>Meth. cap.</hi> 5. does thus define it; that it is a principal Lap<U+017F>e of all the Spirits, happening by <U+017F>ome hurt of the Heart, or injury done to it, when it is quiet in its procreation and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59608:29"/>
di<U+017F>tribution of its vitall Spirits. For then, as <hi>Gordonius</hi> doth expre<U+017F>s it, both <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and motion are taken from the whole Body, the Pul<U+017F>e becomes flat and dull, and Death appears in the face. And in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es the Patients are <U+017F>een to fall down without either <U+017F>en<U+017F>e or motion. This <hi>Syncope</hi> which does mo<U+017F>t commonly intervene in Wounds is for the mo<U+017F>t part from an Haemorrhagiall cau<U+017F>e, the which does make this di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of Spirits; or Fear, the which does make a <U+017F>peedy revocation of the Spirits to the Heart, whence followeth that every Part is forced to leave work, whil<U+017F>t this Di<U+017F>turbance is thus in action. A <hi>Syncope</hi> does ofttimes happen, as <hi>Galen</hi> does ob<U+017F>erve, from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenate and putrid Vapour pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to the Heart through the Arteries, and to the Brain by its Nerves. And hence by mo<U+017F>t Authours are granted the<U+017F>e three cau<U+017F>es of <hi>Syncope.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t is made by the di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of the Spirits and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat, as in a large Haemorrhagy: then by oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion or ob<U+017F>truction of the<U+017F>e Spirits, as in Fear; for thus the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are called back from the Circumference to the Center: and thirdly by Corruption, as in Cacochymick bodies, and venenate Wounds. The fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e are cured, if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Medicines be <U+017F>peedily applied and admini<U+017F>tred; as by <U+017F>prinkling cold water on the face, laying him on his back, and <U+017F>topping his Flux. The <U+017F>econd by good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls, by cheri<U+017F>hing and reviving his Spirits, by clapping <U+017F>weet Smells to his no<U+017F>trills, frictions of his Temples. But if a venenate Quality does occa<U+017F>ion this, cure this by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, Actuall Cauteries, application of live Pigeons cut in the middle, Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation and interception of this Matter which is to be fetched out.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. <hi>Delirium.</hi>
                  </note> Neither is <hi>Delirium</hi> in Wounds le<U+017F>s dangerous, which is a perillous Affect ari<U+017F>ing from <U+017F>ome principall or noble Part, as the Nerves, Brain, Heart, <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the like, the<U+017F>e, or any of the<U+017F>e, being wounded. For this <hi>Delirium</hi> is nothing el<U+017F>e but a deprivation of Motion, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59608:30"/>
an alienation of Sen<U+017F>e, contained in the wounded Brain by e<U+017F><U+017F>ence or con<U+017F>ent. Hence is it, that we <U+017F>o oft <U+017F>ee in <U+017F>uch as are bit by a mad Dog, that venomous Vapours do a<U+017F>cend upwards into their Heads, and fill the poro<U+017F>ities of the Brains, which makes them <U+017F>o frantick and idle. It does ari<U+017F>e from a vehement Pain and Inflammation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>uch Medicines as may cure Pain and Inflammation are very proper here. If it ari<U+017F>eth from Poy<U+017F>on, Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmicks are the be<U+017F>t engines to remove it. For deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interception of the matter which doth excite this <hi>Delirium,</hi> alterant and evacuating Cly<U+017F>ters are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Phlebotomy, Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, Actuall and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Cauteries are here mo<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>ite. Setons and Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinells are fair Orifices for letting out its venome. Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, Emul<U+017F>ions and good Decoctions may defend it from the Heart. Hordeaceous and Papaverall Decoctions may bani<U+017F>h it, by procuring Re<U+017F>t. And as it is a deprivation of the principall faculty of Motion, <U+017F>o are we to take care of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. Fever.</note> But becau<U+017F>e this more properly does belong to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ician to examine and advi<U+017F>e about, I <U+017F>hall briefly <U+017F>hut up this Symptome, onely acquainting you, that <hi>Avicen, fen.</hi> 1. does call that a Fever, which is an extraneous, adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, accen<U+017F>ive heat in our Heart, by which the Veins and Arteries therewith <U+017F>haring, it's carried through the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of our whole Body, and hurteth its actions. Neither is there any Fever allowed where the Heart is not affected, either primarily, or <U+017F>econdarily, being a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereity.</p>
               <p>But to come to that which more properly does relate to large Wounds: and here, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> offereth, untill a good Dige<U+017F>tion be procured, both Fever, Pain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation do attend the Part: for whil<U+017F>t the Matter is making, the Heat does increa<U+017F>e. Sometimes a Fever does ari<U+017F>e from the Bite of a venomous creature; and therefore as it does carry this poy<U+017F>onous quality to the Heart, there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59608:30"/>
endeavouring to infect its Spirits, it very readily runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fever and Inflammation. Now where this happens, cool the body by Phlebotomy: if ill Humous do joyn in the combate, di<U+017F>patch the<U+017F>e by convenient Catharticks. And in re<U+017F>pect of the Poy<U+017F>on, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks: for the Pain and Inflammation, prepare Anodynes; <U+017F>hunning all things which may procure a vehement motion, di<U+017F>turbance and perturbations of the mind; and u<U+017F>e your greate<U+017F>t indu<U+017F>try to bring every part to its due order, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7. Crudity.</note> Crudity al<U+017F>o is a great enemy to the healing of Wounds; for it does afford no laudable Matter, without which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no good new Fle<U+017F>h. And this by many Authours is allowed to happen by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix means: by a continuall <note place="margin">Six things cau<U+017F>ing Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</note>Flux of bloud, where no good Dige<U+017F>tion is; by an In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contu<U+017F>ing the Part, as happens in Gun<U+017F>hot-wounds; by the nature of the Part, <U+017F>uch as deep Wounds in the Joynts; by coldne<U+017F>s of the Air; by applying of unfit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; and la<U+017F>tly, by too <U+017F>trict Ligature. As for the fir<U+017F>t, this you have already <U+017F>hown. The <U+017F>econd is to be dige<U+017F>ted as contu<U+017F>ed Wounds. A<U+017F>tringent Medicines are to be applied to the Articulations, to pre<U+017F>erve their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Air is to be corrected; the Part to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed with convenient Medicines; and the <U+017F>trict Ligature to be relaxed. And thus may you cure the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix Cau<U+017F>es of Crudity. The other two remaining Symptoms I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak of a little more largely, they being of great con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Pal<U+017F>ey.</head>
               <p>A Pal<U+017F>ey by the generall Con<U+017F>ent of Authours is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Re<U+017F>olution or Relaxation of the Nervous parts, with Deprivation both of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>ide, or both <U+017F>ides of the Body, or in <U+017F>ome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this mo<U+017F>t properly is called a Pal<U+017F>ey. Now the Nervous bodies are re<U+017F>olved, in that the animall Spirits do not act in them, neither are they filled or enlightned with vigour and briskne<U+017F>s. The cau<U+017F>es whereof are referred to the Ob<U+017F>truction of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, the which does hinder their Tran<U+017F>piration. In a Pal<U+017F>ey, Motion, or Sen<U+017F>e, onely, or both may be hurt together. And this may be acted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Completion, Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity. For either their Ductures are filled up with <U+017F>ome extraordinary Matter impacted in them, or compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by extrava<U+017F>ed Bloud or <U+017F>ome Tumour, or Solution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity made by <U+017F>ome Wound or Concu<U+017F><U+017F>ion: and every of the<U+017F>e may imprint their <U+017F>everall rea<U+017F>ons and cau<U+017F>es for a Pal<U+017F>ey. And as our Countryman Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> does ob<U+017F>erve, as often as an univer<U+017F>all Pal<U+017F>ey or <hi>Hemiplexia</hi> does <U+017F>ucceed a Lethargy, a <hi>Caros,</hi> or Apoplexy, it's very ea<U+017F>y to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this change of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e does happen from a <hi>Meta<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is</hi> or Tran<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the morbifick matter. And if it may be enquired why that Sen<U+017F>e and Motion are not alwaies equally inhibited in a Pal<U+017F>ey, either of the<U+017F>e is perfected in their proper Nerves and Fibres, and either Faculty is as the aver<U+017F>ion of each other. Ju<U+017F>t as the Light ca<U+017F>teth its beams through a Gla<U+017F>s, when the Wind is excluded: <U+017F>o ofttimes Motion is aboli<U+017F>hed, the Sen<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <U+017F>afe and <U+017F>ound. For Sen<U+017F>e is as a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, a <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59608:31"/>
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the which by the continuity of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous proce<U+017F>s is carried from the Organ to the common Sen<U+017F>ory; without which the faculty of the Spirits is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by cour<U+017F>e and <U+017F>trength. Now Motion is a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and difficult action, to the which is required the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<U+017F>ion or explo<U+017F>ion of Spirits, not onely in the motionall Organs, but chiefly in the Parts where the beginning of Motion and its fir<U+017F>t affection does draw its Origination. For from hence floweth its whole conduct of its explo<U+017F>ive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, the which it acteth through all its Nervous parts. In the Spinall marrow an Interception of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or Cohibition thereof, making a Pal<U+017F>ey, very oft doth happen, by rea<U+017F>on of Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or Solution of Continuity. The extrava<U+017F>ed Bloud, or Matter pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing forth from the di<U+017F>rupted Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s, does very oft <U+017F>hut up and ob<U+017F>cure the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Spirits. Hence Wounds of the Head, Concu<U+017F><U+017F>ions or Inci<U+017F>ions do not onely fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pervert or lacerate the Medullary tracts, but al<U+017F>o by their coldne<U+017F>s do con<U+017F>tipate and bind up their <U+017F>piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages.</p>
               <p>The next thing we propo<U+017F>e is, whether this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e be accidentall, or habituall. The fir<U+017F>t may be <U+017F>aid to come from an evident cau<U+017F>e, as being procured by Wounds, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>ions, Concu<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Exce<U+017F>s of cold or heat: be<U+017F>ides which it hath no other then a Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity. An habituall Pal<U+017F>ey hath its dependence from a procatarctick cau<U+017F>e, the which is an extraneous Matter, and as it were vitriolized, <U+017F>uffu<U+017F>ed into the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion, profligating the Spirits by contaction. A Pal<U+017F>ey does much differ from a Convul<U+017F>ion, in that in the <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ey and a Convul<U+017F>ion<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Cau<U+017F>es of a Pal<U+017F>ey.</note>fir<U+017F>t, Re<U+017F>olution and Relaxation is its proper quality; in the latter, Contention and Contraction.</p>
               <p>We come now to the Cau<U+017F>es of this Pal<U+017F>ey, which are generally allowed to be both inward and outward. The inward ob<U+017F>tructing the Ventricles of the Brain, <U+017F>o as the animall Spirit, which <U+017F>hould be conveyed to the Nerves of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59608:32"/>
Sen<U+017F>e and Motion, is wholly aboli<U+017F>hed. The externall Cau<U+017F>es being Wounds, Concu<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Percu<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Inci<U+017F>ions, Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, or Con<U+017F>trictions, or violent Colds occluding the Spirits. From what Humour a Pal<U+017F>ey may be <U+017F>aid to proceed, is hard to tell. For Melancholy drying the Nerves cannot be the Humour. Choler, having allowed it a drying quality al<U+017F>o, and having an acrimony joyned to it, may rather be allowed to create Convul<U+017F>ion, by contracting and convelling the Nerves. And therefore it mu<U+017F>t either proceed from the Bloud, or Phlegm. It very rarely happens from Bloud alone, unle<U+017F>s by accident. It's therefore granted by a generall con<U+017F>ent, that it is bred from thick Phlegm, bordering upon the Nerves. But I rather pre<U+017F>ume that it happens from thin Phlegm, which flows from the Brain, and therein does create an Ob<U+017F>truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through its whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, making it more <U+017F>oft, out of which <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s there follows an explo<U+017F>ion of the Nerves. A <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance very contrary to its naturall Con<U+017F>truction, the which does wholly aboli<U+017F>h the motion of the Nerves where it is in<U+017F>erted. Thus if the whole <U+017F>pinall Marrow be affected, there does <U+017F>ucceed a Re<U+017F>olution of the whole from the Head; if onely one part, that part onely bears the lo<U+017F>s. Thus have we given a brief di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ey, and its inward and outward cau<U+017F>es: let us now come more clo<U+017F>ely to that which chiefly does belong to our pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>When therefore a Nerve is wounded or amputated, there mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow a Pal<U+017F>ey upon the part, becau<U+017F>e both Sen<U+017F>e and Motion in the action are lo<U+017F>t and bani<U+017F>hed; and being thus divided, it's impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to fetch them again: for being once cut, they do gather towards their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls. Therefore when any Nerve is either inci<U+017F>ed, cut or punctured, Pain being hereupon a very ready atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Anodynes are here mo<U+017F>t proper, defending the Wound from cold and all <U+017F>harp things, and u<U+017F>e comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and <U+017F>trengthening Medicines. But of the<U+017F>e more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> does give all good Chirurgeons this Caution, that he ought to under<U+017F>tand the primary Affect hereof and its place, and from whence this mi<U+017F>chief ari<U+017F>eth, and its di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition. And he who is ignorant of the<U+017F>e, may not be allowed skilfull enough to cure tho<U+017F>e Parts who<U+017F>e Sen<U+017F>e and Motion are vitiated. The fir<U+017F>t we do fetch from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy, which is an excellent Schoolma<U+017F>ter, the which perfectly learneth us how to know the Nerves which are <U+017F>prinkled about the Face, <U+017F>ent thither from the Brain. If <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e with the whole Body be re<U+017F>olved, it cannot in rea<U+017F>on be allowed, that this di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of Re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the Brain it <U+017F>elf, whereas the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Face do remain unhurt and <U+017F>afe.

                  <note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>ages.</note> To pre<U+017F>age and judge of a Pal<U+017F>ey, and every occa<U+017F>ion which may cau<U+017F>e and produce it, and every affect of the Nerves, as touching their <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>es or cures, this mo<U+017F>t properly does belong to the Progno<U+017F>tick part. And thus according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> we may pre<U+017F>age that a Pal<U+017F>ey is hard to cure in old men, becau<U+017F>e their native Heat is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t extingui<U+017F>hed. And <hi>Galen</hi> does affirm, if Fever and Trembling have <U+017F>upervened a Pal<U+017F>ey, it's a good <U+017F>ign: for Fevers do partly di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the <U+017F>uperfluous Humours which are in Re<U+017F>olution of the Nerves, and do partly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t their coldne<U+017F>s. A Solution of the Nerves, as <hi>Galen</hi> does worthily declare, is never perfectly cured. A Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ey proceeding from an inward cau<U+017F>e is not ea<U+017F>ily found out, or ea<U+017F>ily cured. A Pal<U+017F>ey following an Apoplexy is <U+017F>carce curable, the cau<U+017F>e being vehement, and the Parts weak. Where Sen<U+017F>e and Motion do appear to be both lo<U+017F>t, this does prove very dangerous. If the Parali<U+017F>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59608:33"/>
member do change its colour, expect no Cure, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat is extingui<U+017F>hed, and the animal Spirits aboli<U+017F>hed. If it happen from an evident cau<U+017F>e, as by a Blow, a Wound, or the like, if it do not quickly amend, or give way to Medicines, it does prove for the mo<U+017F>t part incurable. Such as are once cured of a Pal<U+017F>ey ari<U+017F>ing from an evident cau<U+017F>e, are not readily troubled therewith a <U+017F>econd time. And to conclude the Pre<U+017F>ages, if Pal<U+017F>eys happen in Aged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or in Cacochymick or Scorbutick bodies, and in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereities, the<U+017F>e are very hard to remove.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> And <U+017F>ince, as I have already propo<U+017F>ed, we <U+017F>ee that a Pal<U+017F>ey does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of manifold Types and divers Cau<U+017F>es, its Cure is al<U+017F>o to be performed after a various manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tituting a proper method to every <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And as there are generally allowed three kinds or <U+017F>orts hereof, <U+017F>o <U+017F>hould there be propo<U+017F>ed three kinds of Cure. Fir<U+017F>t, for Re<U+017F>olution, this being the main Agent, this is to be cured, Secondly, if it happen by Wound, Inci<U+017F>ion, exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Cold, or a Fall from a high place, this al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t have allowed it its way of Cure. Thirdly, as it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctick and primary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of it <U+017F>elf. I mu<U+017F>t leave the fir<U+017F>t and third, and onely take the <U+017F>econd for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>And whereas we here do grant, that this Pal<U+017F>ey does happen by <U+017F>ome Accident, produced by <U+017F>ome vehement Hurt, there will not be required many Intentions for this, <U+017F>ave onely the Conformity of the hurt Part to be made into its pri<U+017F>tine frame. And that no Affect, as Bloud or affluent Humours, may bring detriment to the affected Part, Phlebotomy in this ca<U+017F>e is very <U+017F>peedily to be made u<U+017F>e of, if nothing hinders it; and the Body is to be kept open by lenifying Purgings, and a good order of Diet, keeping your Patient in a moderate Sweat in his bed, <U+017F>o as all Superfluities may be exhaled and called back from the hurt Part. And for this U<U+017F>e <hi>Pulvis ad Ca<U+017F>um</hi> is granted a good Medicine, to be given in White wine, to

To this may be added many other Cephalick herbs and flowers, to be brui<U+017F>ed, and boiled in Beer, for the Patient to drink either at meals, or morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

A <U+017F>mall while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, falling into a Drowzine<U+017F>s of mind, and a Sleepine<U+017F>s, without an Apoplexy, being asked <U+017F>everall que<U+017F>tions, he very aptly an<U+017F>wered them, yet <U+017F>lowly, and as it were di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed.

               <p>AMong<U+017F>t all the preternaturall Affects which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tent in Solution of Continuity, and which do bring danger of Inflammations, Watchings, <hi>Delirium,</hi> and Convul<U+017F>ion, Wounds of the Nerves and Nervous parts are mo<U+017F>t dangerous: for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>eldome do goe without their Symptoms. This Convul<U+017F>ion in Wounds is a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Symptome, for it is an involuntary Contraction of the Parts towards their Originall, pro<U+017F>ternating their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Pain, aboli<U+017F>hing all voluntary Motion, without which Life is but a trouble<U+017F>ome thing. And that it is a morbifick cau<U+017F>e may from hence be collected, in that it does deprive the Parts of their proper Motion. For as when Deglutition is hindred, there does follow an Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all parts, <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently a Con<U+017F>umption. Even thus while the Urine or Excrements are detained, Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es are made in the Cavities: and al<U+017F>o in Intempereity, Magnitude, and Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ion is.</note> The Nature therefore of a Convul<U+017F>ion is diligently and carefully to be minded and con<U+017F>idered, and its Cau<U+017F>es, that we may better find out the way of its thus happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Wounds. We allow therefore that a Spa<U+017F>m is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Motion happening in the voluntary moving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and is a nervous Di<U+017F>tempereity, by which contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mu<U+017F>cles they are altogether made incapable of extention; and it is a principall affection of the Nerves, which do obey a voluntary command. And that this de<U+017F>cription may the better be under<U+017F>tood, we may much enlarge in our knowledge hereof by Anatomy. All Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59608:36"/>
being procurated and procured by the animall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which are exerci<U+017F>ed and performed by the Mu<U+017F>cles and their Tendons, as by their proper In<U+017F>truments; whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles do contract their Beginning and <hi>Radix</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their End, they al<U+017F>o do draw with them their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Members, as Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments. For no proper animall Motion can be made in any living creature without Mu<U+017F>cles, and the<U+017F>e do take their moving Faculty from the Brain. For although the Brain it <U+017F>elf be not fibrous, the body of its Nerves is fibrous: and the<U+017F>e are the me<U+017F><U+017F>engers which do convey this Spirit into the Mu<U+017F>cles, and through them, which do give them both their <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and motion. Now therefore, when by any preternaturall affect the Nerves or Tendons are pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, inflamed, or otherwi<U+017F>e hurt, they do recede from their pri<U+017F>tine vigour, and do prove incapable In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and hence follows Convul<U+017F>ion, or that contractive motion we call a Spa<U+017F>m. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 39. writes, a Convul<U+017F>ion to be a hurting of the voluntary Function, becau<U+017F>e herein the moving quality is as it were tied up from acting in its proper <U+017F>phere; and thus Motion is hindred, the In<U+017F>trument thereof not being wanting, but hindred in its action by being girt up by the Di<U+017F>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity of the In<U+017F>trument. And therefore Spa<U+017F>m or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ion by <hi>Johan. Andr.

                  <hi>Convul<U+017F>io Scapulo<U+017F>a.</hi> The third is <hi>Tetanos,</hi> or <hi>Totum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>um:</hi> and this Convul<U+017F>ion is made, when all the fore and back Parts of the body are equally contracted, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them as it were at a <U+017F>tay, and making them very <U+017F>tiff. <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> does declare, that there is no Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e more outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, cruell, and acute, then that which by a <hi>Rigor</hi> or Stiffne<U+017F>s of the Nerves and Sinews does annex the Head to the <hi>Scapula's,</hi> the Chin to the Brea<U+017F>t, and maketh the Neck right and immovable. In which Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he hath both briefly and elegantly <U+017F>et down the three differences of Spa<U+017F>m, which we have been di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of. He hath al<U+017F>o a fourth Species there of a Spa<U+017F>m, which he calls <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>mus Cynicus;</hi> as when the Mouth is pulled awry, or one or both Hands be contracted.</p>
               <p>All the chief cau<U+017F>es which do produce the<U+017F>e Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions are by him reckoned as three: <hi>(viz.)</hi> Plethory, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anition, and Sympathy. Of the<U+017F>e in their Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Plethory.</note> I begin with Plethory, <U+017F>o called from its copiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and plenitude of divers Humidities, the which do replete and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the In<U+017F>truments of voluntary Motion; as the Body being thick and fle<U+017F>hy, the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells full, the Pul<U+017F>e <U+017F>trong, the Age ripe, the Complexion <U+017F>anguine, and the like. Thus by Plethory or Plenitude Convul<U+017F>ion may be <U+017F>aid to be made, when the Nervous bodies and their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are nouri<U+017F>hed with thick and glutinous Matter, and are therewith al<U+017F>o repleted: by which Repletion they are di<U+017F>tended; and hence, as they fill out in bulk, they do <U+017F>horten in their length: hence do they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and abbreviated, and <U+017F>o are they run into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inanition.</note> The Second is Inanition: and this is made for want of naturall Moi<U+017F>ture; the Nerves being hereof de<U+017F>titute, do <U+017F>oon grow dry and <U+017F>hort. For they mu<U+017F>t needs grow <U+017F>horter, as does a Cord, when once being wet, and dried again, it <U+017F>hrinks and <U+017F>hrivells up: <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o do the Nerves being corrugated. The Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e therefore which does fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59608:37"/>
a Convul<U+017F>ion is a perver<U+017F>e figure of the Mu<U+017F>cles, in which they are made <U+017F>horter by Inanition as well as Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus every humourall Matter which may be <U+017F>aid to fill the Fibres, may al<U+017F>o be allowed to create a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ion. And this may be confirmed of Inanition, that every thing which hath power to make this, hath al<U+017F>o <U+017F>trength enough in it to frame a Spa<U+017F>m. And hence <U+017F>ometimes immoderate Evacuations or Vomitings, which are allowed to dry very much, do <U+017F>o ofttimes bid fair to a Convul<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sympathy or Con<U+017F>ent.</note> A Third Cau<U+017F>e is called Sympathy: and this is <U+017F>aid to happen by malign Vapours offending the Originations of the Nerves, as it is ofttimes <U+017F>een in poy<U+017F>oned Wounds. Another is <U+017F>aid to be made by Pain attracting the Nerves from their Originations. A third which may offer it <U+017F>elf is from immoderate Cold, cau<U+017F>ing in them a great Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>What remains in the Cau<U+017F>es of Convul<U+017F>ion is, to <U+017F>hew how this may be made in Wounds. And here may we <U+017F>ee how this may be made out of Plethory, the Nerves being filled with purulent Matter, or other Excrements, generated either in the wounded Part, or <U+017F>ent thither from other Parts, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ucked up by the Nerves; as it oft happens when a Nerve is half divided or cut: or by rea<U+017F>on of Inflammation, the Part being filled with a large Flux of bloud, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tending the Nervous parts; e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if this Di<U+017F>affection be communicated to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of them, or the Nerve it <U+017F>elf be primarily offended. And hereby the Mu<U+017F>cles become <U+017F>horter, and <U+017F>o forced to contract towards their Originall, neither by Heat alone, but al<U+017F>o by immoderate Cold in Wounds of the Nerves and Nervous parts, hereby <U+017F>uffering Convul<U+017F>ion, this prohibiting the Excretion of Excrements, and <U+017F>hutting up and conden<U+017F>ing the Porous bodies. Out of Inanition may al<U+017F>o be made Convul<U+017F>ion, and this al<U+017F>o by Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and this mo<U+017F>t generally happens in Wounds of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59608:37"/>
Nervous parts. For thus the inflamed Part is convelled, and an<U+017F>wers directly to Convul<U+017F>ion, and hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates it <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ome principall Part, the which being there received, does communicate of its Di<U+017F>tempereity through the whole Body. Convul<U+017F>ion does ofttimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Wounds of the Nervous parts, in re<U+017F>pect of ex<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounded Part, which does <U+017F>end forth its ill habits to the Brain, the Origination of them, by which the Brain it <U+017F>elf is vellicated and irritated: and being thus concu<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that it may clear it <U+017F>elf from the mi<U+017F>chief this portends it, and give a <hi>quietus</hi> to this unhappy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow Convul<U+017F>ion upon this combate in the <U+017F>ubject Parts. But <U+017F>uch motions as the<U+017F>e do prove generally univer<U+017F>all, even as the <U+017F>pirituous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is carried to the Brain through the affected Nerve, being either prickt, cut, or hurt, containing a putredne<U+017F>s in it. So al<U+017F>o of Cold may follow Spa<U+017F>m, being a great enemy to the Nerves.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Signs of Convul<U+017F>ion.</note> The Signs of a Convul<U+017F>ion are readily to be di<U+017F>cerned, for the Part is drawn towards its Origination, and there it does create <U+017F>uch a Stiffne<U+017F>s, that it is not ea<U+017F>ily to be extended. <hi>Galen,</hi> 1. <hi>Proret. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Tract.</hi> 20. <U+017F>aith that it is an Affect full of Pain.

Upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her upper parts, finding no harm or defect there, the lower parts remaining <U+017F>tupid, dull and re<U+017F>olved, the Chirurgeon immediately did apply hot Stupes to her feet, by which was <U+017F>u<U+017F>citated <U+017F>omewhat of Heat.

grievous Pain in her Back: growing faint herewith, and coming to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he complained of her Back being wounded and re<U+017F>olved. Upon examining the Wound, which was on the right <U+017F>ide of her Back, near the eighth and ninth Ribs, coming downwards obliquely towards the Spine, he found it exactly round: and whereas in its Circumference there appeared no <U+017F>ign of Contu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it to have happened by the force of the Shot, he ordered her Cloaths to be examined, in which he al<U+017F>o found a hole made by the Bullet; upon which he fairly conjectured, that this Wound was made by this Shot, and that it had penetrated the Spinall marrow. Divers Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons being called into Con<U+017F>ultation, they all did judge the <U+017F>ame, and by a generall con<U+017F>ent, a Probe being <U+017F>ent into the Wound, part of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> was found to be lacerated. Ten daies being expired <U+017F>ince the hurt, <U+017F>he grew wor<U+017F>e, and troubled with Vomiting and a great Heat in the upper part of her Spine, with pain of her Head, and Spa<U+017F>m about her Neck.

               <p>WE ought to deal with all Wounds <U+017F>o as they may an<U+017F>wer expectation: and now coming to Caver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Wounds, we may as readily account that a Hollow Wound, which hath not onely lo<U+017F>t a part of its Fle<U+017F>h, but that al<U+017F>o which happeneth by a <U+017F>imple Inci<U+017F>ion, without lo<U+017F>s of Fle<U+017F>h, the Lips of which Wound, by rea<U+017F>on of the greatne<U+017F>s and large di<U+017F>tance, cannot be aptly united in the bottome, whence there does remain a Cavity therein. And as for the Cure hereof, we are fir<U+017F>t to mind the Flux, for avoiding of Inflammation. And if occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>erve, and the time of the year does require it, we may breath a Vein, and pre<U+017F>cribe cooling Syrups and Decoctions, and order Purgations, and <U+017F>uch a thin Diet as may keep the Body in good temper. And becau<U+017F>e in <U+017F>uch large and hollow Wounds there is generally <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Matter to lodge in their bottomes, the which the Part of it <U+017F>elf is not capable to di<U+017F>charge; we here ought in the fir<U+017F>t place to u<U+017F>e Dige<U+017F>tives, hereby to dige<U+017F>t the Matter, and to bring it into a laudable <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, that is, <U+017F>uch a Matter as is both white, <U+017F>mooth, equall, and void

of all bad <U+017F>mell. And the<U+017F>e are to be applied no longer, then while this laudable Matter is made, and all Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be removed, keeping and pre<U+017F>erving the naturall Temper of the Parts. And herein Nature is very ready to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t in this Operation: for as the Part is fle<U+017F>hy, this is <U+017F>uddenly renewed, and re<U+017F>tored by Bloud lodged in the Mu<U+017F>cles, out of which is generated a new Fle<U+017F>h. With Dige<U+017F>tives may al<U+017F>o be admixed Deter<U+017F>ives: for as the fir<U+017F>t are proper in the beginning, <U+017F>o the latter are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite in the following part.

               <head type="sub">Of a Contu<U+017F>ed Wound.</head>
               <p>WE have already <U+017F>hewn how a Simple wound is to be cured; but when any other Affect is joyned to it, this Affect is fir<U+017F>t to be cured, and then the Wound. <hi>Galen</hi> doth advi<U+017F>e, if any <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> Contu<U+017F>ion, <hi>Ecchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>is,</hi>

                  <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas,</hi> or the like, <U+017F>hould happen upon a Wound, the<U+017F>e are fir<U+017F>t to be removed; for they onely do adde fewell to the fire. And this is held a certain rule among<U+017F>t all Authours, that we mu<U+017F>t never expect to cure a Wound, untill we have conquered the Symptoms. For as the Wound of it <U+017F>elf doth onely require De<U+017F>iccation; <U+017F>o having Contu<U+017F>ion joyned to it, this is readily to be turned into Putrefaction, and that to be converted into laudable Matter. And becau<U+017F>e the ordinary entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cure of this Wound is ofttimes intercepted by the importunity of Accidents, let it be your fir<U+017F>t care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s the<U+017F>e, and then proceed to the Cure it <U+017F>elf. If the Accident be Pain or Tumour, allay the Pain by <U+017F>ome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyne Medicine; of which <U+017F>ort are <hi>Ol. Aneth. Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. Lilior. Ro<U+017F>arum, Crocus,</hi> and the like. Abate the Tumour by removing both its antecedent and conjunct Cau<U+017F>e; the fir<U+017F>t being the Humour fir<U+017F>t flowing, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being that part of Humour which hath already made its flux. As to the fir<U+017F>t, if it proceed of Bloud occa<U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fluxion, this is to be let out or di<U+017F>charged by the place from whence it floweth, or by the place to which it floweth. This Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion is curbed and bridled by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, and a cooling Diet: and to keep it from flowing further, Revul<U+017F>ion and Repul<U+017F>ion are two proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to effect this; the fir<U+017F>t withdrawing and courting the Humour into another part, the other repelling it when it is once <U+017F>ent. If other Humours do occa<U+017F>ion this Fluxion, then di<U+017F>charge the<U+017F>e by Catharticks, and <U+017F>uch as may an<U+017F>wer the nature of the Humour.</p>
               <p>We come next to the Wound it <U+017F>elf: and here are we chiefly to con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e two Intentions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Suppuration, and then to generate a new Fle<U+017F>h. And becau<U+017F>e, as <hi>Galen</hi> pre<U+017F>cribes, every Suppuration is to be procured by Putrefaction, and every thing that putrefies is affected with a hot and moi<U+017F>t Humour, the chief Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore here is, to apply <U+017F>uch Medicines as may

                  <hi>ECchymo<U+017F>is,</hi> or an Effu<U+017F>ion of bloud coagulated under the Skin, is allowed a Solution of Continuity, the which is generally accompanied with <U+017F>ome Contu<U+017F>ion and Ruption. The Cau<U+017F>es of which, whether procured by <U+017F>ome Fall, Stroke, or other Accident, you will be<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand by the Patient's own di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. This <hi>Ecchymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is</hi> does <U+017F>ometimes happen by the Apertion of the mouth of <U+017F>ome Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, and then this is called <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is:</hi> the which is procured in re<U+017F>pect of the Weakne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ome Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell in that part where this plenty of bloud is <U+017F>catte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;

or by <U+017F>ome inward <U+017F>harp Matter which is allowed to have an inci<U+017F>ive quality; or by <hi>Diapede<U+017F>is,</hi> the which is a Tran<U+017F>colation or Exilition; this al<U+017F>o ari<U+017F>ing from the Coat of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell being made rare and thin, and the Bloud being al<U+017F>o thin. But our pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e does onely reach that which is made by Contu<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>This therefore is allowed a Solution of Continuity; and in re<U+017F>pect of its profu<U+017F>ion of bloud it produceth Pain, and hence <U+017F>ometimes do follow Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es, the which by Tran<U+017F>piration are to be dige<U+017F>ted. A large Contu<U+017F>ion is not without danger, for this does very often not onely procure Corruption of the Part it <U+017F>elf, but al<U+017F>o of the whole Body. This is generally reputed an <hi>Ecchymo<U+017F>is,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of an <hi>Ecchymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is.</hi>

It taketh its diver<U+017F>ity of figure from its variety of cau<U+017F>e: the Parts about it are black, the Bloud being <U+017F>hut up therein, and cannot be di<U+017F>charged by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible or <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Tran<U+017F>piration, but by Suppuration. According to the greatne<U+017F>s of the hurt may you judge of the danger; for great Contu<U+017F>ions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying large Wounds do run the Part into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith, that obtu<U+017F>e In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the mo<U+017F>t proper engines for Contu<U+017F>ion and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, the mo<U+017F>t proper Medicine for the cure of this <U+017F>hould be <gap reason="foreign">

It ought al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>econd the nature and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the native Heat, and by degrees to encrea<U+017F>e it. Hence is it, that in creating of Matter the Humour is <U+017F>omewhat alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and if this Contu<U+017F>ion does happen in any Mu<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous parts, that Part onely does maintain the Brui<U+017F>e which received the Blow or Hurt, whil<U+017F>t the circumjacent Parts do retain their own proper nature.

out of its proper Cavity, does force it <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>ome other; and being in its motion hindred, does change its fir<U+017F>t rudiment. And hence was it that <hi>Philalethus</hi> <U+017F>aith, that Bloud, Seed, and Milk, being out of their proper places, do <U+017F>oon run into knotty lumps and putrefy. Now in Conver<U+017F>ion of this Bloud into Matter, there is made a Pul<U+017F>ation in the Arteries lodging in the Fle<U+017F>h, the which Pul<U+017F>ation the <U+017F>ound man does not perceive, it lying there without Pain; and al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of the great <U+017F>pace which is allowed them for their operation. But where there does ari<U+017F>e Inflammation, <hi>Ecchymo<U+017F>is, Ery<U+017F>ipelas,</hi> or Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s, with Pain, the Wounds are al<U+017F>o inflamed, when they tend to Suppuration; becau<U+017F>e this putrefying Bloud does <U+017F>oon grow hot and fiery, and in this Ebullition and Fervour of the Bloud Vapours are rai<U+017F>ed, the which al<U+017F>o are communicated to the neighbouring Parts, and therein do al<U+017F>o generate an Inflammation. And this is done by Con<U+017F>ent of Parts.

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds made by the Biting of mad Dogs.</head>
               <p>WE arrive now at <U+017F>uch Wounds as do happen by the Biting of mad Dogs, and of other venomous creatures: and although other creatures, as Wolves, Cats, Foxes, and the like, may be mad; yet mo<U+017F>t who have writ of this <U+017F>ubject do give the fir<U+017F>t denomination to the Dog, as <hi>Antiochus, Paulus Aegineta, Oriba<U+017F>ius, Cornelius Cel<U+017F>us,</hi> and others. The generall repute of the Biting of Animalls is allowed to come under a double difference; for <U+017F>ome are venenate in their proper nature, and others are le<U+017F>s venenate. Tho<U+017F>e are reputed venenate, which are lodged in venenate and virulent Bea<U+017F>ts; and among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e are reckoned the mad Dog, Serpents, Adders, Scorpions, Ba<U+017F>ilisks, Vipers, Wa<U+017F>ps, and the like. Others are <U+017F>aid to be le<U+017F>s venenate, which have not in them this virulent <U+017F>pirit; of which <U+017F>ort may be reckoned Man, a Dog that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59608:47"/>
is tame, a Monkey, Hor<U+017F>es, Swine, and the like. The Signs of either do declare their nature. Tho<U+017F>e which are venomous are mo<U+017F>t dangerous, and great care not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had, they do commit their Venome to <U+017F>ome noble Part, and there implanting the poy<U+017F>on, do <U+017F>oon cau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>peedy Death. <hi>Gordonius</hi> reporteth, that the Biting of a mad Dog is mo<U+017F>t dangerous; for although the Patient do not feel it at pre<U+017F>ent, yet this lurking Poy<U+017F>on <U+017F>ome while after makes its appearance. I have read of a Boy, who being bit by a mad Dog, and being well after it for <U+017F>ix weeks, after this died of the Bite he received.</p>
               <p>Seeing the danger is great, and how it aims at the Principalls of life, let us con<U+017F>ult a while the rea<U+017F>on of this Poy<U+017F>on, and how it does communicate it <U+017F>elf. <hi>Read</hi> tells us it is communicated the<U+017F>e two waies; by Biting and Slaver, and by Slaver without Biting. This is <U+017F>ometimes received by the thick Skin of any Part. And this <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus</hi> makes good, <hi>Con<U+017F>.</hi> 82. where he affirms of one putting his hand into a mad Dog's mouth, that within few daies after he became mad him<U+017F>elf. It <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>eizeth on <U+017F>ome Parts then on others, and is al<U+017F>o more readily taken by <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons then others. For it hath <U+017F>hewn its rage in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>peedily, whil<U+017F>t in others it hath had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies and weeks to act its envy and malicious terrour. And hence may we collect, that this Spittle is pernicious which is contained in the Mouth, and thus agitated, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and elaborated into the form of Froath, the which does carry an acrimony and veneno<U+017F>ity with it, by rea<U+017F>on of Choler which moves it, and this Tyrant does make this ebullition; the which being once made, is <U+017F>ent into the Wounds by the Teeth; by which impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion it is carried into the Body and its circum<U+017F>tantiall Parts; the which if they happen to be nervous, the<U+017F>e are pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>timula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the veneno<U+017F>ity of the Humour, and hereby oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Spa<U+017F>m and Convul<U+017F>ive motions are created. If it enters either the Veins or Arteries, it <U+017F>peedily doth <U+017F>end
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59608:47"/>
its venenate Vapour through the<U+017F>e to the Heart, and doth there tyrannize, <U+017F>tirring up Fevers, and exciting <hi>Syncope's,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes running the Part into a Gangrene and <hi>Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> by overcoming the naturall Heat by its venomous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous <U+017F>pirit.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the knowledge of the Dog, whether mad or not, you may well gue<U+017F>s at it by the Wound: for, as <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Rha<U+017F>is</hi> write, if we rub the Wound with a piece of Bread, <U+017F>o as it may <U+017F>uck up the Bloud and Matter which cometh out of the Wound, this being offered to a Dog, if he refu<U+017F>e to eat it, or to <U+017F>mell to it, it declares much of the Dog's being mad. Let the<U+017F>e Signs <U+017F>erve for Madne<U+017F>s confirmed; the Patient becomes <note place="margin">Signs of a mad Dog's Bite.</note>trouble<U+017F>ome, and foameth at his Mouth, he hateth water and all liquid things, the<U+017F>e being the cau<U+017F>e and occa<U+017F>ion of his Madne<U+017F>s, his Pul<U+017F>e is <U+017F>mall and inordinate, his Members dull and heavy, his Voice hoar<U+017F>e, and his Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult. If he dies of his Bite, he is troubled with <hi>Syncope's,</hi> and a little before his departure you will meet him Convul<U+017F>ive.</p>

His Wife was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge, who enquiring of her how her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poy<U+017F>oned, <U+017F>he carried with her <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>ame Sage-leaves to <U+017F>hew him, and ta<U+017F>ting thereof in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, died al<U+017F>o, to the great admiration of all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanders. The wi<U+017F>e Judge con<U+017F>idering of which, did much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect this Sage, and ordered it to be pluckt up from the roots, and commanded it to be committed to a workman's care to clear the ground: upon the doing of which, there appeared a great black Toad, which had harboured at the bottome of the Sage, the which by its poy<U+017F>onous Vapour and tabifick <hi>Illuvies</hi> did infect the whole Plant with its venomous <hi>Saliva</hi> or Slaver; the<U+017F>e two taking whereof, it did occa<U+017F>ion the lo<U+017F>s of both their Lives. And hence may be collected, although Toads have no Teeth, yet have they heard Gums, and the parts to which they adhere they do <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely con<U+017F>tringe and clo<U+017F>e, that they compell and force their whole Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on into the whole part, and thereby do infect the whole Body by their fa<U+017F>tning.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Another.</note> I have al<U+017F>o read from a very Worthy Friend, of two Merchants, who while Dinner was providing, took a few turns about the Garden which belonged to the Hou<U+017F>e, wherein they delighted them<U+017F>elves with the beauty and <U+017F>hape of the Sage-leaf; of which they pluckt <U+017F>ome, and the<U+017F>e being unwa<U+017F>ht they put them into a Gla<U+017F>s of Wine. They had <U+017F>carce dined, but by drinking of this Wine they were taken with a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> all things <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to their view to turn round: and being thus blinded, they both fell into a <hi>Syncope,</hi> and were <U+017F>peedily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards overtaken with Convul<U+017F>ion; their Tongues and Lips grew black, with a horrid A<U+017F>pect, accompanied with cold Sweats, and their whole Bodies were rai<U+017F>ed into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by this Venome; whereupon both very <U+017F>uddenly died. It being generally reported that they were both poy<U+017F>oned, the man of the hou<U+017F>e and his <U+017F>ervants were all convened before a Judge, for <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of poy<U+017F>oning the<U+017F>e two Gentlemen; who upon their Examination declared by a generall con<U+017F>ent, that them<U+017F>elves putting <U+017F>ome Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves into their Wine were herewith poy<U+017F>oned. The Judge hereupon <U+017F>ending for a Phy<U+017F>ician, and enquiring of him whether Sage might be infected with Poy<U+017F>on, he pre<U+017F>ently a<U+017F><U+017F>erted it might. He further enquired of the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Garden, whether any virulent Slaver, Froath, or Matter, was upon the Sage. To which they all readily an<U+017F>wered, There was. And upon making a Cavity at the bottome of the Sage-bed, there was found a great Toad, the which then was conjectured to poy<U+017F>on the Plant at the root by its Slaver and venenate Liquor. And hence may we collect how imprudent all <U+017F>uch men are, who do readily eat Herbs and Fruits newly plucked, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either wa<U+017F>hed or wiped.</p>

               <p>IF any Wound be tinged with Poy<U+017F>on, we are to ha<U+017F>ten its extirpation by Alexipharmicks: and becau<U+017F>e this Poy<U+017F>on does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of very <U+017F>ubtile parts, who<U+017F>e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious qualities it chiefly does <U+017F>tudy to fix and hindge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart; and whereas this ill-conditioned Poy<U+017F>on does corrupt the Body, and turneth it into its nature, and is not here at quiet, untill it does reach the Fountain of life, there creating a change in the principall Faculty, and there getting conque<U+017F>t does <U+017F>peedily di<U+017F>patch and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli<U+017F>h the whole naturall Faculty; let us enquire into its nature, and <U+017F>ee what forms and <U+017F>hapes it does carry. <hi>Hippoc.</hi> 6. <hi>Epid.

that is, <hi>Pharmacum homicidum quaerens, ut ei e<U+017F><U+017F>et unde <U+017F>agittas oblineret.</hi> But as touching Poy<U+017F>on it <U+017F>elf, it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed a compound <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, not naturall, the Heart's great enemy, and that treacherous Invader which does corrupt the whole Body, and does overthrow the naturall Temper thereof. And as touching this, there are various Opinions extant: for <U+017F>ome there are who write, that it may be <U+017F>o made, that it cannot inflict its cruelty in <U+017F>ome in a moneth; in others in the <U+017F>pace of a year,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59608:51"/>
in <U+017F>ome in a greater time. And that it may be <U+017F>o made, as to kill <U+017F>ooner or later, is out of doubt. Now that which it chiefly aims at is the de<U+017F>truction of the native Heat and radicall Moi<U+017F>ture, endeavouring both to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui<U+017F>h and corrupt them. It hath various <U+017F>ubjects on which it hath its dependance, as a Vapour, Juice, or a terre<U+017F>triall <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance: and the<U+017F>e three do comprehend all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophra<U+017F>tus, lib. Plant.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. writes, that the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> did anoint their Arrows with a pe<U+017F>tiferous Root. Lead al<U+017F>o is very ready to take the impre<U+017F>s of Poy<U+017F>on: for both Nature and Experience do make good, that as Metalls are purged by the Fire, and <U+017F>o forced to leave their terrene and faeculent <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and impurities; <U+017F>o although the Fire does perform this very exactly, yet the<U+017F>e Metalls may imbibe a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance by their nature. As for example, take Vinegar, Soot, Salt, and the Juice of Hor<U+017F>e-Radi<U+017F>h-root, and mix them together, and let them dry, and you will find them make the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of Iron. And Iron it <U+017F>elf, being ofttimes infu<U+017F>ed herein, will <U+017F>oon harden at that rate, that unle<U+017F>s you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the <U+017F>ame, you can <U+017F>carce give credit to it: and on the contrary, being oft extingui<U+017F>hed in the Juice of Hemlock, Soap, and Mar<U+017F>h-mallows, it will <U+017F>peedily grow <U+017F>oft. Tin and Lead being ofttimes extingui<U+017F>hed in the Juice of Squills, do <U+017F>o affect the<U+017F>e, that they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath their outward coat, whil<U+017F>t the other thereby is made black and <U+017F>oft. The which could not be, if they retained not in them <U+017F>ome of its <U+017F>pirit and virtue. And although the Fire doth di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s and purge the<U+017F>e, yet they may be granted with ea<U+017F>e to imbibe another kind of <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance. Thus how oft have we <U+017F>een Copper tinged and grow yellow by applying to it <U+017F>pirit of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and Tutty; and again to grow white, by the <U+017F>pirit of Ar<U+017F>enick, Orpiment, and the like? Whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that Metalls, out of which the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>truments of mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59608:52"/>
are made, as Shot, Bullets, and the like, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <U+017F>pirituous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance an<U+017F>wering their nature, out of which, as out of <U+017F>o many various mercuriall, foetid and lethiferous waters, they <U+017F>eem to be framed, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Juice of Wolfsbane, Squills, <hi>Apium Ri<U+017F>Ã»s,</hi> or <hi>Herba Sardonica,</hi> and the like, and of venomous Bea<U+017F>ts, which by rea<U+017F>on of their contrariety of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance do hurt and corrupt our <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
               <p>As thus, for example: <hi>Apium Ri<U+017F>Ã»s</hi> does infect by Laughing; of which <hi>Apuleius</hi> <U+017F>aith, that if one take thereof in the morning fa<U+017F>ting, it kills him with Laughing. <hi>Tragus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 159. writes of a Woman gathering an Hemlock-root among<U+017F>t Par<U+017F>nips, and boiling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eating thereof, that it made her as it were <U+017F>o intoxicated, that <U+017F>he endeavoured to climb up the hou<U+017F>e, and did think <U+017F>he could fly. But by taking a draught of Vinegar <U+017F>he was recovered hereof. A man having the Juice of Wolfsbane mixed with his Bread died the third day, with a great company of formidable Symptoms which attended him. This is reputed to have in it that venome that is <U+017F>carce to be overcome by the be<U+017F>t of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmicks. Night<U+017F>hade al<U+017F>o hath allowed a veneni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick quality, as <hi>Tragus</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Hi<U+017F>tor. Stirp. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. <hi>Mercurialis.</hi> writes, that the Mandrake-apple, called by <U+017F>ome <hi>Bella Donna,</hi> being eaten by <U+017F>ome Children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to feed on it by its fair and beautifull looks, it hath <U+017F>peedily killed them. <hi>Lemnius</hi> declares, <hi>Herb. bib. cap.</hi> 12. that having in Summer-time carele<U+017F>ly gathered a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drake-apple, he did hang this fair and <U+017F>pecious fruit in his Clo<U+017F>et, where <U+017F>itting a while he grew <U+017F>o <U+017F>leepy, that he could <U+017F>carce <U+017F>hake it off, forgetting his Apple did hang over his Head. Waking on a <U+017F>udden, and con<U+017F>ulting with him<U+017F>elf what was or might be the cau<U+017F>e of this his Sleepine<U+017F>s, and ca<U+017F>ting his eyes upwards, he e<U+017F>pied this Apple hanging over his Head, and removed it: the which being removed, he began <U+017F>peedily to grow fre<U+017F>h and brisk
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59608:52"/>
again. <hi>Ponzettus, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>de Veneno,</hi> writes, that he <U+017F>aw a man, who had taken a drachm and a half of Hellebore, to die pre<U+017F>ently. <hi>Matthiolus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 141. writes, that a pre<U+017F>ent Poy<U+017F>on being made out of the Juice of white Hellebore, and Arrows or Shot being herein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated and illinated, they do cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>peedy death to that per<U+017F>on wherein they are lodged, or in tho<U+017F>e Parts through which they do pa<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Thus have I <U+017F>hewn you, that a venenate Mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of any of the<U+017F>e, and Weapons made either of Wood or Iron macerated therein, and then <U+017F>ent into the mu<U+017F>culous Parts, they do there <U+017F>peedily <U+017F>hew their veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous qualities; the which if they be not <U+017F>peedily fetched out, they do leave their pernicious marks of Venome, which does prove a perfect de<U+017F>troyer of the whole. And as daily experience does teach us, many pe<U+017F>tiferous and venenate Mixtures are and have been of late invented and found out. And if Bullets or the like In<U+017F>truments be herein dipped, tempered, and tinged, and <U+017F>hot into any Part, occa<U+017F>ion a Wound, although it be not adherent, yet in its quick pa<U+017F><U+017F>age this Poy<U+017F>on hath that <U+017F>ubtile, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pe<U+017F>tiferous quality, that it does <U+017F>peedily creep from the <U+017F>mall Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ells to the greater, untill it hath got advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the principall Parts; and having once got footing therein, it <U+017F>peedily does there exerci<U+017F>e that furiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, that it does contract the Life of man into a <U+017F>mall compa<U+017F>s of warmth and heat. And hence let no man doubt, that Wounds thus made by Shot, or any other kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments which have power enough in them to receive Poy<U+017F>on, but that they may be made poy<U+017F>onous. And by how much the<U+017F>e are made of very <U+017F>ubtile parts, by <U+017F>o much the readier may they penetrate: and their malign Vapours being <U+017F>ent through the Veins, Nerves and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do at once infect both the naturall, animall, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Faculties, in which conflict they do <U+017F>uffocate by their contrary preternaturall mixtures. As often therefore as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59608:53"/>
any thing of Poy<U+017F>on is dreaded in a Wound, we are chiefly to have a re<U+017F>pect to its dangerous attempts: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch Wounds as are made by poy<U+017F>oned Weapons are for the mo<U+017F>t part mortall, not <U+017F>o much in re<U+017F>pect of the quality of the Wound, as in re<U+017F>pect of the quality of the Poy<U+017F>on; we are therefore fir<U+017F>t to le<U+017F><U+017F>en its vigour, and that becau<U+017F>e it aims altogether at the Heart, the Fountain of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure. Two Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> In this Cure the<U+017F>e two Intentions do chiefly offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves; fir<U+017F>t, that we <U+017F>trengthen the Heart again<U+017F>t its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that we <U+017F>peedily draw forth the Venome the <U+017F>ame way and by the <U+017F>ame Orifice it was taken in. And though in other Wounds Solution of Continuity does onely require Union; yet here, having Poy<U+017F>on adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a grand enemy to our Nature, this is fir<U+017F>t to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and di<U+017F>charged. And this is to be done by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Wound open. In other Wounds indeed it mu<U+017F>t be our greate<U+017F>t care, to avert Fluxion and all other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms from the affected Parts by Purging and Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy: but in poy<U+017F>oned Wounds, <U+017F>o long as the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on urgeth, we are here contrarily to endeavour the Attraction of this Poy<U+017F>on to the affected Part, and by that to di<U+017F>charge it.</p>
               <p>And here, that we may not run our <U+017F>elves upon the rocks of Mi<U+017F>take and Unadvi<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s, we are fir<U+017F>t to con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what part this Wound happeneth. For if it hath happened in the Nervous parts, it is very dangerous: for hereupon by applying of <U+017F>harp and biting Medicines or Cauteries, Convul<U+017F>ion does ofttimes ari<U+017F>e. If the Wound happeneth in that Part where we may not with <U+017F>afety <U+017F>earify, nor apply the<U+017F>e <U+017F>harp Medicines, we mu<U+017F>t here apply <U+017F>uch Medicines as may fetch forth this Poy<U+017F>on by their own propriety and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. We are with all <U+017F>peed to fetch out the Poy<U+017F>on, and to le<U+017F><U+017F>en its vigour. Thus if the Fle<U+017F>h of the Wound be livid, and its colour contrary to that of other Parts, accompanied with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59608:53"/>
Pains, Inflammations, and Debilitation of the whole Body, or Alienation of the Mind, and the<U+017F>e hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without any manife<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e in every re<U+017F>pect do declare Poy<U+017F>on to be pre<U+017F>ent.</p>
               <p>In the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es the Chirurgeon is to arme him<U+017F>elf with Bole-Armeniack, <hi>Smaragd. Bezoar.</hi> Scorzonary roots, <hi>Scord.</hi> Rue, <hi>Angelica,</hi> Gentian, Tormentill, Bi<U+017F>tort, Balme, <hi>Veronica,</hi> St. Johns-wort, and the like, being made either into Decoctions, Syrupes, or the like. Among<U+017F>t Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds may be reckoned <hi>Orviatan, Theriac. Andromach. Mithridat. Electuar. de Ovo, Diate<U+017F><U+017F>eron, Confect. de Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth. Aqua Theriacal. Scord. compo<U+017F>tt. Tinctur. Croc. Elixar Proprietat.</hi> and the like. As to the affected Part, this may be evocated either by Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es with much flame, if to be permitted, or to <U+017F>carify the Part <U+017F>o as the bloud may come out plentifully. After this it is to be wa<U+017F>hed with warm Vinegar, in which Mithridate or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> Treacle hath been di<U+017F><U+017F>olved. For this purpo<U+017F>e Chalk al<U+017F>o mixed with Honey and Treacle is very good.

               <p>SUch Ma<U+017F>ters of Art who have dwelt many years in the Wars, and have hazarded their Lives as well as their Fortunes with their experience therein, will cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly grant, that every young Chirurgeon, who intends to doe his King <U+017F>ervice and his Country a kindne<U+017F>s, his Art right, and his Patients plea<U+017F>ure, ought well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand the Therapeutick part of his Art, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the Practick. And when they enter the <U+017F>tage of Gun<U+017F>hot-Wounds, they ought <U+017F>o readily to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Knowledge of them, and the In<U+017F>truments which do occa<U+017F>ion them, that they may make their <U+017F>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy addre<U+017F>s to their Entrance, Form and Shape, and from thence derive their fir<U+017F>t Intention. This part of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery does not <U+017F>o particularly belong to the City-Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon or Countrey Practicioner, Dome<U+017F>tick Wars not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o frequent: yet to every one it is very u<U+017F>efull and profitable, as upon Accidents, or Duells, and the like. But as to the<U+017F>e Wounds, as they are artificiall, <U+017F>o <U+017F>hould they meet with a man of Art to undertake them. For hereto do belong many weighty Con<U+017F>iderations; as the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the<U+017F>e Weapons, and the Places whereinto they penetrate. And out of the<U+017F>e two do ari<U+017F>e two Intentions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Cure, and Extraction. The Weapons Shapes, Form, and Make, are al<U+017F>o to be con<U+017F>idered; and their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of which they are made, being either of Wood, Iron, Steel, Lead, Bra<U+017F>s, Gla<U+017F>s, or Bone; with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their Forms, being either long, triangular, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular, round, obtu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>harp, and the like; the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59608:55"/>
being either large, or <U+017F>mall: re<U+017F>pect al<U+017F>o is to be had to their Number, being one, or more. And having of every of the<U+017F>e given you a <U+017F>light draught, being conducted by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Ceremony, I here do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Figure, which does relate how the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body may receive the impre<U+017F>s of many kinds of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like In<U+017F>truments, no Part being <U+017F>hot-free from the Head to the Foot. The Figure is pre<U+017F>ented you before, near the beginning of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Wounds in generall; and al<U+017F>o in that of particular Wounds.</p>
               <p>Before I enter upon the generall Treati<U+017F>e of Gun<U+017F>hot-Wounds, let us take a <U+017F>mall view, and <U+017F>ee what Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder and Shot are made of. And here may we find, that a <hi>Franci<U+017F>can</hi> Fryer, called <hi>Bartholdus, Anno</hi> 1380. being an Alchymi<U+017F>t, was the fir<U+017F>t that found out the true Compo<U+017F>ition of Gunpowder, which is now in u<U+017F>e. <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> 1284. does make mention of Gunpowder, with <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall others before him; but it never came at its due perfection of Compo<U+017F>ition till the time of the afore<U+017F>aid Fryer. Which Compo<U+017F>ition we may find framed out of <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of Gunpowder not veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</note>the<U+017F>e Simples, Salt-peter, Sallow or Willow-coal, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> This therefore in its e<U+017F><U+017F>ence mu<U+017F>t not be allowed venenate, daily experience evincing the contrary, by <U+017F>hewing and declaring the contrary effects. Thus Sulphur (which is the fir<U+017F>t) is <U+017F>o far from Poy<U+017F>on, that it is accounted a mo<U+017F>t excellent Medicine for Affects of the Lungs, and not for the<U+017F>e alone, as <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aith, 9. <hi>Simpl.</hi> 36. It is an admirable Medicine again<U+017F>t the Itch, and a thing at this day u<U+017F>ed much for the <U+017F>ame. Its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ofttimes inwardly pre<U+017F>cribed in Juleps for the allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fevers. And in this place, being of an Oleaginous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, it retaineth the fire longer then the Coal being once kindled. Salt-peter is al<U+017F>o u<U+017F>ed in Burning-fevers, cooling and allaying the Patient's thir<U+017F>t. And as all Salts have a Communion with each other; <U+017F>o this, being of thin and <U+017F>ubtile parts, is very free from any Venome.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59608:56"/>
For take it from its Habitation, where you may <U+017F>ee for the mo<U+017F>t part how and where it dwelleth, it cannot be allowed to have any dealings with Poy<U+017F>on; for it is made out of a fatty Sub<U+017F>tance, forcing it <U+017F>elf through the Walls of <U+017F>ome old and cold Cellars. As to Sallow or Charcoal, which is the third Ingredient, the which does <U+017F>peedily take fire, this al<U+017F>o is void of all Poy<U+017F>on. And for the Wine or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> how far this is different from Poy<U+017F>on, every boon Companion and Good fellow will <U+017F>ufficiently acquaint you. Thus have I pre<U+017F>ented you with a brief de<U+017F>cription of Gunpowder, and its e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and touching its tran<U+017F>mutation into a fiery quality. Experience and rea<U+017F>on will fairly contradict its having any commerce with Poy<U+017F>on. And if any be de<U+017F>irous to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, why Wounds made by Gun<U+017F>hot do generally look black; I an<U+017F>wer them, that it is not the effect of Heat brought with the Bullet, but the force of Contu<U+017F>ion, which does di<U+017F>colour the fle<U+017F>h. The which I am <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <U+017F>atisfied in, being made an Example of the <U+017F>ame in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars 1665. and 66. where being Chirurgeon of one of his MAJESTIE's Ships, I was wounded by the wind of a 24 pound Bullet, by which my Arm was mi<U+017F>erably fractured and contu<U+017F>ed. But to proceed; this Contu<U+017F>ion cannot but be great in re<U+017F>pect of its violence it is <U+017F>ent with.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to the <U+017F>econd thing, the Shot or Bullet: and the<U+017F>e are made of Lead for the mo<U+017F>t part in pitched Battels a<U+017F>hore, as in Armies; although at Sea chiefly of Iron. This is very currant al<U+017F>o, that the<U+017F>e of their own nature do carry no Poy<U+017F>on in them. For Lead being beaten to powder is good for old Ulcers; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in its own metallick form and beaten thin, it does depre<U+017F>s the lips of old <U+017F>ordid Ulcers, and <U+017F>top the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e of Scirrhous Tumours. Be<U+017F>ides this, have we not <U+017F>een many Bullets <U+017F>hot into the Body, and there to have remained for <U+017F>everall years, without any hurt or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59608:56"/>
to the Patient? Lead therefore of its own <U+017F>imple quality we ground to be void of all Poy<U+017F>on: but how ready this may be made to take its impre<U+017F>s, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">As touching the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hot-Wounds.</note> We now therefore come to the Wound it <U+017F>elf. And he that will accurately under<U+017F>tand the difference of the<U+017F>e Wounds, mu<U+017F>t well con<U+017F>ider the Nature of the Parts which are thus wounded, their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, u<U+017F>e, action, po<U+017F>ition, <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and figure; the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Divi<U+017F>ion or Solution of Continuity, and its proper differences: all which are the true rules which mu<U+017F>t direct him to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative method. To this knowledge al<U+017F>o does conduce the right under<U+017F>tanding of their proper differences, being either large or <U+017F>mall, <U+017F>uperficiall or deep, long or <U+017F>hort, thick or thin, and the like. Some of which are mo<U+017F>t proper for de<U+017F>truction of the whole Body, others more apt for taking off a Part; <U+017F>ome mo<U+017F>t fit for pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Center, others onely lacerating the Nervous and Mu<U+017F>culous parts; <U+017F>ome having in them power to break Bones, others warrant onely to lacerate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<U+017F>e the Fle<U+017F>h; <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e made of their own metalls, others having added to them <U+017F>trange bodies: every of which carry with them force enough to cau<U+017F>e Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of a Gun<U+017F>hot-Wound.</note> The Signs of the<U+017F>e Wounds are al<U+017F>o taken from their Figure, or Colour, for they are generally round, and of a livid Colour; from the Sen<U+017F>e being there inflicted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or cau<U+017F>ing an obtu<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>e in the Part, or Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, the Part chiefly <U+017F>uffering an <hi>Ecchymo<U+017F>is</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the Bullet. If the<U+017F>e appear, they declare a Gun<U+017F>hot-Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>age.</note> Come we next to the Judgment and Pre<U+017F>age hereof. The<U+017F>e are generally allowed dangerous for three <U+017F>everall rea<U+017F>ons, regarding either the Excellency of the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the Hurt and the vehemency occa<U+017F>ioned by the greatne<U+017F>s of the Weapon, and then its Malignity. Thus
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59608:57"/>
if the principall Parts, as the Brain and its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, be wounded, we do judge the Wound to be lethiferous. If the Lungs, <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> Ventricle, Spleen or Kidneys be hurt by <U+017F>hot, every of the<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the names of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Parts from their Office, they are for the mo<U+017F>t part deadly. Of the <U+017F>ame kind may be reckoned Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Inte<U+017F>tines or Bladder; the<U+017F>e being Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Membranous parts, denying Agglutination. If the Fle<U+017F>hy parts onely be wounded, and the Con<U+017F>titution good, the<U+017F>e may with ea<U+017F>e be cured. Wounds of this kind are harder of cure then others, by rea<U+017F>on of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<U+017F>ion. Wounds by how much the larger and deeper they are made, with dilaceration of the Nerves and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts, and fracture of the Bones, are accounted the more dangerous. Wounds al<U+017F>o in the Joynts have their variety of Symptoms, the which they do fetch from their greatne<U+017F>s. Tho<U+017F>e Wounds which have Venome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with them are very dangerous. In the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ca<U+017F>es we are not perfectly to de<U+017F>pair, for Nature does <U+017F>ometimes play that happy part which Art could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. And hence <hi>Cornelius Cel<U+017F>us</hi> does advi<U+017F>e, to u<U+017F>e our be<U+017F>t skill and judgment even in the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate ca<U+017F>e, rather then to leave the Patient void of all help.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> As touching the Cure of the<U+017F>e Wounds, becau<U+017F>e they are complicated with various Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">Five Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>a diver<U+017F>ity of Intentions. And hence, as a generall Maxime, are we to take our Fir<U+017F>t Intention from that Symptome which is mo<U+017F>t direfull and urgent, not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Wound. Hence therefore, if any preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, as Bullet, Arrow, Splinter, or the like, do accompany this Wound, this is fir<U+017F>t to be extracted, as being its chief Cau<U+017F>e; the which being removed, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect does cea<U+017F>e: and without a regard to which, the Wound is not to be cured. For this does bring Pain and Inflammation with it, the which are fir<U+017F>t to be corrected and abated. The Second is, to ea<U+017F>e and a<U+017F><U+017F>wage Pain,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59608:57"/>
which is a great enemy to the<U+017F>e Wounds; for Fluxion does proceed hereby, and this does rai<U+017F>e the Wound into a Tumour, the which is known by its colour, heat, and dimen<U+017F>ion. The Third is, to bring the Contu<U+017F>ed and Wounded parts into a fair Dige<U+017F>tion. The Fourth is, to mundify and clean<U+017F>e the Wound from all filth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and to fill it up with Fle<U+017F>h, and skin it. And the La<U+017F>t is, to correct all Symptoms which may happen. Of each of the<U+017F>e in their order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Fir<U+017F>t Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And fir<U+017F>t, as touching the Fir<U+017F>t Intention, of this I have already <U+017F>ufficiently enlarged; where al<U+017F>o I have given you a view of tho<U+017F>e In<U+017F>truments which are very proper for performing of this Operation: I <U+017F>hall therefore not charge you here with any further di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> Come we therefore to the Second, as touching the a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waging of Pain: and of this al<U+017F>o I have fairly touched. But becau<U+017F>e in the<U+017F>e Wounds there is generally a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Pain attendant on them, which does weaken the Patient, hindreth Nature, cau<U+017F>eth Fluxion, pro<U+017F>ternateth the Faculties, and produceth the mo<U+017F>t direfull Symptoms, I mu<U+017F>t here a little enlarge thereof.

               <p>Hence may the young Chirurgeon collect, that in any Wound made either by Shot, Splinter, or Bullet, if any part thereof do remain in the Wound, this is to be <U+017F>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily extracted, while the Parts <U+017F>eem as if they were <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefied or benummed, no Inflammation at pre<U+017F>ent appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for <U+017F>hould this be deferred for <U+017F>ome daies, we may well fear a new Inflammation, Pain, or Haemorrhagy to <U+017F>upervene.

And therefore <U+017F>hould a man have very many Shot lodged in his body, you are never to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their Extraction: for how many hundreds are there in health at this day which have them remaining in them? <note place="margin">Hi<U+017F>tories.</note>
                  <hi>Fallopius, lib. de Vuln. cap.</hi> 22. writes, that he extracted a Leaden Bullet, which was received in the Groyn, five years after its reception, in which time it had fallen near the Knee, at which place it was drawn forth. Another Example he hath of a Noble Gentlewoman, out of whom was drawn a piece of Iron, which lodged in the Cavity of her <hi>Thorax</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of nine months. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Camerarius, cap.</hi> 45. writes of a Country-man, who finding a broken piece of a Knife, did thru<U+017F>t it <U+017F>o forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly between the right Clavicle into the Brea<U+017F>t, that the dome<U+017F>tick Chirurgeons could not draw it forth. Within a few daies the man grew well, and the Wound was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and he thus lived <U+017F>ome years without Pain; <U+017F>ave onely a dry Cough perplexed him, and between times a <U+017F>mall Pain about the affected Part. After fourteen years he felt a pricking Pain reaching from the hurt place to the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and this for <U+017F>ome time together did every day encrea<U+017F>e, untill a Tumour appeared, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned into an Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s, the which being opened, this piece of old Iron was extracted: after which the Wound was con<U+017F>olidated, and the Patient recovered; and the piece of Iron <hi>Camerarius</hi> writes he hath in his Clo<U+017F>et. Whence we may learn, if Wounds are inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heal, we are to <U+017F>tudy their healing without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>

And here, as the Brain is the mo<U+017F>t noble Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell of all others in the Body, Nature hath placed this on the Top, being as the Prince of the re<U+017F>t, and covered it with a Skull, for keeping in its own dominion the Seat of Rea<U+017F>on, the Trea<U+017F>ure of Judgment, the Regi<U+017F>ter of Memory, the Shop of Sen<U+017F>e

And con<U+017F>idering its Sphaericall Figure, and the Connexion of parts, it might well make poor Man fall into an humble adoration of his Maker, who hath thus guarded this Trea<U+017F>ury, which contains in it the whole Life, Sen<U+017F>e, and Rea<U+017F>on of mankind. It is not made of one Bone, but framed of many; which may be accounted an admirable piece of Contrivance: and <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely fa<U+017F>hioned, that no other Part of the Body dares compare with it.</p>

For you may <U+017F>ee it ordained as a <U+017F>trong foundation for the maintaining, keeping and propagating the intere<U+017F>t and priviledges of other Bodies, planted both in it, and under it. Thus the Brain, by the benefit of its Sutures, tying its Membranes to this Skull, is kept in a fair <hi>Aequilibrium:</hi> and had it not been thus fa<U+017F>hioned, tho<U+017F>e frequent Concu<U+017F><U+017F>ions or violent Motions occa<U+017F>ioned by jumpings or leapings would herein <U+017F>oon create a great di<U+017F>turbance.</p>

and Experience, that we do well under<U+017F>tand the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, and the Prae<U+017F>age thereof, before we undertake the Cure: and this more particularly in Wounds of the Head, where no evident Signs are made apparent, in the fir<U+017F>t daies, of danger; which whil<U+017F>t they appear under mean <U+017F>hapes to the ignorant Chirurgeon and as Trifles, are <U+017F>peedily undertaken by him; but within few daies they procure <U+017F>uch a Troup of bad Symptoms, as oft hurry the poor Patient and di<U+017F>patch him into another world. And although of the Brain and Heart the Heart is counted the mo<U+017F>t noble; yet its <hi>Thorax</hi> being wounded, by which it is guarded and defended, even into the Cavity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Heart it <U+017F>elf being kept inviolable, or not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therewith, the Patient thus wounded, if skilfully dealth with, is <U+017F>carce <U+017F>een to come under the verge of danger: whereas we <U+017F>ee by daily experience, Wounds happening in the Head, although the Brain be not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or its Membranes, do very often occa<U+017F>ion Death. And hence is it, that he in the beginning of his Book <hi>De Vulnerib.

And in many ca<U+017F>es the be<U+017F>t of Chirurgeons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due re<U+017F>pect and inquiry, may herein fail.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59608:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus by the imploy of ignorant Pretenders to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Art, too oft are the King's Liege People Cheated of their Lives, by procuring mi<U+017F>chiefs to the <U+017F>ubjacent Membranes, applying of a <hi>Trepan</hi> to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <U+017F>harp Medicines hereupon: The<U+017F>e being more proper for exciting of pain, and this drawing inflamation with it; who like people half di<U+017F>tracted are at their Wits ends, fearing the Coldne<U+017F>s of the Air, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding how to temper or correct it, who upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to e<U+017F>chew the danger of the one, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <U+017F>plit them<U+017F>elves upon the Rock of Unadvi<U+017F>ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s in the other. A Third al<U+017F>o <hi>Hippocrates</hi> brings in <U+017F>mall and <U+017F>lender Wounds, the which not being at fir<U+017F>t well treated, prove <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious beyond the expectation of their narrow Genius; who by ordering their Patients thin Broaths, <hi>Pti<U+017F>ans,</hi> and the like, do give way for their Patients to drink Wine, to eat and drink at plea<U+017F>ure, and if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to any Exerci<U+017F>e, not forbidding Venery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greate<U+017F>t enemy to Wounds in the Head, nor prohibiting any pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, all which to a Judicious man appears as idle as any one thing in the World, Knowing that the<U+017F>e will create Choler in the body, and rai<U+017F>e feuds in the humours, cau<U+017F>ing that Intemperiety which in time committing and communicating it <U+017F>elf to the head, hereby inflameth the Animal <U+017F>pirits.

And what power; force, and vigour this may have have in any man, no Judicious or Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious man is ignorant of: For if by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Rules and Aphori<U+017F>me we are Ordered to hope well, and to think the be<U+017F>t, and give comfortable a<U+017F><U+017F>urances to the wounded Patient, this being as an Exact Rule and Maxime as touching Health; <U+017F>o on the Contrary to create De<U+017F>pair, and di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>e the Patient with the unhappy thoughts

And the ca<U+017F>e lyes here parallel with the Heart; for as the body of the Heart doth attract and expel its Sub<U+017F>tances, by its extending and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality in its proper times and circuits, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o doth the Brain, in which is <U+017F>eated the animal Spirit contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its Ventricles, tran<U+017F>mit the <U+017F>ame to every Part,

being thereto incited by a fit and proper motion, and thereby doth di<U+017F>tribute and elaborate the <U+017F>ame.

The fir<U+017F>t two whereof we have already treated on. We come now to the third. And here may we premi<U+017F>e, That Fractures happening upon the Sutures, are harder to cure than to find out: For here are we neither to Derade or Open with a <hi>Trepan,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which upholds the Brain, being tyed to the<U+017F>e parts al<U+017F>o, upon every <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion being <U+017F>ubject to Inflammation; but how few daily <U+017F>tudy the<U+017F>e Precepts, and bear them in their Memories! And as I have already <U+017F>hewn in my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Sutures, no Inci<U+017F>ion is to be made here, they being both weak, and ea<U+017F>ily perforated, hereby <U+017F>ubjecting the Brain to mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs: Becau<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o through the<U+017F>e the Veins and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes do pa<U+017F>s, the which being but lightly touched by any <U+017F>harp In<U+017F>trument, are made <U+017F>peedily to flee thence.

That in all gla<U+017F><U+017F>en Bodies or Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which are hollow, being <U+017F>mitten in one part, they generally do crack or break in the other; and this may as well happen in the Head, as in any other Part: And the Rea<U+017F>ons which he brings are the<U+017F>e; The Air contained in the<U+017F>e gla<U+017F><U+017F>en Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which do receive the Blow, being hereby contu<U+017F>ed and illi<U+017F>ed, doth carry the <U+017F>ame to the Back-part, and there force a divi<U+017F>ion. And why the Air hath force enough al<U+017F>o to do this, is <U+017F>ufficiently evident, whenas we <U+017F>ee it hath vigour and <U+017F>trength enough to divide Mountains, and <U+017F>eparate Hills; and hence may it be granted much more readily, to have power enough in it to break a Gla<U+017F>s in the contrary <U+017F>ide; and when this Fracture doth happen by rea<U+017F>on of any included Air, the Greeks do call this <hi>Apochema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to enlarge a little further; In every Percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion which is made in the Body, is there perceived or felt an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59608:93"/>
Impetuo<U+017F>ity and Agitation in the Spirits contained therein; and this is a <U+017F>pirituous Sub<U+017F>tance, which doth exhale continually from the Body: And hence is it that Bodies in Exhalation are di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated; and this doth inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in the inward Parts of the Body; and therefore in every Percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion we <U+017F>hall meet with a <U+017F>pirituous Habit agitated.</p>
               <p>Again, Many have been <U+017F>een to have their Heads fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured in the back-part of their Skulls, and yet by a large Flux of Blood through their No<U+017F>trils hereupon happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have been perfectly cured and recovered; and whence <U+017F>hould this Blood flow but from the lacerated and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els? but you read not of many cured, who being <U+017F>mitten on the fore-part of their Heads, have their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els rent in the back-part thereof, becau<U+017F>e the Blood here hath not any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age allowed it for its di<U+017F>charge. This Fracture is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>een to happen on the <U+017F>ame Bone, and then this falls out either to be laterally or perpendicularly, the fir<U+017F>t having in it a Wound given in the right <U+017F>ide, and a Fracture hereby purcha<U+017F>ed in the left; or from the upper Part to the lower, and here both Tables are generally allowed to be fractured. Or it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in many Bones, and the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o do communicate the Blow to the oppo<U+017F>ite Part, where meeting the <hi>Cranium</hi> in its violent motion; as two Men readily upon a quick motion meeting each other, doth make them give way and fall back: Thus the Skull receiving a Blow, doth communicate the <U+017F>ame very <U+017F>peedily to the other Part thereof, and there doth frame a Fracture, being denied a <U+017F>peedy pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the<U+017F>e kinds of Fractures, will admit of no Remedies, or the undertaking of their Cure, the affected Part not being ea<U+017F>ily found out: Yet he further advi<U+017F>eth us, That where any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of a Fracture doth offer, although it be a matter of difficulty to find it out; yet he lays down this as a Method for undertaking the

               <p>And having thus given you the brief Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Anatomy of the<U+017F>e two parts, we are now to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what prejudices the<U+017F>e may be brought, for they may <U+017F>uffer both Pain, Inflammation, Apo<U+017F>temation, Blackne<U+017F>s, and the like.</p>
               <p>Where therefore the Membranes of the Brain are hurt, there generally attend thereon great Pain, after which follows a Vomiting, <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Delirium,</hi> Convul<U+017F>ion, Redne<U+017F>s of the Eyes and Face, and as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, the Stomach doth <U+017F>hare with the Head in its griefs, and the Head with the Stomach, by a con<U+017F>ent of the de<U+017F>cendent Nerves being placed at its mouth; and hence doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a lo<U+017F>s of Appetite, and a weakne<U+017F>s both of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>tive and expul<U+017F>ive Faculty; a redne<U+017F>s of the Eyes mu<U+017F>t follow, for their Coats have their Originations from the Membranes of the Brain; a Fever al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ucceeds, by rea<U+017F>on of the exagitation of the animal Spirits lodged
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59608:98"/>
in the Brain, and the<U+017F>e accidents are greater or <U+017F>maller, according to the greatne<U+017F>s or parvity of the hurt. And becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is <U+017F>eldom hurt alone, but the Brain doth <U+017F>hare and communicate with it in its harms, hence doth oft-times follow an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> lo<U+017F>s of Voice and Rea<U+017F>on; for the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being hurt, the Brain it <U+017F>elf doth <U+017F>oon decay, it being chiefly made of Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, through which are carried the vital Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> or according to tho<U+017F>e which are made animal; and the<U+017F>e do not only cover the Brain, and nouri<U+017F>h it, but al<U+017F>o pa<U+017F>s into its Venters, and by or through its Orifices are its vital Spirits conducted into the body of the Brain; and hence happens lo<U+017F>s both of Speech and Rea<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>If therefore you perceive that there is an immoderate Flux of Blood upon the Membrane's being wounded, you are <U+017F>peedily to prohibit it, that you may come to the Membrane it <U+017F>elf.

               <p>And that I may bring in this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with the be<U+017F>t advantage to the young Chirurgeon, I <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew by the Gla<U+017F>s of Anatomy what a Nerve is; how it differeth from a Tendon and a Ligament; for what u<U+017F>e it was framed, and to what end it was con<U+017F>tituted; how it is planted into the Mu<U+017F>cle, and there doth exerci<U+017F>e its mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty: And then having given you its view, you may con<U+017F>equently judge how careful and active you ought to be, in the treating its harms and hurts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Andraeas Laurentius,</hi> with <hi>Galen,</hi> and others, are of a contrary opinion, allowing this to be a di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Part, framed and intertexed out of the concour<U+017F>e of mo<U+017F>t thin Fibres, Ligaments and Nerves interwoven together; it a<U+017F><U+017F>uming its greate<U+017F>t bulk from Ligaments, and a le<U+017F><U+017F>er from the Nerves and their Fibres.

               <p>To conclude this, A Tendon is nothing el<U+017F>e than the fibrillous Sub<U+017F>tances of Nerves expanded and exploded, made and framed much in form of your <hi>Indian</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, which are interwoven of fine Thread or Silk, who<U+017F>e middle Part although expanded and filled up by the intertexture of their woollen Parts, yet are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in either end, and brought into a <U+017F>maller and <U+017F>lenderer Sub<U+017F>tance, by the advantage of <U+017F>o many fine Chords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven and brought to one point.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Puncture of a Nerve.</note> We begin fir<U+017F>t with a Puncture of the Nerve: And here may we <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e little Bodies, being endued with an exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, they being hurt, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>ages.</note>threaten danger; for <U+017F>light and <U+017F>lender Hurts here do produce Spa<U+017F>mes; and the<U+017F>e happen by Pain, the which doth lead the whole Body into intemperiety and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Fi<U+017F><U+017F>ures of the Nerves are hard to cure, by rea<U+017F>on of their cold nature, being in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance both cold and ex<U+017F>anguial, their Humidities admitting no dige<U+017F>tion.

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59608:111"/>
But to come to each in their order; and to begin with a Puncture of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The wounded Nerves do require very drying Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, having an attractive quality in them, being of thin Parts. Now whereas this is an accident, which doth mo<U+017F>t commonly happen to them, by the ignorance of the Chirurgeon <U+017F>ometimes, as well as by the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of <U+017F>ome violent Thru<U+017F>t, Puncture, or the like; here are two <U+017F>copes to be pre<U+017F>cribed: The fir<U+017F>t of which toucheth the Part affected, which is to be treated with <U+017F>trong dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, and <U+017F>uch as may ea<U+017F>e Pain; and the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to hinder Inflammation. The Nerve therefore is to be opened, and its thin and humid Sub<U+017F>tances to be dried up, which do procure the inward injury; and for this U<U+017F>e you are to apply hot Medicines, for the educeing the<U+017F>e Vapours, attracting of the Humidities about the affected Part. And here be <U+017F>ure before you undertake any application, that you remove and extract all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies, which may lodge in the wounded Part, if any remain therein, as Needles, Gla<U+017F>s, Bone, Splints of Wood, or the like, hereby taking care that we add no affliction to the afflicted Part. Hence are we by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Authority here directed for Women, Children, and the like per<U+017F>ons who are tender and <U+017F>oft, to u<U+017F>e Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine by it <U+017F>elf, or to mix therewith Sulphur or <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium.</hi> And to hinder Inflammation, is a great intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Punctures of the Nerve; and this is to be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Phlebotomy, once or more times to be made u<U+017F>e of, as occa<U+017F>ion may require, hereby to di<U+017F>charge a good quantity of the Blood, both for prevention of Fever and Inflammation.</p>
               <p>Next may we <U+017F>torm this by Catharticks, which have power to bani<U+017F>h it by <U+017F>iege, by fir<U+017F>t preparing the Body with <hi>Mel Ro<U+017F>arum, Syr. de Betonic. Oxymel,</hi> or the like; then to pre<U+017F>cribe a convenient Cathartick, made either of <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia, Manna, Rhubarb, Senna, Confectio</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59608:112"/>
                  <hi>Hamech. Diacatholicon, Elect. Ã¨ <U+017F>ucc. Ro<U+017F>ar. Pil. Coch. Rudii,</hi> or the like. And here al<U+017F>o as to the affected Part, we are here to con<U+017F>ider both the breadth and narrowne<U+017F>s of the affected Part, and its Wound; for if the Wound be <U+017F>o narrow, as that the Matter cannot have vent for its exition, and the <U+017F>trength and force of the Medicine cannot reach the Puncture, here are we to dilate, and make the Wound wider, by cutting it <U+017F>o wide, as the Nerve may well appear; if the Wound be large enough, we are here to view the Symptoms which attend and offend; and here if Pain offers, this is to be abated: And for this purpo<U+017F>e <hi>Galen</hi> propo<U+017F>eth Oyl warmed, and with this to foment the Part; and hence is it al<U+017F>o that we always u<U+017F>e hot Oyls in Punctures of the Nerves, for this doth <U+017F>peedily make Pain cea<U+017F>e and vani<U+017F>h. But <U+017F>ome may <U+017F>eem here to quarrel with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who writes, That Oyl is humecting and mollifying, and <U+017F>o an enemy con<U+017F>equently to the Nerves, which do require drying Medicines, and therefore how to be approved of in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es? It's true it is <U+017F>oftning and humective; yet we find that a punctured Nerve being kept for 2 or 3 days in Oyl, hath not received any injury thereby, but hath hereby rather gained a large mitigation of Pain, and therefore in re<U+017F>pect of the Symptoms is advantagiou<U+017F>ly here to be u<U+017F>ed, the Pain being abated. Next indeed in re<U+017F>pect of the nervous Sub<U+017F>tance being cold and dry, we are authorized to u<U+017F>e hot and dry Medicines; dry, that they may keep up and maintain the proper temper of the Nerves; and hot, that they may take off all cold from them; the true temper of the<U+017F>e Medicines are to be very drying, and moderately hot. In a punctured Nerve we may al<U+017F>o note, That the Nerve which is thus punctured, can endure the mo<U+017F>t hot Oyl, which the Finger cannot. Whence I collect, That a Nerve hath not in it a mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, but only an exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; and therefore all <U+017F>uch Medicines which are here to be applied, <U+017F>hould
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59608:112"/>
be freed of all a<U+017F>perity and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s; and the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Nerve being hard, the temper of the Medicine <U+017F>hould be thin and penetrating.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Another thing herein worthy note, which I mu<U+017F>t not pretermit, is, That if any Matter remain at the bottom of the wounded Nerve, it is as bad as poy<U+017F>on, executing there its traiterous venomous qualities, procuring for its companion, Pain.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are further to note, That the proper Medicines which are here to be u<U+017F>ed and applied, ought not only to be hot and drying, but to have in them an educeing and extracting quality. And the<U+017F>e Medicines are either <U+017F>imple or compound; among<U+017F>t the Simples may be reckoned Ro<U+017F>ine of the Fir-Tree, Turpentine, Gum Elemni, Oyl of Turpentine, and Oyl of Fir; the<U+017F>e being both thin bodied, and having in them an educeing and extracting quality, to fetch every ichorous Matter from the bottom of the Wound. Stronger than the<U+017F>e may be reckoned Liquid Pitch, <hi>Ol. Petrol. Sagapen. Opoponax, Sulphur vivum, Euphorbium,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Another thing remarkable in the<U+017F>e Wounds, is, That no Lint is here to be applied, for this doth choak up the Matter, and hinder its exition, and hence follows into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falloppius</hi> doth much commend <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> as the be<U+017F>t and chiefe<U+017F>t of Medicines for the<U+017F>e kind of Wounds, and calls it his <hi>Sacra Anchora,</hi> it never deceiving him that u<U+017F>eth it, but doth further an<U+017F>wer expectation; yet he makes a va<U+017F>t difference between <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> the be<U+017F>t being newe<U+017F>t, and appearing like black Re<U+017F>in at its ends; the old is yellow and reddi<U+017F>h.</p>

               <p>HAving run through all the Wounds of the <hi>Head,</hi> We next come to tho<U+017F>e which may happen to the Front or <hi>Forehead,</hi> called <hi>Frons Ã  ferendo,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it carries in it the lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance of Heavine<U+017F>s, Cheerfulne<U+017F>s, Sadne<U+017F>s or Moro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s: And that which makes it <U+017F>o moveable, is the two Mu<U+017F>cles of which it is compo<U+017F>ed; the which <hi>Riolanus</hi> doth call the Membranous fle<U+017F>hy Mu<U+017F>cle, it begins from the Eye-lids, and ends where the hair begins; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>teth of a <hi>Cuticula, Cutis,</hi> a little fat, and a <hi>Membrana Carno<U+017F>a;</hi> it hath two <U+017F>orts of Fibres allowed it, for help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards the elevation of the Eye-lids. If a Wound happens here, and that with hurt of the frontal Bone, here are we to <U+017F>tudy <U+017F>ecurity of the parts, more than their beauty, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e Wounds are dangerous; for here the Wound is to be dilated, and the Bone to be deraded, and the <U+017F>ame method to be u<U+017F>ed as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <U+017F>hewn you in Wounds of the Skull: But where
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59608:118"/>
Wounds happen here without any hurt to the Bone, here are we to <U+017F>tudy their Cure to be performed with the lea<U+017F>t of Scarr or Deformity: And as a Wound may happen here, without lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, here are we to Cure as we do other Wounds; yet with this re<U+017F>pect to regard the habit of the Body. Hence al<U+017F>o if a Flux of Blood be pre<U+017F>ent which may hinder union, this is fir<U+017F>t to be minded, then are we to proceed to the uniting of the parts. And becau<U+017F>e Sutures here do leave their marks, we are to ab<U+017F>tain from the<U+017F>e, and to apply <U+017F>uch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as may unite the Lips of the Wound; the which being conjoyned are <U+017F>o to be kept: and for this u<U+017F>e a <U+017F>mall and narrow Ligature is very proper, applying <U+017F>ome agglutinative Medicine to the Wound before you u<U+017F>e the Ligature: As hereto adding the white of an Egg well beaten, to which may be added Dragons blood, Ma<U+017F>tich, Frankincen<U+017F>e, Sarcocolla, and the like, to be made into the Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of Honey; this way may you prevent an ill Cicatrice. In a tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Wound of the Forehead, no Ligature is proper; but here we are advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to come to the <U+017F>titch, and the <U+017F>econd dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing to cut off the <U+017F>titches, and to apply <U+017F>ome agglutinative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; the<U+017F>e only to be u<U+017F>ed al<U+017F>o where the lips of the Wound are at much variance, the which are by Suture to be brought to a mutual Contacture: For agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Empl. Barbarum</hi> is very good, and <hi>Diapalma</hi> will do it; and where a good union is purcha<U+017F>ed, the place is to be anointed with <hi>Axungia Humana,</hi> the which by its natural property doth effect a fair Cicatrice. In the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, where you intend to procure a Cicatrice, <hi>Unguent. Tuthiae</hi> is very good, or <hi>Unguent. Ceru<U+017F>sae</hi> in Summer time.

               <p>IN the foregoing Chapters I have <U+017F>hewn you the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Parts of the Head, and tho<U+017F>e Parts which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with long Hairs: We come now to that Part which by <U+017F>ome is called <hi>Vultus, Ã  voluntatis Indicio,</hi> it being turned every way forwards and to the <U+017F>ides accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our wills: It is al<U+017F>o called <hi>Facies,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the difference between Man and Bea<U+017F>t. And here might we look into its Beauty, and con<U+017F>ider in every re<U+017F>pect its fair compo<U+017F>ition: We may well admire its Maker; for although the trea<U+017F>uries and <U+017F>tore-hou<U+017F>es of Judgment, Sen<U+017F>e and Rea<U+017F>on, are placed in other Parts, yet for Beauty this doth <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s them: For in this may be ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een the <U+017F>torms and tempe<U+017F>ts of Anger and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <U+017F>ilver <U+017F>treams of Love, the <U+017F>igns of Health, and the attempts of Death: Here may we lively <U+017F>ee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented the Idea's of Joy, Anger, Sadne<U+017F>s, Melancholy, repre<U+017F>enting the ob<U+017F>cure Parts of Man, as by a gla<U+017F>s; <U+017F>ome of its Parts are containing, others contained. The <hi>Cutis</hi> hereof hath in it this one remarkable thing, the which as it is variou<U+017F>ly perforated in the Eyes, No<U+017F>trils, Ears and Mouth; as it is wholly nervous in the other Parts of the Body, in this it is mu<U+017F>culous and fle<U+017F>hy. And becau<U+017F>e I intend to treat of all its Parts in their <U+017F>everal orders, I <U+017F>hall not give you any further trouble to read more hereof, but fall upon its Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And here although <U+017F>uch Medicines as are already <U+017F>et down, may <U+017F>erve for the curing of Wounds of the

Face, yet becau<U+017F>e it's the comely Part of the Body, and beauty of its Front, affording a wonder to its Spectators, here ought it to be our greate<U+017F>t care that we leave no <U+017F>cars, or foul Cicatrice. If the <U+017F>oft Parts be only wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, clo<U+017F>e the lips of the Wound with evenne<U+017F>s, by a fair Ligature, and agglutinative Medicines; and herein are we directed to make u<U+017F>e of narrow Rowlers, the<U+017F>e being mo<U+017F>t proper for performing this Intention. As for ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Medicines, I have already pre<U+017F>ented you with a plentiful quantity; the<U+017F>e may be made of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin<U+017F>ence, <hi>Bol. armoni.

If the Wound be large and wide, you mu<U+017F>t come to the u<U+017F>e of the dry Stitch, the which I have already <U+017F>hewn in my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Sutures<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and <hi>Ambro<U+017F>e Parrey</hi> is very full hereof, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing both way and method, and therefore in this ca<U+017F>e I do recommend you to him.

other, and by applications of good and proper Medicines the Wound was healed, and the Patient re<U+017F>tored to his former health.</p>
               <p>He writes another Story of the <U+017F>ame Man, who being <U+017F>mitten under the Chin even to the upper Mandible by a Bull's Horn, opened part of the Face therewith, and di<U+017F>-joyned his left Eye from the No<U+017F>e with the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the place being <U+017F>titcht up with a Needle, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible was re<U+017F>tored as you <U+017F>ee in the former, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly was cured; his Mouth was inwardly wa<U+017F>hed with a Decoction of Barley, Ro<U+017F>es, Balau<U+017F>tians, and honey of Ro<U+017F>es; and thus he was in a <U+017F>hort time recovered, many pieces of Bones coming forth by his Palate, which were broken by the Horn, and left remaining in the Cavity of the Palate.</p>

               <p>THE Temporal Mu<U+017F>cles being very <U+017F>trong, are by the Greeks called <hi>Crotaphites,</hi> who<U+017F>e Fibres, by how much they do recede from their middle, they are <U+017F>o much the more obliquely carried with a Tendon.

               <p>Another thing worthy note in this Mu<U+017F>cle is, That it is covered with the <hi>Pericrane,</hi> by which the <U+017F>ubjacent Temporal Bones are de<U+017F>titute thereof. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth advi<U+017F>e in Wounds which happen here, by rea<U+017F>on of the

               <p>Where by the way we are to note, That as the No<U+017F>e is Boney in the upper part, <U+017F>o is it Cartilaginous in the lower part.

                  </gap>, in Engli<U+017F>h, Ears, from Hearing. They are framed of many Parts, the which do as well <U+017F>erve for the reception of found, as al<U+017F>o for the inten<U+017F>ion thereof. They are the in<U+017F>truments of Hearing, but not the principal Organs; for if the<U+017F>e be lo<U+017F>t, as we <U+017F>ee it inflicted as a puni<U+017F>hment upon perjured per<U+017F>ons, yet the Sen<U+017F>e of Hearing doth continue, as well as the Sen<U+017F>e of Smelling, if the No<U+017F>e be amputated. The<U+017F>e Sen<U+017F>es being lodged within the <hi>Cranium,</hi> they gain a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular <U+017F>hape; on the in<U+017F>ide excavated, Nature hath made them two, that one being injured the other may perform the Work. <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> compares the whole Ear to a Fan. <hi>Gaza</hi> calls this <hi>Pinna,</hi> being much like a broad Cartilage, or Fin of a Fi<U+017F>h. By <U+017F>ome it is called a Wing, broad, for the better embracing the <U+017F>ound, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth de<U+017F>cend by the inward Compa<U+017F>s unto the arched Cavity that guides it to the Head.

               <p>But as touching the outward parts of the Ear, the<U+017F>e being the proper Subjects of our pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: And here may we <U+017F>ee a <hi>Cuticula,</hi> as the common covering of this part as well as of the re<U+017F>t; next a Skin, enwrapping both the out<U+017F>ide and in<U+017F>ide of the Ear; it hath Veins di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>ed on either <U+017F>ide from the external Jugulars; Arteries

it hath from the inward <hi>Carotides,</hi> which do pa<U+017F>s to the back<U+017F>ide of the Ear; two <U+017F>mall Nerves it hath backward, and two from the <U+017F>ides of the 2d Conjugation; they have both proper and common Mu<U+017F>cles allowed them, found out by <hi>Ealloppius;</hi> two others they have al<U+017F>o; in all, four. The outward <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Ear is neither boney nor fle<U+017F>hy, but moderately hard, yielding a <U+017F>ound, an Eccho being as it were framed without, and <U+017F>o car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried inwards<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> its Cartilage ari<U+017F>eth as it were out of the Temples; it's tyed to the petro<U+017F>e Bone by a Ligament, which is <U+017F>trong. There are many other parts belonging to the inward Ear, but Anatomy doth <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>hew the<U+017F>e, therefore I pretermit them. If the Ears be hurt by outward Cau<U+017F>es, the danger is not great; yet if part thereof be quite cut off here, it never groweth again; and if they are only wounded, they require a right Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and agglutinative Medicines; and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, the dryer any part is, the more drying Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines doth it require. If the Wound be to be <U+017F>titched up, here are two things to be ob<U+017F>erved: That you only bring together the parts of the Skin on each <U+017F>ide of the Ear, without touching or hurting the Cartilage: And then 2dly, If the Wound doth reach to that Cavity we call commonly <hi>Meatus Anditorius,</hi> you are to keep a <U+017F>pongy Tent in it, to prevent the growth of a <U+017F>pongy fle<U+017F>h, and that no Matter may fall into it, which may exulcerate the inward parts; both which are <U+017F>et down for our in<U+017F>truction by <hi>Aqua pendens, fol.</hi> 904. <hi>cap.</hi> 33.</p>

               <p>Now as touching its Wounds. The Tongue being thus guarded with a Sett of Teeth, and lodged within the Mouth, might <U+017F>eem to be defended again<U+017F>t all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Injuries, yet this is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>een wounded: for when the Cheeks and the Jawes are wounded, the Tongue al<U+017F>o may take <U+017F>hare of the Wounds. And it may be <U+017F>o wounded, that even a part of it may be cut off, and here the lo<U+017F>s is irreparable: If a part hereof doth adhere to the <U+017F>ound part, here it is not to be cut away, but rather to be <U+017F>titched up. Wounds happening here are dangerous for the<U+017F>e two ca<U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e here we can neither u<U+017F>e dry <U+017F>titch nor Ligature; and then becau<U+017F>e Empla<U+017F>tick Topicks have no power to hold on here. In every Wound of the Tongue, in which the <U+017F>ound part is cut or divided, the Lips are to be adjoyned; and this is to be performed by Suture, as <hi>Aquapendens</hi> teacheth it: which is thus to be performed; The Tongue is to be drawn forth out of the Mouth, being holden by the Hand by a piece of Cloath between, you are to make <U+017F>o many and <U+017F>o deep <U+017F>titches as are to be taken, for the true unition of the divided parts.

               <p>HAving run through all the Parts of the Head, We come next to the Neck, where we may meet with that part <U+017F>o properly called the Rock, which lyes ju<U+017F>t under the Head and Face, and upon the Brea<U+017F>t. It obtains a round Figure, and becau<U+017F>e in the<U+017F>e parts are found various bodies, and this wrought out of their diver<U+017F>ity of works, the<U+017F>e may <U+017F>hew diver<U+017F>ity of Species in the<U+017F>e Wounds. For be<U+017F>ides its Mu<U+017F>cles and <hi>Cutis,</hi> which it hath be<U+017F>towed on it, in its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it hath planted the <hi>A<U+017F>pera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-Pipe, under which is placed the <hi>Ae<U+017F>ophagus</hi> or Gullet.

               <p>It <U+017F>hall therefore be Our pre<U+017F>ent Task to Treat of the<U+017F>e in their Order. And as from the Heart the great Artery, and from the Liver doth ari<U+017F>e the great Vein, <U+017F>o from the Brain is produced a great Trunk extended through the whole Spine, which may either be called <hi>Spinal, Dor<U+017F>al, Cervical</hi> or <hi>Lumbary</hi> Marrow.

Hence therefore may we account the<U+017F>e Wounds dangerous, and yet not to be left unattempted without help, the Wind-pipe being the proper In<U+017F>trument for Voice, outwardly being Cartilaginous, and inwardly Membranous and fle<U+017F>hy. When this is wounded, it is generally known by the Sen<U+017F>es; oft-times the Wound is occult, and the rather becau<U+017F>e here is no large Flux of blood follows the<U+017F>e Wounds, but <U+017F>ometimes Pain, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is perceived a <U+017F>tinking Breath, hoar<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of Voice, a dryne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Fauces,</hi> and in proce<U+017F>s of time the Patient doth become Empyemated.

It's of great U<U+017F>e, being as a Tunnel to let through both <note place="margin">Its U<U+017F>e.</note>Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>Thus have I <U+017F>hewn you how the <hi>Oe<U+017F>ophagos</hi> is placed between the <hi>Fauces</hi> and the <hi>Os Ventriculi,</hi> being as its general Receiver, being framed both of a nervous and fle<U+017F>hy Sub<U+017F>tance; nervous, that it may extend it <U+017F>elf upon occa<U+017F>ion; and fle<U+017F>hy, that it may fall again.</p>
               <p>Wounds happening here are very perillous, becau<U+017F>e both Meat and Drink do pa<U+017F>s through it, which do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Agglutination.</p>
               <p>Wounds here happening may be known by their Site, <U+017F>ometimes by the Sen<U+017F>e of Feeling; for this is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a direct and <U+017F>trait Line all along, under or beneath the Wind-pipe, and when this is wounded, either Blood or Matter is vomited, and the indige<U+017F>ted Nutriment doth <U+017F>ometimes pa<U+017F>s through the Wound. When the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lyes down, he feeleth much pain between his Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula's, but upon <U+017F>traightning his Neck he feels <U+017F>ome ea<U+017F>e.

In a penetrating Wound the ordering of the whole Body is to be regarded, both for the evacuating and di<U+017F>charging of Blood, Humours, Matter, or Excrements, which may fall from the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> le<U+017F>t being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in left, they corrupt and putrifie, and <U+017F>o bring death in the end: And the<U+017F>e may be 3 ways di<U+017F>charged; as either

And hence becau<U+017F>e the outward Air being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprepared, doth ru<U+017F>h and pa<U+017F>s hither, it doth much offend the inward Parts, and the inward Air pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing out hereby, doth both weaken, hurt and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the <U+017F>trength and vigour of the Parts. And another ill Symptom which attends the<U+017F>e Wounds, is, they cannot outwardly or conveniently be deterged, and hence they degenerate into Fi<U+017F>tula's and Empyema's, exciting there their purulent Collections, and hence death follows. And <U+017F>uch who upon receiving a Wound here, have annexed therewith a Vomiting and Syncope, or Loo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, death is <U+017F>ure to catch hold of the<U+017F>e.</p>

and Experience; for the Wound is to be kept open, for this Matter is not ea<U+017F>ily or readily to be di<U+017F>charged by Urine, nor yet emptied out by the Mouth, the Orifice of the Wound being the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t ready way to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the <U+017F>ame; and this is to be performed by Tents or Pipes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Intentions.</note> But to come clo<U+017F>e to the genuine Intentions herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and afterwards <U+017F>hew you how this is to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</p>
               <p>And herein are 6 Intentions which offer them<U+017F>elves: As fir<U+017F>t, To <U+017F>top the Flux of Blood. 2dly, To prevent all Fluxion. 3dly, To di<U+017F>charge the contained Matter. 4thly, To deterge and dry up the Wound. 5thly, To order the inward Parts aright. And then la<U+017F>tly, To prevent all other Accidents.</p>
               <p>As for the fir<U+017F>t, I have <U+017F>ufficiently already enlarged. But becau<U+017F>e here <U+017F>ome of the concrete Blood may be lodged in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> this is both nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and <U+017F>peedily to be <U+017F>uppurated. And hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wounds of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are pre<U+017F>ently to be aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, or kept open, being con<U+017F>entaneous in a Cut where the great Veins and Arteries are untoucht, and when no Flux of Blood doth appear here to <U+017F>peed Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, either by Suture or Ligature, or any other ingenious method; for thus the Parts may be united, and the innate Heat pre<U+017F>erved, and the Matter di<U+017F>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Mouth. But if there be any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated or concreted Blood, the Wound is to be kept open, for the di<U+017F>charge of all Matter and Excrements: And for this U<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome do make u<U+017F>e of leaden Pipes, which they have made for the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, to convey and draw forth this Matter, called by the <hi>Greeks Piuleus,</hi> or <hi>Eductorium;</hi> the Matter being di<U+017F>charged, the Parts are to be united and dried up.</p>
               <p>But a little further, as touching the coagulated Blood, it being a matter of great concern in this place: Here are

we not to <U+017F>tudy too <U+017F>peedy an unition of the Parts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til every ill Juyce or Matter be expurged and di<U+017F>charged. The Wound therefore, as I formerly have writ, is to be kept open by Tents, both for the pre<U+017F>erving the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ignoble Parts entire. Hence ought the careful Chirurgeon to examine well the affected Parts, and then to the di<U+017F>charge of the Matter; this is to be done by its proper places; the Blood being <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, the Wound is to be roul'd up.</p>

               <p>THe<U+017F>e being the In<U+017F>truments both of Voice and Breathing, are by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Pneumones,</hi> upon reception of the Air, which they call <hi>Pneuma.</hi> And although the<U+017F>e in mo<U+017F>t Creatures do hang loo<U+017F>e, that they may move more freely, yet by the mediation of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Weazon, they are hung to the Neck, and tyed forwards to the Bre<U+017F>t-Bone, and backwards to the Spine. And Nature taking care to maintain this Motion, <U+017F>he hath united them to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that <U+017F>o by this connexion they might follow the Dilatation of the Che<U+017F>t, though it were perforated. They adhere to the Heart by the <hi>Pulmoniack</hi> Vein, or <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a,</hi> and the <hi>Vena Arterio<U+017F>a.</hi> Their Figure they gain according to the proportion of the Parts of the Che<U+017F>t, being both gibbous and <U+017F>welling. They are divided by a <hi>Media<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> into a right and left, that one Part being hurt, the other might work for both. Their Sub<U+017F>tance is loo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>pongey and rare, made as it were of frothy Blood. They have allowed them a Membrane bred out of the <hi>Pleura.</hi> They have 3 Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els de<U+017F>eminated through them; it receives 2 from the Heart, and the<U+017F>e according to the opinion of <U+017F>ome, are to be moved according to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lungs, others according to the Heart. Their u<U+017F>e is to aire the Heart in its dilatation, moderately cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tempering the heat of the Heart, for want of which the natural heat growes weak. The<U+017F>e being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for fanning the Heart, upon being wounded they occa<U+017F>ion a difficulty of Breathing; the Blood which here comes forth is <U+017F>pumous or frothy. Sometimes there is perceived a noi<U+017F>e or murmuration, the Neck of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59608:146"/>
Patient is convelled, the Face inflamed, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grows white, and many Changes in a <U+017F>mall time act their Parts here. If the Lungs be inwardly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Tongue hath a change in its colour, they breathe <U+017F>hort, and cough frequently, the Wound <U+017F>mall, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording much Matter, they live a good while, but pine away into a Con<U+017F>umption or Mya<U+017F>me; for the inci<U+017F>ed Lungs do beget ill Tempers and Inflammations, the which having once obtained, they leave <U+017F>mall hopes of Agglutination; for upon expiration or in<U+017F>piration <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Air is received, by which the hurt Parts are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and at be<U+017F>t, if Medicines might be allowed a fair reception into the Lungs, yet they mu<U+017F>t be moved by in<U+017F>piration and re<U+017F>piration, and lacerated by Coughs. And where the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are wounded which are lodged herein, or the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs wounded, the<U+017F>e are generally accounted lethal for <U+017F>everal Rea<U+017F>ons, they being in continual motion, moi<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ubject to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, no Medicines ea<U+017F>ily reaching them, a large Flux of Blood attending the<U+017F>e Wounds, and a great part of this Blood mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily fall into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> he which by its weight falling upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> doth cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of Breath; and after all, the Heart mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <U+017F>hare with them in their mi<U+017F>chie<U+017F>s, the Lungs having their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from thence; yet dangerous Wounds here, have been cured; as we <U+017F>hall afterward <U+017F>hew by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>Wounds of the Lungs are known by their proper Symptoms.

As to the <U+017F>uperfluities of the Lungs, the<U+017F>e are to be carried off by Purgation, good Diet, and Medicines. And as to Topicks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either inwardly admini<U+017F>tred, or outwardly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ought to be of a drying quality, and of that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative faculty, as may both act its own Part, and

yet not prove mordacious.

               <p>I Shall here al<U+017F>o continue my former Cu<U+017F>tome, in giving you a <U+017F>hort Survey of this Membrane, and its U<U+017F>es, and then fall to its Wounds and Curative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. It is a Membrane enwrapping the Heart <U+017F>wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in it, and defending it from Injuries, <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from it as its pul<U+017F>ifying actions do require: It ari<U+017F>eth at the ba<U+017F>is of the Heart, from the common di<U+017F>ruptions of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> outwardly covering the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Heart. <hi>Riolanus</hi> will have it a double Membrane; it outwardly adheres to the <hi>Media<U+017F>tinum,</hi> in the lower part to the Center of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> it hath <U+017F>mall Arteries given it for its nutrition, <U+017F>mall branches of Nerves it <U+017F>ends forth to the Axillaries, and doth receive <U+017F>mall Nerves from the left recurrent, and the 6th pair pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart. It contains in it a liquor, the which doth keep the Heart moi<U+017F>t, making its motion more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and prohibiting its dryne<U+017F>s. It hath been ob<U+017F>erved by Practitioners, That this part being wounded, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor hath pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed out; but the Wound being Cicatrized, the Patients have been recovered, and this hath renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its growth again. This Pannicle thus covering the Heart, by <U+017F>ome being called <hi>Cap<U+017F>ula Cordis,</hi> being alone hurt is not very dangerous, being by <hi>Galen</hi> reckoned as an ignoble part; and hence he produceth a Story of <hi>Marulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mimographus,</hi> who although his Heart did lye bare and uncovered, and the <hi>Pericardium</hi> corrupted, yet he recovered. This Membrane is <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ofter than a Bone, as it is <U+017F>ofter than the Lungs, and being as the Hearts <hi>Mar<U+017F>upium,</hi> it being wounded,

                  </gap> or <hi>Coronaria,</hi> encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the whole ba<U+017F>is of the heart like a Crown. It hath oft times two coronary Arteries al<U+017F>o running through its whole Arteries. Its <U+017F>mall Nerves it hath from the <U+017F>ixth Conjugation. I <U+017F>hall not enlarge any further upon its Anatomical di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, although I might here bring in its Ears, its Ventricles, Valves, and Divi<U+017F>ions, but <U+017F>hall rather de<U+017F>ire you to look into <hi>Laurentius Bauhine, Deemerbrooke</hi> and the like, who are full enough in every one of the<U+017F>e. We come now to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and body of the Heart it <U+017F>elf as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Wounds, and here may we <U+017F>ee, the heart being <U+017F>truck, much black and thick blood to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue thence, e<U+017F>pecially if its right ventricle or <U+017F>ide be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and hereupon we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the face <U+017F>oon grow pale, cold <U+017F>weats attend the body, and a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>mell accompany the whole man. Ju<U+017F>t under the right or left brea<U+017F>t the wound is made, the pul<U+017F>e doth much vary and act its changes, the extream parts grow cold, the mind troubled, and death follows. If the left ventricle of the heart be wounded, the blood is of a more ro<U+017F>ie colour, more <U+017F>pirituous, <U+017F>pinning out. And in the<U+017F>e direful ca<U+017F>es we generally meet with Syncopes, cold Sweats and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line<U+017F>s. The heart being <U+017F>o noble and generous a part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure a divorce in it without death, for it's the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59608:150"/>
of life, and elaboratory of the vital Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in continual motion, full of blood, and this oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times emptying it <U+017F>elf into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> there threatning <U+017F>uffocation, as I have already <U+017F>aid. If it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in any of the Ventricles, this wound mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily be lethal, by rea<U+017F>on of the great expence of blood which is made and lo<U+017F>t.

This is an Organick <U+017F>imilar part, membranous, long, thin, hollow, containing Blood in it, and carrying the <U+017F>ame to the Heart. It's <U+017F>aid to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick in re<U+017F>pect of its action or u<U+017F>e, for conveying the Blood. It hath a membranous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, moderately <U+017F>oft, the better for di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion; it hath one proper coat, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texed with a threefold kind of Fibres, the which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>tly apparent in <hi>varices,</hi> the which when its tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e and oblique Fibres have been rent, the coat of the Vein <U+017F>eems loo<U+017F>e, neither is it to be ever re<U+017F>tored to its former natural <U+017F>tate. It's nouri<U+017F>hed with the Blood which pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through it, it's nouri<U+017F>hed as are the Arteries.

               <p>Having thus given you a brief Anatomical di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e parts, we are next to look into their wounds, and here are we to enquire whether this Wound was given by a Sword, or Shaft, or occa<U+017F>ioned by a fall upon a <U+017F>harp Stone, or inwardly by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>alt and corroding humour. All the<U+017F>e are to be collected either from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, or by their proper <U+017F>igns. That there is a breach of <U+017F>ome ve<U+017F><U+017F>el profu<U+017F>ion of blood is certificate enough, herein comprehending the place by the gla<U+017F>s of Anatomy, con<U+017F>idering the largene<U+017F>s of the wound, and impetuo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Blood flowing.

As fir<U+017F>t, the Arterial Blood being both ro<U+017F>ie and florid, al<U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth out with leaping, <U+017F>pinning forth in its dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Secondly, this Blood is more thin and fluid than that of the Veins. And thirdly, as this is florid and ro<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>o the venal blood is black and thick. Again, the Arterial Blood is more hot than the Venal, neither hath the Venal Blood <U+017F>uch Spirit allowed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>ages.</note> Becau<U+017F>e Blood is the trea<U+017F>ure of life, if this flux be not immediately <U+017F>topt, it brings a di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the whole man. For in the<U+017F>e great fluxes we generally <U+017F>ee Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, <hi>Syncope, Singultus</hi> and the like, as continual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants hereupon. The cure of an Artery cut is much more difficult than that of a Vein, becau<U+017F>e the Arterial Blood is more fluxile, and its body more hard and always in motion. An Artery cut overthwart, is <U+017F>ooner heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than that which is inci<U+017F>ed longwi<U+017F>e.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the Cure, we are advi<U+017F>ed by <hi>Galen</hi> to cau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>peedy <U+017F>top to this flux, and then to cure the wound. And this is to be done either by aver<U+017F>ion or derivation, or making the matter more firm that it make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addre<U+017F>s, by ob<U+017F>tructing the mouths of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by joining the lips of the wound together, or by obturation of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them together with the fingers, and keeping them <U+017F>o compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed until the blood do become grumous. I have already in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hown eight <U+017F>everal ways of <U+017F>tanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood, and this may be done either by a certain regulation of the whole body, or well ordering of the affected part. The Diet here ought to be thin, cold and of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance thickning, <U+017F>omewhat re<U+017F>tringent, <U+017F>o as it may both cool and thicken the blood; and for this u<U+017F>e Lentils, Rice, Jujubes, Quinces, Medlers, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Prunes and the like are proper here. Let his drink be either cold water or chalybeated water or Po<U+017F>ca, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-water, of Julip of Ro<U+017F>es, Plantain-water, Spawn-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the like. The part affected ought al<U+017F>o to be cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59608:154"/>
and hence repercu<U+017F><U+017F>ives are proper whereby to repel the blood from the affected part. Hereupon both upon the part and its origination is to be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<U+017F>ed Po<U+017F>ca, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, Juice of Night<U+017F>hade, Lettice, Plantain and the like. The flux is to be averted either by revul<U+017F>ion or deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for revul<U+017F>ion Phlebotomy is to be in<U+017F>tituted, if the flux be large, and the <U+017F>pirits will allow it. For this u<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es either without or with <U+017F>carrificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are proper engines here, as al<U+017F>o Ligatures, Frictions, Unctions, Fomentations and the like, all which are to be applied to the contrary part. Now come we to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el it <U+017F>elf which is wounded, and here are we to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve, that the lips of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are to be <U+017F>hut up; and here if an Artery be di<U+017F><U+017F>ected, we fir<U+017F>t apply our thumb and finger upon the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el for its compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, after which the wound is to be wa<U+017F>hed with Po<U+017F>ca for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of the concreted blood. The blood being clean<U+017F>ed and the wound dried up, we are to <U+017F>prinkle <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>trictive powders into it, over the<U+017F>e to apply a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liniment upon the pre<U+017F>ent removal of the finger, after the application of which, to apply the finger upon it again. And when you take off your dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings, you are to take them <U+017F>ingly off, with a due ob<U+017F>ervation of keeping your finger on untill you have wholly removed all your dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings. The wound being expleted, its <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies is to be <U+017F>prinkled with re<U+017F>trictive powder, then covered over with a rowler, which was dipt in <U+017F>harp Wine and oyl of Ro<U+017F>es. And here are we to ob<U+017F>erve that we do make three or four ligations upon the wound, and <U+017F>o to mount your ligatures upwards towards the origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, <U+017F>o as the blood may be retracted from the affected part. Then remove your ligature the third day, changing al<U+017F>o your dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings, in which time you may <U+017F>afely proceed in this operation. The Chirurgeon ought to be well skilled in Anatomy, for Nature hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and mixed Nerves with Arteries as cold bodies that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59608:154"/>
by their heat they may be cheri<U+017F>hed: for if in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es the Chirurgeon do not <U+017F>eparate the Nerve from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery by a <U+017F>mall hook, he will bind up both parts, and if the Nerve be compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, it <U+017F>peedily is deprived both of its <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and motion, and hence doth follow a <U+017F>tupidity of the whole member. In the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es therefore the Nerve is to be <U+017F>eparated from the Artery, and then the Artery to be bound up. And in our ligations we are to take care that they be not made too <U+017F>trict. <hi>Fallopius fol.</hi> 211. writes of an infirm Mechanick who received a wound in his <hi>Vena Poplitis,</hi> in which wound it behoved the part to be rowled up without which he mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have peri<U+017F>hed; the wound was rowled up although the Artery was cut, yet within the <U+017F>pace of a year after the man perceived a pul<U+017F>e in the Artery of the <hi>Malleolus.</hi> For which rea<U+017F>on he thinks in <U+017F>uch a proce<U+017F>s of time that the Orifices of the Arteries do meet together again and conjugate; but this is not always approved of, neither doth u<U+017F>e of ligatures always appear here proper. For in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es the Artery is to be tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>ly inci<U+017F>ed: for this is the proper nature of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el upon <U+017F>uch an inci<U+017F>ion, to make towards its Original, and to <U+017F>hrowd it <U+017F>elf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mu<U+017F>cles, and with ea<U+017F>e join their Orifices with them. And <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Meth.</hi> teacheth us this way of di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of an Artery, as fir<U+017F>t, to lift it up with a hook, then to <U+017F>eparate it from the Vein and Nerve, and then to divide it; the which being done, the Artery is to be tied up or twi<U+017F>ted by the hook, for hereby the Orifices of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are compleatly ob<U+017F>tructed. But if the wound be <U+017F>o deep and do penetrate <U+017F>o far as that we cannot come at it, in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es U<U+017F>tion is mo<U+017F>t proper, for hereby the flux of blood is <U+017F>topt by cringing the mouth of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el and at its ends procuring an E<U+017F>char or cru<U+017F>t; but this very <U+017F>eldom doth happen.

this action is both painful, cruel and difficult, and we proceeding here as it were hood-winkt; be<U+017F>ides all which if this cru<U+017F>t or e<U+017F>char <U+017F>hould fall off, it would <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the part to a new flux, the which is <U+017F>eldom conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the be<U+017F>t of medicines. In the<U+017F>e de<U+017F>perate ca<U+017F>es the<U+017F>e things are to be ob<U+017F>erved, That you fir<U+017F>t make this with a red hot Iron, taking care that the concreted blood be not cauterized in the wound, but this fir<U+017F>t to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged with Po<U+017F>ca.

But this is not to be u<U+017F>ed in all places, as the face or eyes or the like, for it always doth leave its mark of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.

               <p>We begin with wounds of the Abdomen, and here we may meet with two <U+017F>orts hereof, the one being <U+017F>imple and not penetrating, the other being more compound and penetrating. And before we concern our <U+017F>elves with the cure hereof, let us <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>igns by which we may know the<U+017F>e. And the<U+017F>e again may be <U+017F>een to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate with, or without the exci<U+017F>ion of any part, with or without hurt of the <U+017F>ame. A penetrating wound we may find either by the probe or <U+017F>earching candle; for if a great way in, it's a <U+017F>ign of a penetrating wound, ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Signs of a penetrating<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> wound.</note>here al<U+017F>o that the wound be made directly.

or Candle a great way in between the Mu<U+017F>cles, and the wound notwith<U+017F>tanding not penetrate. Again if you make any injection of Wine and do inject it into the wound well warmed, if the wound penetrateth, it will remain and lodge in the Cavity. If not, it will make its <U+017F>peedy exit. If the Omentum or Inte<U+017F>tines come out of the wound, the<U+017F>e are evident te<U+017F>timonies of its pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. <note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>ages.</note>As for <U+017F>uch wounds as do not penetrate they are void of danger unle<U+017F>s they be very large; and that is wor<U+017F>e which is made in the middle part than in the <U+017F>ides, for the middle part is more nervous, and more difficult to <U+017F>titch up; be<U+017F>ides the guts do more ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F>s out here than at the <U+017F>ides and <U+017F>o do hinder agglutination. And as <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> faith, all penetrating wounds are accounted dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becau<U+017F>e they are mo<U+017F>t commonly large and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deep, becau<U+017F>e the air which pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth into the wound does hurt the guts, and likewi<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ofttimes does fall into the Capacity thereof.

In the<U+017F>e wounds the<U+017F>e Intentions are required. If any part comes out, to repo<U+017F>e this, then to <U+017F>titch up the wound, to apply agglutinative Medicines, and to remove all evil Symptoms. We <U+017F>hall treat of the parts by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. And here by way of Caution as touching our future herein required, we are to con<U+017F>ider how much of the part we are to take up to <U+017F>titch with the Needle, for if here we take up but a <U+017F>mall part, the thread will cut it through, if too great a part, we <U+017F>hall occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain. Secondly, that we make convenient <U+017F>paces between our <U+017F>titches for a better exition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

<U+017F>ize. Here al<U+017F>o are we to note that the <U+017F>titches are not to be cut off the fourth day, but to remain on until the ninth or longer, for wounds here are not <U+017F>uddenly con<U+017F>olidated.

If the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> do come forth at the wound, and by rea<U+017F>on of cold it hath got a <U+017F>trange colour, and purcha<U+017F>ed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural hardne<U+017F>s in it, <U+017F>o far as the part is corrupt, this is to be cut away: but if it carries its native colour, and no change do appear in it, this are we to repo<U+017F>e into its proper place; and if the wound be <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall as we cannot get it in with our fingers, we are advi<U+017F>ed by a <U+017F>earching candle to repo<U+017F>e it, this being dipt in <U+017F>ome Trauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick decoction. Some there are who for this u<U+017F>e do u<U+017F>e a Golden wire, and hereby do cut away all the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part. The next intention after this is to <U+017F>titch the

wound up by <hi>Ga<U+017F>troraphia.</hi> By <hi>Aquapendens</hi> there are <U+017F>et down 3 forts of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>titches: the fir<U+017F>t performed by thru<U+017F>ting the needle through the skin and the Mu<U+017F>cles, even to the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> not touching it; then from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in outwards the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is to be thru<U+017F>t through and the Mu<U+017F>cles of the oppo<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ide by the needle; then within the di<U+017F>tance of an inch the needle is to be thru<U+017F>t through the Mu<U+017F>cles of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide, leaving the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum:</hi> and thus are you to proceed until you have <U+017F>titcht up the wound. The <U+017F>econd is done by <U+017F>titching the Mu<U+017F>cles together and the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> together. The third differeth not from the <U+017F>titch which is u<U+017F>ed in other parts of the body. The<U+017F>e being done, the next Intention is to apply agglutinative empla<U+017F>ters or powders, of which I have already directed <U+017F>ufficiently; over which may be applied <hi>Empl.

And as to the <U+017F>econd acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, matter and blood may well fall from the lips of the wound into the Abdomen, and may not only offend the Guts but al<U+017F>o all the other contained parts, for hereby <U+017F>ometimes a Tumour is cau<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>ometimes a Drop<U+017F>ie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.

The <hi>Arabians</hi> do call it <hi>Zirbus,</hi> being as the mop of the belly <U+017F>weeping up its <U+017F>uperfluities. It is a large membrane, <U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the bottom of the Stomach, and downwards over the Guts unto the Navel. It's fa<U+017F>tned to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Spleen, and Colon. Its form is like a pur<U+017F>e-net or Faulkners-bag, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of a double membrane knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the bottom. Its membranes are two lying one upon the top of another. It hath many Veins ari<U+017F>ing from the Port-vein. It hath its Arteries from the Celia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Me<U+017F>enterical branches. The fat is very plentiful about the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Its u<U+017F>es are to keep the guts moi<U+017F>t, and it warms and comforts the Stomach, and in time of Famine it <U+017F>upplies a kind of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idiary nouri<U+017F>hment to the natural heat.

The great or thick Guts are of the <U+017F>ame number, called <hi>Caecum, Colon,</hi> and <hi>Rectum,</hi> all differing in <U+017F>ite, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and Magnitude.

They have al<U+017F>o two proper coats, partly as <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>heweth, that their expelling faculty might be <U+017F>trong, and partly al<U+017F>o for <U+017F>ecurity. They have all kinds of fibres, the inward being oblique that they might retain, the middle tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e more proper for expul<U+017F>ion, the right being in the <U+017F>mall Guts fewer than in the great. They have their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the Port Vein, Arteries from the <hi>Coeliacal &amp; Me<U+017F>enterical Branches,</hi> they have Nerves from the <U+017F>ixth pair.

each of them lodge a little quantity, fit to be <U+017F>uckt up by the Me<U+017F>eraicks. The u<U+017F>e of the great Guts is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the excrements in them, with choler which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them from the bladder of gall having a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age which enters the <hi>Duodenum.</hi>

If the<U+017F>e be wounded, the excrement does pa<U+017F>s out by the wound; yet if a great and tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e wound does happen here, it ofttimes does threaten death: but if the wound be <U+017F>mall and made directly, it may be cured, and yet mu<U+017F>t not be allowed void of danger, becau<U+017F>e the external part of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is divided.

Some of which do take an Elder pith, and through this they put the needle into the cavity of the Guts, and then they <U+017F>ow the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and Inte<U+017F>tine together; but this way in common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e is out of the way: others there are who do take a dry Gut of another animal, and this being extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do put it about the wound; but this al<U+017F>o is not to be followed, becau<U+017F>e this dryed Gut will <U+017F>oon fall from the moi<U+017F>t, and therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily it mu<U+017F>t be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

               <p>WE come next to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Liver, being in Latine called <hi>Jecur, qua<U+017F>i Juxta Cor,</hi> being a large bowel <U+017F>eated in the right Hypochondry under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> round and <U+017F>mooth in its convex part, and in its lower part concave. Its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is <U+017F>oft and red, much re<U+017F>embling concrete blood. <hi>Malpighius</hi> who by Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>copes hath mo<U+017F>t accurately viewed its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards parts, hath herein ob<U+017F>erved many things unknown to former ages. As fir<U+017F>t, the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance hereof in Man is contexed of Lobes, and the<U+017F>e framed out of the Glandules, the which affording a heap of <U+017F>mall Ramifications, are inve<U+017F>ted with a proper circum<U+017F>cribing membrane. And that the whole ma<U+017F>s of the Liver doth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of rough Glandules, and diver<U+017F>e Ramifications of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and hence is it, that they <U+017F>hould work together, Nature hath nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily interceded a commerce between the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els and tho<U+017F>e Glandules. Thirdly that the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Port, hollow, and biliary <hi>ductus,</hi> do run through all the branches into the<U+017F>e little Lobes in an equal number, and that the branches of the Gate Vein do carry the power of the Arteries, and that there is <U+017F>uch a commerce and <U+017F>ociety between the Gate-vein and biliary <hi>ductus,</hi> that both their ramifications are <U+017F>trongly knit by one and the <U+017F>ame knot. The ramifications of the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are not joined together by <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>is,</hi> but the<U+017F>e rough Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules con<U+017F>titute the chief part of the Liver, and <U+017F>o they order <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e for conveying others for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into the <U+017F>ame. Hence may be conjectured that the Liver is a conglomerated glandule, <U+017F>training the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>

And hence may we well contradict the opinion of the Antients, who did a<U+017F>cribe to the Liver the principal faculty of <U+017F>anguification; for we evidently <U+017F>ee that it is but as a colature for the <hi>Bilis.</hi> It's covered with a <U+017F>mall membrane adhering to its <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and from this do many <U+017F>mall watery bladders ari<U+017F>e, from whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Drop<U+017F>ie hereof, as <hi>Platerus</hi> ob<U+017F>erveth. It's tied by three ligaments, to the <hi>Abdomen</hi> by the umbilical Vein; <U+017F>econdly to the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> upwards from the right part, by a large thin membranous ligament taken from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> called <hi>Su<U+017F>pen<U+017F>orium;</hi> the third upwards al<U+017F>o to the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> It's made of a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymatous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, much re<U+017F>embling the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of a Bullocks Liver; the u<U+017F>es of which <hi>Parenchyma</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry con<U+017F>iderable, <U+017F>howing it <U+017F>elf to be the principal part of the Liver, the other parts being but as <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervients to it, for the ligaments do <U+017F>trengthen its <U+017F>ite, a coat covers it, the Gate-vein brings it blood, the common Cap<U+017F>ula admini<U+017F>treth to it, the Artery and Hepatick Nerve do pay their <U+017F>ervice partly to the Port-vein, partly to the common Cap<U+017F>ula and biliary pore, the <U+017F>mall branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and Hepatick <hi>Ductus</hi> do take hence their blood, it <U+017F>eparates the <hi>Bilis</hi> from the blood, and is as a colature here ordained by Nature for performing this office. But not to dwell too long here, we pa<U+017F>s to its colour, and this is <U+017F>omewhat reddi<U+017F>h, in <U+017F>ickly people it is <U+017F>een to look pale.

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Ventricle.</head>
               <p>HAving drawn all the other parts out by Anatomy, we come next to the Ventricle which is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Natures Workhou<U+017F>e, the Kitchin of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are <U+017F>hown the Organs and In<U+017F>truments that both maintain the family of the body, and its <U+017F>pirits. And <U+017F>eeing the life-tide of every creature is incon<U+017F>tant, and doth quickly po<U+017F>te away, Nature doth endeavour by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the continual expen<U+017F>e of his threefold <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance whereof he con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth, to conclude the breach by re<U+017F>pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nutriment. This Ventricle is an Organick part placed in the lower Venter, and is the In<U+017F>trument of chylfication. It lies under the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> as it were hanging in the middle of the body; its left part is large<U+017F>t and more round towards the bottom, and is placed in the left Hypochondry, giving way to the Liver in its right. It hath two Orifices, and both in its upper part, the left of which is generally called the upper mouth of the Stomach. It hath allowed it circular Fibres that it may <U+017F>hut its Orifice. It's by this Orifice that we let down our meat and drink, it's placed in the Epiga<U+017F>trical Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Its right Orifice commonly called its lower part, doth much differ from the other, for it is narrow, and doth remain <U+017F>hut until an ab<U+017F>olute concoction be made of the meat. The Chyle pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth by this <hi>Pylorus</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor.</hi> This <hi>Pylorus</hi> by <hi>Helmontius</hi> is held to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of dige<U+017F>tion. It hath three <U+017F>orts of Fibres allowed it, right, oblique and tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e, and to the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome grant the<U+017F>e three operations, retention, attraction, and expul<U+017F>ion. It hath three <U+017F>orts of coats or membranes,

the fir<U+017F>t ari<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and is the thicke<U+017F>t, the <U+017F>econd more fle<U+017F>hy, the third nervous, into which the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and coats of the Oe<U+017F>ophagus, Mouth, and Lips are terminated. And hence is it that we perceive when there is any choler in our Stomachs that we do find a bitterne<U+017F>s in our mouths. Its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is membranous and cold, its figure is round and <U+017F>omewhat long, much re<U+017F>embling a Bagpipe, it's <U+017F>maller in Women than in Men, its ve<U+017F><U+017F>els it hath many from the Spleen. <hi>Conringius, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tius</hi> and others do defend that it taketh its Veins from the Gate-vein, its Arteries it hath from the <hi>Coeliaca.</hi> Its Nerves ari<U+017F>e from the <U+017F>ixth pair.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs and Pre<U+017F>ages.</note> Now as touching its wounds. When the Ventricle is wounded there generally doth happen a <hi>Singultus,</hi> and a vomiting of choler doth <U+017F>ucceed, and whatever is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in of meat or drink at the mouth doth make its quick pa<U+017F><U+017F>age hither. Here follows no great flux of blood, for the Veins belonging hereto are but <U+017F>mall, <U+017F>ave only in its bottom. It's <U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>tirred up with pains, and hence is <U+017F>peedily inflamed, the motions of its Veins do langui<U+017F>h, thin <U+017F>weats do ari<U+017F>e, and hence the extream parts do grow cold, <U+017F>ometimes both chyle and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted victuals do pa<U+017F>s out of the wound, <U+017F>pitting of blood doth attend the<U+017F>e, and cruel pains of the Heart doth <U+017F>eem to be herewith concerned, at length this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part doth grow hard, being deprived of its natural <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance. And the wound is made under the <hi>Sternon</hi> in the middle Region. This being cut, death <U+017F>oon follows. For it's the in<U+017F>trument of the fir<U+017F>t concoction, and doth receive and elaborate what is received into it, and what it findeth unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary or u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s it throws out by its <hi>Pylorus.</hi> Its outward part if only wounded may be cured having in it a fle<U+017F>hy intertexture <U+017F>pun of tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Fibres, but its dome<U+017F>tick or nervous part is either very rarely or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver con<U+017F>olidated if wounded, being generally repleni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humours and liquors, and hence follow Fevers,

Vertigo, Syncope, Singultus, vomitings, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <U+017F>ymptoms, the which do po<U+017F>t away to the Heart, and make it <U+017F>hare and communicate of its direful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> When the Ventricle is wounded, we are to enquire into the<U+017F>e its proper <U+017F>igns, and if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, to gain the true place of the wound; the which having once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<U+017F>ed, we are to <U+017F>ee how far it penetrates. In the<U+017F>e wounds all fatty and oleaginous meats are to be <U+017F>hunned, and <U+017F>uch as are Euchymick and ea<U+017F>ie of dige<U+017F>tion are to be here elected. Let the Patient eat and drink very <U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. Outwardly may be applied a Decoction made of chalybeated water wherein have been boiled Comfrey roots, Sumach, Myrtills, Cicers, and Pimpinel. The common and general Intention of the inward parts is, that all <U+017F>uch things are here to be pre<U+017F>cribed which are mo<U+017F>t familiar to the nature and con<U+017F>titution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and <U+017F>uch as may mo<U+017F>t properly be allowed for his nouri<U+017F>hment, <U+017F>uch as are Partridge, Phea<U+017F>ant, Rabets, Blackbirds, Plover and the like.

This he may take every morning by his mouth, as Syrup of Myrtills, of dried Ro<U+017F>es mixt with the decoction of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, Comfrey and Betony, to which may be added a little powder of the <hi>Troch. de Carabe</hi> or <hi>Spod.</hi> <U+2108>j. in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es al<U+017F>o <hi>Saccharum Ro<U+017F>atum</hi> is good And becau<U+017F>e agglutination is the greate<U+017F>t intention in the<U+017F>e wounds, you may order your Patient to take every morning of <hi>Electuar.

The wound if it be large is to be <U+017F>titcht up, which is very rarely done, or fir<U+017F>t to be covered with Turpentine, anointing all its circumjacent parts with oyl of Ro<U+017F>es, Camomile,

               <p>THE Spleen is an Organick bowel <U+017F>eated in the left Hypochondry, between the Ventricle and Ribs. In man this is generally one, and very rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this number. In its convex part it's tied to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> <U+017F>uperficially, its Fibres do ari<U+017F>e from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum.</hi> Its blunt part adheres to the <hi>Omentum</hi> and its neighbouring parts. Its magnitude is various in men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their variety of con<U+017F>titution and bodies. <hi>Spigelius</hi> doth ob<U+017F>erve that tho<U+017F>e that have large Veins have al<U+017F>o a large Spleen. Its figure is long; its colour is <U+017F>ublivid or of a leady colour. It's covered with a double membrane, the outward ari<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> the other is its proper coat, between either of which is in<U+017F>erted a plenty of Lympheducts endowed with many valves. It hath innumerable thin and <U+017F>trong Fibres fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of Filaments intertexed with admirable art. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e Lymphatick ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it receiveth other ve<U+017F><U+017F>els as Veins, Nerves, Arteries. Its Arteries ari<U+017F>ing from the left branch of the <hi>Caeliaca,</hi> it <U+017F>ends forth the <U+017F>plenetick branch out of its blunt part. Its Nerves it doth receive from the <U+017F>ixth pair. Its office is to make a <U+017F>ubacid matter out of the arterious blood. We come now to its being wounded, where we may by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns collect its hurt. This part being well repleni<U+017F>hed with Arteries, being of a <U+017F>pungy and loo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, framed and nouri<U+017F>hed as it were by a thick, black and melancholick blood, when this part is wounded there follows inflammation; yet when it is lightly wounded, the<U+017F>e wounds are of no great moment, for inward medicines may with ea<U+017F>e reach this part.

re<U+017F>t here is a great advantage from the<U+017F>e. If much blood flow from the wounded Kidney breath a Vein in the Arm, and this repeat as oft as need requires.

For as <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> writes, wounds happening in the<U+017F>e parts are accompanied with great pain, and very <U+017F>ubject are they to inflammation. The whole body therefore being well ordered, and a good diet pre<U+017F>cribed, and Phlebotomy directed, we are next to come to the wounded parts, where we are both to provide again<U+017F>t pain and inflammation, for which u<U+017F>es the<U+017F>e are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines.

If the wound happens according to the Fibres of the Mu<U+017F>cles, a good ligature goes a great way in the cure. If the wound be tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e, you are to <U+017F>titch this up, leaving a cavity in the bottom of the wound, into which you are to put a Tent armed with a dige<U+017F>tive to clean<U+017F>e it inwardly.

In the whole, the Mu<U+017F>cles which are allowed to belong to the whole hand are accounted forty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, four of the Wri<U+017F>t, four of the <hi>Radius,</hi> three of the Palm of the hand, and twenty nine of the fingers. Of the<U+017F>e there are nine inflecters, two bending the fore-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and <U+017F>even the thumb; the extenders being twenty, <U+017F>ixteen extending the four fingers, in which number are included <hi>Lumbricales,</hi> and <hi>Intero<U+017F><U+017F>aei,</hi> the other four do extend the thumb.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59608:181"/>
his little finger. In<U+017F>omuch as that all the Nerves about that part and Tendons were tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>ly inci<U+017F>ed. The wound was <U+017F>titcht up in three places, putting tents between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry future dipt in the white of an Egg and <hi>Bol. Armeny</hi> for the <U+017F>topping the flux of blood. But this would not <U+017F>top it, wherefore by the command of <hi>Fore<U+017F>tus,</hi> who afterwards was called into con<U+017F>ultation, was Tinder or burnt rags mixt with the bole and the white of an Egg, after which the part being rowled up the flux was <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. The<U+017F>e Topicks were left on for near three days. The third day the re<U+017F>trictive was removed, then was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a dige<U+017F>tive made of Turpentine, the yolk of an Egg and a little Saffron, with which the Tents and Do<U+017F>ills were armed, they fir<U+017F>t being dipt in <hi>Ol.

The <U+017F>eventh day being pa<U+017F>t, when all <U+017F>ymptoms as Fever, Convul<U+017F>ion, inflammation and the like were no further dreaded, he was not ordered <U+017F>uch a thin diet. The eleventh day becau<U+017F>e the wound did appear very <U+017F>ordid, and was not well purged, it was inwardly wa<U+017F>ht with a decoction made of Ro<U+017F>emary flowers and Ro<U+017F>es boiled in Rheni<U+017F>h-wine, the which being done the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove<U+017F>aid medicines were applied.

by his <U+017F>o long lying in his bed. He oft times fell down like an Epileptick man with vomiting and a continual Trembling, <U+017F>o as that he could not bring his hand to his mouth without help. His thigh was fractur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both lengthways and tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>ely with many <U+017F>mall pieces of bones, of which <U+017F>ome came forth, and others kept within, adhering to the Mu<U+017F>cles of the thigh and of the legg, which cau<U+017F>ed a very large cold pituitous and flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humour about the parts, that they <U+017F>eemed as it were extingui<U+017F>hed and robbed of their native heat. All which being con<U+017F>idered there was but little hopes left of any cure. Yet confiding <U+017F>omewhat in the Patients age and <U+017F>trength, he fir<U+017F>t made two inci<U+017F>ions to di<U+017F>charge the matters, which did irrigate into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Mu<U+017F>cles circumpo<U+017F>ed to the bone. Which thing <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded happily, for hereby a great quantity of matter was di<U+017F>charged. Here was injected into the<U+017F>e inci<U+017F>ions by a Syringe a good part of <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> mixt with Wine and a little <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> whereby the matter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and amended, and the <U+017F>oft, loo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>pongey fle<U+017F>h corrected, the Oedematous Tumour he re<U+017F>olved, the pain abated, and the native heat which was oppre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed by the weight of the excrementitious humours was corroborated.

               <p>WE are now arrived at the la<U+017F>t part of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which doth treat of Wounds of the Joints, that part being <U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t properly called which is framed for the <U+017F>etting together of the bones for the performing of free motion. Now wounds made here, are made either by puncture or inci<U+017F>ion, and the<U+017F>e do reach either the upper parts, or el<U+017F>e do penetrate into the cavity thereof. All wounds here happening are dangerous, according to <hi>Galens</hi> <U+017F>aying, they being endowed with an exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e by rea<U+017F>on of the Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments wherewith they are covered, lined, and enwrapped. Hence therefore upon wounds here received do generally ari<U+017F>e an afflux of humours, occa<U+017F>ioned here by pain. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inflammations, watchings, thir<U+017F>t, convul<U+017F>ions, weakne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ometimes death. Such wounds as do

penetrate the Joint, by <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> opinion mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be allowed dangerous, for hereby the moi<U+017F>ture which kept between the joints is let out, the which being di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, an excrementitious humour doth fall thereinto, being a thin ichorous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance much re<U+017F>embling that of <hi>Meliceris</hi> according to his opinion.</p>

Keep the parts from cold and defend them from pain, for cold hardneth the skin, hindereth <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and doth extingui<U+017F>h the native heat as <hi>Hipp.</hi> writes. If the wound be made by inci<U+017F>ion, and this be large, <U+017F>titch it up, hereby not touching any of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous or tendinous parts; leaving a <U+017F>mall orifice in the depending part thereof, for the better di<U+017F>charge of the matter.
