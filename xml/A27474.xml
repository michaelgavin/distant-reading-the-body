            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the Reign of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froy;</hi>
that Prince having
all the Qualities which obtain the
Admiration of the People. He
had render'd him<U+017F>elf formidable
both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and tho'
he had no other Enemies than
tho<U+017F>e his Valour had occa<U+017F>ioned,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43299:6"/>
he had already given <U+017F>everal Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels;
and it is certain, that he
conquered as often as he fought.
Queen <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>andra,</hi> his Wife, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> was
likewi<U+017F>e an accompli<U+017F>h'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
having all the Virtues that
can be wi<U+017F>h'd for in a Great
Queen; and the King, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her with an extraordinary
Affection, would have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to de<U+017F>ire, if Heaven
had not deprived him of <U+017F>everal
Princes whom the Queen had
brought into the World. This
misfortune of their Family, made
a great part of their Lives very
afflicting, Daughters not being
capable of Succeeding in the
Crown, that Kingdom mu<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
have fallen into the hands
of <hi>Berranger,</hi> King of <hi>Majorca,
Minorca,</hi> and <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> his
Cou<U+017F>in-German, and greate<U+017F>t E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.

The<U+017F>e two Kings being
extraordinarily animated again<U+017F>t

<U+017F>u<U+017F>pended the Effects of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
if Prince <hi>Ordogne,</hi> Count
of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> and their Allies,
had not made them agree to a
Truce, which they repre<U+017F>ented to
be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Repo<U+017F>e of
their People. The King of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
notwith<U+017F>tanding the Advantages
he had over <hi>Berranger,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with to con<U+017F>ent to this
Propo<U+017F>ition; for indeed, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Victory does almo<U+017F>t as much
weary the Conquerour as the
Vanqui<U+017F>hed; and the King of
<hi>Majorca</hi> being brought into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair,
through the ill Succe<U+017F>s of
his Arms, accepted though with
Repugnance, all the Conditions

Length of the Truce, he might

who had almo<U+017F>t exhau<U+017F>ted all
tho<U+017F>e of his Kingdom. Tho<U+017F>e kind
of Treaties that are made out of
Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity do not put an end to
Quarrels, they only help to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them, and the Moment of
<U+017F>eeing them revived, is impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

with a Langui<U+017F>hing and Deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne<U+017F>s
that cannot be conceived.
The King made it his Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to
divert her Grief, putting her in
hopes that Heaven would be more
favourable to them, and that it
would perhaps con<U+017F>erve the Child
with which <U+017F>he went; but, if by
Misfortune <U+017F>he was delivered of a
Girl, he was re<U+017F>olved to conceal
her Sex, and to bring her up as
a <hi>Prince Majeur,</hi> a Name con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for to exclude
<hi>Berranger</hi> from hopes of <U+017F>ucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Crown. The Queen
did willingly agree to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign;
and <U+017F>ome days after, <U+017F>he
was brought to Bed of a Prince<U+017F>s,

him; of whom, he took a mo<U+017F>t

but it is perhaps, the little
Peril we <U+017F>hould thereby run, that
makes us <U+017F>o negligent of pur<U+017F>uing
it. The Truth is, dear Cou<U+017F>in,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Leon</hi> to him, with an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
altogether charming, I am
very far from running any <U+017F>uch
Danger; and hitherto, I find in
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o little Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to
Love, that it would require a
great deal of time to prepare me
for the lea<U+017F>t Sence of it. There
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43299:9"/>
needs no more, replyed <hi>Frederick</hi>
gallantly, than two Eyes, and
perhaps not <U+017F>o many Years, to
make you change your Stile. But
you, <U+017F>aid the Prince of <hi>Naples</hi>
once again, Do not you find
<U+017F>omething <U+017F>urprizing in what
they tell us of Love, whom they
de<U+017F>cribe to us as an Infant, and
however, would per<U+017F>uade us, that
he is a dreadful Enemy? I know
not what to think of it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to him, but perhaps we
<U+017F>hall find him more formidable
when we are le<U+017F>s childi<U+017F>h. It was
thus that tho<U+017F>e two lovely Princes
entertained them<U+017F>elves at the Age
of twelve Years. In the mean
while, Endeavours were u<U+017F>ed to
in<U+017F>pire <hi>Frederick</hi> with as much
Indifference as was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for
the Per<U+017F>onage he was to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent;
and more particularly, they
in<U+017F>inuated into him, that to reign
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43299:9"/>
peaceably upon his Throne, it
was requi<U+017F>ite he <U+017F>hould reign over
his own Heart. The King his
Father had taken Care to in<U+017F>truct
him betimes with the Rea<U+017F>ons of
his Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e; and had made him
promi<U+017F>e, that during his Life, and
that of <hi>Berranger,</hi> he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
di<U+017F>cover what he was, for the
depriving his Enemy of the Hopes
of <U+017F>ucceeding him in <hi>Sicily. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
embraced the<U+017F>e Sentiments,
and knew no other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion than
that of reigning. At length, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attained to the Age of <U+017F>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years, he was in<U+017F>tructed in
all the Exerci<U+017F>es that are in u<U+017F>e
with Men; wherein, he <U+017F>o excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that he <U+017F>eemed the mo<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hed
Prince of his Time.
His Stature, though tall for a
Woman, was middle <U+017F>eized for a
Man, but <U+017F>o full of Sweetne<U+017F>s, that
it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to forbear being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43299:10"/>
charmed with it. His Eyes were
black, <U+017F>parkling, and <U+017F>weet, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with a Flame, and an enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Langui<U+017F>hing: in <U+017F>hort, all
his Per<U+017F>on was compo<U+017F>ed after
<U+017F>uch a manner, as was capable of
in<U+017F>piring the mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible with
Affection. Having attained to that
Sea<U+017F>on wherein Love commits <U+017F>o
many Di<U+017F>orders, he began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
him<U+017F>elf more <U+017F>trictly, well
knowing, that if that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was
<U+017F>o much to be avoided by all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it was much more <U+017F>o for
him, who would be obliged to
keep very perplexing Mea<U+017F>ures
with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould have rendred
him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. He <U+017F>aw daily a
number of hand<U+017F>ome Princes, and
having examined him<U+017F>elf, he did
not yet find any Motions, which
he could be any ways apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
of. Be<U+017F>ides, he imagined that
his Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e <U+017F>heltring him from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43299:10"/>
the Gallantries of Lovers, would
likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ecure him again<U+017F>t the
Attempts of Love: but therein
he was mi<U+017F>taken in his Accounts.
He quickly perceived by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>ts
that his good Meen had
made, that a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
without the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Several Beauties <U+017F>ighed for
him in <U+017F>ecret, and <U+017F>ome, openly
enough to make them<U+017F>elves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood;
in<U+017F>omuch, that the
Crowd of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, he imagined, that his
be<U+017F>t Cour<U+017F>e would be to di<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Intrigue, by which means,
he would deprive them of their
Hopes, and by Con<U+017F>equence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the De<U+017F>igns they might have
upon his Heart. Be<U+017F>ides, being
per<U+017F>uaded that Gallantry is very
becoming a young Prince, he was
willing to affect a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, who<U+017F>e
Appearances could be no ways

would have di<U+017F>couraged all tho<U+017F>e

of their Family, which <U+017F>he had

her from entertaining any thing

<U+017F>he abandoned her <U+017F>elf to

know, that the E<U+017F>teem <U+017F>he had
for <hi>Frederick,</hi> was too particular
for to be only meer E<U+017F>teem; and

what ought to be concealed from

aro<U+017F>e to go to his Apartment, when
Prince <hi>Leon</hi> came into her's, with
De<U+017F>ign to prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s her in his

whom he fancyed to have ever
eluded, by be<U+017F>ieging her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
He found her <U+017F>o thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and <U+017F>o dejected, that he had
not the Power to <U+017F>peak to her;
and the<U+017F>e two unhappy Lovers,
remained in a Silence, that would
have melted with Pity all tho<U+017F>e

hardly take notice.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Amaldee</hi> diverted them

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43299:17"/>
deferred the Declaration
thereof, expecting a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Juncture.</p>
                  <p>But the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> being
alarmed and confu<U+017F>ed, to find I
know not what new Motions in
her Heart, which <U+017F>he could in no
wi<U+017F>e approve of, did all that was
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to render them <U+017F>ecret.
That young Prince<U+017F>s being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed
to feign what <U+017F>he had not
yet been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to conceal this real Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All the Court did quickly
ob<U+017F>erve this Change of her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
which was imputed, with
great Probability, to <hi>Yolanda</hi>'s
Ab<U+017F>ence; who, upon the Rumour
of <U+017F>o tender an Effect, was willing
to put an end to their mutual
langui<U+017F>hing, by re<U+017F>toring to him
her Sight, and enjoying his: the
Cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was, however, to <U+017F>teer
was pretty nice in the Conjuncture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43299:18"/>
of things. The Admiral's Lady,
whom <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Sadne<U+017F>s did put
very much out of Humor, was
more to be feared than ever; but
a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s does little value the
Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of a Mother in Law.
Be<U+017F>ides, a Friend <U+017F>he had at Court,
who had given her Notice of the
Condition the Prince was reduced
to, propo<U+017F>ed to her a <U+017F>ecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
between them, which it
was ea<U+017F>ie for her to procure:
whereupon, <U+017F>he returning to
Court, did heap up Troubles on
the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Frederick,</hi> who had
too many Misfortunes of his own,
for to be in a Condition to pity
tho<U+017F>e of others. The Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Sicily</hi> did ea<U+017F>ily perceive, that
notwith<U+017F>tanding the Complai<U+017F>ance
of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he had a terrible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ion
for all the Nation, and
which this Prince<U+017F>s did not fail to
apply to her <U+017F>elf in particular,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43299:18"/>
through the <U+017F>ingular Intere<U+017F>t <U+017F>he
took therein: though <U+017F>he looked
upon <hi>Camilla</hi> as her Rival, <U+017F>he
failed not to pay her Vi<U+017F>its very
often, that <U+017F>he might <U+017F>ee there her
Lover, who notwith<U+017F>tauding his
Indifference, appeared to her very
lovely. She came once thither
ju<U+017F>t as Prince <hi>Leon,</hi> in De<U+017F>pair of
having found <hi>Camilla</hi> <U+017F>o ill di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to hear him, was ri<U+017F>ing for

at the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who blu<U+017F>hed at the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
and <hi>Leon,</hi> out-raged to <U+017F>ee all
this Di<U+017F>order, re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay
there <U+017F>till, that he might ob<U+017F>erve
Motions that put him upon the
Rack. <hi>Amaldee</hi> alone had <U+017F>o <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
an Air, that the Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Sicily</hi> thought him the mo<U+017F>t hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of all men; and after a light
Cover<U+017F>ation, her Heart full of
Sighs, which <U+017F>he found difficult

to <U+017F>tifle, and her Eyes moi<U+017F>t with
Tears, which <U+017F>he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
contain, <U+017F>he went away, not
being able to <U+017F>upport the <U+017F>ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<U+017F>he made upon <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s
Happine<U+017F>s. But, the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
had other Sentiments of this
<U+017F>o precipitated Departure; and,
having well ob<U+017F>erved the Di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Frederick</hi> in the Pre<U+017F>ence
of her Brother, <U+017F>he imagined, and
applauded her <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ecret, for
being the Cau<U+017F>e of it. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
being left alone with his Si<U+017F>ter,
for <hi>Leon</hi> went away a Moment
after <hi>Frederick,</hi> propo<U+017F>ed to her

and told her, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
too long in an Enemies
Country, that it was requi<U+017F>ite they
<U+017F>hould be gone with the <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t,
and that too towards <hi>Barcelonna,</hi>
where Prince <hi>Ardalin</hi> impatiently
expected them. <hi>Camilla</hi> trembled

at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and putting all

for <U+017F>ome Time, that terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<U+017F>he made him con<U+017F>ent,
though with great Repugnance,
to all <U+017F>he had a Mind.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, he re<U+017F>olved
to di<U+017F>patch, privately, <U+017F>ome one
to the King his Father, for to

with his Si<U+017F>ter's Change of

in the Palace Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Immediately, he heard <U+017F>ome

Advance; your Vows are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

and there is no pretending to any
other than the Quality of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Lover, if a Man had a
mind to engage in <hi>Sicily. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
had too many Affairs in his
Mind to think of undeceiving
him; in<U+017F>omuch, that he replyed
with <U+017F>ome Sharpne<U+017F>s, As you did
not con<U+017F>ult me about the Choice
of your Engagement, I do not
think my <U+017F>elf obliged to give you

in a certain Scituation, wherein,

You ought to be upon your Guard,

Ah! it is too much interrupted,

                     <hi>Amaldee</hi> did but too well know
the Vivacity of this <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which his Si<U+017F>ter made, in
An<U+017F>wer to <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Ver<U+017F>es;
and Prince <hi>Leon</hi> imagined, that
<U+017F>he had made them at that very
In<U+017F>tant; <hi>Frederick</hi> alone, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
nothing of this My<U+017F>tery;

he was <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s,
that nothing but the
Cau<U+017F>e was capable of diverting it.
They approached him by little

having <U+017F>ome Indulgence for
his Si<U+017F>ter, whom he <U+017F>aw was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

willing to render her an Office

if he had known what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
in the Heart of <hi>Frederick;</hi> in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Camilla</hi> had immediately an

but he made but ill Returns,
and <U+017F>he maintained much better
the Character of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, than
he of a Gallant. His Eyes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> and pur<U+017F>ued him by

to draw the Prince of

                     <hi>Leon</hi> was ever
ca<U+017F>ting his Eyes towards <hi>Camilla,</hi>
who took little Notice of his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Actions: neither knew <U+017F>he
what to think of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
and was upon the Point
of preventing what he ought to
have <U+017F>aid to her, and encourage
by her Kindne<U+017F>s, that Lover whom
<U+017F>he could only accu<U+017F>e of too much
Circum<U+017F>pection. Her Haughtine<U+017F>s,
whereof Women have little when
they are in Love, would not have
been <U+017F>ufficient to have made her
keep Mea<U+017F>ures; <U+017F>he would have
<U+017F>poken, if Prince <hi>Leon</hi> had not
had too much Tenderne<U+017F>s for to
<U+017F>uffer hers to take it's Cour<U+017F>e. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become knowing in a <U+017F>hort
Time, he was ea<U+017F>ily inclined to
think that Love had a great <U+017F>hare
in their mute Conver<U+017F>ation; and
believing that he had but too long
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43299:25"/>
permitted his Rival to enjoy what
he imagined to merit, as much as
he, his Return was <U+017F>omething
precipitated. This Incivility did
not at all amaze <hi>Amaldee,</hi> but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
did <U+017F>ufficiently let him
know her Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, to hinder
him another Time from <U+017F>uch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Interruptions, if Lovers
can be ever more circum<U+017F>pect.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Frederick</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
at his being <U+017F>o happily freed
from <U+017F>o perplexed an Encounter,
yet he fell immediately into an
other of no le<U+017F>s Intricacy. <hi>Yolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
as we have already <U+017F>aid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concealed in <hi>Me<U+017F><U+017F>ina,</hi> gave
him notice that <U+017F>ame Evening of
her Arrival, conjuring him to
meet her in an Arbour, which her
Friend had judged proper for the
A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation. <hi>Frederick</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to go thither, and knowing
the Afflictions of an ill-rewarded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43299:25"/>
Affection, he was not willing to
be the Occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>uffering them.
Well, Prince, <U+017F>aid <hi>Yolanda</hi> to
him, at his coming, are not you
full of Acknowledgment for the
Sentiments I have ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of you, and of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
your Ab<U+017F>ence has given me.
<hi>Frederick</hi> by deceiving her agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
being willing to give a
Loo<U+017F>e to his own Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, made
An<U+017F>wer, Yes, my dear <hi>Yolanda,</hi>
I have been tormented <U+017F>ince your
Ab<U+017F>ence, by all the Cruelties of
Love; and I never knew what
Grief was, till after I had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Delight of <U+017F>eeing you.
He was going to continue, when
he heard at a little di<U+017F>tance the
mo<U+017F>t lamentable <U+017F>hriek that can
be. <hi>Camilla,</hi> whom her ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tiny
had conducted ju<U+017F>t to the
Place of the Rendevouz, which
was not far from her Apartment,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43299:26"/>
had heard the Prince<U+017F>s's Voice,
and di<U+017F>covered a Rival, at a time
when <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o tenderly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
with the <U+017F>ole <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
<U+017F>he was not able to <U+017F>upport
this Rever<U+017F>e, and fell into a <U+017F>woon
ju<U+017F>t at the place from whence the
Voice came: <hi>Frederick</hi> ran thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Yolanda</hi> withdrew, not
being in a condition to give help
to others, that might have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
her own Reputation, <U+017F>he
only gave notice to her Friend
of what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, who came
thither in all ha<U+017F>te, tho however
too late. <hi>Berranger</hi>'s Daughter
had received, without knowing
it, that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from the mo<U+017F>t
cruel of her Per<U+017F>ecutors; he took
Water from a Fountain that was
hard by, and having <U+017F>prinkled
<U+017F>ome of it upon her Face, he
made her ea<U+017F>ily come to her <U+017F>elf.
Perhaps that the Delight which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43299:26"/>
her heart, tho in de<U+017F>pair, felt at
the approaches of the Per<U+017F>on who
had rendred her <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
very much towards the
making her recover the U<U+017F>e of
her Sen<U+017F>es; <U+017F>he opened her Eyes,
and <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf in the hands
of a Per<U+017F>on who cau<U+017F>ed all her
trouble, Vexation <U+017F>eized her <U+017F>oul,
and following her fir<U+017F>t motion,
<U+017F>he withdrew <U+017F>omething rudely,
and got to her Apartment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
turning towards him, who
had newly rendred her that good
Office, Where Love is outraged,
it often takes every thing for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts.
In <U+017F>hort, the Prince<U+017F>s, of
<hi>Sicily</hi> being left alone, with her
Mind full of its own Di<U+017F>quiets,
<U+017F>he made but a Moments reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon all the<U+017F>e capricious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
which <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o did with
relation, that to her the like might
happen, What a Night did <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43299:27"/>
pa<U+017F>s! all the torments of
Jealou<U+017F>ie pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves to
her Imagination; and tho her
Choller had no Object to fix it
<U+017F>elf upon, <U+017F>he entertained a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
De<U+017F>igns, again<U+017F>t whom<U+017F>oever
it was that u<U+017F>urped from her that
Heart which <U+017F>he had thought her
<U+017F>elf in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of; then repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a <U+017F>udden, <U+017F>he felt all tho<U+017F>e
touching Motions that a generous
and an afflicted Soul can be <U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, How? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is my

ill rewarded for being produced
<U+017F>omething later than that, which
my Ungrateful is <U+017F>o fond of?
Mad that I am, added <U+017F>he, Shall
I di<U+017F>turb the Peace of two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whom Heaven had united
before I dream'd of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd?
No, let us leave them to
enjoy all tho<U+017F>e Delights which I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43299:27"/>
had vainly figured to my <U+017F>elf,
and let us not one moment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them through the compa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mi<U+017F>eries that I have drawn
upon my <U+017F>elf by having been too
credulous. All the<U+017F>e doleful
thoughts kept her company as
long as the Night continued;
Day appeared before that her
Mind could find a moment of
Repo<U+017F>e. <hi>Amaldee</hi> came, as he
often did, to <U+017F>ee her in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and he having been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
cau<U+017F>e of her Tears, at the
<U+017F>ight of him <U+017F>he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
redoubling them. Ah! why
have you <U+017F>educed me by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Appearance of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by the Prince of <hi>Sicily?</hi>
Why, by making me apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
of his Tenderne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>hould
you render it <U+017F>o dangerous to me?
Ah! continued <U+017F>he, <U+017F>eeing he
made no An<U+017F>wer, Why did you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43299:28"/>
not keep that Silence that would
have <U+017F>pared me <U+017F>o many Tears?
Why did you pronounce that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Word by it's enchanting Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s?
—Heaven is my Witne<U+017F>s,
interrupted <hi>Amaldee,</hi> that my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was to hinder you from
loving by—Alas! interrupted <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla,</hi>
ha<U+017F>tily, was that the way
to hinder me from loving, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me that I was beloved? Why
did you not rather tell me, as
was true, that he langui<U+017F>hes for
another? It would have made me
<U+017F>igh; but I <U+017F>hould at lea<U+017F>t have
avoided the mortal Troubles that
devour me. She thereupon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him all that <U+017F>he had hear'd,
exagerating the thing as much as
her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion could in<U+017F>pire her, and
endeavouring to exhale her Grief
in Reproaches, <U+017F>he was not able
to make an End. When Per<U+017F>ons
are <U+017F>omething recovered from their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43299:28"/>
fir<U+017F>t Tran<U+017F>ports, they aim at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eloquent, that they may at
lea<U+017F>t make others <U+017F>hare with them
in their Misfortunes. But <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
judging that <U+017F>he wanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
left it her in <U+017F>ome kind,
by leaving her Chamber, for <U+017F>he
remained as motion-le<U+017F>s after his
departure, and found her <U+017F>elf in
that condition wherein we have
already repre<U+017F>ented the Prince<U+017F>s
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who by lying under
the heavie<U+017F>t Oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, enjoyed
<U+017F>ome kind of Tranquillity, and
<U+017F>ome time after <U+017F>he fell very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerou<U+017F>ly
ill.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi>
having got <U+017F>ome intelligence
of his Bride's being ca<U+017F>t away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he came
thither <hi>incognito</hi> to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
of the truth. The Shipwrack
of his Mi<U+017F>tris had <U+017F>o dejected and
penetrated him with <U+017F>o lively a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43299:29"/>
grief, that he was not to be
known. The fir<U+017F>t Object that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it <U+017F>elf to his Eyes was <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
who was thinking of the
means to free his Si<U+017F>ter out of
the Aby<U+017F>s of De<U+017F>pair wherein he
<U+017F>aw her plunged. The Prince of
<hi>Majorca</hi> was at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>urprized to
<U+017F>ee <hi>Ardalin</hi> in the Territories of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and was hardly able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
from it, by rea<U+017F>on of the
change that Affliction had wrought
in his Countenance, in<U+017F>omuch
that he only an<U+017F>wered with a
<U+017F>igh, when <hi>Ardalin</hi> made enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after <hi>Camilla.</hi> This <U+017F>igh co<U+017F>t
the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna</hi> many
more. He no longer doubted, but
that his Prince<U+017F>s had been <U+017F>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Waves, and
being pierced to the quick by <U+017F>o
fatal a Thought; Speak, <U+017F>aid he,
Prince, <U+017F>peak, and no longer
conceal from me a lo<U+017F>s which I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43299:29"/>
ought not to <U+017F>urvive. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
knowing that an Infidelity is the
mo<U+017F>t afflicting thing that can be
told a Lover, was in no ha<U+017F>te to
undeceive him; but being at
length pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to make An<U+017F>wer,
<U+017F>he lives, <U+017F>aid he to him, but ask
me nothing more concerning her,
and would to Heaven you may
never be informed of the re<U+017F>t.
The<U+017F>e Words, though the latter
part of them were capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
terrible Su<U+017F>picions, failed
not to calm the Soul of <hi>Ardalin;</hi>
and not penetrating the Motive
of that Sadne<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended his
own, upon learning that he <U+017F>hould
again <U+017F>ee <hi>Camilla;</hi> and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from the Fright he had
been in for her Life, all the re<U+017F>t
<U+017F>eemed <U+017F>weet and ea<U+017F>ie. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
acquainted him in few Words,
with all that had happened to
them, except what he ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43299:30"/>
to have known. He gave him
notice not to di<U+017F>cover them, and
as for him<U+017F>elf, having but a <U+017F>mall
Train, he would hardly be known
for the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna.</hi> They
came at length, to the Palace
where the whole Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was
of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Sickne<U+017F>s: That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
after having been brought
out of a Lethargy, had made <U+017F>uch
powerful Efforts to cure her
Heart, that her Body had fallen
under the weight of them. She
was taken with <U+017F>o violent a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that from the Beginning, they
were apprehen<U+017F>ive of the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue:
However, <hi>Ardalin</hi> went with
<hi>Amaldee</hi> to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Apartment.
How great was the A<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment
of the Prince<U+017F>s, at that unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sight! The Remor<U+017F>e of having
neglected a Hu<U+017F>band who left all
to come and <U+017F>eek her, the Shame
of having betrayed him for a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43299:30"/>
Per<U+017F>on, who triumphed, perhaps,
in her Sufferings, and may be
boa<U+017F>ted of them to her Rival, put
her into a <U+017F>trange Confu<U+017F>ion. As
<hi>Amaldee</hi> would have prepared her
for <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Arrival, whom <U+017F>he
had but too well known, <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
him; and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing

From whence come you,

Health: his Pre<U+017F>ence, which at

was plea<U+017F>ing in this Occa<U+017F>ion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43299:31"/>
<U+017F>ince it interrupted a Conver<U+017F>ation

gave her Brother to under<U+017F>tand

for a Favour to be left alone;
which Prince <hi>Leon</hi> comprehending,

the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> who
without knowing all his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
had however enough to
put an end to his Days. <hi>Leon</hi>
was no le<U+017F>s to be pityed than <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin;
Camilla,</hi> during the time
her Fever la<U+017F>ted, could hardly

him<U+017F>elf of the Condition <U+017F>he

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43299:31"/>
that <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Ab<U+017F>ence
being as dangerous a Misfortune
as all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he already lay under,
it brought her almo<U+017F>t to the la<U+017F>t
Ga<U+017F>p. The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
likewi<U+017F>e langui<U+017F>hing, by Rea<U+017F>on
of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Affliction, in whom
<U+017F>he could not <U+017F>uffer that Sadne<U+017F>s
for any other than her <U+017F>elf. In
<U+017F>hort, there was nothing but
Lamentation in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and one
would have <U+017F>aid, that Love reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

But <hi>Camilla</hi> was yet much
more to be pityed, the frequent
fainting Fits that her too much
oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Heart did bring her in,
made her imagine, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
quickly find a favourable Death.</p>
                  <p>One day, after coming out of
a cold Sweat, which <U+017F>he believed
the Fore-runner of her End, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>ent for her Brother, and her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and having made them <U+017F>it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43299:32"/>
on her Bed-<U+017F>ide, Prince, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
looking upon <hi>Ardalin,</hi> it is no
longer time to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e any thing,
I will <U+017F>pare you the Regret that
you would have for the Lo<U+017F>s of
me, by defacing my <U+017F>elf out of
your Memory, too happy! if the
Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of my Weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es do
not render it odious to you. I am
no longer that <U+017F>evere <hi>Camilla</hi> who
made a Scruple of proceeding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than E<U+017F>teem for a Prince,
who was to have been her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
I have felt the mo<U+017F>t lively
Sentiments of Love, if I may <U+017F>o
<U+017F>ay, for an other than your <U+017F>elf,
but Care has been taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
you on my Ingratitude, by
having my Affection de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed.
Farewel, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, forget
me if you can, and pardon me
my Errors. I pardon you them,
Divine Prince<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ardalin,</hi> I
know the Fatality of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43299:32"/>
which forces us to love, but
I cannot pardon my <U+017F>elf for not
having known how to gain your
Affection; my Heart is without
doubt, irritated, to find that you
refu<U+017F>e it that Tenderne<U+017F>s which
you are capable of; but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
my <U+017F>elf, and I alone ought
to expiate the Crime of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been able to plea<U+017F>e you. At
this <U+017F>ad Thought he fainted away,
and lo<U+017F>t with all his Sen<U+017F>es, that
of the Infidelity of his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s;
but they brought him to him<U+017F>elf
by the help of Remedies, which
made him enjoy <U+017F>till, for <U+017F>ome
Moments, all the Malignity of his
Fate, The Alarums he had had
for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Life, whom he had
believed to have been <U+017F>wallowed
up by the Waves, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of her Change, penetrated
him with <U+017F>o lively a Grief, that it
is no Wonder, if he fell under the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43299:33"/>
weight of it in that <U+017F>o fatal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Violence of the
Motions of his Soul was <U+017F>o great,
that the Wound he had received
did re-open in that In<U+017F>tant: he
did not perceive that his Spirits
di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated; and indeed, he was
wounded in a more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible part.
Ah! Prince<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he to her, I am
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that your Indifference
does abridge a Life that I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to you, and which has not
been <U+017F>o happy as to plea<U+017F>e you:
I dye; and may it plea<U+017F>e the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of Love to content it <U+017F>elf with
my Life, and not extend it's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the Days of <U+017F>o beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
a Prince<U+017F>s. It is <U+017F>ufficient,
that I <U+017F>acrifice mine to it, which
was wholly yours; but let at lea<U+017F>t,
my la<U+017F>t Sigh draw <U+017F>ome from you,
at lea<U+017F>t, let them be out of Pity,
and do not refu<U+017F>e them to a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
who ready to expire, out of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43299:33"/>
Tenderne<U+017F>s, demands of you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
el<U+017F>e: after he had <U+017F>poken
the<U+017F>e Words, a mortal Langui<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed him; his Eyes fixed
upon <hi>Camilla,</hi> <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>till, by
their dying Looks, all the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
imaginable, and cau<U+017F>ed a
Torrent of Tears to gu<U+017F>h out
from tho<U+017F>e of that de<U+017F>olate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s.
<hi>Amaldee<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                     </hi> endeavoured to
<U+017F>uccour <hi>Ardalin,</hi> and to recal his
Spirits which had entirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him. The Rumour of all
that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed was quickly <U+017F>pread
about; one of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es
Maids could not forbear blaming
<hi>Frederick</hi> openly; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
came thither as well as others,
and mixing his particular Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with tho<U+017F>e of the publick,
he was willing to try, if he could
at the <U+017F>ame Time change the Face
of things. <hi>Camilla</hi> <U+017F>eeing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <U+017F>o many Mi<U+017F>eries, was not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43299:34"/>
able to <U+017F>upport the Sight of him,
and turned her <U+017F>elf on the other
<U+017F>ide. <hi>Frederick</hi> ob<U+017F>erving that
Action, came and ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at
her Feet, and following his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Propen<U+017F>ity, made her remark
<U+017F>o much Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in his Eyes, that
<hi>Camilla,</hi> notwith<U+017F>tanding her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
did quickly perceive it.
What would you have, Prince,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him with a low Voice?
Ah! Madam, how late is it to
declare my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>aid the tender
<hi>Frederick</hi> to her; I love, but alas!
I could never have re<U+017F>olved to
have let you know it till this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
Ah! Prince, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
him, do not con<U+017F>train your <U+017F>elf;
the too certain Knowledge I have
of the Sentiments you have for an
other, has brought me into this
Condition; but I lo<U+017F>e it with my
Life. Ah! Madam, cryed <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
I atte<U+017F>t Heaven, that I have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43299:34"/>
no Sentiments prejudicial to what
I owe you, and you will one day
<U+017F>ee that I am only unhappy. The<U+017F>e
Words, which <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily in<U+017F>inuated
them<U+017F>elves into her Soul, made her
<U+017F>igh; and thinking of what <U+017F>he
owed the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi>
withdraw, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, with
<U+017F>ome Difficulty, withdraw, and
leave me to die le<U+017F>s criminal, if
I cannot die altogether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, <hi>Ardalin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come again to him<U+017F>elf, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a new Vigour from the Sight
of the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whom he
then knew for his Rival, he u<U+017F>ed
all his Efforts to <U+017F>peak, but not
being able to do <U+017F>o, he melted
the Hearts of all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw
him. His Ga<U+017F>pings re-doubling,
the Company perceived that he
was ready to breath his la<U+017F>t; and
having made them comprehend by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43299:35"/>
mo<U+017F>t moving Demon<U+017F>trations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
that he had a De<U+017F>ire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Prince<U+017F>s, they brought
him to her Bed-<U+017F>ide: whereupon,
his Forces returned to him when
he was upon the Point of lo<U+017F>ing
them for ever; and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> live,
<U+017F>aid he to them, happy Lovers, <U+017F>o
beautiful a Prince<U+017F>s could only be
born for <U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>hed a Prince.
I am not at all a<U+017F>hamed to yield
to a Rival, who excells me by <U+017F>o
many Advantages, and whom I
can only <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s by my Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
At the<U+017F>e Words, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
his Mouth upon <hi>Camilla</hi>'s
Hands, he <U+017F>eemed in<U+017F>eparable
from that afflicted Per<U+017F>on, and
his Soul being detained by that
Plea<U+017F>ure, had all the Difficulty
imaginable to fly away. Thus
Love terminated the Days of a
Prince, who by the Greatne<U+017F>s of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43299:35"/>
his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion ought to have been
re<U+017F>erved for a better De<U+017F>tiny: So
<U+017F>ad a Spectacle put all the A<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tants
into a Con<U+017F>ternation, and
their gloomy Silence was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by the lamentable Cries
of <hi>Camilla;</hi> they cau<U+017F>ed his Corps
to be removed, who occa<U+017F>ioned
all this Sadne<U+017F>s: he <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>till
animated by his Love and his
greedy Looks, which appeared
not altogether extingui<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if they could never be <U+017F>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with <U+017F>eeing what he had <U+017F>o
much loved.</p>
                  <p>During all this Confu<U+017F>ion, they
had forgot to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble; <hi>Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s
Attendants Train di<U+017F>covered
him by their Regrets for the
Prince of <hi>Barcelonna;</hi> and <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> were likewi<U+017F>e
known to be the Children of
King <hi>Berranger,</hi> though they did
not expect to be di<U+017F>covered. They
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43299:36"/>
could not have cho<U+017F>en a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Moment; for, Peoples
Minds were altogether di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed
to Pity, there was no Room for
Hatred: and the King continued
to them the <U+017F>ame Kindne<U+017F>s he had
already afforded them, as he only
con<U+017F>idered them by them<U+017F>elves;
he did not change the Sentiments
he had of them, though they had
changed their Names as to him.
But, the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
over-joyed to hear that <hi>Amaldee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> were only Brother
and Si<U+017F>ter, and filling her Soul
with the <U+017F>oft Motions which <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the place of the cruel
Su<U+017F>picions that had agitated her,
her Tenderne<U+017F>s was thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderably
augmented. If <U+017F>he found
in him the Son of <hi>Menfroy</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a Prince for whom <U+017F>he was
forced to that <U+017F>o <U+017F>ingular Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e,
in <U+017F>hort, one who ought never to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43299:36"/>
wear the Crown of <hi>Sicily,</hi> <U+017F>he
found in Recompence, a Prince
full of Charms, a Prince who
might be engaged in her Favour;
<U+017F>he no longer found a Rival; and
that Ob<U+017F>tacle being removed, did
<U+017F>ufficiently make amends for all
that might be contrary to her:
Thus being in Repo<U+017F>e, as to her
Lover, <U+017F>he was no longer di<U+017F>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
about obtaining him for
her Husband. <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Body
was <U+017F>ent back to <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> with
all the Magnificence that became
him and <hi>Menfroy:</hi> And a Poet
made his Epitaph; which is as
follows.</p>
                  <l>Within this Tomb Fidelity is laid,</l>
                  <l>With the kind Lover who Nature's
Debt hath paid;</l>
                  <l>Henceforth, like him few Lovers
will be <U+017F>een,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:43299:37"/>
And, in my mind, Heaven has too
cruel been,</l>
                  <l>Who dy'd for Love, de<U+017F>erv'd here
to have <U+017F>tai'd.</l>
                  <p>Nothing could recover <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi>
and though Remedies had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
her Fever, yet her Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was as bad as all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es.
<hi>Leon</hi> having been Witne<U+017F>s of all
that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between <hi>Camilla</hi>
and <hi>Frederick,</hi> all the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances
he receiv'd from this Prince were
not capable of <U+017F>atisfying him. He
could in no wi<U+017F>e comprehend
the important My<U+017F>tery he was to
expect the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of. Be<U+017F>ides, this
Prince<U+017F>s was in love with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was <U+017F>ufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of all Repo<U+017F>e. <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
who<U+017F>e Heart was free from any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
was continually repa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
in his memory the Events
that had newly happened. All
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43299:37"/>
his mind was full of the <U+017F>hade of
<hi>Ardalin,</hi> and all his Actions
<U+017F>hew'd him very Melancholy. As
he often did walk all alone, the
Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> did the <U+017F>ame
through another motive, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they often met, but
never joyned company; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s's
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion rendring her fearful,
made her avoid the Per<U+017F>on whom
her Heart <U+017F>ought with too much
eagerne<U+017F>s, and he either took no
notice of it, or was not very
earne<U+017F>t to ask her the rea<U+017F>on.
However, one day, as <hi>Frederick</hi>
was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by him, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to <U+017F>ee him; Lovers are
very <U+017F>alvage, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him
laughing, and I think my <U+017F>elf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happy in having my heart of
a more obdurate temper than
yours; after what I know of
Love, I would not for any thing
make the Experience of it, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43299:38"/>
will neglect, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
tho<U+017F>e Beauties who excite <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
an application; and <U+017F>ince we
ought to <U+017F>acrifice all our thoughts
to what we love, I am re<U+017F>olved
never to love any thing. The
Prince<U+017F>s, who was <U+017F>trangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, made
him however an an<U+017F>wer with
<U+017F>omething a <U+017F>cornful tone; Well,
keep to that indifference you find
<U+017F>o very charming. She had not
the power to <U+017F>ay any thing more,
but went away very much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed.
And <hi>Amaldee</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
depart after that manner,
was <U+017F>omething di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied; and,
not believing he had offended
him, he made Reflection upon all
his re<U+017F>erved and unhand<U+017F>ome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
and found in his way of
living with him, <U+017F>omething very
particular, which he could only
take for the Effect of <U+017F>ome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43299:38"/>
Antipathy. He admired how
a Per<U+017F>on could love the Si<U+017F>ter,
who<U+017F>e Brother he <U+017F>o much hated,
but re<U+017F>olved, however, to <U+017F>erve
him both in his Hatred and
his Amour. He wrote to the
King his Father, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to melt him by the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
that had been done them, he
propo<U+017F>ed to him a Match between
<hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Frederick,</hi> <U+017F>aying,
that it <U+017F>eemed as if Heaven had
already a<U+017F><U+017F>embled their Hearts for
the uniting their Families for ever,
and adding, that <hi>Menfroy</hi> would
not oppo<U+017F>e it; that the Kindne<U+017F>s
he had for his Son, would make
him pa<U+017F>s over all manner of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts;
that this King was of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Nature; and that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he would make the lea<U+017F>t Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards an Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a Peace would quickly be
concluded. This Letter had not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43299:39"/>
all the Succe<U+017F>s it ought to have
had, as will be made appear in
the Sequel.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Amaldee</hi> not
being capable of hating <hi>Frederick,</hi>
avoided him however, for fear
his Pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>hould prove trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>ome.
Some Days after the
Conver<U+017F>ation that had <U+017F>eparated
them, they met in <U+017F>uch another
Conjuncture; it was nice, <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
<U+017F>tept back, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
<U+017F>ighed to <U+017F>ee that <hi>Amaldee</hi> retired
fir<U+017F>t; a Sigh is not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
<hi>I hate you;</hi> however, that
Sigh made the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi>
think <U+017F>o: But, <hi>Frederick</hi> in his
Turn, could not comprehend the
Cau<U+017F>e why he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>hun his
Company; thus they were both
deceived by very contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons.
If <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Indifference
made him take for Hatred what
was nothing le<U+017F>s, the Tenderne<U+017F>s
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43299:39"/>
of the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily
believed what <U+017F>he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made her likewi<U+017F>e take for
Contempt, what was very far from
it; for, though <U+017F>he did not appear
under the Figure of a Lover, that
did not hinder her from being <U+017F>o;
and if Neglect ought not to have
directly offended her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yet
<U+017F>he failed not to be wounded by
the Effects, which the Intention
did not <U+017F>ufficiently ju<U+017F>tifie with
her. Alas! <U+017F>aid that Prince<U+017F>s,
Why does he not find him<U+017F>elf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to love me, though his Rea<U+017F>on
does oppo<U+017F>e it? I find, I love him
without the Con<U+017F>ent of mine; but
he is far from being under <U+017F>uch
Circum<U+017F>tances; Why has not he
more penetrating Eyes, and why
cannot he di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the Heart
of a Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s under the Figure of
a Lover? The langui<U+017F>hing of my
Eyes, ought, methinks, to have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43299:40"/>
unravelled to him this Mi<U+017F>tery, but
his were not willing to <U+017F>ee it, or
if they did, they have de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed
the Di<U+017F>covery. The Figure of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
is it <U+017F>o contemptible, that
it has not yet been capable of
making a Friend of <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
<U+017F>ince the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> dares
not make him her Lover? And
not daring to entertain any hopes
for her <U+017F>elf, mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>he needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ome Re<U+017F>pects for
<hi>Frederick,</hi> whom <hi>Amaldee</hi> takes
<U+017F>o much care to avoid. As Love
is addicted to making Ver<U+017F>es, and
that Poetry entertains and charms
our Amorous Thoughts, <U+017F>he fell
to making an Elegy, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion'd
many other Di<U+017F>orders.
The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Majorca</hi> began to
leave her Chamber, and <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who through the Conformity of
their De<U+017F>tiny, and the re<U+017F>emblance
<U+017F>he had with <hi>Amaldee,</hi> afforded

her; Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,
your di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ting Haughtine<U+017F>s for
any other Lover, gives you a
Prince wearied with Sighs; but
have a Care, if I am not deceived,
your Ladi<U+017F>hip will not long main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Character; for, I have
ob<U+017F>erved in your fir<U+017F>t Motions,
<U+017F>omething <U+017F>o far from Cruelty,
that if the Sequel be an<U+017F>werable
to this Beginning, I am very much
afraid, that that Severity, which
you have had during <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43299:45"/>
Indifference, will end with it:
However, follow my Coun<U+017F>el,
continue your Severity, if you are
de<U+017F>irous that a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould la<U+017F>t
which it has produced. You are
in the right, <U+017F>aid the Admiral's
Lady to her, ri<U+017F>ing to be gone:
The Prince<U+017F>s was <U+017F>tung to the
Quick, both at the An<U+017F>wer, and
her uncivil Departure. They all
retired thereupon, every one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oning
after their own manner,
upon the capricious Choice of
<hi>Frederick. Yolanda</hi> was quickly
informed hereof, by the means of
her Friend; and, by the order
<U+017F>he had to return to Court, her
Mother-in-Law having made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Elegy, found
that it admirably well <U+017F>uted with
her Circum<U+017F>tances. The little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<U+017F>he had had for a Prince her
Lover, could only pa<U+017F>s with her
for Contempts; <U+017F>o much Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43299:45"/>
on his part, could only be
for a Woman, who had too much
out-raged him to love her without
Shame; and what confirmed this,
was the Name of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> which
the Prince<U+017F>s dur<U+017F>t not write at
length; which being very like
her own, (<U+017F>he being called <hi>Amedee)</hi>
did fully confirm her in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Any other than one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
would never have unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
that trembling and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Character; but, what does
not Love do when it goes about
it? In<U+017F>omuch, that being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured
of that Heart which <hi>Yolanda</hi> had
vainly imagined that <U+017F>he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
<U+017F>he was very willing to have her
for a Witne<U+017F>s of her Happine<U+017F>s.
The Vexation of a Rival is a great
Satisfaction to a Lover, who tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
with great Delight, over
one <U+017F>he had had any Apprehen<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of. What a Di<U+017F>appointment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43299:46"/>
to <hi>Yolanda,</hi> to return to Court
for the Infidelity of a Prince, when
her too great Facility had drove
her from thence; but <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t
obey, which <U+017F>he the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did, that <U+017F>he might clear a Su<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
that could hardly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Mind. She thought her
Mother-in-Law very unfit to u<U+017F>urp
a Heart which <hi>Camilla</hi> had not
been able to make a Conque<U+017F>t of;
for, her Friend had heard one <U+017F>ay,
that <hi>Frederick</hi> had a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that
<hi>Camilla</hi> was not the Per<U+017F>on whom
he mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately loved; but,
that there was another, for whom
he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>igh as long as he lived.
<hi>Yolanda</hi> had <U+017F>ome Rea<U+017F>on to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Con<U+017F>tancy of the Prince
herein, being deceived by the
Relation that the<U+017F>e Words had,
with the good Opinion <U+017F>he had
of her <U+017F>elf touching <hi>Frederick.</hi> In
<U+017F>hort, being returned to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43299:46"/>
<U+017F>he found her di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
of that <U+017F>evere and <U+017F>alvage
Air, which Women quickly lay
a<U+017F>ide, when they have a Lover
who plea<U+017F>es them; <U+017F>he took upon
her the Air gallant, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ecret, with having
lo<U+017F>t by her little Under<U+017F>tanding in
Love, tho<U+017F>e Moments which <U+017F>he
might have <U+017F>pent with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
had <U+017F>he known <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
Inclination; <U+017F>he had a Mind to
recall them, and was contriving
how to embolden him whom <U+017F>he
had rendred fearful by her too
great Severity, and thought good
to open the way her <U+017F>elf to his
Pur<U+017F>uit. Knowing that he often
walked all alone, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>igned
to meet him in his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, which
<U+017F>he accordingly performed, the
<U+017F>ame Day. <hi>Frederick</hi> had <U+017F>tol'n
from the Crowd, and leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of his Hands, let <U+017F>ome
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43299:47"/>
Tears tricle down his Cheeks,
which the amorous <hi>Sicilian</hi>
thought worthy of her Pity; <U+017F>he
approached him <U+017F>oftly, and told
him, blu<U+017F>hing, alas! Prince, is
there no way to put an end to
Sufferings<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which afflict all the
Court; Joy dares no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
there, <U+017F>ince you have bani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it from your <U+017F>elf: All our
Ladies are penetrated with the
Langui<U+017F>hing which oppre<U+017F><U+017F>es
their Prince. That Langui<U+017F>hing,
an<U+017F>wered he <U+017F>omething indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
ought not in any wi<U+017F>e
to concern all the Ladies you
reproach me with, <U+017F>ince the only
Per<U+017F>on whom it ought to move
with Pity,—Proceed Prince,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <U+017F>eeing that he
<U+017F>topped there; I very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand,
that <U+017F>ome too <U+017F>evere
fair one does make you, fearful
of ill Succe<U+017F>s<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43299:47"/>

But, Why do not you
<U+017F>peak? There is not a Beauty
how haughty <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he may be,
but would willingly <U+017F>hare with
you in all the Sentiments you
entertain of her. But, <hi>Frederick</hi>
made her no Reply, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
returned <U+017F>everal Times to the
Charge, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he made no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s,
and <hi>Frederick</hi> irritating
her by his too great Re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he quitted him with <U+017F>ome kind

                  <p>IN the mean time, the Truce
was upon the point of being
at an end, <hi>Berranger</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
very ill the Propo<U+017F>itions of
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> and the Commendations
he had given of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to return home with

of <hi>Majorca</hi> ought to <U+017F>peak like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43299:50"/>
the Son of the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
This Prince, well fore-<U+017F>eeing after
what manner he <U+017F>hould be treated
by his Father, would not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be di<U+017F>obedient, and be<U+017F>eech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Menfroy</hi> to give him the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to leave his Dominions, which
was granted him, with the <U+017F>ame
facility that he was <U+017F>uffered to
come into them. They embraced
very affectionately, being charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with one another's Virtue<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
From thence <hi>Amaldee</hi> went to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s
Apartment, being to take
his leave of him; tho he had <U+017F>ent
to inquire, if his Vi<U+017F>it would not
prove importunate, and that he
was prepared to receive it, yet
he was however di<U+017F>ordered at his
arrival. Be plea<U+017F>ed to give me
leave, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you Thanks for all Your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
which I have very well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed,
notwith<U+017F>tanding what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43299:50"/>
a Sentiment of Hatred may in<U+017F>pire
you with again<U+017F>t a Prince, whom
his misfortune has borne your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
At the<U+017F>e words the Prince<U+017F>s
was extremely troubled; <U+017F>he
would have <U+017F>tifled <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ighs, but
that <U+017F>he found impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and
her Confu<U+017F>ion was thereby <U+017F>o
much the more augmented. <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
not knowing what to think of
this, asked her the cau<U+017F>e of her
Di<U+017F>order; this put her quite out
of Countenance, and though the
Habit<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>he wore did <U+017F>ecure her
from the <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions that might
have been had of the truth, it
was <U+017F>ufficient to be culpable in
her <U+017F>elf, to believe <U+017F>he appeared
<U+017F>o to others. For though <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>ome thoughts of unbo<U+017F>oming her
<U+017F>elf, that De<U+017F>ign did not continue
long, and her Severity did hinder
her from putting it in execution.
Leave me, Prince, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he <U+017F>adly to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43299:51"/>
him, and, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to what you <U+017F>ee. This was
certainly a great Mi<U+017F>tery to him,
and he went and related to his
Si<U+017F>ter all that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between
them. She thought <U+017F>he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it better than he did,
and imagined that it might be the
Remor<U+017F>e of having betrayed the
Si<U+017F>ter, who<U+017F>e Brother treated him
with that Civility, and that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
without doubt would follow
it. This was <U+017F>ufficient to overturn
all that had been projected again<U+017F>t
him, and thereupon <U+017F>he wrote him
a Letter, that might do more than
re-a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him. The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
received it, after having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
terrible Conflicts, having
accu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf of weakne<U+017F>s in
not having known how to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Prince of the aver<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>he was in no wi<U+017F>e capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of him, for this was what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43299:51"/>
<U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t apprehended he would
believe. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a
Per<U+017F>on in Love to leave the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beloved in a Belief of being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
She had judged very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her fir<U+017F>t Motion, that he would
know nothing more; and re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
at all Adventures, to remove
the Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of what might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s
him again<U+017F>t her, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to what he might perhaps
one day know of the Cour<U+017F>e of
her Inclinations. Remaining fix'd
in this De<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>he enjoyed <U+017F>ome
Repo<U+017F>e, and read the Letter that
was brought her from <hi>Camilla,</hi>
which was conceived in the<U+017F>e
Terms.</p>

keep up their Re<U+017F>entments, when
they have once lo<U+017F>t their Hearts;
and <U+017F>ince you have made a Conque<U+017F>t

have not been able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t either
your feigned Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or your real
Neglect. I ought, at lea<U+017F>t, to have

notwith<U+017F>tanding I have found <U+017F>uch

not; you may do either, without
making me change my Sentiments:
But, will you mi<U+017F>u<U+017F>e this Power?
And will you leave a Prince<U+017F>s to
love alone, when you would find it
very delightful to love reciprocally?
But, I mu<U+017F>t explain my <U+017F>elf further
with you; to which Purpo<U+017F>e, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire

                        <p>IT is in vain that Endeavours are
u<U+017F>ed to alarum me about your
Con<U+017F>tancy; my Heart tells me that
you are faithful, which is <U+017F>ufficient
to per<U+017F>uade me you are <U+017F>o; I judge
of yours by my own: Our Hearts
were ingaged in one Moment, and
ought never to be di<U+017F>ingaged, but at
the <U+017F>ame time. Mine is faithful to
You, Prince, and cannot be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
per<U+017F>ons than yours, which is
enough to make me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> warrant, that
yours is wholly mine: neither is it
to clear any Su<U+017F>picion, that I de<U+017F>ire
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43299:54"/>
you to meet me in the grat Alley
near the <hi>Oval,</hi> it is only to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
you, that you have never yet given
me any Jealou<U+017F>ie. All that I hereby
aim, is only that we may mingle our
Sighs. Alas! we have <U+017F>ighed <U+017F>o long
a part, that it is fit we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>igh
for one Moment together.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi> did very much <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that this Letter came from
<hi>Yolanda;</hi> he imagined that De<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conducted him to the unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <U+017F>o many Adventures; he
fancyed that the<U+017F>e three Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es
meeting at the <U+017F>ame Randezvouz,
would free him by an Appearance
of Treachery, from all the real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
they had plyed him
with: In<U+017F>omuch, that de<U+017F>cending
into the Alley, he had hardly the
Lei<U+017F>ure to walk there a Moment,
before he <U+017F>aw them all three a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
He thought it <U+017F>trange to
<U+017F>ee them together: but the thing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43299:54"/>
happened in this manner; <hi>Yolanda</hi>
having placed her <U+017F>elf at a Window
which looked out upon the way
that was to be taken to go to the
Alley, waited therefor <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
Arrival; and having <U+017F>een him pa<U+017F>s,
and immediately after him, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who walking with trembling
Steps, took the <U+017F>ame way; <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to prevent her enjoying a
Conver<U+017F>ation with <hi>Frederick,</hi>
which <U+017F>he had been too long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
it to leave it to others:
<U+017F>he run thither with <U+017F>uch an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s,
that it was taken notice
of by her Mother-in-Law, who
had too great an Intere<U+017F>t in her
Conduct not to follow her. Where
are you going, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her?
I <U+017F>ee a certain Emotion in your
Countenance, that would make
me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that <U+017F>ome amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
had brought you hither, if
I knew not that after the Princes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43299:55"/>
<U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h Infidelity, you could not
be capable of a new Engagement.
And I, Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, with
a malicious Smile, I <U+017F>hould believe
that you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected me through <U+017F>ome
intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed Motion, if I <U+017F>aw not the
Prince<U+017F>s, whom you have more
Rea<U+017F>on to fear than me. At that
Word, all Reply cea<U+017F>ed, and they
walked in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly after <hi>Camilla,</hi>
whom they overtook before <U+017F>he
had entred the Alley; in<U+017F>omuch
that being all three animated with
the <U+017F>ame Spirit of Jealou<U+017F>ie, they
returned into an other, and never
parted till they had <U+017F>een the Prince,
who, weary with waiting for them,
was gone, after he had <U+017F>een them
take another way, and thought
his Intrigues at an end, without
him<U+017F>elf being any ways concerned.
He fancyed, that their haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
had hindred them from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
either's Rival the lea<U+017F>t Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43299:55"/>
of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting their De<U+017F>ign
or that the Severity of <hi>Amedee</hi>
who<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had not yet taken
notice of, had re<U+017F>trained them; in
<U+017F>hort, not knowing to whom he
was indebted for his good Luck,
he re<U+017F>olved to take Advantage of
it, and never to be with them alone,
but even to avoid the Companies
of all Women, that he might not
be troubled with any more of
their amorous Importunities: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he was mi<U+017F>taken in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
as tho<U+017F>e three Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es
had been in thinking to deceive
each other. As each of them had
pretended not to have <U+017F>een the
Prince, they all imagined in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that the Randezvouz had
been only for them; and all of
them applauding <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and their Addre<U+017F>s in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they thought thereof,
<U+017F>o that there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed a very gallant
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43299:56"/>
Conver<U+017F>ation between them, and
they parted with great Civilities.
<hi>Camilla</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t pen<U+017F>ive, as
indeed <U+017F>he had the mo<U+017F>t Rea<U+017F>on
to be <U+017F>o; and that Occa<U+017F>ion being
lo<U+017F>t, was hardly to be recovered.
Her Brother was to depart the
next day, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t either go with
him, or expo<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Rage, or to the Slights of
her Lover, which was le<U+017F>s ea<U+017F>ie
for her to <U+017F>upport. But, Love
<U+017F>till wrought in her Favour; for,
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as we have
<U+017F>aid, who was willing to repair all
the Incivilities <U+017F>he had done to
him whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>o tenderly loved,
went to take her Leave of him;
but <U+017F>he ea<U+017F>ily perceived, by the
Trouble <U+017F>he was in at her fir<U+017F>t co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into his Pre<U+017F>ence, that it
would be difficult for her to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the De<U+017F>igns <U+017F>he had laid in
his Ab<U+017F>ence. The fir<U+017F>t Civilities
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43299:56"/>
being over, which <U+017F>he acquitted
her<U+017F>elf of, with Gallantry enough,
<U+017F>he was to proceed to <U+017F>omething
of more Concern, which perhaps
<U+017F>he would have but very ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
<U+017F>he already trembled, the
Fear of <U+017F>aying too much or too
little detained her for <U+017F>ome time in
Silence, which was only ended by
the coming in of <hi>Camilla,</hi> which
both rejoyced and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed her,
<U+017F>eeing that deferred, which <U+017F>he
would willingly have <U+017F>aid, and
which <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much apprehended to
<U+017F>ay. <hi>Camilla</hi> had the <U+017F>ame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and perhaps they would not
have <U+017F>poken, if <hi>Amaldee</hi> had not
opened the Conver<U+017F>ation. Prince,
<U+017F>aid he to <hi>Frederick, You <U+017F>ee a
Prince<U+017F>s allarm'd at the V<U+017F>age <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hall receive from an irritated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Ah!</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Camilla</hi> interrupting
him, <hi>I have but too well merited his
Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure not to undergo the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43299:57"/>
of it with Re<U+017F>ignation. The
King is very unhappy,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
to her, <hi>to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf refu<U+017F>ed,
even in the Azyls that he is de<U+017F>irous
to afford you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I know how much I
am indebted to the King,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he
to him; <hi>but, the Prince of</hi> Sicily
<hi>would do too great a penance, <U+017F>hould

Hatred. Ah, Madam!</hi> interrupted
<hi>Frederick, What a Mon<U+017F>ter would
the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>be! Ah!</hi> <U+017F>aid
<hi>Camilla,</hi> interrupting him again,
<hi>it was no <U+017F>mall Effect of Hatred,
that of pretending to love me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for the
depriving me of a Happine<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e
lea<U+017F>t</hi> Idea <hi>was <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e
me: See,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi><U+017F>hewing
him the Elegy, What a Delicacy for
a Prince, who<U+017F>e Flames are kindled
by Severities, and how does Love
over-turn the Order of all our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations!
It is this <U+017F>ame Prince<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> who
is to this point <U+017F>o tender and <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ive!</hi>

In what Confu<U+017F>ion was
<hi>Frederick!</hi> His Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was <U+017F>o na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
painted in tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, the
Character of them was <U+017F>o tender,
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> was very much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
he was <U+017F>ome time without
having the Power to ju<U+017F>tifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
of a thing too true, but at length
made u<U+017F>e of the Ambiguity for his

I vow to you, once again, that all

<hi>How <U+017F>weet do I find the<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!
After having imagined to have

leave me in my Error, if
you cannot draw me out of it, but at

<U+017F>he quickly agreed to <U+017F>tay in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43299:58"/>
Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of <hi>Berranger,</hi> who had
learn'd, with Indignation, the
Kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had for the Prince
of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but, this was not enough,
<hi>Frederick</hi> had yet <U+017F>aid nothing in
his own Behalf, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>aluting
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> he looked upon him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tenderly, <hi>And you, Prince,</hi> <U+017F>aid

I hate you? I know not,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
to him likewi<U+017F>e very tenderly,
<hi>All that I can <U+017F>ay is that my Regret
is extream to leave you in a time
you are willing I <U+017F>hould believe you
do not.</hi> They were not able to <U+017F>ay
any thing more, their Tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down reciprocally; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, the Prince of <hi>Majorca<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                     </hi>
felt that, I know not what, which
<hi>Frederick</hi> found <U+017F>trange he had not
yet been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of. The Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he was to take his publick
Leave of the King, all the Court
was a<U+017F><U+017F>embled, and <hi>Menfroy</hi> did
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43299:58"/>
<U+017F>hew the great E<U+017F>teem he had for
the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> by all the
Care<U+017F><U+017F>es he made him, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him once again; after which,
<hi>Amaldee</hi> made up to embrace <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
who retired <U+017F>ome Paces;
but the King taking notice of that
Action, made him a Sign not to
di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf, but to embrace
the Prince: whereupon, a great
Blu<U+017F>h mounted into his Face, and
the Prince, when a re<U+017F>pectuous
Sentiment did already re<U+017F>train, did
advance without trembling; and if
notice had been taken of that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
it would have been without
doubt <U+017F>urprizing. After this, <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
returned immediately unto the
King his Fathers Dominions, with
all the Violence of a Man, who
finds him<U+017F>elf drawn el<U+017F>ewhere
without knowing what it was that
did <U+017F>o. He <U+017F>aw the King, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Expectations, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43299:59"/>
him like a di<U+017F>obedient Son,
and who fell into a <U+017F>trange Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
again<U+017F>t <hi>Camilla,</hi> accu<U+017F>ing her
of Trea<U+017F>on, and vowing that he
would go and drag her from the
Arms of the triumphing <hi>Frederick.</hi>
Alas! How little did he merit that
Title, and under what Affliction
did he lie, through the Ab<U+017F>ence of
<hi>Amaldee.</hi> This la<U+017F>t Misfortune <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him in<U+017F>upportable; he fell
<U+017F>ick of a lingring Fever, which
<U+017F>heltred him from the Pur<U+017F>uits of
<hi>Yolanda</hi> and the Admirals Lady,
who could not agreed together:
The<U+017F>e two Rivals being almo<U+017F>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Company, envyed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Joy and Affliction. In <U+017F>hort,
being always at Enmity, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Yolanda</hi> went for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
                     </gap>
and that of her Mother-in-law
to remain at a Relations Hou<U+017F>e<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
from whence <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the Health of the Prince,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43299:59"/>
whom <hi>Camilla</hi> alone had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of vi<U+017F>iting. She came to
<U+017F>ee him with the King, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her Affection would <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later degenerate into Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip,
and endeavoured already to
give Occa<U+017F>ion for the contracting
it between them. The Prince<U+017F>s his
Daughter contributed thereto on
her part, and being de<U+017F>irous to
expell Love from her own Heart,
<U+017F>he no longer u<U+017F>ed any Terms that
are proper to it; and <U+017F>aid nothing
that might give Occa<U+017F>ion to any
<U+017F>uch Motions. The words of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
were the only ones in their
Mouths; and <hi>Camilla</hi> not caring,
tho Love appeared to her under
a borrowed Name, provided it was
<U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame in the Soul of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
did <U+017F>uffer it with great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi>
was at length cured of her Fever,
but <U+017F>he was <U+017F>till in a langui<U+017F>hing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43299:60"/>
Condition; <U+017F>he had ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>o
melting a Sadne<U+017F>s in <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s
Countenance at their parting, that
it re-doubled her own. But tho
that tender Trouble had afforded
her <U+017F>ome Joy, yet it la<U+017F>ted not long,
and that In<U+017F>tant of Happine<U+017F>s went
away <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that it only helped
to render that Prince<U+017F>s more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Truce
being at an end, and <hi>Berranger</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a long time been preparing
a con<U+017F>iderable Fleet, (his Son was
hardly returned) when for to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h
him for the Ob<U+017F>tacles he had
rai<U+017F>ed in his De<U+017F>igns, he ordered
him to take the Command and
Conduct of it. This was a cruel
Circum<U+017F>tance, for him to bear
Arms again<U+017F>t a King, who<U+017F>e Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
had filled him with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and again<U+017F>t a Prince, who
had in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly di<U+017F>armed him of<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43299:60"/>
certain natural Haughtine<U+017F>s, which
was his only Defect. His budding
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which he did not call by
that Name, did extreamly weaken
in him that which his Father would
have in<U+017F>pired him with for that
War. Moreover, he found it <U+017F>o
unju<U+017F>t, that he proceeded to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Extremities, before he could
be brought to it: however, he at
Length yeilded, it being to no
purpo<U+017F>e for him to oppo<U+017F>e the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns
of his Father, who for his
Ob<U+017F>tinacy inflicted the Puni<U+017F>hment
on him, of going to lay wa<U+017F>t a
Countrey he had <U+017F>o much kindne<U+017F>s
for, which indeed he looked upon
as <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere, that he could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have been dragged to his
Grave. He could not forbear tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King, who recommended

Words making the King appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that he might favour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>ts
of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> he gave a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Charge to one of the Officers,
to have an Eye upon his Conduct,
and to give him an Account of all
his Actions, and told him, that
his Fortune <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer for the
Di<U+017F>obedience of his Son. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Amaldee</hi> embarqued for to
return to <hi>Sicily.</hi> He wi<U+017F>hed that
a happy Ship-wrack would di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
him from a Voyage <U+017F>o fatal
to his Repo<U+017F>e and his Glory. He
had only the Name of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Chief, and it was that Name
that made him appear culpable
in the Eyes of the <hi>Sicilians.
Menfroy</hi> did very much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
the Violence that was done him,
but <hi>Frederick</hi> was more difficult
to be per<U+017F>uaded in that Ca<U+017F>e;
he thought it <U+017F>omething <U+017F>o <U+017F>evere,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43299:61"/>
to <U+017F>ee him in Arms to attach him,
and which he would have done,
tho it had been only in his own
Defence again<U+017F>t him, that he could
not find any Rea<U+017F>on for his Ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Be<U+017F>ides, the Vexation
he had to <U+017F>ee that apparently
he had never had him in his
Memory, while that he afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all his Thoughts, did
very much contribute to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him entertain Rea<U+017F>ons of
Complaint in all he could have
done. Thus that Prince did not
appear, though he was effectually
innocent: No Body had heard
from him <U+017F>ince his Departure from
<hi>Sicily,</hi> by the Care that <hi>Berranger</hi>
had taken to prevent it. This
very much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed <hi>Camilla,</hi>
who knew not what to think
of it. <hi>Frederick</hi> had often let
her know, how much he was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>atisfied
with this Procedure; but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43299:62"/>
in <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Terms, that <U+017F>he
frequently reproached him with
having more Kindne<U+017F>s for her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

retrenched to the Names of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip,</hi>

<hi>Why <U+017F>hould you make <U+017F>o di<U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
a Difference for me?
How <U+017F>atisfied <U+017F>hould I be, if I could
draw upon my <U+017F>elf a little of that
Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, which methinks is <U+017F>o

an extream Sadne<U+017F>s, <hi>It is more for

Yours would vani<U+017F>h in an in<U+017F>tant.
But, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that it would be

your Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, as you to grant

do no longer, or You never did love
me, my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion is ever augmenting
and yours decrea<U+017F>ing.</hi> And indeed,
it is a great Dimini<U+017F>hing in Love,
not to encrea<U+017F>e. Be<U+017F>ides, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
of <hi>Majorca,</hi> in the beginning
of her Tenderne<U+017F>s, had <U+017F>o often
wavered between the fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Rival, and the hopes of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none, that tho<U+017F>e tumultuous.
Sentiments did blind her as to tho<U+017F>e
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and hindred her,
in <U+017F>ome manner, from perceiving
their Faintne<U+017F>s. But, when <U+017F>he had
her mind free from any Jealou<U+017F>ie,
<U+017F>he began to ob<U+017F>erve them with
more Exactne<U+017F>s; and finding
them <U+017F>o little conformable to her
own, <U+017F>he fell into a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more cruel than all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Griefs <U+017F>he had lain under.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43299:63"/>
                     <hi>How!</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>I lo<U+017F>e</hi> Frederick,
<hi>and no body deprives me of him, I
lo<U+017F>e him by him<U+017F>elf, and it is he
who refu<U+017F>es to love me, tho he is
not in love with any other Women!
How happy was I, when I had no
rea<U+017F>ons of Complaint but again<U+017F>t my
Rivals, I might accu<U+017F>e my Star of
Misfortunes, I might accu<U+017F>e their
Charms of forcing him to love, but
nothing ingages him; he prefers his
indifference before all the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s I
might in<U+017F>pire him with; he <U+017F>lights
me, and I can only blame him for
all the hard u<U+017F>age. I receive from
him.</hi> But the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was without
remedy, and in<U+017F>upportable, they
all began to <U+017F>ham one another in
<hi>Scicily,</hi> and <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s ab<U+017F>ence
cau<U+017F>ed a Con<U+017F>ternation in the mind
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> which was <U+017F>hared
by all tho<U+017F>e who had any concern
for him. He was <U+017F>o out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
that no Body dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43299:63"/>
to him: If he went out of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
it was to hide him<U+017F>elf
in <U+017F>ome lonely place where he was
inacce<U+017F><U+017F>ible. His Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es would
<U+017F>everal times have followed him to
his Retreats, but were <U+017F>till hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by one another; they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
incommoded them<U+017F>elves, and
through the conformity of their
Sentiments, they almo<U+017F>t ever jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <U+017F>ame De<U+017F>igns: Thus was
he freed by all together, from each
of them in particular, and he found
him<U+017F>elf le<U+017F>s importuned by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
than if he had had but one.
However, tho they all per<U+017F>ued him
with an equal Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Lady was the mo<U+017F>t happy to
find him alone; He <U+017F>hunned her
the lea<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e he did not know
that <U+017F>he was his unknown Votary,
whom he wi<U+017F>hed might be <U+017F>o to
him for ever; though he had <U+017F>een
her often with <hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Yolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43299:64"/>
in places where they came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his account, he had not taken
notice of it; he had ever looked
upon her to be too aver<U+017F>e to Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
for to entertain any <U+017F>uch
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, and imagined, when he
perceived a return of kindne<U+017F>s in
her for him, after all the incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he had committed, that her
Husband had made her a Confident
of what he was. This thought
<U+017F>eemed to him <U+017F>o probable, that
he re<U+017F>olved to make her his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.
It was requi<U+017F>ite he <U+017F>hould
have one: When we are happy,
we contain all our joy within us,
and can be without imparting it to
any Body; but when we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
we mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
one part of our grief by
confiding it in a Friend. He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Admirals Lady as a
very good Woman, imagined that
<U+017F>he would willingly embrace all his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43299:64"/>
Sentiments; and as they had reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
the de<U+017F>ign of meeting, it
was not long before they did <U+017F>o.
One day <hi>Frederick</hi> went into an
Alley, where he found the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
Lady, they walked together
for a while, and after the fir<U+017F>t Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
which la<U+017F>ted but too long
in both their opinions, <hi>Frederick</hi>
began fir<U+017F>t a particular Conver<U+017F>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>I
have extreamly <U+017F>ought an occa<U+017F>ion to
find you alone, and you have not
<U+017F>eemed to <U+017F>hun it; I give you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
thanks for all your favours. I
have of late perceived a change in
your Carriage, which makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you know <U+017F>omething of my
Secret.</hi> The <hi>Admiral</hi>'s Lady was
very much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the change
of his re<U+017F>pectful behaviour, and did
not take it well that <U+017F>he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with having <U+017F>o much
kindne<U+017F>s, which <U+017F>he had never
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43299:65"/>
dreamt <U+017F>he was liable to. Her face
<U+017F>hewed her to be extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and <U+017F>he told him with <U+017F>ome
kind of Anger, <hi>Methinks that you
ought not to abu<U+017F>e what pity has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me to do:</hi> And the di<U+017F>order
<U+017F>he was in hindring her from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
<hi>Frederick</hi> not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, told her, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I did not think that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
which <U+017F>hews the e<U+017F>teem I have
for you, could have given you any
offence; but <U+017F>ince it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>es you,
I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay nothing more.</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Lady being mortally afraid
he <U+017F>hould hold his peace, told him
langui<U+017F>hing; <hi>Speak, Prince, I will
lay a<U+017F>ide <U+017F>omething of my <U+017F>everity,
<U+017F>ince indeed I know but already too
much not to hear the re<U+017F>t favourably.</hi>
The Prince<U+017F>s was more and more
perplexed, and could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the meaning of that <hi><U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and that <hi>favour</hi> which were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43299:65"/>
valued at that rate, and thinking
that <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf was obliging in that
<U+017F>he had cho<U+017F>en her to the prejudice
of any other, to honour her with
her Confidence, <U+017F>he thought her
very fanta<U+017F>tical. However the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>he had for One whom
<U+017F>he might open her heart to, made
her pa<U+017F>s over all, and <U+017F>he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tell her a thing which would
have produced terrible Con<U+017F>equen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in that Conjuncture. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Lady would have proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Mi<U+017F>tery which mu<U+017F>t have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her with <U+017F>pight, and all the
mea<U+017F>ures that the King had taken
<U+017F>hould have been broken, if his
good fortune had not made him
<U+017F>end one of his Attendants to <U+017F>eek
out <hi>Frederick,</hi> to give him notice
that <hi>Berranger</hi>'s Fleet was coming
with full Sails under <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
The per<U+017F>on who was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43299:66"/>
it <U+017F>omething rudely. What a
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e was this to the poor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s!
What conflicts did <U+017F>he not
undergo! The <U+017F>laughter and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
which <U+017F>he repre<U+017F>ented to her
<U+017F>elf, might well have daunted a
young per<U+017F>on; but nothing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
her <U+017F>o much as the danger
whereto <hi>Amaldee</hi> was going to be
expo<U+017F>ed: She was no longer mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his <U+017F>lights, her greate<U+017F>t mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
was to lo<U+017F>e him by his
death; and all Sentiments being
confounded in that, <hi>I mu<U+017F>t be gone,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he <U+017F>adly, turning towards the
Admiral's Lady, <hi>tho I have not yet,
Madam, unbo<U+017F>omed to You my
thoughts. I know enough, Prince,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <U+017F>hedding <U+017F>ome tears
which <hi>Frederick</hi> found very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and for which he thanked her
by a <U+017F>ign of his Head, which <U+017F>he
found more obliging than all he
could have <U+017F>aid. Whereupon he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43299:66"/>
went away to the King, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him in his Cabinet. He
had a mind to be alone with his
Daughter, whom he <U+017F>aw very much
alarum'd, which did not at all <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e
him, and interpreting her
timidity like a good Father, he
was long in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence if he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>uffer her to be expo<U+017F>ed to the
dangers of a Sea-fight. It was
however requi<U+017F>ite to continue a
Fiction that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for a Truth,
and was <U+017F>o important to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
of his People; Thus he found
no rea<U+017F>on that could di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e his
Daughter from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing for his Son
in the War, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
under that name at Court:
Wherefore he de<U+017F>ired her with tears
in his eyes to pre<U+017F>erve her <U+017F>elf, and
to be more mindful of what <U+017F>he
was, than of what <U+017F>he ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
<hi>Why do not You incourage
me better,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, being
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43299:67"/>
charmed with the kindne<U+017F>s he <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, <hi>it will be but too ea<U+017F>ie for
me to appear what I am, and I
ought at lea<U+017F>t to <U+017F>eem</hi> Frederick <hi>in <U+017F>o
great an Occa<U+017F>ion, though I belie that
name in my own Soul. Ah! my
dear Daughter, be careful only of the
Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Sicily; Frederick <hi>will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be well enough pre<U+017F>erved.</hi> They
parted, being both full of all the
Events which they fore<U+017F>aw. But
<hi>Camilla</hi> having had notice of all
that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
Her Brother and her Lover
were going to engage, and <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw afflictions falling upon her,
what <U+017F>ide <U+017F>oever Fortune <U+017F>hould
favour. She went to <hi>Menfroy,</hi> and
asked him pardon for the Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of her Brother: That good
King was altogether di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to
excu<U+017F>e him; they ea<U+017F>ily believed,
knowing him as they did, that he
mu<U+017F>t be under a great Con<U+017F>traint,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43299:67"/>
and rather pitied than blamed
him. All things were made ready,
and <hi>Menfroy</hi>'s Fleet being equal,
or indeed rather <U+017F>tronger than that
of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he re<U+017F>olved to go out
and prevent his Enemies Attack:
Be<U+017F>ides confiding in the ju<U+017F>tice
of his Arms, and in the good luck
which had never abandoned him,
he <U+017F>ent a Herald to the Prince of
<hi>Majorca,</hi> for the choo<U+017F>ing a day
fitting to decide their quarrel.
<hi>Menfroy</hi> cho<U+017F>e rather to hazard an
Engagement by Sea, than to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
his People by a long War,
which would have interrupted
their Commerce, in<U+017F>omuch that
the day was appointed for the
Battel. <hi>Camilla</hi> had not of a
long time <U+017F>een <hi>Frederick</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
there had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome
kind of Coldne<U+017F>s between them,
which ea<U+017F>ily happens when Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not reciprocal. As all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43299:68"/>
their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was now come to
be of indifferent things, <U+017F>he took
an occa<U+017F>ion to ask him what he
thought of her Brother, and if his
procedure did not in<U+017F>pire him
with a great aver<U+017F>ion for all their
Family; for <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t no longer
tell him, that <U+017F>he apprehended it
as to her own particular: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to her with a very
tender Air, <hi>You would ea<U+017F>ily know
my thoughts, if you knew me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better:</hi> This was <U+017F>ufficient to
engage her to an Explication,
which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired.
It is ea<U+017F>ie to judge that they then
were reconciled; Quarrels <U+017F>eldom
la<U+017F>t long when there is a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on both <U+017F>ides to put an end
to them, and when we once come
to clear Su<U+017F>picions, we often end
by Ju<U+017F>tifications. Thus <hi>Frederick,</hi>

alone had not an opportunity of
<U+017F>peaking with him; but <U+017F>he
thought of him the more, and
fancied that he thought no le<U+017F>s
of her; and indeed, never did
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>o much rely upon the
Faith of her Inclination. It gave
her <U+017F>o great a tranquility as to
<hi>Frederick,</hi> that an Infidelity on
his part would never have <U+017F>eemed
probable to her. Hereupon he
went on Board his Ship, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncertain what he was to do;
and <hi>Menfroy</hi> having embraced him
with a tenderne<U+017F>s that <U+017F>eemed a
fore-knowledge of <U+017F>ome Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
they <U+017F>eparated, the King
leaving him the Command of one
of the Squadrons of his Fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of the Admiral,
and he him<U+017F>elf Commanding in
Chief over the whole, boar up in
all diligence again<U+017F>t <hi>Amaldee:</hi>
When this Prince, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43299:69"/>
him in good order, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, he <U+017F>ent at the <U+017F>ame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant
one of his mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable
Officers in a Pinnace, for to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tifie
to him the <hi>great</hi> regret he
had to appear in that Equipage,
and to <U+017F>how <U+017F>o much ingratitude
in appearance, tho he was only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in effect. <hi>Menfroy</hi> <U+017F>ent him
a generous An<U+017F>wer, That he was
not at all <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed that he obeyed
the Orders of his Father, and that
the Actions could not be Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
when the Intention is Innocent.
Thereupon he <U+017F>ent him back; and
tho<U+017F>e two Princes thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of doing their duty.
The Engagement was very bloody
on both <U+017F>ides; the principal Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Fleet put a
great part of that of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
di<U+017F>order, who coming to rally
and <U+017F>econd them with the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
which he commanded in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43299:69"/>
He found <hi>Menfroy</hi> in the
Head of them, and was willing to
<U+017F>hun him; and the King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
being unwilling to attack him
out of the <U+017F>ame motive, turned his
Fury upon the re<U+017F>t of the Enemies
Fleet, the greate<U+017F>t part whereof
he took and <U+017F>unk; and after five
or <U+017F>ix hours Engagement, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at longth a great Victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <U+017F>ame Fate that had always
attended him; but it co<U+017F>t him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dear, <U+017F>ince that <hi>Frederick</hi> and
the Admiral were not to be found
among<U+017F>t the Conquerors, in<U+017F>omuch
that it was very much doubted,
whether <hi>Berranger</hi> or <hi>Menfroy</hi> had
received the greate<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>s. The
thing happened in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaldee,</hi> as we have <U+017F>aid, being
de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>pare <hi>Menfroy,</hi> knew
not that in falling upon another
Squadron of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Fleet, he
attacked <hi>Frederick.</hi> The Admiral
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43299:70"/>
did his duty with great vigour;
but as they were bearing up <U+017F>o
near one another, as to di<U+017F>cern
Objects, <hi>Frederick</hi> perceived the
Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s
<U+017F>eemed to attone for all the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he had given him; that <U+017F>ight
put him into <U+017F>uch a trouble, that
he no longer knew what he did:
He was <U+017F>o little able to defend
him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t him, that he no
longer thought of defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
again<U+017F>t others: And <hi>Amaldee</hi>
fell likewi<U+017F>e into <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>order
that he <U+017F>eemed to Communicate it
to the re<U+017F>t of his Fleet. But to
what an Extremity were they not
both reduced, when that the <hi><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi>
being animated by the death
of the Admiral, who had been
newly killed with an Arrow, they
grappled <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Ship, before
that tho<U+017F>e two Princes had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
what they were to do,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43299:70"/>
their Souldiers attacked one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Fury that did <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
repair the weakne<U+017F>s of their
Princes; and <hi>Frederick</hi> <U+017F>eeing
him<U+017F>elf Ma<U+017F>ter of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
by the Death of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
after having been in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence
<U+017F>ome Moments about the Re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was to take, on a <U+017F>udden
repenting his Effeminacy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not knowing how to come
to any determination, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I know not what rage, which
forced him to enter with his
Sword drawn into <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Ship:
He remained in that Confu<U+017F>ion,
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> had time to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
him<U+017F>elf from his fir<U+017F>t Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and pre<U+017F>enting him with his

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43299:71"/>
unworthy of the e<U+017F>teem I have
for you. Frederick</hi> was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with what he had done,
and with what he had <U+017F>een the
Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> do, that giving
back he made a fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>tep, and had
like to have fallen into the Sea,
but <hi>Amaldee</hi> <U+017F>aved him, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
all other Cares, his whole
Thoughts were then full of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
who intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed him under a
borrowed Name. He had taken
him by the hand, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<U+017F>ome Moments in that
Po<U+017F>ture, enjoying a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
notwith<U+017F>tanding all their
Agitations, which hindred them
from thinking even of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were in. Then <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
di<U+017F>ingaging him<U+017F>elf from

<U+017F>uffer me at lea<U+017F>t to go to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43299:71"/>
                     <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him, with an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
Grief, <U+017F>eeing that he was
going away, <hi>What Cour<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t I
take to do my Devoir, and why do
we <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinately pur<U+017F>ue War, when
our Hearts are in Peace? Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was <U+017F>omething vexed that
he had given Occa<U+017F>ion to the
<U+017F>peaking the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Words; and
for which, <U+017F>ome of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<U+017F>uffered, that the Prince of
<hi>Sicily</hi> might at lea<U+017F>t revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
on them, for the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion their
Prince had in<U+017F>pired him with;
in<U+017F>omuch, that he fell upon them
with an extraordinary Fury, and
making his way through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Swords, the Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca</hi>
was in terrible Alarums for
his Life. He endeavoured to put
an end to the Fight; his Party had
the Advantage in that place,
where the better part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
was got together. The <U+017F>mall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43299:72"/>
Forces that followed <hi>Frederick,</hi>
were over-pow'red by Numbers;
the re<U+017F>t peri<U+017F>hed, and were <U+017F>unk
with <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Ships, who was
left alone, and abandoned in that
Extremity. He looked tenderly
upon <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and without deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what he demanded of him,
he in<U+017F>pired him at that In<U+017F>tant
with a de<U+017F>ire of making him his
Pri<U+017F>oner, and with a de<U+017F>ign of
<U+017F>etting him at Liberty. At fir<U+017F>t,
they were not able to <U+017F>peak a
Word to one another; but at
length, <hi>Amaldee</hi> broke Silence,
either as he was the bolde<U+017F>t, or
that his Thoughts were at more
Liberty: It is certain, that when
that Love does not appear under
it's proper Figure, he does not
commit <U+017F>uch great Di<U+017F>orders, he
is hardly any otherwi<U+017F>e formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than through the Fear we have
of him; and tho he was in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43299:72"/>
Heart of <hi>Amaldee</hi> as well as in that
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> yet he made a much
le<U+017F>s Bu<U+017F>tle in the one than in the
other; <hi>Amaldee</hi> had received him
without knowing who he was,
and he only gave him <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall
Di<U+017F>quiets, which he is not able to
di<U+017F>pence any Body from; but
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who endeavoured to
oppo<U+017F>e his Progre<U+017F><U+017F>es, was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
both with the Shame of
having given him Entrance, and
the De<U+017F>ign of bani<U+017F>hing him from
his Heart. The Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is never
<U+017F>o extream as when we go about
to be cured; and it is in tho<U+017F>e
Conflicts that we are to be pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Ah! Prince,</hi> cryed <hi>Amaldee,
Why mu<U+017F>t I needs lo<U+017F>e you by <U+017F>etting
you free; for, if the Friend<U+017F>hip I
have for you makes me de<U+017F>irous to
detain you, the Acknowledgment
that I owe the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>and
your <U+017F>elf, demands of me your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43299:73"/>
Render it me then all
entire,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Frederick</hi> to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurryed away by his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.
<hi>You con<U+017F>ent then to our Separation,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him; <hi>and do you
willingly,</hi> replyed <hi>Frederick? In
<U+017F>hort,</hi> continued he, <hi>You will <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to go. Amaldee</hi> was <U+017F>o
charmed with receiving <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Te<U+017F>timonies of Friend<U+017F>hip, and
<hi>Frederick</hi> <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him them, that they
once more were <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with
Silence; but then at length, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s
Timidity made him
break it in his Turn, and the
fear of being expo<U+017F>ed to the
receiving a thou<U+017F>and Marks of
E<U+017F>teem from the Prince, which
though plea<U+017F>ing, were <U+017F>o dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to him, that they made him
re<U+017F>olve to de<U+017F>ire the Prince to let
him go. <hi>I perceive then you hate
me <U+017F>till,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43299:73"/>
but he made him no An<U+017F>wer;
and fearing that he had but too
well per<U+017F>uaded him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he went in great Ha<U+017F>te in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ship that was de<U+017F>tined to
carry him home. <hi>Amaldee</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
with great Grief, that he
<U+017F>hould be conducted to <hi>Me<U+017F><U+017F>ina,</hi>
but he was but very ill obeyed;
the Per<U+017F>on whom <hi>Berranger</hi> had
commi<U+017F><U+017F>ioned to have an Eye
over his Sons Conduct, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<U+017F>ecretly, for the carrying <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to <hi>Majorca,</hi> after having
feigned, for the contenting the
Prince, that he had appointed
them to <U+017F>teer to <hi>Sicily;</hi> it was
ea<U+017F>ie to put this Order in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Night coming on, did
both facilitate this Deceit, and
the Retreat of the Prince of
<hi>Majorca,</hi> who did but too <U+017F>oon
perceive the Defeat of his Fleet,
he re-a<U+017F><U+017F>embled the Remains as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43299:74"/>
well as was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him, and
e<U+017F>caped happily from the Pur<U+017F>uit
of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> whom Night did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
both of <hi>Frederick</hi> and the
re<U+017F>t of the Victory. After that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
thought him<U+017F>elf out of his
Reach, being troubled with <U+017F>o
many Events, he <U+017F>hut him<U+017F>elf up
in his Cabin, while that his Fleet
made away with full Sails from
<hi>Sicily,</hi> whither his Heart tended
however. His Return was yet
more <U+017F>ad than his Voyage had
been, and <hi>Frederick</hi> who was no
le<U+017F>s agitated than him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>uffered
them to carry him whither they
had a Mind; but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Trick that was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, he gave a doleful Skreek,
and likewi<U+017F>e fell into a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e who u<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o
treacherou<U+017F>ly; but there was no
Remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:43299:74"/>
He perhaps found likewi<U+017F>e a
kind of Con<U+017F>olation in thinking
that he <U+017F>hould again <U+017F>ee <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
without having contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
He was very glad that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had done for him what he
never dur<U+017F>t have done for him<U+017F>elf,
and though he <U+017F>eemed to be in
a rage, without doubt he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no great Violence. They had
neither of them the lei<U+017F>ure to be
weary during their Voyage, their
Thoughts took them <U+017F>o up, that
they made them imagine it very
<U+017F>hort. They arrived at the <U+017F>ame
time at <hi>Majorca,</hi> and Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
not knowing that <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was <U+017F>o near him, went to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the King and Queen, who
made him a very unkind Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they were very much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <U+017F>ee that De<U+017F>tiny continued
ob<U+017F>tinately bent upon their ruin,
they knew nothing of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43299:75"/>
being taken, and the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was equal between them
and <hi>Amaldee,</hi> when it was told
a moment after, they then were
full of Acknowledgment to the
Prince, their Son; the Per<U+017F>on
who had managed the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
had a great Re<U+017F>pect for his Prince,
and <U+017F>eeing that he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him out of
obedience to the King, he was
willing to repair his Fault, by
giving him the honour of all.
In private he made him his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>es
for that deceit, and after
having told him the Rea<U+017F>ons
which obliged him to it, he
found him di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to pardon
him, thus all the World was <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
The King had never been
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any Joy equal to that
of having the Son of <hi>Menfroy</hi> in
his hands, He de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee him;
and that Prince having paid his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43299:75"/>
Re<U+017F>pects to him, with a very
good Grace, and having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him with a great deal of
Wit, he was <U+017F>omething <U+017F>ecretly
vexed, that his Merit was but
too an<U+017F>werable to his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the Queen had far other
Sentiments, <U+017F>he reli<U+017F>hed a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plea<U+017F>ure in having him for
her Pri<U+017F>oner, when <U+017F>he found him
<U+017F>o well made, and obtained from
the King her Husband, that the
City <U+017F>hould be all his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hoping to make him lo<U+017F>e
the Liberty <U+017F>he gave him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Frederick</hi> on the morrow had
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions, and in a few
dayes after, <U+017F>he imparted to him
her Thoughts. Years had not yet
extingui<U+017F>hed her Beauty, <U+017F>he was
addicted to Gallantry, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that <U+017F>he might well merit
Vows, without exacting them,
<U+017F>he was forced <U+017F>ometimes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43299:76"/>
to make Advances; Her
Rank hindred her at lea<U+017F>t from
knowing the Lovers whom <U+017F>he
cau<U+017F>ed to langui<U+017F>h, and did <U+017F>trange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importune her, upon <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s
account, who entertained
her with a thou<U+017F>and agreeable
things, for he had recovered all
his Gayety, and he lived in <U+017F>o
perfect an intelligence with <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
that his Felicity hindred
him from thinking that under the
Name of a Friend, <U+017F>he was a
Lover, and that her haughtine<U+017F>s
was but ill managed; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Women never think of
that, when they are <U+017F>atisfi'd with
their Lovers, and the de<U+017F>ign of
being <U+017F>evere, does <U+017F>eldom ari<U+017F>e

him better; he might believe that
it was <U+017F>ympathy which occa<U+017F>ion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Inclination; and as he
was entertaining him with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
kind things, being prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereto by motions which he
could not penetrate. Word was

<U+017F>peak with the Prince of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
At fir<U+017F>t their Conver<U+017F>ation was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

great deal of Wit, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
had no le<U+017F>s; at length they made
Love the Theme of their Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.
<hi>For my part, <U+017F>aid</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,

the Queen, <hi><U+017F>hould believe on
the contrary, that Con<U+017F>tancy does
rather proceed from the weakne<U+017F>s

                     <hi>Frederick</hi> received very Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the application <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed
to make him of tho<U+017F>e obliging
words, but the Queens di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e

Hereupon <U+017F>he withdrew into his
Clo<U+017F>et, without expecting her
an<U+017F>wer, perhaps for fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
one, that would not be
very conformable to what <U+017F>he too
ardently de<U+017F>ired not to be under
apprehen<U+017F>ions, and perhaps like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
to conceal her Blu<U+017F>hes; for
how much accu<U+017F>tomed <U+017F>oever a

Blu<U+017F>hes at her loving fir<U+017F>t,

remained very much <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and fore<U+017F>eeing that the Queens
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43299:78"/>
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion would give him <U+017F>ome
trouble, he was a while in <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
if he <U+017F>hould give a hint of
it to the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by that means they would
have come to a more entire expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The Conjuncture was
favourably, but they were de<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to other events, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was deferred
by an interre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Per<U+017F>on. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was expecting <hi>Amaldee</hi> who
u<U+017F>ed to Walk with him every
Evening, and had hardly made
four <U+017F>teps, than that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by a young Cavalier, who
made him<U+017F>elf known to be the
Admirals Widdow. His <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e
was great, <hi>How, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he
to her, <hi>my Eyes deceive me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt: No,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,
<hi>Your Eyes do not deceive you, and
be<U+017F>ides, if your heart did tell you
that it was me, you may very well
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43299:78"/>
rely on its Te<U+017F>timony: but by what
good Fortune,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>do I
<U+017F>ee you again? Can you doubt of
that,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>let it be
only in con<U+017F>ideration of you, if you
could do the <U+017F>ame thing for me?
Frederick</hi> was <U+017F>o amazed, that by
having only offered to make her
his Confident, it had obliged her
come <U+017F>o far; and was no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at the Compliments <U+017F>he
made him, joyned to that <U+017F>trange
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, that they were going to
fall into a new perplexity, if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldie</hi>
had not diverted them
from it. But it is time to make
known by what Adventure <U+017F>he
came to <hi>Majorca;</hi> it is certain
that when a Woman, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trends
to more than ordinary
Virtue and Severity, does concern
her <U+017F>elf in Gallantry, <U+017F>he does not
do it by halfes, but pa<U+017F><U+017F>es from
one extremity to another; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43299:79"/>
when <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olves once to <U+017F>tray
out of the cour<U+017F>e of Wi<U+017F>dom, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>eldom contains her <U+017F>elf from
committing extraordinary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?</p>
                  <p>But for the taking a Pro<U+017F>pect
of things from the time we left
them in <hi>Sicily;</hi> you mu<U+017F>t know,
that after the Fleet was returned
Victorious, although in Con<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon <hi>Frederick</hi>'s being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
people were divided between
Joy and Grief, every one was
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of their particular lo<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and it was enough that they did
not afflict them<U+017F>elves with the
Princes impri<U+017F>onment, <U+017F>ince they
were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of his being alive,
without that rejoycing at the

paid <U+017F>o dear for; <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
per<U+017F>ons had lo<U+017F>t their Lives
therein and among<U+017F>t others, the
Lord High Admiral, as we have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43299:79"/>
<U+017F>aid was Killed. His Widdow,
whom he left in right to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
of her <U+017F>elf, re<U+017F>olved to make u<U+017F>e
of it in favour of her Lover: <U+017F>he
had apparently a very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
Grief for the Death of her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and people were not <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ed
at the Re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>he had
taken to leave the World, but
<U+017F>he had not yet renounced its
Plea<U+017F>ures, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>till found
was not without Charms: <U+017F>he
was only obliged to go <U+017F>eek them
afar off. The Object of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was now at <hi>Majorca,</hi> and
<U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>pare no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to find him out. After
that the fir<U+017F>t Ceremonies of
Mourning were over, <U+017F>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to retire into a Convent.
In the mean while <hi>Camilla</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Frederick</hi> to be at <hi>Majorca,</hi>
had a great de<U+017F>ire to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and did not think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43299:80"/>
to <U+017F>tay any longer in
the Dominions of an Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
the Will of her Parents, <U+017F>he
went to the King and told him,
that it was not Ju<U+017F>t, that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranger</hi>'s
Daughter <U+017F>hould be well
treated by a Prince, who<U+017F>e Son
was in the hands of her Father,
who did not re<U+017F>tore him that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which he had given <hi>Amaldee.
I ought not,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>to <U+017F>hare in
his ingratitude, by <U+017F>uffering it:
I am ohliged to make it my whole
endeavour to <U+017F>et the Prince at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<U+017F>end me back to</hi> Majorca, <hi>if
you can confide in me. Without
doubt the King my Father will at
length be melted with <U+017F>o much Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nero<U+017F>ity:
But in Ca<U+017F>e he continues
Obdurate, notwith<U+017F>tanding all your
Favours, leave me to manage this
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with Addre<U+017F>s, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e,
you that you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in a <U+017F>hort time, or that I will
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43299:80"/>
come and remit my <U+017F>elf into your
hands.</hi> Perhaps <U+017F>he did really
mean all that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken:
But <hi>Memfroy</hi> without much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
her intention, told her,
<hi>Madam, provided that your intre<U+017F>ts
may <U+017F>till be pre<U+017F>erved, I <U+017F>hall not
be <U+017F>orry to be obliged to you for the
Liberty of my Son.</hi> He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
cau<U+017F>ed an offer to be made
<hi>Berranger</hi> to render her upon very
advantagious Conditions, but he
would in no wi<U+017F>e hearken to it.
Nothing was <U+017F>o advantagious to
him, as to have the Prince of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
in his Dominions; in<U+017F>omuch
that <hi>Memfroy</hi> de<U+017F>paring of <U+017F>eeing
him without renewing a War, the
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s whereof is ever doubtful<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
adventured to <U+017F>end back <hi>Camilla,</hi>
and delivering up voluntarily an
Ho<U+017F>tage that Chance had given
him: He fancied that he <U+017F>hould
thereby oblige <hi>Berranger</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43299:81"/>
what Fortune had given
him likewi<U+017F>e. In<U+017F>omuch that all
things being prepared for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s
departure; <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ent back
with a Noble Convoy, and the
Admirals Widdow taking that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to go to <hi>Majorca,</hi> did
mingle her <U+017F>elf in the Crowd of
tho<U+017F>e who accompanied her. She
Tran<U+017F>ve<U+017F>ted her <U+017F>elf into a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
and was <U+017F>o well di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed,
that <U+017F>he hardly knew her <U+017F>elf.
Several days pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed without any
ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in her De<U+017F>ign. <hi>Camilla</hi>
was almo<U+017F>t ever <U+017F>hut up in her
Cabin with one of her Maids, in
whom <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t Confided, and
without doubt the Admirals Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
would not have been Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
if her Love had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
her. The Character of a
Lover is too remarkable not to
be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed. She bethought
her <U+017F>elf of making an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43299:81"/>
with the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
hoping to know by that
means, in what terms <hi>Frederick</hi>
<U+017F>tood with <hi>Camilla,</hi> though the
Admirals Widdow did believe her
<U+017F>elf beloved: There needs <U+017F>o little
to wound a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
has ever been the <U+017F>hare of
tho<U+017F>e who are in Love. Thus
<U+017F>he did all <U+017F>he could to have a
clear Information; <U+017F>he thought,
that the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e would be for
her to win the Heart of that
Maid, for the di<U+017F>covering of her
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Secrets; and as nothing
renders People <U+017F>o dextrous as
Love, <U+017F>he acted the Lover <U+017F>o na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
that this Confident took
delight in believing that <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pired
her with <U+017F>ome tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The habit of hearing ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, had prepared her
Heart to entertain tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>oft and
tender Vows; and the <U+017F>entiments
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43299:82"/>
of the Prince<U+017F>s, had <U+017F>eemed to
her to be <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet, that <U+017F>he could
not forbear following them. The
Admirals Widdow made a very
pretty Gentleman, and <U+017F>eemed
very de<U+017F>erving the Ladys Favours.
Thus a great progre<U+017F>s was made
in the Heart of that Maid, when
unluckily <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>peak
of her Galant. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for People to forbear <U+017F>tarting in
all their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>omething of
the Object their Soul is full of,
and we <U+017F>ometimes meet with <U+017F>uch
Per<U+017F>ons, who had rather <U+017F>peak ill
of their Victorys, than be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to <U+017F>ay nothing at all of
them. She was ever hearing
<hi>Camilla</hi> commending hers, and it
is no <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>traint to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hearing, when we have <U+017F>o
many things to <U+017F>ay. She could
not forbear breaking <U+017F>o trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
a <U+017F>ilence, which <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43299:82"/>
dextrou<U+017F>ly, that <U+017F>he both found
the means to plea<U+017F>e her Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s,
and <U+017F>atisfie her <U+017F>elf at the <U+017F>ame
time. The Admirals Widdow
had often talked to her of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and the Maid made u<U+017F>e of
that pretext to <U+017F>peak in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of her Galant, <hi>Madam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her, <hi>I know a</hi> Sicilian
<hi>here on Board, who has a mo<U+017F>t par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Affection for his Prince, and
I dare a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that he is the
mo<U+017F>t zealous of his Subjects. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
was too tender not to be
Charmed with the affection that
people had for <hi>Frederick,</hi> we
think our <U+017F>elves indebted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the kind <U+017F>entiments they
have for what we love, and <U+017F>he
was willing that the pretended
<hi>Sicilian</hi> <U+017F>hould know, how kindly
<U+017F>he took his good will. Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
was upon the wing to call
him, but at fir<U+017F>t he made <U+017F>ome
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43299:83"/>
re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, yet being obliged to
obey, he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed his voice <U+017F>o
well, that he was not known, till
<U+017F>peaking of <hi>Frederick,</hi> a blu<U+017F>h
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed him, and it was ea<U+017F>ily
perceived that he <U+017F>tudyed what
he had to <U+017F>ay: his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had
no relation, the one part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
his Motions appeared in
their Naturals, and his true tone
of Voice returned on him. The
Admirals Widdow was too <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
upon this Subject, for to be
able to conceal any thing from
Jealou<U+017F>y. <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
her, <hi>I thought you very bu<U+017F>y in
Works of Piety, but the Habit of
a man which you have put on, does
not per<U+017F>uade me that you have had
any <U+017F>uch Motive.</hi> The Admirals
Widdow made her a very <U+017F>mart
An<U+017F>wer, for there is no keeping
of rank among<U+017F>t Rivals, and the
Conformity of Sentiments does
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43299:83"/>
in <U+017F>ome manner equal per<U+017F>ons;
their Conver<U+017F>ation was very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
during <U+017F>ome time, but at length
they were appea<U+017F>ed being there
was no Remedy, and agreed; hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deceive one another, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion before their
Faces of the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
that the Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s, who was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<U+017F>hould enjoy that happine<U+017F>s
without the others envying it
her; Whereupon they concluded
together, that the be<U+017F>t way would
be to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e him, that he might
not have the lea<U+017F>ure to Correct
his words, but explain him<U+017F>elf
in good earne<U+017F>t, but they re<U+017F>olved
both in particular to prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s

keep their Words, and Love
removes all manner of Scruples.
The Admirals Widdow found him
out fir<U+017F>t as has been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
but <U+017F>he made no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43299:84"/>
of her diligence, for though
<U+017F>he was not hindred by <hi>Camilla</hi>
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>o by her Brother who
came to tell him <U+017F>ome News;
The Admirals Widdow withdrew
not being willing to be <U+017F>een in
that po<U+017F>ture which was <U+017F>o little
Conformable to Mode<U+017F>ty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
then by him who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd
that extravagance, and who
ought to be the more obliged to
her for that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>urmounted
all manner of Con<U+017F>iderations for
the love of him. But as we have
not all the<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>iderations for
others, we are careful to keep up
the reputation of all our virtue
with them, and willing to have
them think us <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame. In
<U+017F>hort the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Frederick</hi> with the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of his Si<U+017F>ter, who had met
with unkind reception from the
King, and one much wor<U+017F>e from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43299:84"/>
the Queen, Who <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting the
occa<U+017F>ion of her return, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
her to <U+017F>tirr out of her
Apartment. After which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to him a piece of News,
which put him in de<U+017F>pair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Comprehending the rea<U+017F>on
thereof. The King had <U+017F>ent for
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi> the Queens
Neece, under Pretext of keeping
her Company, but indeed for
the concluding a Match between
her and <hi>Amaldee.</hi> This Prince
had ever <U+017F>hown a very great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ion
for any <U+017F>uch ingagement,
but it was hoped that the Charms
of that Prince<U+017F>s would by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
vanqui<U+017F>h that indifference,
the King gave him notice that
very evening of this de<U+017F>ign, that
he might contribute thereto, and
told him that he would grant
him <U+017F>ome time for the producing
between them what makes a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43299:85"/>
happy Union: <hi>Frederick</hi> was no
le<U+017F>s troubled at this News than
<hi>Amaldee.</hi> They remained both
of them mute, and looked upon
one another without <U+017F>aying a
word, the King and Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <U+017F>ame place with all
their Train: the Queen found
<hi>Frederick</hi> in a very great trouble,
which <U+017F>he did not doubt, but
that <hi>Camilla</hi> had given occa<U+017F>ion
to, and that thought putting
her into de<U+017F>pair, <U+017F>he gave the
King to under<U+017F>tand that it was
requi<U+017F>ite he <U+017F>hould be upon his
Guard, that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> under
the pretext of having brought
<hi>Camilla,</hi> might facilitate to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
the means of evading, and
Conducting him into his own
Teritories; The<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons were
thought very probable by the
King, and diffidence <U+017F>uting with
his natural humor, <hi>Frederick</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:43299:85"/>
was guarded more <U+017F>trictly, which
di<U+017F>grace he <U+017F>upported with con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
patience, and indeed he
had other misfortunes which lay
much heavier upon him. He
perceived that his ill Fortune had
only made a truce with him for
a moment, to the end, that he
might be the more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of all
the afflictions that its return was
preparing for him. The Queens
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that of <hi>Camilla,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that which <hi>Amaldee</hi>
was in a way of being engaged
in, made her find a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happine<U+017F>s
in all the others, it
was however a kind of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for him, that he had all
the<U+017F>e misfortunes together, if he
had had them <U+017F>eparately, they
would have been more afflicting,
but when the mind has <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
views, it fiexs upon none,
and it has of its <U+017F>ufferings on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43299:86"/>
a confu<U+017F>ed Notion which is
not <U+017F>o violent, and indeed he
was only dejected. But the
Queen was more agitated, the
thoughts of having cau<U+017F>ed the
lea<U+017F>t trouble in what <U+017F>he loved,
made her ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly contriving
the means of puting him out
of pain. She only waited for a
favourable occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak
thereof to the King, who<U+017F>e hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
was difficult to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but <U+017F>he ordered her bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<U+017F>o as to find it. She could
no longer forbear <U+017F>eeing <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
her Jealou<U+017F>y was mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by time, and <U+017F>he knew no other
trouble than ab<U+017F>ence, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happine<U+017F>s
<U+017F>he was to endeavour
the removing, whereupon <U+017F>he
remon<U+017F>trated to <hi>Berranger</hi> that
it was glorious to leave <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
upon his word, that he
would oblige him, by Treating
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43299:86"/>
him honourably to make the
like returnes, that he ought not
to render him<U+017F>elf odious to his
people, by an action oppo<U+017F>ite to
Royal Virtues, and that in <U+017F>hort,
the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e would be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to them, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the trouble he lay under in
being detained from his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by rendring his abode
with them as agreeable as could
be. The King did comply with
the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>tances, having nothing
more to fear from the <hi>Sicilians</hi>
when he had <U+017F>ent back with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to tell <hi>Menfroy,</hi> that if Chance
had put <hi>Frederick</hi> into his hands,
as it had done <hi>Camilla</hi> into his,
he would have delivered him
after the <U+017F>ame manner, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
purcha<U+017F>ed him with the
bloud of <U+017F>o great a number of
his Subjects, and by the lo<U+017F>s of
a Battaile, it was fitting he <U+017F>hould
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43299:87"/>
<U+017F>till keep what he had <U+017F>o dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquired. The King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
perceived that he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till
ri<U+017F>cue <U+017F>ome more of his men for
the recovery of his Son, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
anew for War, but <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
<U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf freed from
that great number of Guards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
his dejection, he
enquired after <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he was
told that that Prince was gone to
meet the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi> with
a con<U+017F>iderable part of the Court.
How fatal was this News! He
was not able to view his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in that di<U+017F>tant Pro<U+017F>pect,
though it makes it appear le<U+017F>s
great, he <U+017F>aw it approaching, and
was in no le<U+017F>s perplexity how, to
come off from a Vi<U+017F>it that the
Queen exacted from him; and
yet, however he was obliged to
make it, but he went to her with
<U+017F>o great a <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, that the Queen
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43299:87"/>
asked him with <U+017F>urprize, from
whence that profound Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
proceeded, <hi>You ought to lay

now, than the Marriage of
<hi>Amaldee;</hi> he Walked Pen<U+017F>ive all
alone, and tho impatient of his
return, yet it was not long enough
deferred in his Opinion. He could
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43299:90"/>
not <U+017F>ee but too <U+017F>oon the Prince<U+017F>s
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to him <U+017F>o
Beautiful, and <hi>Amaldee</hi> <U+017F>o Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ant,
tho he only did what
meer Civility required, that he
perceived his grief was capable of
increa<U+017F>ing. The King received
her according to her Quality, and
the views he had for her, did
merit. Yet the Queen did not
<U+017F>ee her that day, and gave out
that <U+017F>he was Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed. But the
Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi> viewed <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
with great application, and
hardly took any notice of all the
honours that were done her. She
could have wi<U+017F>hed that he had
been the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and
tho' that <hi>Amaldee</hi> was admirably
well made, <U+017F>he was not de<U+017F>tined
to have tho<U+017F>e Sentiments for him,
which <U+017F>he began to have for <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</hi>
They had conceived a
great e<U+017F>teem for one another, but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43299:90"/>
nothing more, and never two
hearts were at that di<U+017F>tance, when
they were to have been united.
they met, it is true, at the <U+017F>ame
point in what concerned <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
but that was not the way to
join them. On the Morrow they
were each of them full of <U+017F>uch
Capricious Sentiments, that it
<U+017F>eemed as if Love had changed
place for the better exerci<U+017F>ing his
vengeance, but this Prince<U+017F>s did
<U+017F>till bear the <U+017F>ource, and all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were mean in compari<U+017F>on
of hers. She had a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of them, through the
Jealou<U+017F>ie <U+017F>he had of <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
which <U+017F>he had hitherto been unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with; and that <U+017F>o violent
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in all others, was only
doleful in her, and by con<U+017F>equence
much more oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ing. It is a
great ca<U+017F>e when we can complain
of a Per<U+017F>on with Ju<U+017F>tice: And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43299:91"/>
tho<U+017F>e terrible Motions, which
makes us believe that we hate
him who loves a Rival, are
more <U+017F>upportable than tho<U+017F>e ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
langui<U+017F>hing, which only tends
to the accu<U+017F>ing our <U+017F>elves of all
our Sufferings. Ah! how feeble
is that Accu<U+017F>ation, and how Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
at the <U+017F>ame time? <hi>Why
did I not make my <U+017F>elf known,</hi> <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, <hi>before he made his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es
to another, it is now too late to <U+017F>how
him the Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Sicily, <hi>after
he has <U+017F>een the Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Mantua,
<hi>and that he has already received the
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her Charms? Why did
I not take the opportunity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his heart, during his happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference:
I complained of this,
alas! but I <U+017F>till deferred the procuring
being beloved. I <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
Why did he not keep to
that indifference which he would not
quit for me? I never had any other
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43299:91"/>
than the trouble of not being belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but that <U+017F>eeing him Love an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a thou<U+017F>and times more Cruel.</hi>
She was not able to go abroad
that day, and pretended a <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s
which <U+017F>he had only in her mind.
The Queen was very well again,
when there was an occa<U+017F>ion to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>it
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who though he had
offended her by his faint Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<U+017F>he found the means of
ju<U+017F>tifying him. He had <U+017F>ome
rea<U+017F>on on his <U+017F>ide; the unju<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure
of the thing wherein he
might think that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>hare, by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Camilla,</hi> was
very capable of putting him out
of humor: but tho all <U+017F>hould
have been again<U+017F>t him, <U+017F>he found
in her heart what <U+017F>poke in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
It is very natural to believe
Innocent, what is <U+017F>o much our
Intere<U+017F>t to have <U+017F>o. In <U+017F>hort <U+017F>he
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf to make him a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43299:92"/>
Vi<U+017F>it, after having received one
from the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
whom <U+017F>he gave to under<U+017F>tand,
that <U+017F>he was obliged to have great
regards for that Forreign Prince;
and tho <U+017F>he could not approve in
her <U+017F>elf of all the managements
<U+017F>he had for him, <U+017F>he endeavoured
to make them be approved of by
others. The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi>
asked her <U+017F>everal Que<U+017F>tions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Frederick,</hi> telling her that
<U+017F>he had not taken notice of <U+017F>uch a
Per<U+017F>on, and obliged her to carry
her with her; tho <U+017F>he had no
great de<U+017F>ire to do <U+017F>o. This young
Prince<U+017F>s had had a certain di<U+017F>quiet
all the Night, which had hindred
her from <U+017F>leeping, and which had
put her into a condition of keeping
her bed if <U+017F>he had not been to <U+017F>ee
the Queen: <U+017F>he flattered her <U+017F>elf that
<hi>Frederick</hi>'s Sickne<U+017F>s might be <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
approaching hers. She fancied
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43299:92"/>
that he had viewed her very earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>tly,
and that he frequently <U+017F>ighed,
while he was in her Pre<U+017F>ence, and
the de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing him do <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
filled her Imagination with
a Delight, which vani<U+017F>hed at her
coming into his Chamber: they
found him in <U+017F>o lamentable a
Condition, his Eyes being all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Tears, which he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thought of Wiping away, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
their Pre<U+017F>ence. It
was ea<U+017F>ie for them to Judg, that
they had neither of them any
<U+017F>hare in that great grief. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion are not <U+017F>o
violent, and the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>

that the Per<U+017F>on whom <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>irous to render <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, was
but too much <U+017F>o already. The
Queen on her <U+017F>ide having no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
to applaud her <U+017F>elf for that
profound affliction, it made her
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43299:93"/>
conceive a furious <U+017F>pight; the
Conver<U+017F>ation was faint on all
<U+017F>ides, and the Vi<U+017F>it <U+017F>hort. As
they were going away, <hi>Amaldee</hi>
came likewi<U+017F>e to make <hi>Frederick</hi>
a Vi<U+017F>it, who could not forbear
giving him an unkind Reception,
and though he would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give him any offence, yet he
did, for the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined
<U+017F>he robbed her of that
heart, when they did not give it
her, tho <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o well merited
it. She could not be <U+017F>atisfied with
him, who gave it to another.
<hi>Does the Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Mantua <hi><U+017F>end
you hither,</hi> <U+017F>aid Frederick <hi>to him,</hi>
after <U+017F>omething a <U+017F>lighting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<hi>Amaldee</hi> without making
him any an<U+017F>wer upon that, asked
him only what he thought of her,
and if <U+017F>he was not very beautiful,
<hi>I did not take <U+017F>o much notice of
her,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he in the <U+017F>ame tone.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43299:93"/>
                     <hi>I am much afraid,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
now <U+017F>omething di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed, <hi>that
you have <U+017F>een her but too much for
your repo<U+017F>e and for mine; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of not <U+017F>peaking of her, <U+017F>eems
to me a fear of augmenting that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s
by commending a Prince<U+017F>s
who has in<U+017F>pired me with it. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>ordered, and in
<U+017F>uch di<U+017F>pair, to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that he had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to give him an An<U+017F>wer, and
<hi>Amaldee</hi> was more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion he had of
his being faln in Love with his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: this troubled him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing the rea<U+017F>on of his own
Thoughts. He perceived that he
<U+017F>hould not be much concerned,
tho <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould Love <hi>Frederick,</hi>
but he could not endure that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
<U+017F>hould love her. <hi>I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he, <hi>and Jealou<U+017F>ie di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs
my mind, I ought only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his Loving her, for fear <U+017F>he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43299:94"/>
<U+017F>hould likewi<U+017F>e Love him: but</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he a moment after, <hi>I am
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that I apprehend all on the
<U+017F>ide of</hi> Frederick, <hi>even without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Prince<U+017F>s. I am Mad,</hi>
added he in <U+017F>hort, <hi>I am in Love,
<U+017F>ince I am Jealous, and I can only be
<U+017F>o of the Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Mantua.
However, he could not conclude
this in good earne<U+017F>t, and he was
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pended between his Rea<U+017F>on and
his Sentiments, which he could
not accord, but had very terrible
Allarms. <hi>Frederick</hi> not being
able to <U+017F>uffer his Rival to make all
the Progre<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had a mind to,
while he <U+017F>hould amu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf in
complaints, he left his Chamber on
the morrow, and appeared <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad,
but <U+017F>o lovely, that the Prince<U+017F>s
of <hi>Mantua</hi> commended him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily,
and gave Pre<U+017F>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Truth to the Queen,
whom experience rendred know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Womens thoughts of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:43299:94"/>
<U+017F>he found two Rivals, and
was not her <U+017F>elf Beloved. This
was <U+017F>ufficient to prompt her to
terrible extremities; <U+017F>he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Imperious: however, as
Love works great changes in the
minds of tho<U+017F>e it po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
of her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion made her
undertake what <U+017F>he would never
have done without its aid. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
happening to lean upon a
Window, where he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
Pen<U+017F>ive; <U+017F>he approached
him under the pretext of looking
into the Gardens; <hi>You are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>of the kind

<hi>and I will give her to you: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e,
let this extraordinary effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to <U+017F>ome acknowledgment.</hi>
She did not wait for his An<U+017F>wer;
and a great Blu<U+017F>h covering her
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43299:95"/>
Face, <U+017F>he went from thence to go
find out the King, of whom <U+017F>he
demanded <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Pardon, and
told him that his Severity ought
to be <U+017F>atisfied, and that it was now
time to take her again into his
Favour. The King could hardly<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
be prevailed with to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent:
but after a thou<U+017F>and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>es,
for which he had no rea<U+017F>on
to be much obliged to her, <U+017F>he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
what <U+017F>he demanded, upon
condition however, that his
Daughter <U+017F>hould not appear in
his Pre<U+017F>ence. From thence <U+017F>he
went to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Apartment,
whom <U+017F>he found under <U+017F>o great a
<U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, as would have melted
with pity, any other than a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
The ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who<U+017F>e Company was enjoyed by
the Admirals Widdow, and all his
other Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es, was <U+017F>uch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
as <U+017F>he had been ignorant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43299:95"/>
of till that time, and which <U+017F>he
had the lei<U+017F>ure to feel in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
She received the Queens
Vi<U+017F>it with no <U+017F>mall a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment:
but her <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e was cruelly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
when <U+017F>he entertained her
with the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Go
thank the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>for your
Pardon, it is to him that you are
indebted for it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he <U+017F>ets you free, by
playing you an Infidelity with the
Prince<U+017F>s of</hi> Mantua, <hi>Camilla</hi> was
not willing to purcha<U+017F>e her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at that rate; and the Queen
went away without <U+017F>aying any
thing more. As by breeding a
quarrel between her and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
<U+017F>he deprived her of the fruit
of the <U+017F>ervice, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
de<U+017F>igned her, <U+017F>he was in hopes
that all would turn to her own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<hi>Camilla</hi> would rather
have cho<U+017F>en to have continued in
doubt of what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43299:96"/>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi> and the Admirals Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
than to have the certainty
of his being become a Votary to
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua:</hi> a new
Rival revives all our griefs; they
augment every time we fall under
them anew, becau<U+017F>e we add the
fre<U+017F>h troubles to tho<U+017F>e we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Penetrated with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
different thoughts, <U+017F>he only
followed that which <U+017F>pight in<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her with, which was never
to <U+017F>peak to <hi>Frederick.</hi> And indeed
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much addre<U+017F>s to avoid
the occa<U+017F>ions of doing <U+017F>o, that
tho he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ought them
more than he did, he would never
have found an opportunity. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
and the Queen, did <U+017F>o well ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all that had been <U+017F>aid, that
there was no place for any doubt.
The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> was very
glad to deprive the Per<U+017F>on of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43299:96"/>
Heart, who had deprived her of
hers, and by that means take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for all the torments <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
had put her to, which <U+017F>he did
with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. As they one day
met, <U+017F>aid that Prince very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to him, <hi>Well, you are in Love

The affection which you have for her!</hi>
an<U+017F>wered Amaldee, <hi>Ah! this I

We mu<U+017F>t quarrel if you Love the

<U+017F>aid the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi> outraged
to <U+017F>ee motions in him which <U+017F>he
did not think her<U+017F>elf the cau<U+017F>e of,

many Caprices without making
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43299:97"/>
him<U+017F>elf known, as he did in the
Soul of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> they <U+017F>poke no
more to one another that day, and
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> <U+017F>pending with
her Rivals all the hours <U+017F>he would
have <U+017F>pent with her Lover, did
recompence her<U+017F>elf for what <U+017F>he
might lo<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he was al<U+017F>o a
lo<U+017F>er, and <U+017F>he imployed her time
in putting ob<U+017F>tacles to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F><U+017F>es
which his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion might
make, if <U+017F>he could not hinder
him from being in love, too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in having <U+017F>o u<U+017F>eful an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
This made a diver<U+017F>ion to
her <U+017F>entiments, which Idlene<U+017F>s
would have rendred more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi> was
Charmed to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o happy a <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s
in her de<U+017F>ign, which at fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>he did not think capable of being
executed; <U+017F>he no longer made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the difficulty <U+017F>he
had fore<U+017F>een therein, <U+017F>ince it was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43299:97"/>
now removed. When we are <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the pre<U+017F>ent, we are
not inclinable to take views of
unacceptable remembrances, or
when we do make <U+017F>ome reflections
upon them; our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ufferings
do only help to make us find more
plea<U+017F>ures by the oppo<U+017F>ition of the
pre<U+017F>ent delightful entertainments.
The Queen was in a fury to <U+017F>ee
that a change had been wrought
according to her Maxims, and that
it was not <U+017F>o in her favour, <U+017F>he
would have found it le<U+017F>s cruel to
have <U+017F>een that <hi>Frederick</hi> had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to love <hi>Camilla,</hi> than to <U+017F>ee
that he began to be in love with
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua,</hi> he might
well have <U+017F>igh'd for her daughter,
without giving her offence, he knew
not then that <U+017F>he was beautiful,
but after having both known her
to be <U+017F>o, and had received Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of her Affection, to <U+017F>acrifice
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43299:98"/>
her to another could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a horrible Contempt. It is
particularly the preference which
outrages. <hi>Camilla</hi> for her part had
no other Cour<U+017F>e to take than that
of complaining with her Brother,
and he of complaining with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter;
thus they augmented their
griefs by mingling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Admirals Widdow who
made a <U+017F>trict inquiry after all
that concernd <hi>Frederick,</hi> was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the very lea<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of her misfortune? <U+017F>he became
a friend of the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Majorca,</hi>
<U+017F>ince they had nothing more to
fear of one another, and <U+017F>ince they
equally did dread a Rival. They
likewi<U+017F>e concerted together the
means of doing her an Injury. The
Admirals Widdow could not
re<U+017F>olve to lo<U+017F>e the fruit of her
Voyage, <U+017F>he would at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak
with the ungrateful <hi>Frederick,</hi> but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43299:98"/>
<U+017F>he could not meet with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity;
He kept the Prince<U+017F>s
of <hi>Mantua</hi> Company the mo<U+017F>t he
could, and was more frequently
with the Queen than he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have been, who endevouring
not to make any noi<U+017F>e, made u<U+017F>e
of the <U+017F>ame Artifices he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in regard of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and
<U+017F>tole from him moments which
he had de<U+017F>igned for the Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> thus was he tortured on
all <U+017F>ides. By the<U+017F>e means the
Queen did <U+017F>hare in his a<U+017F><U+017F>iduities,
or rather payed them to him, or
at lea<U+017F>t extorted them from him
much again<U+017F>t his will. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance
for her was onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained,
nothing could move
him to have any, but only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration
of her Rank; Thus
his devi<U+017F>es having not the <U+017F>ame
Motive which made him act for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43299:99"/>
the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua,</hi> they had a
notable difference. <hi>Frederick</hi> had
four Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es at the <U+017F>ame time,
he was the Lover of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
and the Rival of his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and he particularly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
tho<U+017F>e two la<U+017F>t Characters
to the heighth. As <hi>Amaldee</hi>
would have <U+017F>een without trouble,
the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s, if his
Friend had not repaid it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
flames. He neglected
very much to complain of her, he
frequently entertained her only
with indifferent things: but one
day ob<U+017F>erving the unea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who was Walking with
the Queen, and who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to approach him, to hear what
he <U+017F>aid to the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
he re<U+017F>olved in his turn to put him
upon the Rack for <U+017F>ome moments,
and rai<U+017F>ing his Voice, <hi>Ah!</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>have we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43299:99"/>
that is more delightful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
our <U+017F>elves with, it <U+017F>eems as
if we were afraid that</hi> Frederick
<hi><U+017F>hould over-hear us:</hi> as he did
indeed. She made him An<U+017F>wer
in a kind of <U+017F>lighting manner,
<hi>The more indifferent the Conver<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, the more it ought to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
What a rigour!</hi> cryed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee,</hi>
in a trouble that was not
feigned, <U+017F>ince he judged that her
indifference for him, only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the affection that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
had for her. <hi>Is it,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, <hi>by <U+017F>uch indifferent things
that the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>has found
the way to plea<U+017F>e you, and has he <U+017F>o
little accu<U+017F>tomed you to amorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ations,
that you cannot bear
with them. Frederick</hi> was too
knowing in motions, not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
that tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Amaldee</hi> had a
very tender Principle, without
diving into the cau<U+017F>e of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43299:100"/>
<U+017F>ince he who felt it
could not dive into it him<U+017F>elf;
this in<U+017F>pired him with all the rage
which the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi>
ought to have conceived, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Queen took notice
of it, and was no le<U+017F>s concerned
than he. And tho<U+017F>e four Lovers,
two of whom had only a good
Title to that Appellation, <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

humour which hindred
him from proceeding any further
upon that point. On the other

the <U+017F>haddow of the lea<U+017F>t Power is

<U+017F>he thought fit to hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

between having the <U+017F>ame addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es

feigning to be of her Opinion, and
of not ob<U+017F>erving her di<U+017F>order, told
her, <hi>The truth is, that there is a

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43299:108"/>
what people would fain conceal
from us; for my part I intere<U+017F>s
my <U+017F>elf in an affair from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I know it, and it affords
me almo<U+017F>t as much delight as it

But the Prince<U+017F>s was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to <U+017F>upport the <U+017F>ight of him,
<U+017F>he went away under the pretext
of being newly <U+017F>eized with a pain

in her <U+017F>elf the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of
her Malice, was willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

<hi>That word made him turn pale,</hi>
and the Queen continuing <U+017F>aid,
<hi>The King has always had the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>has ever po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed him <U+017F>ince that

Ceremonies are to be performed
within a few days: you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have a mind to <U+017F>hare in the
Diverti<U+017F>ements that will be upon
that occa<U+017F>ion: but if you are not
that way inclined, you may depart
when you think convenient, if the
plea<U+017F>ures that are preparing for
that Fea<U+017F>t are indifferent to you,
and if you do not think us de<U+017F>erving
the <U+017F>atisfaction of enjoying your

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43299:109"/>
But you give me no An<U+017F>wer,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<U+017F>he, <hi>Is not this Match to your

with great violence, <hi>The only
thought of parting from you, is <U+017F>o
afflicting, that it hindered me from
under<U+017F>tanding what you <U+017F>aid: but
when is this Marriage to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ummated?
It would have been
already Con<U+017F>ummated, had it not
been for</hi> Amaldee's <hi>backwardne<U+017F>s,</hi>
<U+017F>aid the Queen, thinking to be
very Malitious, <hi>for the Prince<U+017F>s of</hi>
Mantua <hi>does ardently de<U+017F>ire it.
Frederick</hi> recovered <U+017F>ome Joy at
that Word, and Prote<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly
to the Queen, that he was
not in Love with the Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and entertained her with
<U+017F>o many obliging things, that <U+017F>he
remained more <U+017F>atisfied than <U+017F>he
promi<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
was in hopes of making the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
con<U+017F>ent, that by <U+017F>acrificing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43299:109"/>
the Queen effectually to her, he
might have the Liberty of <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have cea<U+017F>ed his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es.
The intelligence, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, might authorize that
Thought: But all the<U+017F>e Projects
were out of Sea<U+017F>on, thanks to the
Queens Artifice, all his mea<U+017F>ures
were broken by the Jealou<U+017F>ie,
which <U+017F>he had dextrou<U+017F>ly in<U+017F>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
into the Soul of her Rival.
This Prince<U+017F>s would no longer
look upon him, and it was in vain
that <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Eyes <U+017F>ought to
tell her, how de<U+017F>irous he was of
a particular Conver<U+017F>ation with
her; they could not meet
with hers, but having approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
her Ear at a time, that no
Body took notice of that action,
<hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>endeavours
are u<U+017F>ed to make me abandon you,
but I <U+017F>ee a change in your Carriage
which if you continue much longer
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43299:110"/>
will proceed perhaps to the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
me to the Prince of</hi> Majorca.
She turned away her head <U+017F>corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
without making him any
an<U+017F>wer, and pre<U+017F>enting her hand
to <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he was obliged to
lead her to her Apartment. But
the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> did
not take notice after what
obliging manner <U+017F>he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it him, his mind was filled
with a thou<U+017F>and vexatious things
upon her account. The King
having <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>eek him, had
commanded him ab<U+017F>olutely to
Marry her within eight days,
which was the longe<U+017F>t time that
his re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance could obtain. He
<U+017F>lighted her very much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
from that Evening to treat
her as <U+017F>he had done him, thus
they all three pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed that night
very unea<U+017F>ily. The Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Mantua</hi> had been <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43299:110"/>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi>'s perfidity, that <U+017F>he did
not think at fir<U+017F>t of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faithful to her, her mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fixed upon her misfortune,
did not afford her any agreeable
views; It is very difficult in a
moment that a <U+017F>trong pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
finds it<U+017F>elf betray'd for a Woman
to think of giving birth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thought came only into
her head when <hi>Frederick</hi> would
have been as intimate with her as
before the di<U+017F>covery: <U+017F>he then on a
<U+017F>uddain re<U+017F>olved to revenge her
<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he fancied that the Prince
of <hi>Sicily</hi> was proud, and that he
would be loath to be deprived of
his Conque<U+017F>t; When a Woman
lo<U+017F>es one, the de<U+017F>ign comes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to make another, but it is
only to make her <U+017F>elf the more
valued by her former Lover, that
<U+017F>he endeavours to procure a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who is not much obliged
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43299:111"/>
by the paces that are made in
his favour, <U+017F>ince they all relate
to the affection which fir<U+017F>t of all
prevailed. <hi>Amaldee</hi> as we have
already <U+017F>aid, did not examine all
this, he had <U+017F>o little inclination
for the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua;</hi> that
he took no notice of her Actions,
<hi>Frederick</hi>'s being out of humor
was capable of making him <U+017F>o,
he could not get an opportunity
to <U+017F>peak to him <U+017F>ince the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that had happened at the

a Declaration wherein he took
<U+017F>o little intere<U+017F>t, and he found
him<U+017F>elf more troubled at his being

which I cannot Comprehend. I am

Ah! how cruel does your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip

all the fury that <U+017F>o authentick a

her with: <hi>How!</hi> cried <U+017F>he,
<hi>He is not <U+017F>atisfied with betraying
me, he would likewi<U+017F>e deprive me of
the only Lover I have left; Ah!
what a rage is his? I <U+017F>hould have
<U+017F>uffered his indifference, if it had
not been voluntary, but I cannot <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

Women are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
jealous of their Beauty, and
they are often, only willing to
have a Lover, for the giving Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>timony

was <U+017F>o <U+017F>atisfied with him, that <U+017F>he
could no longer look upon the
Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi> as the Rival;
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>till more confirmed of
the Sacrifice that <hi>Frederick</hi> had

<U+017F>eemed to have, of becoming

there was now no more ob<U+017F>tacles

<hi>Amaldee,</hi> who coming in at that
moment, did pay all her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with extraordinary unkindne<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es;
the <U+017F>lights that are put upon
a Beauty, do vex her more, than
all tho<U+017F>e that can be done to the
mo<U+017F>t Amorous of all men; <U+017F>he
accu<U+017F>ed <hi>Frederick</hi> with Ju<U+017F>tice of

and that <U+017F>he received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olation

is the having <U+017F>o favourable an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
when all was contrary

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43299:116"/>
the <U+017F>atisfying her vanity. And
indeed the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
pen<U+017F>ive all alone, when his Letter
was brought her, <hi>How!</hi> great
was her <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e, <hi>Ah!</hi> cried <U+017F>he,

<U+017F>o afflicted, that he was not able

and leaning again<U+017F>t a Tree, he
looked upon her tenderly, and
<U+017F>hedding a torrent of Tears, he
at length drew the like from the
lovely eyes of that irritated Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,

were in pur<U+017F>uit of her; who
joined together, to ask the; rea<U+017F>on

<hi>How!</hi> replyed <hi>Frederick, and do

I do not find her aimable, but
if you do not Love her, why are you

<hi>Camilla</hi> being charmed with this

thought again<U+017F>t him, but <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
<U+017F>topping, found him<U+017F>elf in a

more, if the King had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him, he was amazed at
his taking him a<U+017F>ide to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
him, but the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in this
manner:</p>
                  <p>The Queen whom a too long
ab<U+017F>ence from <hi>Frederick</hi> rendred
unea<U+017F>ie, had <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>eek for him,
her imagination being full of him,
figured him always with another,
it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for her to <U+017F>ee him
for the calming all her Su<U+017F>picions,
<U+017F>he was told that he was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla,</hi> which was
<U+017F>ufficient to allarm her. The King
being pre<U+017F>ent when this Word was
brought, <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>hed at the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cretion
of the Per<U+017F>on <U+017F>he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
which <hi>Berranger</hi> taking
notice of, he looked upon it as a
very ill augure. What <U+017F>he added
afterwards with <U+017F>ome kind of
tran<U+017F>port, made him the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ive.
<hi>Camilla,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43299:119"/>
him, <hi>renews her Per<U+017F>uits, and it is
very convenient to have a Watching
Eye over her. Your Virtue is very
Au<U+017F>tere, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her
with <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>dain, <hi>I perceive that
you are not willing to allow your
Daughter a Lover: but as for</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,
<hi>I <U+017F>hall take order about him,
and he may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be on his way to</hi>
Sicily <hi>by to Morrow, for preventing
the con<U+017F>equences of an Amour, at
which your <U+017F>everity is <U+017F>o much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd.</hi>
Thereupon he went down
into the Palace Garden, thinking
upon the Di<U+017F>covery he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made; he met there with <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
and breaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation
that had <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ed
him, he entertained him with one
that was very afflicting. <hi>Prince,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to him, <hi>you may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that I have deferred <U+017F>o
long the telling you that you are
Free: but now hence forward, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43299:120"/>
<U+017F>hall detain you, all things
<U+017F>hall be ready for your going on
Board, and that to Morrow, if
no Body <U+017F>tay you here, I pretend to
render Civility for Civility to the
King of</hi> Sicily <hi>by re<U+017F>toring him his
Son.</hi> And indeed <hi>Berranger</hi> had
found his Glory to revive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
upon the Queens being in
di<U+017F>order, and accu<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf of
having not too well managed it:
He managed at the <U+017F>ame time his
own repo<U+017F>e. He paid great Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to <hi>Frederick,</hi> who only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him with a profound bow,
he had not the power to thank
him for a thing which puts him
into de<U+017F>pair, and for the re<U+017F>toring
him to a Liberty, which he found
would be in<U+017F>upportable. How
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible was the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s
grief to depart in a time when her
Pre<U+017F>ence might <U+017F>upport the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43299:120"/>
have entertained of her. To
depart without making her <U+017F>elf
known, or to make her <U+017F>elf known
when <U+017F>he was to depart, were <U+017F>uch
tumultuous reflections, that <U+017F>ome
time was requi<U+017F>ite for her to come
to a determination, the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no le<U+017F>s to be pitied than <U+017F>he.
The <hi>Idea</hi> of never <U+017F>eeing what we
Love, is the mo<U+017F>t cruel thing that
imagination can repre<U+017F>ent; it was
requi<U+017F>ite that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him at
lea<U+017F>t once more. Yet the King
be<U+017F>ieged continually, and the thing
was almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. In this
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing need <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained
to run <U+017F>ome ri<U+017F>que. She Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the di<U+017F>cretion of one of her
Maids of Honor, who<U+017F>e Chamber
<U+017F>he thought mo<U+017F>t convenient for
the interview, being there was a
way to it by a back pair of Stairs.
This Woman took care to conduct
<hi>Frederick</hi> thither, who was re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43299:121"/>
to imploy his Credit with the
Queen, being ignorant of the <U+017F>hare
<U+017F>he had in that adventure. The
King having <U+017F>et <U+017F>pies to watch
him that Evening; he failed not
to have notice given him of the
way he had taken. The Queen
finding her <U+017F>elf indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her <U+017F>elf upon a Bed of repo<U+017F>e,
where all bathed in Tears, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw
<hi>Frederick</hi> at her knees, being as
full of grief as her <U+017F>elf, he conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her tenderly to imploy her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
for the deferring a departure,
which would be <U+017F>o fatal to him:
they were in that po<U+017F>ture when
they heard the Chamber door
thundred open, and <U+017F>aw the King
with his Sword in his hand: he
made a full pa<U+017F>s at <hi>Frederick,</hi> who
happened to be fir<U+017F>t in his reach:
the Queen made her e<U+017F>cape by the
back pair of Stairs, he ran to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ue
her, but not finding her, he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43299:121"/>
met with <hi>Amaldee</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi>
whom we <U+017F>ent to the place where
all this di<U+017F>order pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, finding
that his vengeance would be the
more compleat, if all the World
knew it, and that he added to it
the trouble of all <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>ons as
took part in <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Prince<U+017F>s
of <hi>Mantua</hi> was likewi<U+017F>e informed
of this accident, by the rumors
that were <U+017F>pread of through all
the Palace. Her tenderne<U+017F>s was
now revived, and <U+017F>he no longer
found him culpable, <U+017F>ince he had
now expiated his Crime by his
Bloud that was <U+017F>hed. In<U+017F>omuch
that <U+017F>he ran thither as well as the
re<U+017F>t; their <U+017F>hrieks were heard on
all <U+017F>ides in that Chamber, and it
was a very lamentable <U+017F>pectacle to
<U+017F>ee <hi>Frederick</hi> weltring in his own
bloud. The Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Mantua</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> embraced one another
in <U+017F>hedding a torrent of Tears.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43299:122"/>
The<U+017F>e two Rivals were no longer
Enemies, and their common mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
left them no other Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than for the lamenting
what they Loved. It being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to undre<U+017F>s <hi>Frederick,</hi> they
withdrew, and his wound was
<U+017F>earched. But how dangerous a
one did <hi>Amaldee</hi> receive? when
he <U+017F>aw an admirable Bo<U+017F>om,
tinctured in <U+017F>everal parts with
bloud, yet heightned its natural
Whitene<U+017F>s. This cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
Love making him<U+017F>elf
known to him in that cruel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he made him feel it with
all its Violence. The Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Sicily</hi> was Fainted away, <U+017F>he was
thought to be dead, <U+017F>he no longer
breathed. But <hi>Amaldee</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

having cau<U+017F>ed that heart to move
again, which he had <U+017F>o much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
<U+017F>he opened feebly her Eyes,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43299:122"/>
and ca<U+017F>t a piercing look upon the
amorous <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<U+017F>hut them again. <hi>Ah! Lovely
Eyes,</hi> cried he, <hi>are you clo<U+017F>ed for
ever,</hi> He imagined <U+017F>he had given
her la<U+017F>t Sigh, he did the Actions
of a Mad-man, and being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
capable of governing him<U+017F>elf,
he <U+017F>uffered tho<U+017F>e Per<U+017F>ons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him, whom the Queen had
<U+017F>ent to give help to <hi>Frederick,</hi> to
the Apartment of tho<U+017F>e afflicted
Beauties, he did not acquaint
them with <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he little thought of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, or of telling them a
piece of News which would
only have <U+017F>erved to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
his own de<U+017F>pair, they
were all in a gloomy <U+017F>ilence,
which being cau<U+017F>ed by a violent
grief, did lively expre<U+017F>s it, there
remained in tho<U+017F>e Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es a ray
of hopes which tormented them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43299:123"/>
more than the entire a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of
their misfortune could have done.
We <U+017F>uffer our <U+017F>elves to be tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with rage, when the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is without Remedy, and
there is at lea<U+017F>t but that Motion
which hurries the Soul away with
that Violence, and which leaves
it not the lei<U+017F>ure to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of
all its torments: but when we
are divided between <U+017F>mall hopes
and a great deal of fear, we feel a
thou<U+017F>and Conflicts, which as it
were tore us, and cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but by the lo<U+017F>s of the one or
other. They quickly lo<U+017F>t them
both, to make way for <U+017F>omething
that was much more afflicting.
Word was brought that <hi>Frederick</hi>
had been di<U+017F>covered to be the
Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi> then all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they had <U+017F>o improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertained, di<U+017F><U+017F>ipating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
on a <U+017F>udden, they fell into
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43299:123"/>
a kind of Lithurgy, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of which they found all their
Allarms to be <U+017F>oft and plea<U+017F>ing.
In the mean while the Prince<U+017F>s of
<hi>Sicily</hi>'s wound being <U+017F>earched,
was found not to be Mortal,
which News being carried to the
King, he received it as the cure of
all his ills. The Queen no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
gave him any embraces, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hindred him from joyning
the Crown of <hi>Sicily</hi> to his own,
and finding his Honour <U+017F>ecure, and
his ambition <U+017F>atisfied, he learnt
with great <U+017F>atisfaction, a thing
that was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary both for his
own repo<U+017F>e, and that of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He <U+017F>ought out the Queen to
ask her pardon for his rage, and
was willing to believe, that it
was only to the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
that the A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<U+017F>ince it was but effectually
her. The Queen was <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43299:124"/>
with <U+017F>o many changes, that <U+017F>he
knew not what an<U+017F>wer to make,
<U+017F>he was in fear that it was a <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e,
that the King would put
upon her, and could perhaps have
wi<U+017F>hed it. Nothing was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to her, as to learn <U+017F>he
had no longer a Lover, and what
was more that <U+017F>he had not had
one. It was in vain that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to render her a Witne<U+017F>s
of that Truth, <U+017F>he excu<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf,
telling him after a <U+017F>pightful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which her Virtue too well
ju<U+017F>tified, in<U+017F>pired her with, that
<U+017F>he was even afraid, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es
Sex would not <U+017F>ecure her
from his Su<U+017F>pitions, <U+017F>ince her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had not been able to do <U+017F>o.
Neither would the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>
nor <hi>Camilla,</hi> now <U+017F>ee under the
proper Figure, the Per<U+017F>on they had
found <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing under one that
was borrowed. They hated the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43299:124"/>
Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Sicily,</hi> from the time
that <U+017F>he was no longer <hi>Frederick,</hi>
but <U+017F>he did not remain abandoned:
the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> gave her all
his thoughts which did <U+017F>ufficiently
comfort her for tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
What a delight was it to
her to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf beloved! this
was a Novelty, <U+017F>he had never <U+017F>een
a Lover at her feet; it is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
to <U+017F>ee one there: but it is the
highe<U+017F>t Felicity when it is one the
Woman Loves. <hi>Ah!</hi> cryed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee,</hi>
all tran<U+017F>ported, <hi>Why did
you wait <U+017F>o long to triumph over a
heart that ought to be wholly yours,
from the time it was capable of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
I have felt, it is true, <U+017F>ome
tender longings towards you, but I
lo<U+017F>t the Plea<U+017F>ure by not knowing the
motions of my heart, nor the merit
of the Object who in<U+017F>pired me with
them.</hi> A thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ighs with which
he repaired the time he had been
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43299:125"/>
without knowing the u<U+017F>e of them,
and a thou<U+017F>and di<U+017F>quiets he was in
for her Life, did make her <U+017F>ufficient
<U+017F>atisfaction for tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had
thought to no purpo<U+017F>e. She had not
Courage to make him langui<U+017F>h
longer without telling him what
he had in<U+017F>pired her with. As he
was one day Comparing before
her the <U+017F>entiments he had had
for <hi>Frederick,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e he had

willing likewi<U+017F>e to give him a

                     <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Wife, which was

two days after the wound
was given without giving the

for all the favours he had be<U+017F>tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
