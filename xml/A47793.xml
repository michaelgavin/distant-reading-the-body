      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and the De<U+017F>ire <U+017F>he had to be acquainted

her an account of her Brothers and Si<U+017F>ters. <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
relates the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Julius Antonius, Antonia</hi> and young
<hi>Ptolomy. Julius Antonius,</hi> riding a hunting one day,
is thrown by his Hor<U+017F>e, and relieved by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

<hi>Area,</hi> where the bea<U+017F>ts fought. <hi>Antonius,</hi> perceaving how
much <hi>Tullia</hi> was troubled at it, out of an extravagance
of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, leaps down into the <hi>Area</hi> among the bea<U+017F>ts,
and takes it up: but bringing it to her, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<U+017F>he would take that expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his love with
civility, if not with kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he, out of the horrid
aver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had for him, would not receive it: whereupon
he keeps it, prote<U+017F>ting he would never re<U+017F>tore it to any
hands but her own. <hi>Cecinna,</hi> meeting him afterwards
alone, demands the box of him, which <hi>Antonius</hi> refu<U+017F>ing
to deliver him, it begat a duel, wherein <hi>Cecinna</hi> is killed.
Vpon which accident, as al<U+017F>o at the reque<U+017F>t of <hi>Tullia,</hi>

They had hardly opened their bright

<U+017F>atisfied, to my confu<U+017F>ion, that it is onely to my imagination, that
I mu<U+017F>t attribute the<U+017F>e deplorable effects of my affliction. <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable,
and yet unfortunate Prince<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>aies that known voice) I
mu<U+017F>t then be content to loo<U+017F>e you for ever.</hi> The<U+017F>e few words are
all I heard, or, to <U+017F>ay better, thought I heard, but the <U+017F>ound, I
have <U+017F>ome time been <U+017F>o well acquainted with, hath made <U+017F>uch
an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in my hearing, that, with all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of my
rea<U+017F>on, I can hardly be per<U+017F>waded, that I have not heard the
very voice of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> 'Twas with that reflection that I
<U+017F>tarted as you felt, and turning to you that I looked wi<U+017F>h'dly
about me through that remainder of the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which my
errour had left in my thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Such was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> approved
her opinion: but it was not long ere <U+017F>he fell into another ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
which might have added very much to her affliction,
had <U+017F>he fa<U+017F>tened her thoughts on it: for <U+017F>he imagined for <U+017F>ome
minutes, that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> killed in the combat wherein <U+017F>he had
left him ingaged; it might haply be that his <U+017F>pirit, wandring
about that which he had <U+017F>ome time dearly loved, had entertained
her with tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate words. This reflection found at fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ome little entertainment in her mind, and might have done abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of mi<U+017F>chief there, had <U+017F>he afforded it any long entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but that being <U+017F>uch in her, as was not capable of ordinary
weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that extravagance was <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>pell'd by the light of her
rea<U+017F>on, and communicated to <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> who gave it more credit
then <U+017F>he had done. For the <hi>Armenian</hi> Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e was ea<U+017F>ily drawn
in, to think the opinion very probable, and <U+017F>oon per<U+017F>waded, that if
it were true, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had heard certain words pronounced
by a voice, like that of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> 'twas, que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e, the <U+017F>pirit
of that unfortunate Prince, dead in the combat, wherein they had
left him with little a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of his <U+017F>afety, that <U+017F>poke them to the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e he had <U+017F>o dearly loved while he lived, and whom haply he
<U+017F>till loved, even after his death. From the opinion <U+017F>he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
of the death of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> <U+017F>he derived all the affliction her
vertue could give her for a Prince, who<U+017F>e extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
de<U+017F>erved a better fate, and the friend<U+017F>hip <U+017F>he had for <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
for a man, who (how angry <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he might <U+017F>eem to be, and
how highly <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he might di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her <U+017F>entiments) was much
dearer to her, than her life. Certain it is, that what <U+017F>en<U+017F>e <U+017F>oever
<U+017F>he might have of her own misfortunes, it abated nothing of what
<U+017F>he conceaved for <U+017F>o great a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that to the tears <U+017F>he <U+017F>hed for
her own unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he added <U+017F>ome for the death of <hi>Juba's</hi>
<U+017F>on. But when, reflecting on her fortune, <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration
to another, and was <U+017F>atisfied that <U+017F>he might mind her
own intere<U+017F>t with tho<U+017F>e of others, without any breach either of
friend<U+017F>hip or genero<U+017F>ity, <U+017F>he thought, that, if <hi>Coriolanus</hi> were, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97242:5"/>
certain, dead, (an accident <U+017F>he neither could nor would conceave,
without an extraordinary affliction) it might occa<U+017F>ion no incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
alteration in <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s condition and her own, and that, it
being not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s inclinations might change, when
the object of her affections were in the grave, if <U+017F>he could con<U+017F>ider
the love of the King her Brother, with other eyes than <U+017F>he had done
before, and be per<U+017F>waded by time and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to marry him, that
Prince, how exa<U+017F>perated <U+017F>oever he might be again<U+017F>t <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi>
sand <hi>Alexander,</hi> would not onely pardon them for <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s <U+017F>ake,
but would, no doubt, confirm their marriage, and <U+017F>uffer them to
enjoy in quiet what they had <U+017F>ought with <U+017F>o much trouble and
danger. To this happine<U+017F><U+017F>e would be added al<U+017F>o that of having
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for whom <U+017F>he had a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate affection, her Si<U+017F>ter two
<U+017F>everal wayes: in<U+017F>omuch, that this reflection flattered her into
a hope that was not unplea<U+017F>ant. True it is, that <U+017F>he could not
rai<U+017F>e it to that height, as to reflect on the death of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
without grief, but rather that <U+017F>he was content to <U+017F>eek out <U+017F>ome
comfort in her misfortunes, without intrenching <U+017F>o much as to
the lea<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>h, upon what <U+017F>he ought the vertue and friend<U+017F>hip of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Yet dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>he not communicate this reflection to the
de<U+017F>olate daughter of <hi>Anthony,</hi> conceiving, not without rea<U+017F>on,
that <U+017F>uch a Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would not be delightful to her: but <U+017F>he
felt her re<U+017F>olution growing <U+017F>tronger and <U+017F>tronger by that glimp<U+017F>e
of hope, betrayed in her countenance, more <U+017F>etledne<U+017F><U+017F>e and le<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>orrow, then <U+017F>he had done the day, nay indeed, for <U+017F>ome minutes,
before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This little alteration happened in her thoughts, at the <U+017F>ame
time that tho<U+017F>e of</hi> Cleopatra <hi>met with <U+017F>uch another; for that fair
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, out of motives quite contrary to tho<U+017F>e of</hi> Artemi<U+017F>a,
<hi>had ju<U+017F>t then fa<U+017F>tned on re<U+017F>olutions worthy the</hi> Cleopatra's. <hi>She had
hardly well fixed on them, but, not able to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them either by
her countenance or her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he embraced</hi> Artemi<U+017F>a, <hi>with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ad than all the precedent; and letting her rend in her

us not weep any longer, but rather hope, from the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the
Gods and our own Courage, the remedy of our misfortunes; it may
be our unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e will not be <U+017F>o great as we were afraid it may;
and if our hard fates re<U+017F>erve us for what we fear us mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,

or to entertain it as we ought. For your part, <hi>Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> I hope
it will be no hard matter to pacifie the King your Brother, and I

for me, I can ea<U+017F>ily contemn whatever may happen to me, when I do

into any <U+017F>uch exigency; and if the King your Brother violates the
re<U+017F>pect due to me, or do any thing that <U+017F>hall make my captivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ufferable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97242:6"/>
to me, I <U+017F>hall free my <U+017F>elfe by the <U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>es the Queen my
mother took to avoid it; and I have that example <U+017F>o much before my

any where el<U+017F>e while I have that of my own courage. This re<U+017F>olution
once taken, I no longer fear the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <U+017F>ince I hope no
more of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> whether dead or unfaithful, I look on whatever may
happen to me in a manner with indifference, and <U+017F>hal entertain it haply
with a con<U+017F>tancy whereof the very example mayadde much to yours.</p>
                     <p>No doubt but <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> found <U+017F>ome comfort in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> not that <U+017F>he approved that hope, which the daughter
of <hi>Anthony</hi> grounded onely on a contempt of life, but was glad to
<U+017F>ee her in a quieter po<U+017F>ture then <U+017F>he had been in before: and
though <U+017F>he had not the confidence to di<U+017F>cover to her the reflection
that had found her the entertainment of <U+017F>ome few minutes, yet
was <U+017F>he of a belief that time might <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and that in the mean time <U+017F>he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a conver<U+017F>ation le<U+017F><U+017F>e afflictive than that wherein they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away <U+017F>o many cruell houres. Accordingly, no <U+017F>ooner
were the<U+017F>e two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ubmit to what the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of fortune might ca<U+017F>t upon them, but they <U+017F>eemed to be
quite changed from what they were; the current of their teares
was dried up, and by degrees they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of their pre<U+017F>ent misfortune. Yet could not <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>a</hi>
give over di<U+017F>puting in favour of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

her of his affection, in his for<U+017F>aking of his kingdom, the trouble
it was to him to wander up and down the earth to find her out,
and the late combat he was engaged in before their eyes, again<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e that would have ravi<U+017F>hed them, <U+017F>he could not be

what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid with the rea<U+017F>ons before alleadged, yet <U+017F>o as that
through her arguments, might be perceaved part of what <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>a</hi>
repre<U+017F>ented in his favour. But at la<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
of who<U+017F>e life there was much uncertainty, adding to her grief,
<U+017F>he would needs change it, and put <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> upon <U+017F>ome other.</p>
                     <p>The love which that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e had for <hi>Alexander,</hi> made her
de<U+017F>irous to know, and willing to hearken to any thing that related

el<U+017F>e, that the per<U+017F>ons now to be <U+017F>poken of, communicated their mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ecret <U+017F>entiments, and that it was in a manner in my pre<U+017F>ence, that
the greate<U+017F>t part of the things happened. The relation will haply
be <U+017F>omewhat long, (though it may not contain any great variety of
adventures, and that in all likelihood I <U+017F>hall not be able to leave off
when I would) but <U+017F>ince I made a <U+017F>hift ye<U+017F>terday to continue that
which I had begun, of the Hi<U+017F>tory of my own misfortunes, I hope
I <U+017F>hall be as able to go through with this, and I <U+017F>hall endeavour all
that lies in my power not to omit any thing that may any way <U+017F>atisfie

HISTORY
OF
JULIVS ANTONIUS,
ANTONIA and PTOLOMEY.</head>
                        <p>BEfore I give you the account you de<U+017F>ire of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Antonia,</hi> it will not be ami<U+017F><U+017F>e,
Si<U+017F>ter, to make mention of an Elder Brother we have
had, and whom haply we have yet, though I <U+017F>aid litle
of him in my own Hi<U+017F>tory, in regard it is <U+017F>o long time
<U+017F>ince we have either <U+017F>een or heard of him, that we
have acted hitherto as if there were no <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>on in the World.
His beginning di<U+017F>covered him not to be unworthy the bloud of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and all things in him were great enough to re<U+017F>cue him
from the oblivion of his neere<U+017F>t relations. But before I acquaint
you with the fir<U+017F>t beginnings of his life, and the <U+017F>trange accident
whereby we lo<U+017F>t him, I <U+017F>hall tell you what condition the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Antony</hi> left his family in when he dyed, though I doubt not
but you have heard <U+017F>omething of it from <hi>Alexander.</hi> I am ea<U+017F>ily
per<U+017F>waded, Si<U+017F>ter, you are not to learn how that <hi>Anthony</hi> left
<U+017F>eaven children by three wives, by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who was the fir<U+017F>t,
<hi>Antillus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi> by <hi>Octavia, Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s Si<U+017F>ter, the two
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Antonia;</hi> and by Queen <hi>Cleopatra,
Alexander, Ptolomey,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf. For the two daughters by
<hi>Octavia,</hi> and for us, the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> we all had our educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
together, in the hou<U+017F>e of that Vertuous Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, with all
the civilities and kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es that could be expected from a mo<U+017F>t
affectionate mother; and as to the two children of <hi>Fulvia,
Antillus</hi> was killed not long after the death of our Father, by
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s Souldiers, (his fate having proved not unlike that of our
Brother <hi>Cae<U+017F>arion,</hi> who<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t eruptions, and the great inclinations
he di<U+017F>covered, rai<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>ie of him in <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97242:7"/>
that rea<U+017F>on took away his life) and <hi>Julius Antonius</hi> was provided
for as we were by the indulgent <hi>Octavia,</hi> and not long after po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed
of the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and all the e<U+017F>tate belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
with an addition of <U+017F>omewhat out of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s. To be
<U+017F>hort, his condition was <U+017F>uch, that he needed not envy the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of any <hi>Roman</hi> what<U+017F>oever, and though he had not tho<U+017F>e
Kingdoms at his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, which had been at his Fathers, yet did
he keep up our hou<U+017F>e in the greate<U+017F>t lu<U+017F>tre it ever was in before
the death of <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and before <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> made
them<U+017F>elves Ma<U+017F>ters of the Empire. He was elder then <hi>Alexander</hi>
and my <U+017F>elf by <U+017F>eaven or eight years, in<U+017F>omuch, that within a
<U+017F>hort time after our misfortune, and while we were yet brought
up as children by <hi>Octavia,</hi> he was numbred among the young
Princes that pretended to employments and opportunities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
fame. He was certainly born to all the noble<U+017F>t and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
endowments, and though he were not <U+017F>o <hi>fair</hi> as <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet
had he a high and maje<U+017F>tick look, was of a proper <U+017F>tature, and
wanted not any of tho<U+017F>e advantages, either of body or mind,
which could rationally be wi<U+017F>hed in him. With this, his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were ab<U+017F>olutely noble, he was wholly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
of vertue, and an earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitor to tho<U+017F>e opportunities
which lead a man to glory. We cannot indeed complain, but
that he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed as great affection towards us, as we could
expect from a Brother, and him a vertuous one: but in
regard we were of <U+017F>everal venter's, lived in <U+017F>everal hou<U+017F>es, nay,
that ours was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort divided between him and us, and that
even among the kindred of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> there was no <U+017F>mall aver<U+017F>ion
for the name of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> certain it is, that our familiarity was
<U+017F>o much the le<U+017F><U+017F>e with him, and that he concerned him<U+017F>elf le<U+017F><U+017F>e in
our Affairs, then if our family had not been di<U+017F>united, which is
the rea<U+017F>on that you have had <U+017F>o little mention made of him in the
fir<U+017F>t beginnings of the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> and mine. Whence yet
I would not have it thought, as I told you, that we can reproach
<hi>Julius Antonius</hi> with any backwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e to do all the civilities and
good offices we could expect from his friend<U+017F>hip; but that when any
great emergencies interven'd, he was no longer among us; and it is
upon that account that I have been de<U+017F>titute of his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances in all
tho<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions which the love of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath furni<U+017F>hed me with,
to make u<U+017F>e of them, &amp; of which I have already made you a relation.</p>
                        <p>You have, I que<U+017F>tion not, under<U+017F>tood, from <hi>Alexander,</hi> as al<U+017F>o
from me, all the particularities of our younger years; but to
give you an account of <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi> I am to tell you, that
after he had attained perfection in all tho<U+017F>e exerci<U+017F>es, that are
proper to per<U+017F>ons of his birth, he was no <U+017F>ooner arrived to an age
fit to bear arms, but he <U+017F>ought out the wars with much earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and engaging him<U+017F>elf in the armies of <hi>Dalmatia, Pannonia,</hi>
as al<U+017F>o that which <hi>Marcus Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> conducted again<U+017F>t the <hi>Ba<U+017F>ternae,</hi>
and having gone through all employments and charges <U+017F>uitable to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97242:8"/>
his age, with all the good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e imaginable, he acquired a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fame, and gave the World ground to conceave as glorious
hopes of him as of any other what<U+017F>oever. Being, after <U+017F>everal
years <U+017F>pent in travel, returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he <U+017F>etled there, and was
honoured by all, nay wanted not from <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> him<U+017F>elf more then
ordinary expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of e<U+017F>teem and affection. He was at fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>hed
at the Court among per<U+017F>ons of the highe<U+017F>t rank, <U+017F>o far,
that onely <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and the children of <hi>Livia,</hi> particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> <U+017F>eemed, by rea<U+017F>on of the advantage of their
fortune, to aim at higher pretences. His expence was noble and
magnificent, his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition inclined to do civilities and to oblige,
and his whole deportment, <U+017F>uch as all the World approved, and
were <U+017F>atisfied with. Accordingly, he <U+017F>oon got him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of friends, and, tho<U+017F>e onely excepted, whom the divi<U+017F>ions of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the di<U+017F>tractions of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> had made irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
enemies to our hou<U+017F>e, there were very few of the Roman
Nobility, who had not a particular e<U+017F>teem for him, and courted
not his friend<U+017F>hip. When he went to <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus's</hi> Palace, he was
attended by a gallant retinue of young Gentlemen. In all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<U+017F>hews, and all A<U+017F><U+017F>emblies that met either at the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>es, or
at the young Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Julia</hi>'s, he alwayes had the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
and it was already the ordinary talk in <hi>Rome,</hi> that, if
Fortune were any thing favourable to him, he would rai<U+017F>e the
hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Anthony</hi> to the height of lu<U+017F>tre it had been in <U+017F>ome few
years before. But it was not the plea<U+017F>ure of the gods, he <U+017F>hould
continue long in that condition, and the quiet that he him<U+017F>elf lo<U+017F>t
after a very <U+017F>trange manner, proved the occa<U+017F>ion of our lo<U+017F>ing of
him, to our no <U+017F>mall grief. Now, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>hall you hear <U+017F>omething
which you will haply be a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at, as to the parallel you will
find there is between the fate of <hi>Alexander</hi> and that of <hi>Antonius;</hi>
whence you will haply imagine, that Fortune treating them as
Brothers, would needs have <U+017F>ome conformity between their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
                        <p>Among tho<U+017F>e exerci<U+017F>es of the body he was mo<U+017F>t addicted to,
<hi>Antonius</hi> was the greate<U+017F>t lover of hunting, and u<U+017F>ed it very often.
To that end being gone a dayes journy from <hi>Rome</hi> on the <hi>Tu<U+017F>culum</hi>
<U+017F>ide, where the Country is very plea<U+017F>ant, and very fit for that kind
of diverti<U+017F>ement, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away certain dayes there, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <U+017F>atisfaction. The la<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e he intended, to be<U+017F>tow
on that exerci<U+017F>e, being, as he was hunting a Stagge, forced to cro<U+017F><U+017F>e
certain woods in the pur<U+017F>uit, he came into a very plea<U+017F>ant valley,
where putting on his Hor<U+017F>e very negligently down a little de<U+017F>cent,
and along the <U+017F>lippery gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, he <U+017F>tumbled, but <U+017F>o of a <U+017F>udden,
that he could not get his feet out of the <U+017F>tirrops, nor prevent the
hor<U+017F>e from falling upon him <U+017F>o violently, that having knocked his
head again<U+017F>t the root of a tree, he was not onely <U+017F>en<U+017F>e-le<U+017F><U+017F>e for the
time, but receaved al<U+017F>o a very con<U+017F>iderable wound. A further
misfortune was, that none of his fellow-hunt<U+017F>men being mounted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97242:8"/>
comparably to him, or having taken other wayes, there was not
any one of his people neer him, to afford him any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in that
condition, <U+017F>o that he lay groveling on the ground, <U+017F>en<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e,
loo<U+017F>ing bloud; and being much in need of help, when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
per<U+017F>ons that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by in a Chariot, in a way not far off, drew
neerer, and came out of the Chariot to relieve him. They were
in number three, and they women, without any man with them,
but he that drove the Chariot, and certain <U+017F>laves that followed it.
She of the women that <U+017F>eemed to be of the greate<U+017F>t quality, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving
my Brother to be in the <U+017F>ad condition I told you of, was
extreamly troubled for him, and concluding otherwi<U+017F>e by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and the <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his cloaths, (though he had
onely a riding-<U+017F>uit on) that he was of no mean condition, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very much inclined to do him all the good <U+017F>he could. She fir<U+017F>t
looked on the wound in his head, which <U+017F>he found not to be very
dangerous, yet did <U+017F>he not think it ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to put <U+017F>ome linnen to it,
which <U+017F>he tore off the cloaths of her maids.</p>
                        <p>While <U+017F>he was thus employed, <hi>Antonius,</hi> who<U+017F>e greate<U+017F>t hurt
proceeded from the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e-le<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e he had been in, comes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
and opening his eyes, <U+017F>aw that he was under the hands of tho<U+017F>e
fair and officious Surgeonne<U+017F><U+017F>es. He was not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at
the adventure, and though he were in <U+017F>ome doubt of the truth,
nay, remembred that he had <U+017F>een the Chariot as he came into the
Valley, yet could he neither forbear being <U+017F>urprized at the fir<U+017F>t, nor
afterwards divert the amazement with the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o beautiful a
per<U+017F>on, as <U+017F>he that <U+017F>tood by him, put him into. He ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon
her, yet without <U+017F>peaking, and viewed her all over <U+017F>everal times,
in <U+017F>uch a manner, as ea<U+017F>ily betrayed his admiration. He had indeed
<U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to look on her with a particular attention, for there
was both in her countenance and her per<U+017F>on, what might very well
fa<U+017F>ten the eye, and fetter the imagination. Her <U+017F>tature was of the
noble<U+017F>t, and her deportment di<U+017F>covered a certain grace that was
wholly particular. All the features of her face were regularly
well drawn, her mouth extreamely hand<U+017F>ome, her hair of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
<U+017F>laxen that could be, and her eyes were animated by <U+017F>omething
<U+017F>o <U+017F>parkling, and with all <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, that, among the greate<U+017F>t
Beauties the earth affords, there is not haply any one <U+017F>o fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a <U+017F>udden effect, and to imprint <U+017F>omething of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in a <U+017F>oul
capable thereof. In fine, whether <U+017F>he were truly <U+017F>uch, or that the
inclinations of <hi>Antonius</hi> repre<U+017F>ented her as <U+017F>uch, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to him
a very Admirable Per<U+017F>on, and he looked on her a long time with
a certain a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, without <U+017F>o much as being able to open his
mouth to acknowledge the good office <U+017F>he had done him. But at
la<U+017F>t he ab<U+017F>olutely recovers him<U+017F>elf as well of his <U+017F>urprize, as the
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e-le<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ioned by his fall; and conceaving him<U+017F>elf to
be in a very undecent po<U+017F>ture, before a per<U+017F>on he thought worthy
all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible re<U+017F>pects, he would needs ri<U+017F>e up, but he could not do it
without <U+017F>ome difficulty, as having his leg a little cru<U+017F>hed by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97242:9"/>
hor<U+017F>e that had fallen upon it; in<U+017F>omuch, that when he was got up,
being not well able to <U+017F>tand, he was forced to lean again<U+017F>t a tree,
where, minding not <U+017F>o much the pain he felt, as the noble adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he had met with, he at la<U+017F>t broke forth, and looking on that
fair Lady, with an action that already <U+017F>poke <U+017F>omething that argued
abundance of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <hi>I know not,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>fair, or rather,
divine, Lady, what acknowledgments I ought to return your Goodne<U+017F>s,
for words will be but weak expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions thereof, if you do me not an
ab<U+017F>olute favour, by affording me <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion to return you part of
what I owe you. The a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance you have receaved from me,</hi> replies
that excellent per<U+017F>on, with <U+017F>uch an accent as di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>omething
ful of charm, <hi>is no more then what we are obliged to do to all tho<U+017F>e that
<U+017F>tand <U+017F>o much in need thereof as you did, and particularly to tho<U+017F>e,
who, as you, carry about them what di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes them from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rate of men. Your pre<U+017F>ent condition is not, as far as I can judge,
very good, and therefore if you plea<U+017F>e to make u<U+017F>e of my Chariot, I
will bring you to a place, where you may receave the helps you <U+017F>tand in

<hi>Antonius</hi> hath related <U+017F>ince) with <U+017F>o much kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e, in<U+017F>inuation
and maje<U+017F>ty, that he was infinitely taken with it, and felt at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant,
the <U+017F>udden quickening of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which till then could
never get entrance into his <U+017F>oul; in<U+017F>omuch that he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
her again with a ge<U+017F>ture that expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed part of what he felt,
and thinking it a di<U+017F>honour not to returne <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer to <U+017F>o obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a Proffer. <hi>I have not been able,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the
effects of your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, nor prevent your hands from taking the pains
they have, becau<U+017F>e I was in a condition that allowed me not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your favours; but how precious <U+017F>oever I ought to account
them, I <U+017F>hall not pre<U+017F>ume <U+017F>o far upon you as to abu<U+017F>e them, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to pre<U+017F>erve, till death deprive me of it, the glorious remembrance
of tho<U+017F>e I have receaved, without de<U+017F>iring any other of you,
which, being trouble<U+017F>ome to you, might too much betray my inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus did he endeavour to put off the civility of the Unknown
Lady, wherewith yet he was at la<U+017F>t willing to comply, out of the
violent inclination he had to follow her: but ju<U+017F>t upon this comes
in <U+017F>ome of his people, and <U+017F>eeming to be not a little frighted at that
adventure, they came about their Ma<U+017F>ter, viewing him all over
with much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and holding him up under the arms to help
him to walk. <hi>Antonius</hi> began to feel within him a wound, which
took up his thoughts more then the hurt of his body, and <U+017F>o was
de<U+017F>irous, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his men, to get near that fair Lady,
who was gone <U+017F>ome few paces form him: but at the <U+017F>ame time one
of her Maids, having before <U+017F>poken to one of <hi>Antonius</hi> his men,
comes to her, and whi<U+017F>pers <U+017F>omething in her ear. She had no
<U+017F>ooner heard what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, but her colour changed. She <U+017F>eemed
to be extreamly at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e; in<U+017F>omuch, that turning her back on the
Prince, after <U+017F>he had called her <U+017F>laves to her, <U+017F>he went to her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97242:9"/>
Chariot, got into it, commanded it <U+017F>hould be made fa<U+017F>t, and to
make all ha<U+017F>t thence. <hi>Antonius,</hi> more <U+017F>urprized at this accident
then he had been at the former, it rai<U+017F>ed in him a certain vexation
and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, <U+017F>o that being <U+017F>till between his people, he lift up
his voice, the better to be heard by that fair Lady: <hi>How, Madame,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>do you for<U+017F>ake me ere you afford me the time to return
you my thanks? I forgive them you,</hi> replyed <U+017F>he a little <U+017F>martly, <hi>and
you <U+017F>tand no longer in need of my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance.</hi> The Prince was not
able to ma<U+017F>ter him<U+017F>elf in the agitations, which <U+017F>o unexpected a
<U+017F>eparation cau<U+017F>ed in him, in<U+017F>omuch, that his impatience was <U+017F>uch
that he <U+017F>poke then what he would not haply have the confidence
to <U+017F>peak in a long time, had he been in another condition. <hi>Ah
Madame,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>the pain I endure, is much greater than you imagine,
and the wound you have <U+017F>een is very <U+017F>light in compari<U+017F>on of that which
you have given me. Ala<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> continued he, <U+017F>eeing her departing, and
following her with his eyes, while <U+017F>he made all the ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could
away, <hi>mu<U+017F>t I lo<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, and with <U+017F>o much cruelty, without
knowing either the cau<U+017F>e of your departure, or my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e?
What have I done? What have I attempted? Or what have I <U+017F>o much
as thought, that <U+017F>hould in a moment work a change in tho<U+017F>e officious
inclinations? Have you perceaved in my heart the creation of your
own eyes there? Or have you di<U+017F>covered therein any thing <U+017F>o injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to your <U+017F>elf, as to arm, in an in<U+017F>tant, with <U+017F>o much disdain, a mind
wherein I had found <U+017F>o much goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o much humanity?</hi>
The<U+017F>e words he <U+017F>cattered into the air, while the Chariot drove
on with all <U+017F>peed, till that, not long after getting into a Wood, he
quite lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius,</hi> over-pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with affliction, <U+017F>ate him down on the gra<U+017F>s,
whereupon reflecting on his adventure, he found <U+017F>o much matter to
grieve at, that it was with much ado that he admitted any the lea<U+017F>t
mitigation thereof. He was ignorant what motive could induce
a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o officious, and one that had made proffers to him <U+017F>o
full of obligation, after <U+017F>he had a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him with her own
hands, to exchange <U+017F>o much indulgence into <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>ain; nay,
he was to <U+017F>eek who that fair, good-natured, and <U+017F>cornful per<U+017F>on
was, from whom he had receaved <U+017F>o much good, and <U+017F>o much
hurt; and what compleated his affliction, was, that he could not
inform him<U+017F>elf from any of his own people, who ingeniou<U+017F>ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ed
they had not the curio<U+017F>ity to enquire, though one of her
Maids had come to them and learned his name, which it <U+017F>eems
they made no difficulty to tell her. <hi>Antonius</hi> blamed them a
hundred times for their <U+017F>tupidity, though they alledg'd by way of
excu<U+017F>e, that the di<U+017F>turbance which his fall had put them into, <U+017F>o
took up their thoughts, that they could reflect on nothing el<U+017F>e.
Being therefore de<U+017F>irous to do all that lay in his power to learn out
the name of a per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e idaea was but too well engraven in
his heart, he commanded one of his men to get on hor<U+017F>e-back
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97242:10"/>
immediately, and ride after the tracks of the Chariot, and without
fail to find out <U+017F>ome means or other to know the truth, and to
come and give him an account of it at a hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Servilius</hi>'s, which
he named to him, that lay about two hours riding from that place,
and upon the way to <hi>Rome.</hi> Having given him this order, he,
with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of tho<U+017F>e that were about him, got on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and though it was with <U+017F>ome difficultity that he <U+017F>ate,
yet he made a <U+017F>hift to ride on ea<U+017F>ily towards <hi>Cervilius</hi>'s
hou<U+017F>e.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It were a hard task for me to repre<U+017F>ent to you the different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that exerci<U+017F>ed his thoughts all the way he rode; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, as he hath him<U+017F>elf acknowledged <U+017F>ince, that though he
felt no <U+017F>mall pain in his body, yet he never <U+017F>o much as minded it;
and that he had <U+017F>o deeply graven in his heart the idaea of a per<U+017F>on,
one while kind and obliging, and another, cruel and di<U+017F>dainful,
and yet both in her mildne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and in her <U+017F>corn ever fair, and ever
full of charm, that he was not one minute without it.</hi> What a
fanta<U+017F>tick adventure is this of mine? <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> and what arms does
Fortune intend to take up again<U+017F>t me? Ought I to <U+017F>ee that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed
per<U+017F>on in a condition, wherein her good offices had begun,
what her fair eyes have compleated? or could my <U+017F>oul, prevented by
the obligation, be in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as to beauty? But when I had <U+017F>een her,
when I was obliged to her for her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, when her beauty had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
me with love, mu<U+017F>t I lo<U+017F>e her after <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all probability, contrary to all rational order? and, what I
think yet much more in<U+017F>upportable, <U+017F>ee her depart di<U+017F>dainful, incen<U+017F>ed
and exa<U+017F>perated, from a place, where <U+017F>ome few minutes before <U+017F>he had
appeared with <U+017F>o much goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e? By what action have I incurred
her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure? or what could <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover in my per<U+017F>on, which
<U+017F>hould oblige her <U+017F>o of a <U+017F>udden, to exchange her fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>entiments, for
<U+017F>uch as were ab<U+017F>olutely oppo<U+017F>ite thereto? Or is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he may have
truly read in my eyes the love which I already feel for her, or
could <U+017F>he look on that unexpected influence of her beauty, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
worthy her indignation, and this deportment of hers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Having thus for <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>pent his thoughts on that part of his
adventure, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to the other;</hi> But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>added he,</hi>
I <U+017F>hould commend, or be di<U+017F><U+017F>ati<U+017F>fyed with any one, and not know
whom I either commend, or am di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with, and <U+017F>hall I be long
ignorant whom I ought to returne my thanks to, for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I
have receaved, or whom I ought to complain of, for the wound
hath been given me? For in fine, I feel, and that not without <U+017F>ome
confu<U+017F>ion, that I am really in love. Tis from the bloud of <hi>Mark-Anthony,</hi>
who lived and dyed the mo<U+017F>t amorous of mankind, that I
derive the<U+017F>e ambrous inclinations, for had I not been born of him,
the charms of that Vnknown Beauty had not produced <U+017F>o unexpected
an effect.</p>
                        <p>Amid<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e reflections he comes to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Servilius,</hi> who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97242:10"/>
chanced at that time to be there him<U+017F>elf, and who having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
the accident had happened to him, cau<U+017F>ed him to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a bed, and to be attended with as much care and affection as
might be. The hurt he had gotten by his fall was not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
in<U+017F>omuch, that before he left <hi>Servilius</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, which was
about two or three dayes after, he had very well recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf:
but that which troubled him mo<U+017F>t, was, that he could not
learn any thing of what he de<U+017F>ired from the per<U+017F>on he had fent
after the Chariot, who had brought him no other account, then
that having lo<U+017F>t the track of it in the <U+017F>and, he had never been able
to recover it again; and that, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the enquiry he
had made up and down the Villages thereabouts, yet could he not
meet with any tidings of it. So that my Brother, being <U+017F>till as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as he had been before, after he had de<U+017F>cribed the place as well
as he could to <hi>Servilius,</hi> and given him all the marks whereby he
might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly know it, could not meet with any <U+017F>atisfaction at all,
though <hi>Servilius,</hi> the more to humour him, had <U+017F>ent for <U+017F>everal
other per<U+017F>ons, and had very diligently enquired of all the Ladies
that might have any habitation near the place where the accident
had happened.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> having taken a great deal of pains in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to no
purpo<U+017F>e, returns to <hi>Rome</hi> with as much melancholy, and haply with
as much love as ever man could be capable of. He di<U+017F><U+017F>embled
the cau<U+017F>e of his affliction, as thinking it not fit to di<U+017F>cover it, but
to <U+017F>ome few per<U+017F>ons, that were his very intimate friends, who
were not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the adventure, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him what
lay in their power, to find out the name of the per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e
image he had <U+017F>o deeply imprinted in his heart. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to whom
he had made a relation of this <U+017F>tory, and who was his very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
friend, had <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him of it, when ever they
met together, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him what he could, (though as ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as others) in the inqui<U+017F>ition he was <U+017F>o much bent upon. His
melancholy was remarkable, and obvious to all the World: in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that tho<U+017F>e who knew him to be naturally of a cheerful di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition,
could not conceave upon what grounds his humour was
<U+017F>o changed of a <U+017F>udden. It being about <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>eaven years <U+017F>ince
what I relate to you happened, <hi>Alexander</hi> and I were too young
to be admitted of his Privy Councel, <U+017F>o that it is <U+017F>ince that I came
to the knowledge of the<U+017F>e particularities.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Antonius,</hi> as to point of magnificence, lived
much after the rate he was wont to do. He went dayly to the
Emperour's Court, who had a very great e<U+017F>teem and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him; and whereas the generous <hi>Octavia,</hi> his Si<U+017F>ter, with
whom we were; notwith<U+017F>tanding the ill treatment <U+017F>he might
have receaved from our Father, had neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects
for his memory, <U+017F>he was as earne<U+017F>t for the advancement of
tho<U+017F>e children that he had had by his other Wives, as <U+017F>he could
have been for that of her own, and that meerly out of the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97242:11"/>
of vertue that was in her. Thence was it that <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>ign to
marry <hi>Antonius</hi> to one of the Daughters <U+017F>he had had by <hi>Marcellus</hi>
her former Hu<U+017F>band, and who were brought up with us, without
any di<U+017F>tinction, as if we had been really Si<U+017F>ters: as conceaving that
<U+017F>he could not better di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her Daughters then to be<U+017F>tow them
on the Sons of her Hu<U+017F>band, or rather, that <U+017F>he could not do any
thing more contributory to the advantage of the Son of <hi>Anthony</hi>
then, by making him her Son in law, to make him <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s Nephew,
who was able to rai<U+017F>e his fortunes to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e.
It was indeed an admirable expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the indulgence
of <hi>Octavia,</hi> in regard that by way of addition to the merit of their
per<U+017F>on, which yet is extraordinary, her Daughters, whether we
con<U+017F>ider their birth or their fortunes, were <U+017F>uch as there were no
men in the World, who would not have been proud to <U+017F>erve them,
upon the lea<U+017F>t appearance of any <U+017F>uch pretention; nay, it might
haply be affirmed, that <hi>Julia</hi> onely excepted, they were the be<U+017F>t
Matches in the World.</p>
                        <p>You may well imagine that <hi>Antonius</hi> being acquainted with that
goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Octavia</hi> towards him, entertained it with all manner
of acknowledgement and re<U+017F>pect; but by rea<U+017F>on of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
whereby he was a little di<U+017F>ordered, he receaved it not with
any great joy, but found it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e his re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as he was obliged to do. His love was not haply rai<U+017F>ed to that
violence which it might have arrived to, by a further knowledge
of the per<U+017F>on beloved; yet was it <U+017F>trong enough to maintain the
Garri<U+017F>on of his <U+017F>oul again<U+017F>t the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults and eruptions of another
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and to <U+017F>atisfie him, though not without an extraordinary
affliction, that, of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, he mu<U+017F>t either prove ungrateful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Octavia,</hi> and oppo<U+017F>e the advantages were intended him, or
re<U+017F>olve to do a thing, which, how advantageous <U+017F>oever it were,
could not appear to be <U+017F>uch, nay, not indeed <U+017F>upportable to his
prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed imagination. But it being withall certain, that he
was a per<U+017F>on of very great endowments, and a noble education, he
neglected not to do what he thought requi<U+017F>ite, to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
to <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s Si<U+017F>ter, and forced his inclinations <U+017F>o
far, as to do all tho<U+017F>e devoirs and civilities, which he thought
might be expected from him by the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Marcella,</hi> <U+017F>o was
called the elder of the Daughters of <hi>Octavia</hi> by <hi>Marcellus</hi> her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Hu<U+017F>band. Twas indeed with abundance of prudence and
di<U+017F>cretion, that he overcame the violence he did him<U+017F>elf in that
particular; but it was withall ea<U+017F>ie to ob<U+017F>erve, that he made it

as in all appearance he <U+017F>hould have done; or rather that he <U+017F>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tho<U+017F>e that were employed about it, to be<U+017F>tir them<U+017F>elves, he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little or nothing contributory thereto. Tho<U+017F>e who made this
ob<U+017F>ervation were very much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the di<U+017F>-activity he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
in an affair of <U+017F>uch concernment to him, and in<U+017F>tead of
imagining the true cau<U+017F>e, were per<U+017F>waded that his indifference or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97242:11"/>
backwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e proceeded from the little inclination he naturally
had to marriage in general, again<U+017F>t which he had been often
heard to <U+017F>peak, and for which it was known he really had <U+017F>ome
aver<U+017F>ion.</p>
                        <p>But when he had done all he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to by
way of <U+017F>acri<U+017F>ice to that violence he had done his inclinations, and
had <U+017F>ome hours freely to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of, his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ran upon his
misfortune, and his entertainment was of the <U+017F>trange po<U+017F>ture of
his <U+017F>pirit, and the odde effects of his adventure. He did indeed
endeavour all he could, to force out of his thoughts the inevitable
Idaea which would have a place there, whether he would or no, and
was <U+017F>o prejudicial to his quiet and his e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hment. Nay I know
he did all that lay in his power, to get it thence, and it may be his
endeavours had, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of time and his rea<U+017F>on, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
effectual, if he had not afterwards met with <U+017F>omething, that
in<U+017F>tead of contributing to his recovery, confirmed him in his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                        <p>Among tho<U+017F>e friends whom he accounted his mo<U+017F>t intimate and
familiar, <hi>Lucius Scipio,</hi> of the illu<U+017F>trious hou<U+017F>e of the famous
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s, who<U+017F>e glory hath filled the univer<U+017F>e, was the chiefe<U+017F>t. He
was a per<U+017F>on not unworthy the name he bore, as being one, that
while he was yet very young, the hope generally conceaved of
him, was, that he would not degenerate from his Ance<U+017F>tors. He
had a violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for <hi>Emilia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Statilius Scaurus,</hi>
and, being very free and open to <hi>Antonius,</hi> he had given him a
faithful account of the progre<U+017F><U+017F>e of his love, and had carryed
him along with him to <hi>Emilia.</hi> But this affection of his being
of no long <U+017F>tanding; <hi>Antonius</hi>'s acquaintance at that hou<U+017F>e was
not very great, be<U+017F>ides that it was haply the le<U+017F><U+017F>e, by rea<U+017F>on it had
been contrary to our Fathers party; nay I think he had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<hi>Scipio</hi> but once thither. It is <U+017F>cituated upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and
the Garden, which is one of the faire<U+017F>t about <hi>Rome,</hi> reaching down
to the River <U+017F>ide, which is kept off by a Terrace with Pila<U+017F>ters, very
magnificent, and very commodious for walking. It being the
faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of the year, <hi>Emilia</hi> came<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>down thither everynight
to take the fre<U+017F>h-air, and <hi>Scipio,</hi> out of a certain piece of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
very ordinary in <hi>Rome,</hi> taking a little boat, and driving
along the River to <hi>Scaurus</hi>'s Garden, had often <U+017F>een <hi>Emilia</hi> upon
the Terrace, and, without quitting the boat, had had in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<U+017F>everal conver<U+017F>ations with her. And whereas the de<U+017F>ign he
had upon the Lady, was approved by his friends, no body took
any offence at, or cen<U+017F>ured his <U+017F>o doing; for <U+017F>ince the hou<U+017F>e was
alwayes open to him, the conver<U+017F>ation of the Garden was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
him.</p>
                        <p>But meeting one evening with <hi>Antonius</hi> at <hi>Octavia</hi>'s, he invited
him to that diverti<U+017F>ement, and that he did the more freely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he did not conceal any thing from him of his amorous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The melancholy <hi>Antonius</hi> was content to accompany his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97242:12"/>
friend to that walk, and being gotten into the boat with him, they
went down the River towards <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Garden. <hi>Antonius,</hi> out of
a confidence not inferiour to that of <hi>Scipio</hi> towards him, had di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his mind to him, and had fully acquainted him with that
fatal adventure, whereby he came to fall in love with that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Beauty, and which had changed his natural cheerfulne<U+017F><U+017F>e
into <U+017F>o much cloudyne<U+017F><U+017F>e and melancholy. <hi>Scipio</hi> had taken abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of pains to get him the acquaintance of that Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
but his endeavours had proved as fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e as tho<U+017F>e of other
people. Now this con<U+017F>ideration being the ordinary employment of
<hi>Antonius</hi>'s thoughts, it proved al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ubject of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with <hi>Scipio</hi> in the boat, and they talked of the con<U+017F>equences of
that accident, till they came in <U+017F>ight of the place where <hi>Emilia</hi>
was wont to walk. It being as fair and plea<U+017F>ant an evening as
could be wi<U+017F>hed, <hi>Emilia</hi> failed not to be walking upon the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race;
where <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>covered her,
but they could perceave another Lady walking with her. The
Waves of the Tiber did continually wa<U+017F>h the wall of the Terrace,
<U+017F>o that <hi>Scipio</hi> could cau<U+017F>e the boat to be brought as near it as he
plea<U+017F>ed, and the Terrace being of no great height, he could di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
with <hi>Emilia,</hi> and not <U+017F>peak any louder then ordinary, and
di<U+017F>cern all objects with ea<U+017F>e, at a certain di<U+017F>tance, which was not
very great. As they drew neer, <hi>Scipio,</hi> who knew not the Lady
that was with <hi>Emilia,</hi> would have asked <hi>Antonius</hi> whether he had
any acquaintance with her: and <hi>Antonius,</hi> who<U+017F>e thoughts were
otherwi<U+017F>e taken up, and had not <U+017F>o much as looked towards her,
thought to have a fuller <U+017F>ight of her when the boat was come <U+017F>o
neer as that he might ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cern her. But, at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant,
<U+017F>he, not de<U+017F>irous it <U+017F>eems to be known, lets fall her vail over her
face, and deprived them of the <U+017F>ight of it; yet not <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly,
but that the prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Antonius</hi> could perceave <U+017F>ome few raies of
the <U+017F>ame Beauty which he had <U+017F>o well engraven in his memory.
This confu<U+017F>ed and imperfect glimp<U+017F>e put him into <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
that he was no further concerned in the fir<U+017F>t interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> then a <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive <U+017F>alute to <hi>Emilia</hi> and
her Companion amounted to, on the latter whereof his eyes were
<U+017F>o much the more fa<U+017F>tened, out of that <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition that rai<U+017F>ed no
<U+017F>mall tempe<U+017F>t in his heart. At la<U+017F>t he di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed that cloud which
he thought his mind over-<U+017F>pread with <U+017F>o un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably, and with
<U+017F>o little ground, and engaging him<U+017F>elf in the conver<U+017F>ation that was
between <hi>Emilia</hi> and her Friend, he confirmed her by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
in the good opinion <U+017F>he had conceaved of him. <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<U+017F>eemed not at all concerned in their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, though <U+017F>he were
<U+017F>till in place, and it being her de<U+017F>ign not to di<U+017F>cover her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he
accordingly was re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>peak at all. But <hi>Scipio</hi> having
a particular curio<U+017F>ity to be acquainted with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es's Friends
of her own Sex, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing his <U+017F>peech to her: <hi>Since you are a Friend
of</hi> Emilia's, <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>can you have <U+017F>o much cruelty as to conceal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97242:12"/>
your <U+017F>elf any longer from tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons, who, of all the World, have
the greate<U+017F>t honour that may be for whatever is dear to</hi> Emilia? The
Lady, who thought her <U+017F>elf obliged not to be altogether awanting
in point of civility towards a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o much worth as <hi>Scipio,</hi>
e<U+017F>pecially one <U+017F>he knew to be much in the affections of her friend;
or rather out of an imagination, that the accent of her voice
would not be di<U+017F>covered by a per<U+017F>on, with whom <U+017F>he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
above three or four words in her life, would needs put
her <U+017F>elf to the hazard of making him <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer. Seeing him
therefore in a great expectation of it; <hi>Though I am a friend of</hi>
Emilia's, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>yet am I not any of tho<U+017F>e you have <U+017F>een
about her before, and, for my face, it is <U+017F>o little known in</hi> Rome, <hi>that
you would be never the more <U+017F>atisfyed, though you had your full <U+017F>ight
of it.</hi>

                        <p>Tho<U+017F>e few words were all they could get from her, but there
needed no more to di<U+017F>cover her to my Brother, and the accent of
that voice came <U+017F>o full into his memory, that at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllables
<U+017F>he uttered, he knew her again as perfectly as if he had <U+017F>pent his
whole life with her, and to the knowledge of her voice, adding
the great trouble <U+017F>he was in to conceal her <U+017F>elf, and the little
glimp<U+017F>e he had had of her face when <U+017F>he covered, he was ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>atisfied <U+017F>he was the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on, that, in <U+017F>o few minutes, had
rai<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch a combu<U+017F>tion in his <U+017F>oul. Whence it came that he
was at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e at the rencounter, that he continued in <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

affording her the lea<U+017F>ure of a few words to excu<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf to
<hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he was forced to leave them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

had rai<U+017F>ed a certain joy in him, the other cau<U+017F>ed in him an equal

Emilia'<hi>s, <U+017F>ince you de<U+017F>ire it; and let us hope, that, in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he take
any di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure at this action, <U+017F>he may pardon it out of a con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our friend<U+017F>hip.</hi> Having taken this re<U+017F>olution, they cau<U+017F>ed
the boat to put off, and being brought as neer as they could
come to the <U+017F>treet, wherein was the great gate of <hi>Scaurus</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e,
they went about, and <U+017F>oon got thither. <hi>Scipio</hi> being much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in the hou<U+017F>e, went <U+017F>traight to that part where <hi>Emilia</hi>
had her lodgings, where tho<U+017F>e of the hou<U+017F>e were wont to <U+017F>ee
him almo<U+017F>t every day; and, as fortune would have it, they were
no <U+017F>ooner come into her Chamber, but they pre<U+017F>ently perceaved
<hi>Emilia</hi> and her Companion; who, <U+017F>tanding neer a window, with
their backs turned to it, were fallen, as they inferred from their
ge<U+017F>ture, into a very <U+017F>erious di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <hi>Antonius</hi> immediately
knew the beloved countenance of the cruell one that <U+017F>o much
avoided him, and the fre<U+017F>h flames, which at that moment found
a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age quite into his heart, heightned the fatall fire that was
already kindled in his <U+017F>oul. He went towards her very amazed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but <U+017F>he immediately perceaving it, to avoid him, as one
would do, that they think mo<U+017F>t abominable, ha<U+017F>tily leaves <hi>Emilia,</hi>
and runs into a clo<U+017F>et, that lay hard by whereof the door was
open. It happened, that either by accident, or by rea<U+017F>on of
the fright <U+017F>he was put into, <U+017F>he forgot to <U+017F>hut it; <U+017F>o that <hi>Antonius,</hi>
whom the <U+017F>udden tran<U+017F>port of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had deprived of part
of his di<U+017F>cretion, and <U+017F>mothered the re<U+017F>pect he ought <hi>Emila,</hi>
followed her into the clo<U+017F>et, and <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>ate on a chair, runs
to her with <U+017F>uch precipitation, that he was at her feet, and held
her fa<U+017F>t by the knees, in a manner before <U+017F>he had had the time
to perceave what he did. This beautiful enemy of <hi>Antonius,</hi>
being neither able to get away from him, nor yet to endure his
pre<U+017F>ence, who<U+017F>e importunate pur<U+017F>uite very much enflamed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
<U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome few minutes in con<U+017F>idering what re<U+017F>olution
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take, di<U+017F>covering in her countenance the marks of an
extraordinary agitation. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he thought fit to <U+017F>peak fir<U+017F>t, and
endeavouring to force my Brother from her knees, with an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which though it expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>ufficiently incen<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t
him, yet made her not <U+017F>eem the le<U+017F><U+017F>e amiable. <hi>Vpon what account
is it,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>that thou dare<U+017F>t thus violate the re<U+017F>pect due
to my <U+017F>ex and my birth, and by what action is it that I have de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be expo<U+017F>ed to thy unmerciful per<U+017F>ecution? Is it not enough
that thou ha<U+017F>t receaved from me an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which I was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to afford my enemy? Or wilt thou in requital force me once
more to quit</hi> Rome <hi>to avoid what is to me, of all the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
mo<U+017F>t abominable?</hi> The<U+017F>e words pronounced with a <U+017F>hrill
voice, and after a manner ab<U+017F>olutely imperious, <U+017F>truck <hi>Antonius</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97242:14"/>
like a Thunder-clap, and put him for a while to <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of
<U+017F>pirits, that he knew not what to <U+017F>ay. At la<U+017F>t, rallying all the

<hi>Adorable enemy,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>whom I do adore, though,
I do not know, and to whom I am odious, yet am to learn the rea<U+017F>on
why, mi<U+017F>take not for a per<U+017F>ecution, or any want of re<U+017F>pect for your
Divine Beauties, tho<U+017F>e effects that proceed from a cau<U+017F>e ab<U+017F>olutely
contrary. No, the<U+017F>e are the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of my gratitude, and a
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion full of veneration and re<U+017F>pect, which I fatally conceaved for
you, at the very moment I became obliged to you for your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance.
Then it was that I became yours, much out of a con<U+017F>ideration of the
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance you afforded me, but infinitely more through the violent
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion which your cele<U+017F>tial beauties made of a <U+017F>udden in my
heart, which thereupon ab<U+017F>olutely yielded to be yours without the
lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. I have tenderly, nay indeed but too too tenderly for
my own quiet, pre<U+017F>erved the memory of the obligation you put upon
me, and the glorious wound I receaved; and therefore you ought
to be the le<U+017F><U+017F>e offended, if I am at <U+017F>ome pains to find out the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
both to acknowledge your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and to <U+017F>ee again tho<U+017F>e
fair eyes that had hurt me. If my eyes have done you any hurt,</hi>
replies the Unknown Beauty <U+017F>omewhat angrily, <hi>they have done me
<U+017F>uch an injury as I <U+017F>hall never be able to pardon them: and if what
you <U+017F>ay be true, you will find your <U+017F>elf very unfortunate in your
addre<U+017F><U+017F>e to a per<U+017F>on, who cannot, otherwi<U+017F>e then by hatred and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
make any return to your affection. I am indeed ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>

by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome defects in my per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ince</hi> I <hi>am confident</hi> I <hi>could
never have merited it by any action, or thought</hi> I <hi>have ever been
guilty of.</hi> I <hi><U+017F>ee then,</hi> replyed <U+017F>he much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with him, <hi>that</hi>
I <hi>am <U+017F>till unknown to you, and, were you not ignorant whom you <U+017F>peak

<U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>with a very <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive ge<U+017F>ture, that</hi> I <hi>am to learn

u<U+017F>ed to gain a more particular knowledge of you, have proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
<U+017F>o that</hi> I <hi>am now at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what</hi> I <hi>ought to learn, or what</hi>
I <hi>ought to de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ince the knowledge of your per<U+017F>on is of no le<U+017F><U+017F>e
concernment to me then that of your aver<U+017F>ion. You <U+017F>hal know both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
replies the Unknown Beauty, <hi>and you will be no longer to <U+017F>eek
why</hi> I <hi><U+017F>hun you, when</hi> I <hi>have told you that</hi> I <hi>am Daughter to</hi> Cicero,
<hi>and you remember, that you are Son to</hi> Anthony <hi>and</hi> Fulvia, <hi>his
Executioners.</hi> With the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he goes out of the Clo<U+017F>et into
<hi>Emilia</hi>'s Chamber, and out of that into another, where <U+017F>he locked
up her <U+017F>elf for fear of further pur<U+017F>uit.</p>
                        <p>But indeed there was no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take all that pains,
for he, who<U+017F>e pur<U+017F>uit <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o much afraid of, was at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized at the di<U+017F>covery <U+017F>he had made to him of her
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97242:14"/>
<U+017F>elf, that he hardly knew where he was. Not that, from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding
that <U+017F>he whom he loved was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Daughter, he
felt any diminution in his love, nor yet that being his Daughter,
<U+017F>he appeared le<U+017F><U+017F>e amiable; but that all the hopes he might have
conceaved vani<U+017F>hed away in an in<U+017F>tant. And when it came into
his mind, not onely that <hi>Anthony</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Cicero</hi> to be put to
death, but al<U+017F>o that <hi>Fulvia,</hi> his Mother, had cau<U+017F>ed his head and
his hands to be fa<U+017F>tened to the <hi>Ro<U+017F>tra,</hi> where he u<U+017F>ed to make his
Orations, and had committed a thou<U+017F>and cruel indignities on the
reliques of that great per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e memory was <U+017F>o precious
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> he had no more to <U+017F>ay for him<U+017F>elf, and could
not blame his Daughter for the horrour <U+017F>he had conceaved again<U+017F>t
the Son of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Fulvia.</hi> For, though indeed divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
had lo<U+017F>t their lives, during the pro<U+017F>criptions of the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
which yet occa<U+017F>ioned not eternal enmities between families,
yet it is certain that in the death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> there had been <U+017F>ome
circum<U+017F>tances <U+017F>o cruel, and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> naturally inclined to bloud,
had u<U+017F>ed him with <U+017F>o much inhumanity, even after death, that my
Brother, who<U+017F>e memory was of a <U+017F>udden burthen'd with all tho<U+017F>e
things, and who<U+017F>e inclinations were ab<U+017F>olutely vertuous, could
not think on them without horrour, <hi>Woe is me,</hi> cryed he at la<U+017F>t,
ri<U+017F>ing up from the place where he had continued all this while, and
turning to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had been witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of all that
was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Cicero, <hi>hath indeed rea<U+017F>on to avoid the
Son of</hi> Fulvia; <hi>but the <U+017F>on of</hi> Fulvia <hi>hath not his own de<U+017F>tiny at his
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, and cannot forbear loving, whiles he lives, the Daughter of</hi>
Cicero.</p>
                        <p>With the<U+017F>e words he, at the entreaty of <hi>Emilia,</hi> <U+017F>ate down, and
lay under <U+017F>uch a dark cloud of affliction, that for a good while
he was not fit for any conver<U+017F>ation. During that time, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
from <hi>Emilia,</hi> without any de<U+017F>ire of his to be informed, that
<hi>Tullia</hi> was a neer Kin<U+017F>woman of hers, and that her Mother <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
was of the family of the <hi>Scauri,</hi> that the beauty and excellent
endowments of that young Ladie had made no great noi<U+017F>e in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that her per<U+017F>on had not been known there <U+017F>o much as
in all probabilitie it ought to have been; by rea<U+017F>on that while <U+017F>he
was yet verie young, and that during the time the hou<U+017F>e lay under
di<U+017F>grace, her Mother had carryed her to a Country-hou<U+017F>e neer
<hi>Tu<U+017F>culum,</hi> where <U+017F>he had <U+017F>pent her life in <U+017F>olitude, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Rome;</hi> and that haply <U+017F>he had not come thither <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon,
if, upon occa<U+017F>ion of her Mothers death, which happened not long
before, her Brother <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi> who lived at <hi>Rome</hi> after a
verie noble and high rate, and had been nominated <hi>Procon<U+017F>ul</hi> in
<U+017F>ome part of <hi>Africk,</hi> had not <U+017F>ome few daies <U+017F>ince <U+017F>ent for her.
<hi>Emilia</hi> further acquainted <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> that <hi>Tullia,</hi> be<U+017F>ides
the perfections of her body, had a many admirable endowments,
that <U+017F>he had cultivated an excellent di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition with an excellent
education, and that, during the time of her <U+017F>olitude, being addicted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97242:15"/>
to the <U+017F>tudy of the nobler kind of Sciences, <U+017F>he was grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
therein; that <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered abundance of courage and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>ubject to the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of our Sex; and
that <U+017F>he was of a conver<U+017F>ation infinitely plea<U+017F>ant, when <U+017F>he was
among per<U+017F>ons to whom <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to communicate
her <U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>To the<U+017F>e <hi>Emilia</hi> added a many other things in commendation
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> whereof the effect was, that they made the wound of
the unfortunate <hi>Antonius</hi> wider than it was, and di<U+017F>armed him of
all the forces he had to oppo<U+017F>e a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, wherein he expected
not to find any <U+017F>atisfaction. <hi>Scipio</hi> was extreamly troubled at it,
through tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>entiments which friend<U+017F>hip in<U+017F>pired him with;
and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had that e<U+017F>teem for his vertue, as all others had
that were acquainted with it, had an extraordinary compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
for his misfortune, and would have been very glad to find out any
means to comfort and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him. But knowing <hi>Tullia</hi> to be a
per<U+017F>on con<U+017F>tant and unchangeable in her re<U+017F>olution, e<U+017F>pecially in
tho<U+017F>e, wherein <U+017F>he thought her honour concerned, and that from
what <U+017F>he already knew, <U+017F>he fore<U+017F>aw that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate <hi>Antonius</hi>
would find but little <U+017F>atisfaction in his love, <U+017F>he endeavoured to
divert his thoughts from it, with the be<U+017F>t arguments <U+017F>he could
make again<U+017F>t it, and forbore not to tell him whatever <U+017F>he imagined
might put him into <U+017F>ome doubt of the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e, and fear of her
friends humour. My Brother heard her with abundance of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and great expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the re<U+017F>entment he had of her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
in concerning her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much in his misfortune: but when
all was done, he prote<U+017F>ted to her, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to
make any advantage of her good advi<U+017F>e, and that that unfortunate
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was grown <U+017F>o predominant in his <U+017F>oule, that he was out of
all hopes ever to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf free from it, what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>oever he
might take. <hi>Scipio</hi> added his remon<U+017F>trances to tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Emilia,</hi>
and knowing, that, be<U+017F>ides the difficulties, which his friend might
well fear in re<U+017F>pect of <hi>Tullia,</hi> he was in the ready way, by a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
love, to ruine his fortunes which <U+017F>eemed ab<U+017F>olutely to court
him in the de<U+017F>ign which <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> had to marry him to one of his
Neeces, he repre<U+017F>ented to him whatever his friend<U+017F>hip could <U+017F>ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t
that were mo<U+017F>t rational, and mo<U+017F>t likely to prevail with him
in that emergency: but he took pains to as litle purpo<U+017F>e as
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and that poor lover, too too violently prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed, made
them both <U+017F>uch an<U+017F>wers, as rai<U+017F>ed in them more compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ee
him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olute, then hope to <U+017F>ee him of any other mind. <hi>I am
not to learn,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to them at la<U+017F>t, <hi>that in</hi> Tullia'<hi>s aver<U+017F>ion</hi> I <hi>have
a terrible enemy to engage with, nay am further <U+017F>atisfied that the
hatred <U+017F>he hath for our Family is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>tifiable, that I <U+017F>hould find it
a hard matter to find any pretence to condemn her for it. As to the
de<U+017F>ign which</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar <hi>and</hi> Octavia <hi>have upon me, I know it amounts
to tho<U+017F>e advantages, to which, the po<U+017F>ture of my Fortune con<U+017F>idered,</hi>
I <hi>could not rai<U+017F>e my hopes: nor am</hi> I <hi>ignorant, that by my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97242:15"/>
importunate addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to a per<U+017F>on that <U+017F>huns me, and will haply <U+017F>hun

inclinations towards me into ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entments again<U+017F>t me. But there is
<U+017F>omething withal I know much better than I do all this, that is, that
I am not able to hear any rea<U+017F>on in the wretched condition to which
I am reduced; and that whatever the mo<U+017F>t enforcing arguments
might produce where there is freedom of <U+017F>pirit, will have no effect
at all upon a mind fatally and unfortunately prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed. I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely

an effect of the wrath of the gods again<U+017F>t the memory of</hi> Anthony

Cicero, <hi>again<U+017F>t his murtherers, otherwi<U+017F>e then by <U+017F>acrificing their

and <hi>Scipio</hi> could get of him; and a while after, out of a fear to
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Emilia,</hi> by depriving her of the conver<U+017F>ation of her
friend, he took his leave of her in <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad a manner, that it rai<U+017F>ed
in her an extraordinary compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for him, and went out of the
hou<U+017F>e with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who would not by any means leave him; but
it was in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture, and with a countenance <U+017F>o di<U+017F>turbed, that
it was no ea<U+017F>ie matter to know him.</p>
                        <p>From that day he grew more and more melancholy and affected
<U+017F>olitude much more then he had done; and if, while he knew not
who was the object of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the de<U+017F>ire to be acquainted
with it, was his perpetuall torment, the knowledge he had of it
troubled him al<U+017F>o after a <U+017F>trange manner; and the le<U+017F><U+017F>e di<U+017F>turbed
and moved he was at it, the more he <U+017F>eemed to be afflicted and
ca<U+017F>t down. He was <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>een at the Emperours, at <hi>Octavias,</hi>
or at the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Julias,</hi> or in any of the noble<U+017F>t companies of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and if any of his friends came to him, where he ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
them with abundance of civility, they found him <U+017F>o
changed and different from what he was wont to be, that they
had not the patience to <U+017F>ee him in that condition, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them<U+017F>elves in his affliction, though they knew not the
cau<U+017F>e of it. All his thoughts, all his de<U+017F>ignes, aimed at nothing
<U+017F>o much as to find out an opportunity to <U+017F>peak once more to
<hi>Tullia,</hi> out of an imagination, that, if he could but ea<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at
her feet, and entertain her with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which his mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
ran upon, though her <U+017F>oul were made of iron, he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>often it. In this imagination he made a hundred pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate
<U+017F>peeches, and his love in<U+017F>pired him with the tendre<U+017F>t things any
mind could be capable of: but when he had <U+017F>ufficiently rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on what he would have <U+017F>aid to her; he <U+017F>till was to <U+017F>eek for the
opportunity to <U+017F>peak with her.</p>

                           <hi>Tullia</hi> had been in <hi>Rome</hi> but <U+017F>ome few dayes, and her abode
was at her Brother's, <hi>Quint us Cicero,</hi> who lived after the rate of a
Con<U+017F>ular hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uitably to the condition his Father had left him
in; but there was no likelihood <hi>Antonius</hi> <U+017F>hould ever give her a
vi<U+017F>it at that hou<U+017F>e. The Son of <hi>Cicero</hi> had for the family of
<hi>Anthony</hi> a re<U+017F>entment which none could blame him for; and
though, by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Caefars</hi> authority, the factions of the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi>
had been reconciled, and that the families among which
the difference of parties had produced very fatall effects, were
content to be quiet, and forbore openly to endeavour the revenge
of pa<U+017F>t injuries, yet had not that reconciliation, which had put a
Period to the civil wars, <U+017F>o far reunited their hearts, as to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h
friend<U+017F>hip, and <U+017F>ecure the freedom of vi<U+017F>its: nay, though this
had been effected among tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e enmities were grounded
on more incon<U+017F>iderable injuries, yet tho<U+017F>e between the children of
<hi>Cicero</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> amounted to <U+017F>ome thing
more bloody, then to admit of any corre<U+017F>pondence between them:
Be<U+017F>ides, young <hi>Cicero</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of a nature much different from
that of his Father, he was <U+017F>tupid, bruiti<U+017F>h and malicious, and
though he <U+017F>mothered his re<U+017F>entments out of a fear to di<U+017F>cover
them again<U+017F>t a hou<U+017F>e of a far greater fortune than his own; yet
is it certain, that, if he could<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> have done us a mi<U+017F>chief without
any hazard to him<U+017F>elf, he would have embraced the opportunity
to do it, and therefore it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Antonius</hi> <U+017F>hould attempt
the <U+017F>eeing of <hi>Tullia</hi> at her Brothers hou<U+017F>e, without putting his
life into manife<U+017F>t danger. Yet was it not this fear that hindred
him, for that of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing <hi>Tullia</hi> had a far greater influence upon
his <U+017F>pirit, then that of hazarding a life that could not be of much
value to him, con<U+017F>idered with the misfortune that attended it:
Nay, he would have cheerfully ventured into that hou<U+017F>e, though
his enemie's, without any reflection on the danger that might
en<U+017F>ue, had he ob<U+017F>erved in <hi>Tullia</hi> any <U+017F>entiments different from
tho<U+017F>e of her Brother: but it was his unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e, that after he
had <U+017F>ubdued the enemies he contemned, he <U+017F>hould meet with one
that was terrible, again<U+017F>t whom yet he had no arms to defend
him<U+017F>elf. A hundred times did he ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at <hi>Emilia</hi>'s feet,

per<U+017F>wade her Kin<U+017F>woman to afford him that <U+017F>atisfaction. But
<hi>Tullia</hi> was not onely inexorable as to that reque<U+017F>t, but fearing
further that in her vi<U+017F>its to <hi>Emilia,</hi> <U+017F>he might meet with <hi>Antonius</hi>
at her hou<U+017F>e either by accident, or out of de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>he entreated her
not to take it ami<U+017F><U+017F>e if <U+017F>he came not to her any more, till <U+017F>he were
confident that <hi>Antonius</hi> had quitted all inclinations for her;
in<U+017F>omuch that having earne<U+017F>tly intreated her pardon for that re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<U+017F>he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in it <U+017F>o far, that <U+017F>he made no more vi<U+017F>its to her,

or, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>ometimes, it was at <U+017F>uch hours that <U+017F>he was in no
fear of finding my Brother there.</p>
                        <p>This cruel ob<U+017F>tinacy of hers to avoid <hi>Antonius</hi> had almo<U+017F>t put
him into de<U+017F>pair, and yet <U+017F>uch was his unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e, that what
would have recovered any other out of an affection <U+017F>o much
<U+017F>lighted, made his cure the more de<U+017F>perate. All the di<U+017F>coveries
of <hi>Tullia</hi>'s cruelty <U+017F>ignified, in his apprehen<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>o many expre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her vertue, and the re<U+017F>pect <U+017F>he had for the memory of her
Father; and <U+017F>o bewayling his own misfortune, he thought he
could not ju<U+017F>tly charge her with any thing. He con<U+017F>tantly vi<U+017F>ited
all the places <U+017F>he was wont to frequent: but <U+017F>he, being as carefull
to avoid him, as he was diligent to find her out, forbore going
thither as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he perceaved that he had di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>o much:
yet could not all her caution hinder, but that he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Temple, but <U+017F>he either let fall her veyle as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he
perceaved him, or took up <U+017F>uch places, and kept <U+017F>till <U+017F>uch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that he could not come to her. But one day above the re<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>he having not been <U+017F>o careful as at other times, and being gone to
the Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> with the Maids that ordinarily waited on her,
while <U+017F>he was at her devotion, in a remote corner, and at <U+017F>uch a
time as there were hardly any people in the Temple, my Brother,
who had cau<U+017F>ed her to be watched where ever <U+017F>he went, having
had notice of the place where <U+017F>he was, failed not to come thither,
and to <U+017F>peak to her, but with a countenance that <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the fear he was in to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her. <hi>Tullia</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner
perceaved him coming towards her, but <U+017F>he lets fall her veyle, and
by that action had almo<U+017F>t put the <U+017F>ad <hi>Antonius</hi> <U+017F>o far out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that he hardly had the courage to <U+017F>peak to her. However,
he made a <U+017F>hift to recover him<U+017F>elf, and when he was got neer her,
making a halt as if he <U+017F>tayed for <U+017F>ome body, and having looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the door of the Temple, he at la<U+017F>t turned his face to <hi>Tullia,</hi>
whom, though <U+017F>he looked another way, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing his <U+017F>peech to
her; <hi>Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>you <U+017F>hould hope for any
favour from the gods you adore, when you your <U+017F>elf are inexorable
towards tho<U+017F>e men that adore you? Tullia</hi> was <U+017F>ilent a while out of
a re<U+017F>olution not to make <hi>Antonius</hi> any an<U+017F>wer at all; but at la<U+017F>t
conceaving that what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make him would be <U+017F>uch, as <U+017F>he
might haply be rid of him for ever after: <hi>It is not for the Son of</hi>

there is in your <U+017F>hunning me as you do. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hun you while I live,</hi>
replyed <U+017F>he very angrily, <hi>and, if you get not from me, I <U+017F>hall not
onely quit this Temple, but <U+017F>hall leave</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>in ca<U+017F>e you do

ri<U+017F>en out of the place where <U+017F>he was, but <hi>Antonius,</hi> thinking he
could not any further pre<U+017F><U+017F>e her without incivility, prevented her
departure; and having made her a low reverence, he went from
her, <U+017F>o clouded with affliction, that for that whole day he was not
capable of any conver<U+017F>ation.</p>
                        <p>Though <hi>Antonius</hi> found it a great difficulty to conceal from
tho<U+017F>e who were acquainted with his natural cheerfulne<U+017F><U+017F>e, the
change which that unfortunate pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had wrought in him, yet
were they ignorant of the cau<U+017F>e, and for a good <U+017F>pace of time
onely <hi>Scipio</hi> knew the my<U+017F>tery of it. But, at la<U+017F>t, it came to the
knowledge of diver<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons by <U+017F>everall di<U+017F>coveries <U+017F>ufficiently
extraordinary, but particularly by one which, becau<U+017F>e it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and withall very rare, made no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e in <hi>Rome.</hi> The
Emperour, <hi>Livia, Julia, Octavia,</hi> and all the Illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>ons
about <hi>Rome</hi> were one day a<U+017F><U+017F>embled in the Cirque, where they
were to be entertained with the combats of <U+017F>avage bea<U+017F>ts, by
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had brought them out of <hi>Africk</hi> to that purpo<U+017F>e, as
you know it is an ordinary thing at <hi>Rome,</hi> as al<U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e who
would have the reputation of being magnificent, do often enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the people with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ports. Though <hi>Tullia</hi> went very <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into great companies, as well by rea<U+017F>on of the mourning <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>till in for her Mother, as out of a fear of meeting <hi>Antonius,</hi>
yet this day <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf obliged to go, not onely upon the
account of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was at the charge of the diverti<U+017F>ement,
but al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e it was her Brothers will <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould go, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he brought her thither with divers other Per<U+017F>ons of their
Family and Alliance. <hi>Antonius,</hi> who was very much in hope <U+017F>he
would be there, and expected, with much impatience, to <U+017F>ee her,
ob<U+017F>erved, very much to his <U+017F>atisfaction, the place where <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate,
which was near enough to her Brother, and <U+017F>ome of her Kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women:
but found withall to his grief, that <hi>Lucius Cecinna,</hi> a
young man, of an Illu<U+017F>trious Hou<U+017F>e, and one that had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of courting her, having waited upon her thither, <U+017F>ate down
by her. This <U+017F>ight made <hi>Antonius</hi> blu<U+017F>h, and enflamed him with
indignation and jealou<U+017F>ie; yet dur<U+017F>t he not <U+017F>eat him<U+017F>elf near <hi>Tullia,</hi>
out of a fear <U+017F>he would take it unkindly, and a confidence that <U+017F>he
would admit no conver<U+017F>ation with him; but he got into a place,
which, being not very far from her, and at one of the Angles of
the Amphitheatre, joyning to that where <U+017F>he was, gave him the
advantage of <U+017F>eeing her better than any other part where he
could have placed him<U+017F>elf. The <U+017F>eats of per<U+017F>ons of quality are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97242:17"/>
in the lowe<U+017F>t Stage, and neere<U+017F>t the <hi>Area,</hi> which is the place where
the combats are fought, whether they be between <hi>Bea<U+017F>ts</hi> or
<hi>Gladiators:</hi> <U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e of that rank may lean again<U+017F>t certain
Pila<U+017F>ters, whereby the Cirque is compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about, and which is
rai<U+017F>ed up to <U+017F>uch a height, as to <U+017F>ecure them from the fury of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

behind that, being rai<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>tanding at a greater di<U+017F>tance, are
for the people, who are ordinarily admitted to the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ights, to
their very great delight and entertainment. I went thither my
<U+017F>elf that day with the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Julia,</hi> though we were both of us
at that time but in the thirteenth year of our age, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
I can give you a more particular account of this action,
then of <U+017F>ome others at which I was not pre<U+017F>ent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> had his eyes continually fa<U+017F>tened on <hi>Tullia's</hi> face, who
never was guilty of <U+017F>o much as one look towards him. This amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Prince looked upon that freedom of conver<U+017F>ation which was
between her and <hi>Cecinua,</hi> with a very jealous eye, and with no
<U+017F>mall di<U+017F>turbance of mind: and if any one had concerned him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>o far as to mind his actions, he might ea<U+017F>ily have ob<U+017F>erved in his
countenance the agitations of his <U+017F>oul. There had pa<U+017F>t diver<U+017F>e
combats of <U+017F>everal bea<U+017F>ts, which found the Spectators abundance
of <U+017F>port and entertainment, and they were going to open the door
to let in a Tygre and a Bear of a prodigious bulk, to <U+017F>et them a
fighting together, when <hi>Antonius,</hi> who had his eyes <U+017F>till fixed on
<hi>Tullia,</hi> <U+017F>aw, that amid<U+017F>t the conver<U+017F>ation <U+017F>he had with <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and
certain Ladies that <U+017F>ate about her, <U+017F>he took out a little box, <U+017F>et
with divers rich Diamonds, wherein was her own picture, which
her Mother had cau<U+017F>ed to be taken about a year before, and which
<U+017F>he had given her at her death. She had <U+017F>hewn it to tho<U+017F>e Ladies,
and <hi>Cecinna</hi> had it in his hands a good <U+017F>pace: but at la<U+017F>t going to
re<U+017F>tore it to <hi>Tullia,</hi> the box, through negligence, <U+017F>lipt out of his
hands, and <U+017F>he leaning on the raile, it fell down into the <hi>Area,</hi> ju<U+017F>t
when the two furious bea<U+017F>ts were coming into it with looks <U+017F>o full
of terrour, that they put the Spectators into <U+017F>ome fear. <hi>Tullia,</hi> being
extreamly troubled at the fall of the box, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>pected <U+017F>o much,
into a place, whence in all likelihood there would not be any <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>perate as to fetch it again, gave a great outcry, and by her
countenance and all her actions expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed an extraordinary di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
at that accident. The Emperour, and all that were pre<U+017F>ent,
<U+017F>oon came to under<U+017F>tand it, but there was no po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility to recover
it while the bea<U+017F>ts were within the Cirque. <hi>Cecinna,</hi> who was
partly the occa<U+017F>ion of the falling of the box, endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade
<hi>Tullia</hi> to patience, by telling her, that, after the combat of
the bea<U+017F>ts, he would go and find it for her: but <U+017F>he giving too
much way to her indignation upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>light an occa<U+017F>ion, an<U+017F>wered
him very roundly, that had <U+017F>he been a man, <U+017F>he would have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her life to fetch her picture. She had no <U+017F>ooner delivered
the<U+017F>e words, but young <hi>Antonius,</hi> whom his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had at that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97242:18"/>
time ab<U+017F>olutely deve<U+017F>ted of all rea<U+017F>on, di<U+017F>tracted as to all matter
of con<U+017F>ideration, not onely of the hazard whereto he expo<U+017F>ed
him<U+017F>elf without any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, but al<U+017F>o of the noi<U+017F>e which that
action mu<U+017F>t needs make, contrary to the de<U+017F>ign he had to keep
his love <U+017F>ecret, turning towards that <U+017F>ide where <hi>Tullia</hi> was; <hi>Fair</hi>
Tullia, <U+017F>aid he, loud enough to be heard by her, <hi>you <U+017F>hall find
there is a man who dares hazard his life to do you this incon<U+017F>ider able
<U+017F>ervice;</hi> and thereupon, leaning upon the raile, he vaulted over
it into the Cirque. I was ever of opinion, that <hi>Antonius,</hi> a per<U+017F>on
naturally di<U+017F>creet, would never have been guilty of an action <U+017F>o
extravagant, had he not been tran<U+017F>ported by an over-violent
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. But I imagined withall, as diver<U+017F>e others did, that to do
<hi>Tullia</hi> that <U+017F>ervice, whereof the con<U+017F>equence de<U+017F>erved not he
<U+017F>hould expo<U+017F>e his life to <U+017F>o great a danger, he had been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
partly by a belief he was of, that he might not haply, while
he lived, meet with <U+017F>o noble an occa<U+017F>ion to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his love to
her, and partly by a de<U+017F>ire he had to let her know the difference
there was between him and <hi>Cecinna,</hi> whom <U+017F>he preferred, and
favoured even in his pre<U+017F>ence. However it were, this action
rai<U+017F>ed a many outcryes among the Spectators, even to the Emperour
him<U+017F>elf, who had a great love and e<U+017F>teem to my Brother. My Si<U+017F>ter
and I were almo<U+017F>t out of our <U+017F>elves to <U+017F>ee it, <hi>Octavia</hi> was not a
little troubled at the accident, nay there was hardly any one in
that great A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, that was not troubled at it, onely <hi>Antonius</hi>
<U+017F>eemed to be the per<U+017F>on that had any confidence, and though he
were a little <U+017F>tartled at his alighting, by rea<U+017F>on of the height of
the place whence he had leapt down, yet immediately recovering
him<U+017F>elf, he drew his <U+017F>word, and went with an undaunted courage
towards that <U+017F>ide where the box lay <U+017F>parkling among the <U+017F>and.
He was <U+017F>o happy as to take it up without any hindrance, and <U+017F>o
indi<U+017F>creet as to open it in the <U+017F>ame place, and to have the patience
to look on the beautiful picture of <hi>Tullia</hi> that was enclo<U+017F>ed within
it. Yet was it not with <U+017F>o little caution, but he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ufficiently
on his guard, to defend him<U+017F>elf if the bea<U+017F>ts came to fa<U+017F>ten on
him: but as he went towards the door at which he was to go out,
he made no more ha<U+017F>t than ordinary, and retreated <U+017F>o as if he had
not been in the lea<U+017F>t fear of the two bea<U+017F>ts that were within the
Cirque. The Bear <U+017F>tirred not from the place <U+017F>he was in, but the
Tigre came up to my Brother with his <U+017F>parkling eyes, and in <U+017F>uch
a po<U+017F>ture, as put all that were pre<U+017F>ent into a fright. <hi>Antonius</hi>
might have gained the door before the Tygre could have fa<U+017F>tened
on him, if he would have run for it, but <U+017F>uch a flight he thought
unworthy his courage; and therefore <U+017F>eeing this terrible enemy
coming towards him, he <U+017F>tood and expected him, and pre<U+017F>ented
the point of his <U+017F>word to him with an admirable con<U+017F>tancy. You
may well imagine, that all tho<U+017F>e to whom <hi>Antonius</hi>'s life was any
way dear, were not a little troubled at the accident, but it was the
plea<U+017F>ure of the gods, that when the furious bea<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw the gli<U+017F>tering
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97242:18"/>
of the <U+017F>word, it made a halt, and <U+017F>eemed uncertain what re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take: when the Emperour having called out to tho<U+017F>e of
his guard that were about him, immediately to kill it, it was <U+017F>hot
with above twenty arrows, and fell down dead at <hi>Antonius</hi>'s feet.
He <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>omewhat troubled at the death of the bea<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>aying he was very <U+017F>orry he had deprived the Emperour and the
Spectators of part of their entertainment, and when he thought
he might retire without di<U+017F>honour, (for the Bear had not <U+017F>tirred
from the place) he came to the door which they kept open for
him, and by the <U+017F>tairs joyning thereto, came up into the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre.
As all that were pre<U+017F>ent had a <U+017F>ecret admiration for what
he had done, <U+017F>o did all gladly make way for him, it being percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it was his intention to re<U+017F>tore <hi>Tullia</hi> her picture; and
accordingly having without much trouble gotten up to the place
where <U+017F>he was, he comes to her with a <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive action, and
pre<U+017F>enting her with the box: <hi>Were I not odious in your <U+017F>ight,
Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>I would entreat you to entertain the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable
<U+017F>ervice I have done you without aver<U+017F>ion: and if I am <U+017F>o
unhappy as that I cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e, I be<U+017F>eech your acceptance and
acknowledgement of that I would have done you by expo<U+017F>ing my life
which you <U+017F>o much dete<U+017F>t.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the enmity which is between the Children of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and
the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Anthony,</hi> being known to all the World, no body
took any exceptions at tho<U+017F>e words of <hi>Antonius;</hi> but there were
many who thought that that action <U+017F>hould have obliged <hi>Tullia</hi> to
<U+017F>ome kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e, or at lea<U+017F>t to receave that <U+017F>ervice with a <U+017F>eeming
civility. But her deportment was quite otherwi<U+017F>e, and in<U+017F>tead
of making any acknowledgement of the <U+017F>ervice he had done her,
<U+017F>he turned her face another way, and vouch<U+017F>afed not <U+017F>o much as
either to make him any an<U+017F>wer, or receave out of his hands the
picture he pre<U+017F>ented to her. This action, which di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed all
that were pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>truck <hi>Antonius</hi> to the very heart; but having
fortified him<U+017F>elf with an extraordinary courage, and done an
action <U+017F>o full of gallantry, that he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to
pre<U+017F><U+017F>e it home: <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, not without <U+017F>ome violence

but withal would have been much troubled to <U+017F>ee him keep his
Si<U+017F>ter picture. But he whom they had greate<U+017F>t influence on, was
the amorous <hi>Cecinna,</hi> who being pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with <hi>Tullia,</hi>
could not, without much di<U+017F>turbance within him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ee her picture
in the hands of a man, whom he looked on as his Rival, and withal
a powerful one: <U+017F>o that he would undertake to <hi>Antonius,</hi> to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97242:19"/>
per<U+017F>wade <hi>Tullia</hi> to receave the picture, and while he de<U+017F>ired it,
<hi>Cicero</hi> reached forth his hand to receave it from him. But <hi>Antonius</hi>
looking on them both with a certain contempt, and with a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
<U+017F>mile; <hi>Tis not thee,</hi> Cicero, <U+017F>aid he to them, <hi>and much

<hi>is content it <U+017F>hould remain in my hands, I <U+017F>hall keep it no otherwi<U+017F>e
then I would do my life. If thou would<U+017F>t have had it, added he,
looking on</hi> Cecinna, <hi>thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t have gone for it to the place where
it fell through thy negligence; and if thou art <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous of it,
thou mu<U+017F>t force it out of a place, whence there will haply be as much
difficulty to get it, as from among Bears and Tygres. However it
be, I hear prote<U+017F>t before the gods, that I <U+017F>hall never part with it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
till</hi> Tullia <hi>de<U+017F>ire it of me her <U+017F>elf, and that I will never put

                        <p>With the<U+017F>e words he left <hi>Tullia,</hi> and, without any more adoe,
immediately quitted the Amphitheatre, out of a fear that <hi>Tullia</hi>
might change her mind, and call for her picture. She was upon
the point to do it, as being de<U+017F>irous it <U+017F>hould not remain in his
hands, nay indeed would not have been well <U+017F>atisfied to leave it
with any man, how great an affection <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he might have for
him: but thinking there were other wayes to retrive it, <U+017F>he
thought it better to have patience for <U+017F>ome dayes, then to remit
any thing of her di<U+017F>dain, and <U+017F>toop <U+017F>o low as to de<U+017F>ire it, after

Per<U+017F>ons.</p>
                        <p>This action rai<U+017F>ed no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e in <hi>Rome,</hi> and found all people
matter of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Several judgements pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed upon it, there
were a many that attributed it to the true cau<U+017F>e, others made it
onely a piece of gallantry, and the effect of a violent de<U+017F>ire of
glory, a thing not incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the fiery humour of a young
man: Nay, <U+017F>ome pitching upon an opinion probable enough
according to the intention of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he made
of it, which was, that, having di<U+017F>covered <hi>Tullia</hi> in that great
A<U+017F><U+017F>embly to be the Lady from whom he had receaved <U+017F>uch
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance when his hor<U+017F>e fell under him, whom till then he had
not known, and had <U+017F>ought out <U+017F>o much, though he knew not
who <U+017F>he was, imagined that he had re<U+017F>olved to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e by <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>ervice, the re<U+017F>entment he <U+017F>till had for the kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had done
him, and that ju<U+017F>t then an opportunity offering it <U+017F>elf, he thought
he could not, without ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>le, that is, without being accounted
either an ungrateful per<U+017F>on, or a man of little courage, let it <U+017F>lip.
With this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e did my Brother <U+017F>atisfie the Emperour, who
blamed him very much for expo<U+017F>ing his life to <U+017F>o great a danger
without any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity; but that account of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e being
probable enough, <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who could not di<U+017F>approve tho<U+017F>e
actions that argued courage, had a greater e<U+017F>teem for <hi>Antonius</hi>
then he had before. <hi>Octavia,</hi> who was as tender of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Anthony,</hi> as <U+017F>he was of her own, e<U+017F>pecially of him <U+017F>he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97242:19"/>
intended to make her Son in Law, entertained this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as
the Emperour did, and attributed to gratitude, excellency of
nature, and the courage of <hi>Antonius:</hi> what was meerly a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tration
of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. And yet what had pa<U+017F>t at the clo<U+017F>ure of
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, concerning <hi>Tullia</hi>'s picture, which he had refu<U+017F>ed to
re<U+017F>tore either to <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Cecinna,</hi> with words pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate enough,
might cau<U+017F>e a little <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion; but it might al<U+017F>o be attributed to
pure gallantry, which might produce that effect in a per<U+017F>on
of the age my Brother was then of, and that, after the doing of
<U+017F>o noble an action. In fine, every one cen<U+017F>ured it according to
his inclination; and <hi>Antonius,</hi> whatever might be <U+017F>aid to him,
could not repent him of it, though he was extreamly troubled at
<hi>Tullia</hi>'s deportment towards him, and that the vexation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
thereat, put him <U+017F>ometimes into a re<U+017F>olution, to do
what lay in his power, to free him<U+017F>elfe of that cruell <U+017F>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                        <p>Some dayes after, having intreated <hi>Scipio</hi> to bring my Brother

her that he <U+017F>hould think him<U+017F>elf extreamly happy, if <U+017F>he would be
plea<U+017F>ed to lay any commands upon him, <U+017F>he told him before
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who was pre<U+017F>ent, that <U+017F>he was de<U+017F>irous to have <U+017F>ome di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e

all the intere<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had in him to get it, upon the confidence
<U+017F>he had that my Brother would not deny that <U+017F>atisfaction to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
for whom he <U+017F>eemed &amp; profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to have a very great e<U+017F>teem.
<hi>Antonius</hi> entertained this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Emilia's</hi> with abundance
of re<U+017F>pect, and when <U+017F>he had given over <U+017F>peaking, <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid
he to her, <hi>it is not without rea<U+017F>on your friend is per<U+017F>waded that you

doubt but that <U+017F>he would make this reque<U+017F>t to you, when ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
be content to have her picture again: and I further engage my <U+017F>elf,

                           <hi>ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf under,</hi> I <hi><U+017F>hall tell you, that for the favour of one vi<U+017F>it
from</hi> Tullia, <hi><U+017F>he <U+017F>hall receave her picture. Tis the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he can do,
if <U+017F>he have any de<U+017F>ire to have it again: and if <U+017F>he deny me <U+017F>o poor
a reque<U+017F>t, you are to imagine it is her plea<U+017F>ure</hi> I <hi><U+017F>hould keep it: all</hi> I
<hi>de<U+017F>ire is to put it into her own hands in your pre<U+017F>ence, and you <U+017F>hall
be privy to our conver<U+017F>ation. And, to acquaint you with what is
mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret to my thoughts, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee</hi> I <hi>have but this onely means
left me to procure one vi<U+017F>it more of</hi> Tullia <hi>while</hi> I <hi>live, methinks you
cannot without cruelty take it away from me. Emilia</hi> found a great
deal of rea<U+017F>on in my Brothers di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and <hi>Scipio</hi> adding his
per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions to the others to prevaile with her, they brought her to
this at la<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed to u<U+017F>e all the intere<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could
with <hi>Tullia</hi> to oblige her to <U+017F>ee <hi>Antonius</hi> once more, and to receave
her picture from his own hands, according as he was engaged by
his oath.</p>
                        <p>She made it her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e that very day, but to no purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o
that <hi>Antonius</hi> under<U+017F>tood by her, the next, that all the entreaties
<U+017F>he could make to her, could not induce that heard-hearted Beauty
to conde<U+017F>cend thereto, and that, at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he had with a <U+017F>trange
con<U+017F>tancy prote<U+017F>ted, that <U+017F>he had rather lo<U+017F>e her picture, by an
accident whence it might not be inferred that <U+017F>he had any de<U+017F>ign
to favour <hi>Antonius,</hi> then re<U+017F>olve to <U+017F>ee him, and to <U+017F>peak, with her
will, to a man, who<U+017F>e name tho<U+017F>e of her family could not hear
without horrour. My Brother was extreamly ca<U+017F>t down at this
ob<U+017F>tinacy of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and entertained <hi>Emilia</hi> with diver<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
which moved her to much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for him: but he al<U+017F>o
continued firm to the re<U+017F>olution he had made not to deliver the
picture, not that he could do <hi>Tullia</hi> this di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure without <U+017F>ome
repugnance, but that, be<U+017F>ides the comfort he receaved from the
<U+017F>ight of that dear image, he thought he could not with honour
re<U+017F>tore it, after the prote<U+017F>tation he had made not to do it before
<hi>Cecinna</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who pretended to be <U+017F>o much concerned in it.
What confirmed him further in this re<U+017F>olution, was, that, <U+017F>ome
dayes after, he under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Cicero,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>pight him,
had be<U+017F>towed his Si<U+017F>ter on <hi>Cecinna;</hi> and it was conceaved that
within a few dayes he was to marry her, and indeed it was certain
that he had promi<U+017F>ed her to him, and though <hi>Tullia</hi> had not till

contradiction entertained the Hu<U+017F>band he was plea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
have. This news put my Brother into <U+017F>uch violent tran<U+017F>ports of
grief, as you may ea<U+017F>ily imagine, if you con<U+017F>ider well what I have
told you concerning tho<U+017F>e of his Love; nay, it is almo<U+017F>t a miracle
that he did not di<U+017F>cover it by <U+017F>ome action <U+017F>uitable to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
he was hurryed by. At fir<U+017F>t all his thoughts ran upon <U+017F>ome thing
that was violent and fatal; and when he imagined to him<U+017F>elf that
his Rival was happier then he, did not onely deprive him of what
he loved, but might haply be the cau<U+017F>e of all <hi>Tullia</hi>'s rigour

towards him, had prevented him by an affection, that made her

her again<U+017F>t him more than any con<U+017F>ideration of the death
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> he could not oppo<U+017F>e the torrent of his re<U+017F>entments, nor

walking in a furious manner, <hi>it was then the love of</hi> Cecinna <hi>that
made</hi> Tullia's <hi>heart impenetrable as to all compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and it is</hi>
Cecinna <hi>that robs me of this unmerciful Beauty, and, with her, of
all the <U+017F>atisfaction and de<U+017F>ire of life<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

his backwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e to recover her picture, and the confidence he had
<U+017F>oon to be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of the per<U+017F>on, hath made him take it the more
indifferently to <U+017F>ee her fair image in the hands of an unfortunate
Rival. Tis the knowledge he had of my misfortune made him neglect
what haply both his intere<U+017F>t and his honour had obliged him to do,
and I am <U+017F>atisfied he had courage enough to take the advice of his
reputation in that emergency, if the hope of a greater happine<U+017F><U+017F>e
had not made him le<U+017F><U+017F>e earne<U+017F>t for what was of le<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>equence.</hi>
Whereupon he walked for a good while, without <U+017F>peaking at all,
then breaking forth into his ordinary tran<U+017F>ports, <hi>Think not,</hi> Cecinna,
<hi><U+017F>aid he, that I re<U+017F>ign</hi> Tullia <hi>to thee; as thou ha<U+017F>t done her picture to
me; it <U+017F>hall co<U+017F>t thee the pure<U+017F>t of thy bloud to di<U+017F>pute who<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hall be, and <U+017F>ince I have hazarded my life for her picture, it is but

                        </p>
                        <p>This was the re<U+017F>olution he took; but when he thought him<U+017F>elf
fully confirmed in it, he met with <U+017F>uch difficulties in that de<U+017F>ign,
which he was not a little <U+017F>tartled at. He had rea<U+017F>on to fear he
might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> who, upon what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in his pre<U+017F>ence
fearing the con<U+017F>equence, had forbidden them very <U+017F>everely to
attempt any thing one again<U+017F>t another. Nay, there was yet <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in it, as to what re<U+017F>entment the Emperour might have
of it; for when he con<U+017F>idered that he could not quarrel with
<hi>Cecinna</hi> upon the account of any intere<U+017F>t in <hi>Tullia,</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
openly, and di<U+017F>covering at the <U+017F>ame time the little regard
he had for the advantageous de<U+017F>ign which the Emperour and
<hi>Octavia</hi> had for him, and that in a conjuncture on which his ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
fortune depended, he knew not what cour<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould take
to overcome that difficulty. And yet this was not con<U+017F>iderable to
him, in compari<U+017F>on of the fear he was in of <hi>Tullia's</hi> indignation,
as putting it out of all doubt that he mu<U+017F>t needs force her to the
extremities of enmity towards him, by putting him<U+017F>elf in a po<U+017F>ture
to take away that mans life whom <U+017F>he accepted for her Hu<U+017F>band.
To be <U+017F>hort, this con<U+017F>ideration prevailed <U+017F>o far upon him, that he
hardly minded the re<U+017F>t, and how far <U+017F>oever he might be from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving
the cruel treatments he receaved from that incenced
Beauty, yet was his <U+017F>oule guilty of <U+017F>uch extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects
towards her, that he would have lookt death in the
face with le<U+017F><U+017F>e di<U+017F>turbance, than the occa<U+017F>ion of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her.</p>

The<U+017F>e contradictions kept his thoughts in an aequilibrium in
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a perplexity; <U+017F>o that finding it a hard matter to fix on
any thing, he continued <U+017F>ome dayes without fa<U+017F>tening on any re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
During that time he delighted altogether in <U+017F>olitude,
avoiding the company even of his Friend <hi>Scipio,</hi> and retiring into
the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary places, where he would not admit any of his own
people to be about him. Without the gate called <hi>Porta Capena,</hi>
there is a little Wood neer the fair Gardens of <hi>Metellus,</hi> where the
<U+017F>hadyne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>olitude of the place afford very plea<U+017F>ant walking,
for <U+017F>uch as avoid company. <hi>Antonius</hi> going out of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s
Garden, was directed thither by his own cruel thoughts, or rather
by <U+017F>ome genius, who would determine his irre<U+017F>olutions. He
walked there a long time alone, (having left tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervants that he
brought with him from home, which he could not di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>e, at the
Garden door of <hi>Metellus</hi>) and had endeavoured to find out,
though with no <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e, what might prevent the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of
<hi>Cecinna,</hi> without any violation of the re<U+017F>pect he ought <hi>Tullia,</hi>
or incurring the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, (if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible) of the generous
<hi>Octavia</hi> and the Emperour, when coming to a cro<U+017F><U+017F>e-walk, he <U+017F>pies
a man coming all alone towards the place where he was, and
having looked on him very attentively, when he was come <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neer, he found him to be <hi>Cecinna.</hi> The <U+017F>ight of him enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Antonius</hi> with indignation and jealou<U+017F>ie; and though he
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected what de<U+017F>ign brought <hi>Cecinna</hi> towards him, yet did he
mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t his own thoughts of mi<U+017F>take, and was in <U+017F>ome fear he
<U+017F>hould not have <U+017F>o much power over him<U+017F>elf as to reflect, in that
emergency, upon tho<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations whereby his hands were as
yet tyed up. In this uncertainty he expected him as ready to
fight, and in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture as put <hi>Cecinna</hi> into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now my Brother being a per<U+017F>on of higher quality in</hi> Rome <hi>than

not, replyed <hi>Cecinna,</hi> but you know that <U+017F>ufficiently well already, and
if you but remember that <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture is <U+017F>till in your hands, you
are at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>atisfied of the great concernment <hi>I</hi> have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

was of opinion it might be gotten out of your hands without my

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97242:21"/>
friends hath proved ineffectual, you will not think it <U+017F>trange, if, as
things now <U+017F>tand between us, <hi>I</hi> endeavour to obtain that from you
which you had denyed them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> looking on him with a <U+017F>cornful <U+017F>mile, There is indeed
but very little likelihood, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him, I</hi> <U+017F>hould grant <hi>Cecinna</hi> what
<hi>I</hi> had denyed <hi>Emilia:</hi> be<U+017F>ides, <hi>I</hi> am of opinion, that if you had been
<U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous of <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture, you would have gone for it to the
place whence <hi>I</hi> took it. Though <hi>I</hi> was much le<U+017F><U+017F>e obliged to do it than
you, it were unju<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould, with the hazard of my life, procure a
thing you had <U+017F>lighted, to be<U+017F>tow it on you with <U+017F>o much ea<U+017F>e, and
you may haply find your <U+017F>elf very much mi<U+017F>taken, if you imagine
there may be le<U+017F><U+017F>e danger to get it out of my hands, then to recover
it out of the <hi>Area</hi> of the Amphitheatre. Had there been any nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for that action, <hi>replyed Cecinna, I</hi> <U+017F>hould have done it as well as
you: And if there had been any ju<U+017F>tice, <hi>interrupted</hi> Antonius <hi>very
roundly,</hi>
to re<U+017F>tore what <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>o well gotten, <hi>I</hi> had re<U+017F>tored it to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and not to you. However it be, <hi>Cecinna,</hi> you ought not to
expect it, as being the la<U+017F>t of all men for whom <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould have that
complyance. I thought indeed, replyed <hi>Cecinna,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be forced
to tho<U+017F>e extremities with you, which the Emperour hath forbidden
us: and it is with that de<U+017F>ign that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ought you out, re<U+017F>olved to
take away either your life, or <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture. This is it <hi>I</hi> expected
from thee, replyed <hi>Antonius</hi> fiercely, and which <hi>I</hi> thought I had <U+017F>o
<U+017F>ufficiently obliged thee to, as to make thee contemn all other con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <p>With the<U+017F>e words they both layd hands on their <U+017F>words, and
drew at the <U+017F>ame time, there being not any body neer to hinder
them. They exchanged a many blows, with much more fury then cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>pection.
<hi>Cecinna</hi> fought with abundance of courage, but with
little good fortune; and being over-ra<U+017F>h and incon<U+017F>iderate, he
receaved two mortal wounds in the body, upon which he fell
down at my Brother's feet, with very little remainder of life.
<hi>Antonius</hi> had no doubt wi<U+017F>hed the death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and had
behaved him<U+017F>elf in that duel with abundance of indignation and
animo<U+017F>ity again<U+017F>t him; but being a per<U+017F>on of a great and noble
<U+017F>oul, <U+017F>eeing him fall with all the mortal <U+017F>ignes, his anger vani<U+017F>hed,
and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion took place in his heart, into which the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions
whereby it was then moved, were not again<U+017F>t its admittance. He
came to <hi>Cecinna,</hi> to do him all the good he could, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>top his bloud, per<U+017F>waded him to take courage, by all the
words which might expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the regret and <U+017F>orrow he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at his misfortune.</p>
                        <p>But while he was employed in this compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate office, there
comes, by an accident, you cannot but be a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at, a Chariot,
full of Ladies, to take the plea<U+017F>ure of a <U+017F>olitary walk in the
Wood, to the place where they were: and the Ladies, who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

without any jealou<U+017F>ie of what had happened, to the very place

where the unfortunate <hi>Cecinna</hi> was expiring his la<U+017F>t, in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

<U+017F>pectacle rai<U+017F>ed in the Ladies; but it will be hard for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
that of my Brother, when with <hi>Emilia</hi> and <U+017F>ome other
Ladies of his acquaintance, he <U+017F>aw the cruel <hi>Tullia,</hi> that very
<hi>Tullia</hi> whom he had <U+017F>o well engraven in his <U+017F>oul. I leave it to
you to <U+017F>upply the difficulty of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion I meet with in this <U+017F>trange

agitations of the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>ouls in <U+017F>o unexpected an adventure. If
<hi>Antonius</hi> was <U+017F>urprized to <U+017F>ee that <hi>Tullia</hi> whom he adored, that
<hi>Tullia,</hi> who <U+017F>hunned him with all the cruelty imaginable; nay,
the <U+017F>ame <hi>Tullia,</hi> who<U+017F>e Lover, that was to be within a few dayes
her Hu<U+017F>band, he had killed; you may well think that <hi>Tullia,</hi> on
the other <U+017F>ide, was not le<U+017F><U+017F>e a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to meet with that <hi>Antonius,</hi>
whom <U+017F>he avoided, <U+017F>tanding over the expiring <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and <U+017F>oiled
with the bloud of a man <U+017F>he was to be married to. She had
not had, tis true, any violent affection for him, yet it is withall
certain <U+017F>he had no di<U+017F>-inclination towards him; and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had
been acquainted with the de<U+017F>ign her Brother had to make her his
Wife, <U+017F>he had entertained in her heart all the love <U+017F>he thought
her <U+017F>elf obliged to have, for a per<U+017F>on that was <U+017F>hortly to be her
Hu<U+017F>band: <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ee him weltring in his bloud, and
expiring at his enemies feet, without feeling an extraordinary
affliction, and whatever her <U+017F>oul was capable of, upon an accident
of that nature. She at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight gave a great outcry, and was
ready to <U+017F>wound in <hi>Emilia's</hi> arms, who made a <U+017F>hift to hold her up,
and, a little after, ca<U+017F>ting her eyes on both <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cecinna,</hi>
on the one, with all the demon<U+017F>trations of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and on the
other with all tho<U+017F>e of indignation, <U+017F>heding tears for <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and
darting forth her wrathful looks on <hi>Antonius,</hi> <U+017F>he continued for
<U+017F>ome minutes in an uncertainty as to what re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
take, whether to avoid what <U+017F>he hated, or to <U+017F>uccour what <U+017F>he was
obliged to love. And whereas <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be rather carried away
by the aver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had for my Brother, or at lea<U+017F>t inclined rather
to the motives <U+017F>he conceaved <U+017F>he had to avoid him, then to the
affection <U+017F>he had for <hi>Cecinna,</hi> her fir<U+017F>t reflections <U+017F>eemed to engage
her to avoid the face of an enemy, e<U+017F>pecially he being <U+017F>uch a one
as confirmed him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>uch, by the action he had then done.
But afterwards, upon <U+017F>econd thoughts, <U+017F>he, being a Lady that
cho<U+017F>e rather to be guided by her duty then her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
her <U+017F>elf obliged to relieve <hi>Cecinna</hi> dying upon her account,
rather then to avoid <hi>Antonius,</hi> comes to him, with her face bathed
in tears, and by certain broken words entreated him to take
heart, and to further all he could the de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he had for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation
of his life. The expiring <hi>Cecinna</hi> met with this <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in his misfortune, that he breathed out his la<U+017F>t in the arms
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and mu<U+017F>tering up all the <U+017F>trength he had left him, to turn
his eyes towards her, and to take her by the hand, <U+017F>he reached
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97242:22"/>
forth to him, while one of her Mayds held up his head in her lap;
<hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>I loo<U+017F>e my life by the hands of</hi> Antonius,
<hi>but it was through my own fault and <U+017F>eeking; and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you to forgive him my death as heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

happy and glorious, <U+017F>ince I dye at your feet, for your <U+017F>ake,
and in a condition that forces tho<U+017F>e fair <U+017F>howers from your
eyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With much difficulty was he delivered of the<U+017F>e words, but
with them he lo<U+017F>t his <U+017F>peech, and, <U+017F>ome few minutes after, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
out his la<U+017F>t, leaving in <hi>Tullias</hi> <U+017F>oul <U+017F>uch violent characters of
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that <U+017F>he hardly knew where <U+017F>he was, or what <U+017F>he did. My
Brother, to give her way, retired <U+017F>ome few paces when <U+017F>he came
neer <hi>Cecinna;</hi> and being extreamly moved with pity for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
the affliction he perceaved it was to <hi>Tullia</hi> heightened his
own <U+017F>o much and <U+017F>o violently, that he had much ado to keep off
from de<U+017F>pair. He, at fir<U+017F>t, thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to avoid the
eyes of that incen<U+017F>ed Beauty; nay, though he was infinitely de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have a <U+017F>ight of her, yet mu<U+017F>t he needs imagine, that, as
things then <U+017F>tood, he could not without inhumanity importune her
with his. Out of this con<U+017F>ideration had he already retired <U+017F>ome
few paces; but his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion growing too <U+017F>trong for him, would needs
oblige him to <U+017F>peak to her, and to make <U+017F>ome reparation for the
injury he had done her. This re<U+017F>olution grew <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong upon
him, that he could not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t it, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>lighting all tho<U+017F>e reflections
that were incompatible with the violence of his love, he came
<U+017F>ome paces neerer, he looked on that de<U+017F>olate Beauty, with all
the agitations that a <U+017F>oul that hath lo<U+017F>t all command of it <U+017F>elf can
be capable of. He had not hardly had the confidence to open his
mouth, had he not been encouraged by the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Emilia,</hi>
whom he knew to be favourable to him, and from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<U+017F>ome relief. But at la<U+017F>t, having rallyed all the courage he
had, he <U+017F>ets one knee on the ground, and looking on Tullia in a
trembling po<U+017F>ture; <hi>I <U+017F>hould not pre<U+017F>ume to importune you with my
<U+017F>ight, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>if</hi> I <hi>thought not my <U+017F>elf obliged
to make you <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction for the injury</hi> I <hi>have done you; and
though</hi> Cecinna <hi>hath in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort ju<U+017F>tified me, by telling you that
I onely <U+017F>tood in a defen<U+017F>ive po<U+017F>ture again<U+017F>t him, yet the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure</hi>
I <hi>have done you is greater then to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over with <U+017F>uch a repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There was no need of this la<U+017F>t misfortune to heighten the
aver<U+017F>ion you have ever had for the unfortunate per<U+017F>on that now
adores you; and this <U+017F>ight of you, which I <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before, <U+017F>hould not have been granted me, together with that
of an accident which can rai<U+017F>e in you nothing but horrour for
this <U+017F>o unhappy a wretch. But <U+017F>ince it is the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of Heaven,
it is but ju<U+017F>t that both Heavens anger and yours <U+017F>hould be appea<U+017F>ed:
and <U+017F>ince</hi> I <hi>am already <U+017F>o well acquainted with your heart, as to
believe I <U+017F>hall find in you all the re<U+017F>olution requi<U+017F>ite to revenge

your <U+017F>elf, and to do right to the</hi> Manes <hi>of</hi> Cecinna, <hi>here take the

<hi>take the <U+017F>word that hath taken away the life of</hi> Cecinna, <hi>thru<U+017F>t it
into this brea<U+017F>t which lyes open to you, and <U+017F>pare not, after the injury</hi>
I <hi>have done you, a life, which, even in a condition of innocence hath
ever been odious to you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the<U+017F>e words <hi>Tullia,</hi> who all the while would not <U+017F>o much as
look towards him, but turned her face another way, gave him
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden and furious look, that haply upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>allies of
the violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>he was then ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>ubject to, <U+017F>he might
have granted the de<U+017F>olate <hi>Antonius</hi> the death he <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired,
and that accordingly <U+017F>he would have taken the <U+017F>word he pre<U+017F>ented
to her, and whereof the very <U+017F>ight very much enflamed her indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when <U+017F>he perceaved upon it certain drops of <hi>Cecinna's</hi>
blood. But the prudent <hi>Emilia</hi> fa<U+017F>tening immediately upon it,
got it, without much difficulty, from <hi>Antonius;</hi> and this <U+017F>he
did, as well in regard of the uncertainty <U+017F>he was in as to
<hi>Tullia's</hi> intention, as to prevent that de<U+017F>perate Prince,
from making u<U+017F>e of it again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elfe, as he might have
done, in the di<U+017F>traction his griefe had then put him
into.</p>
                        <p>Tullia <hi>continued for <U+017F>ome time without <U+017F>o much as opening
her mouth, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the agitations of her <U+017F>oule by her looks
and <U+017F>ilence more effectually than <U+017F>he could haply have done by
her words. But at la<U+017F>t, not able to ma<U+017F>ter the impetuo<U+017F>ity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and looking on the pro<U+017F>trate</hi> Antonius <hi>with eyes, wherein,
through the tears that fell from them, the fire of her indignation

Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that thy inhumanity cannot be <U+017F>atisfied either
with the bloud of <hi>Cicero,</hi> <U+017F>pilt by thy Friends, nor with
that of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> which thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>hed thy <U+017F>elf, but thou mu<U+017F>t
per<U+017F>ecute to the death an Vnfortunate Mayd, who hath not
without rea<U+017F>on avoided thee, and who never yet gave thee the
lea<U+017F>t offence? Do<U+017F>t thou hope, <U+017F>tained with the bloud of
him that was to be her Husband, that <U+017F>he can regard that
odious pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which hath proved the cau<U+017F>e of all her
unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e? Or do<U+017F>t thou imagine <U+017F>he can look otherwi<U+017F>e
on thee than a Mon<U+017F>ter, and the foule<U+017F>t object of dete<U+017F>tation
and horrour? Go <hi>Barbarian,</hi> go Sonne of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and di<U+017F>turb

cruelty hath opened a <U+017F>ource of tears, which no pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion could ever

                        <p>As <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words, which came from her, attended with
a deluge of tears, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ted her face on <hi>Emelia's</hi> arme, when
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who was then in que<U+017F>t of either his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e or his
Friend, came into the place, directed thither haply by the gods,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97242:23"/>
to prevent my Brother's de<U+017F>pair. He was in few words made
acquainted with all that pa<U+017F>t; and though compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had that
effect which it could not but produce in him, yet he made a <U+017F>hift

which <hi>Tullia</hi> had conceaved again<U+017F>t my Brother. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all their arguments, intreaties and remon<U+017F>trances, <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>till as inflexible as ever, and the <U+017F>uppliant po<U+017F>ture wherein
<hi>Antonius</hi> had continued all this while, nor the abundance

<hi>Tullia, <U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> that nothing but my death can <U+017F>atisfie you,

prote<U+017F>ting to him that he knew it not him<U+017F>elf, and that he
was re<U+017F>olved to wander up and down the World, till he were
quite recovered of <hi>Tullia's</hi> love, and then he promi<U+017F>ed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and not before. <hi>Scipio</hi> and all his Friends <U+017F>ent
<U+017F>ome after him for certain dayes, but they returned to <hi>Rome</hi>
very much troubled that they could meet with no tidings
of him. <hi>Tullia</hi> extreamly ca<U+017F>t down, and in a manner di<U+017F>tracted
at this unhappy adventure left <hi>Rome</hi> <U+017F>ome few dayes after, and
returned to her <U+017F>olitude, where <U+017F>he continued for many years.
And thus, by a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion fatally enflamed, Have we lo<U+017F>t a Brother?
a great and excellent per<U+017F>on. It is <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>eaven years <U+017F>ince this
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e happened, which yet I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, before it could be
thought one of my age could be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any <U+017F>uch thing, and in
regard that it is <U+017F>ince that time that all the remarkable accidents of
my life are happened, my Brother could not be any way concerned
in them. And thence it came, that I made no mention of him in
the relation of all the misfortunes which the love of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
hath engaged me in. I <U+017F>hall now proceed to the adventures of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97242:24"/>
re<U+017F>t of our Family, which having happened long <U+017F>ince the other,
I have accordingly fre<U+017F>h in my memory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Here the fair</hi> Cleopatra <hi>made a <U+017F>top to take her breath a little,
and</hi> Artemi<U+017F>a, <hi>who had heard her with very much attention,
without ever interrupting her all the time, <U+017F>eeing her come to
that place,</hi> Good Heaven, Si<U+017F>ter, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> what an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
oligation have you put upon me by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of yours?
and what regret have you rai<U+017F>ed in me for the <U+017F>ad fortune of that
Brother of yours, who in all probability, would have lo<U+017F>t nothing
of the lu<U+017F>tre of your noble hou<U+017F>e? How angry have I been with that
inflexible <hi>Tullia,</hi> who made <U+017F>o little di<U+017F>tinction between the innocent
and the guilty, and how different have our <U+017F>entiments been, though
we have met with equal occa<U+017F>ions to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e them? I could not
ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>approve the carriage of <hi>Tullia, replies Cleopatra,</hi>
though it were <U+017F>omewhat too violent at the latter end. At <U+017F>o bloudy
a <U+017F>pectacle as that of the death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> <U+017F>he could not be le<U+017F><U+017F>e
troubled then <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be, and in the beginning, though <hi>Antonius</hi>
were innocent, yet was he Son to tho<U+017F>e who had put her Father to a
death notorious for the cruelty of its circum<U+017F>tances. And if there
were no rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be de<U+017F>irous to be revenged upon him, <U+017F>o was
there not on the other <U+017F>ide any that <U+017F>hould engage her to admit his
conver<U+017F>ation, much le<U+017F><U+017F>e the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his affection. In your
fortune things are very much different; your friend<U+017F>hip took its
fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e from your infancy, and from that time you have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed
to endure the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Alexander,</hi> not as that of their Son
who had put <hi>Artaba<U+017F>us</hi> to death, but as that of a Prince that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you, and for whom ever from that time you had no aver<U+017F>ion. <hi>The

TIS <U+017F>ince the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of our Brother <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi>
as I told you, that <U+017F>o many memorable accidents
have happened in our Family, <U+017F>uch as no doubt
but he would have concerned him<U+017F>elf in, as he
ought to have done, had he not been ab<U+017F>ent, nay,
it may be, ab<U+017F>olutely lo<U+017F>t. It was much about the
time of his departure that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> made the fir<U+017F>t addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of
his love to me, or it was then at lea<U+017F>t that I was come to an age,
wherein I <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly began to take notice of them. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
acquainted you with all that hath befallen me <U+017F>ince, even to
the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>iderable circum<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>o that I am di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
as to any relation that concerns my <U+017F>elf, though what hath
happened to me be of greater con<U+017F>equence than any thing el<U+017F>e
that hath befallen our Family. For what relates to <hi>Alexander,</hi> you
have been acquainted with the adventures of his fir<U+017F>t years to his
departure from <hi>Rome;</hi> and for what hath happened to him <U+017F>ince,
I have learned it from your <U+017F>elf, who mu<U+017F>t needs have been the
be<U+017F>t acquainted of any with his adventures, as having been the
onely occa<U+017F>ion thereof. All then that now lyes on my hands to
do, is, to give you an account of young <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> of the Children
of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and, of tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Octavia,</hi>
of my two Si<U+017F>ters, <hi>Agrippina</hi> and young <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom you have
<U+017F>o particular an affection for. For <hi>Ptolomey</hi> he is yet of an age
wherein it cannot be expected he <U+017F>hould meet with many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
though the World hath, from <U+017F>everal particular actions of
his, conceaved very miraculous hopes of him, and for my Si<U+017F>ters,
I <U+017F>hall punctually acquaint you with all you de<U+017F>ire to know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, born, no doubt, to all the perfections of
nature, have extreamlie improved and heightned them by an
excellent education, for I need <U+017F>ay no more to you then that they
have been brought up by their Mother <hi>Octavia,</hi> to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
what advantages they might derive from that. <hi>Agrippina</hi>
is certainlie a verie rare and exqui<U+017F>ite Beautie, hath a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of under<U+017F>tanding, and is of an exemplarie vertue; nay, it
will haplie be found that the World is but poorlie <U+017F>tored with
per<U+017F>ons who<U+017F>e accompli<U+017F>hments and perfections may come into the
ballance with tho<U+017F>e of this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e. Yet is it as certain that
<hi>Antonia</hi> <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es her in all things, and though Heaven hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>towed
on her a Beautie of the fir<U+017F>t magnitude among tho<U+017F>e
terre<U+017F>trial con<U+017F>tellations, who<U+017F>e influences the earth adores and is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97242:26"/>
guided by, yet is this Beauty of her per<U+017F>on much below that of
her mind, and that of her inclinations. Never was there any one
of her <U+017F>ex that had a mind fixed with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>oliditie, refined
by <U+017F>o much puritie, and heightned by <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>engagement
from things that are incon<U+017F>iderable and beneath her. It di<U+017F>covers
<U+017F>uch a con<U+017F>onancy of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>everity, as amounts to a ju<U+017F>t
moderation, and all her actions are guided by <U+017F>o certain a rule,
that they defie whatever the mo<U+017F>t irreconcileable malice dur<U+017F>t
object again<U+017F>t them. I could tell you much more of her, Si<U+017F>ter,
and yet be in <U+017F>ome fear I might not <U+017F>peak enough, <U+017F>ince it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable,
that, taking her in all things, there cannot be any thing
more accompli<U+017F>hed then <hi>Antonia,</hi> and it is generally acknowledged
in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Octavia,</hi> the honour and ornament of her Time, could
not have furni<U+017F>hed the World with any thing el<U+017F>e that were more
worthy her <U+017F>elf, or more like her Mother in all her great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfections.</p>
                     <p>It is not many years, <U+017F>ince <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> a man Illu<U+017F>trious
enough by his extraction, but much more for his great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the noble actions he did, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed his affections to
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> and afterwards became an earne<U+017F>t and con<U+017F>tant Servant of
hers. And in regard his engagement in this de<U+017F>ign was not without
the approbation of the Emperour, <hi>Octavia,</hi> and, in a word, of all
tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who<U+017F>e countenance he <U+017F>tood in need of, <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
out of pure complyance with <hi>Octavia,</hi> entertained his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es
with the e<U+017F>teem and acknowledgement <U+017F>he was obliged to, and,
without any repugnance or violence of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, was re<U+017F>olved to
<U+017F>ubmit to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons to whom <U+017F>he ought an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
But, on the contrary, <hi>Antonia,</hi> having a di<U+017F>-inclination to
love, and an aver<U+017F>ion for whatever had but the lea<U+017F>t appearance of
gallantry, had <U+017F>pent all the years of her life to this very la<U+017F>t, not
onelie without loving, but even without <U+017F>o much as enduring any
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, or indeed the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>coverie of any <U+017F>uch thing, though
her extraordinarie Beautie, and the amiable excellencies of her
per<U+017F>on had rai<U+017F>ed her no <U+017F>mall number of <U+017F>ervants among tho<U+017F>e of
greate<U+017F>t qualitie upon earth.</p>
                     <p>Among the mo<U+017F>t eminent of tho<U+017F>e that had any thoughts for
her, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> a young Prince, of great valour,
and abundance of vertue, was one of the fir<U+017F>t that declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
a <U+017F>ervant of hers: and certainly, if an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of merit height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <U+017F>ervices, full of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and re<U+017F>pect, might have had any
influence on the heart of <hi>Antonia,</hi> it was not improbable they
<U+017F>hould faile of their effection it, on the behalf of that Prince. His
allyance with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> or rather his dependance on the Empire, to
which his dominions were tributary, (as were tho<U+017F>e of mo<U+017F>t
Kings upon earth) obliged him to be very much re<U+017F>ident
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where all other Kings as well as he were
forced to make their con<U+017F>tant addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97242:27"/>
Twas in one of the<U+017F>e voyages that he became a <U+017F>acrifice to the
fair eyes of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and upon that account <U+017F>tayed longer in <hi>Rome</hi>
then he had re<U+017F>olved to do. Whole yeares pa<U+017F>t away ere he dur<U+017F>t
make his ca<U+017F>e known, or any way di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf to her, who
was the occa<U+017F>ion of all his <U+017F>ufferings. And though that during
this time he travelled very much up and down, either within his
own Kingdom, or into tho<U+017F>e of his next neighbours, whither the
war often drew him, yet was his love his perpetual attendant, and
upon the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion brought him <U+017F>till to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had
left the fair object of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. When ever he felt in him<U+017F>elf
any inclination to di<U+017F>cover to <hi>Antonia</hi> what he <U+017F>uffered for her
<U+017F>ake, her <U+017F>everitie, and that mode<U+017F>t fiercene<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ubject to
put him to immediate <U+017F>ilence: and whereas upon all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
he was never known to be awanting as to courage, yet all that
great confidence he was naturally ma<U+017F>ter of, proved, as to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign,
ab<U+017F>olutely un<U+017F>erviceable, and that out of no other con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then that he was not ignorant of the inflexible humour of
<hi>Antonia.</hi> But at la<U+017F>t he ventured to break forth into <U+017F>peech,
after he had u<U+017F>hered in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e by thou<U+017F>ands of actions which
might have <U+017F>ignified no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then what he <U+017F>poke; but this fir<U+017F>t
overture of his proved <U+017F>o little to his <U+017F>atisfaction, that for a long
time after he could never reflect on it without a certain regret,
which mu<U+017F>t needs be the greater, in that <hi>Antonia,</hi> who till then
had <U+017F>uffered his conver<U+017F>ation as <U+017F>he would do that of a Prince,
eminent for his vertue, and high in the e<U+017F>teem of all the World,
could not endure to hear from his own mouth, the fir<U+017F>t declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which <U+017F>he had a natural aver<U+017F>ion for, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it with <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>entment, as ea<U+017F>ilie put her upon a re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to avoid all occa<U+017F>ions of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him. However,
after <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>he was per<U+017F>waded to endure it, but not <U+017F>o much
out of any remor<U+017F>e of her inclinations, as by the mediation of
<hi>Octavia,</hi> who would not have her treat, with di<U+017F>dain and incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
a King of extraordinary merit, as al<U+017F>o upon the advice of her
Brother <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had very great re<U+017F>pects for, and who
highly e<U+017F>teemed <hi>Archelaus.</hi> But after all, the greate<U+017F>t advantage
he made of this forbearance amounted not to <U+017F>o much as to make
his condition any whit the better; and if <hi>Antonia</hi> gave him
<U+017F>ometimes leave to waite on her, and to fall into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with
her, yet could he never either from his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es or conver<U+017F>ation
infer the lea<U+017F>t hope they might ever prove effectual, or derive any
other comfort from them, <U+017F>ave that of being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that his
Rivalls, (who no doubt were not a few, and tho<U+017F>e very con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
were not treated any thing more favourably than
him<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides <hi>Archelaus,</hi> there was a great number of other Princes
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there daylie came <U+017F>ome from all parts, as I told you,
to do homage, and make their acknowledgements to the Lord of
the greate<U+017F>t part of the Univer<U+017F>e. Among the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97242:27"/>
were <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> per<U+017F>ons whom their excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
made accordingly con<U+017F>iderable, it being indeed upon
the account of their vertue, (which added a great lu<U+017F>tre and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to their birth) that they had not long before receaved
Crowns from the liberalitie of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus; Polemou</hi> that of <hi>Pontus,</hi>
and <hi>Mithridates</hi> that of <hi>Comagenes. Mithridates,</hi> a per<U+017F>on natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
confident and daring, and of high and a<U+017F>piring thoughts;
captivated by the perfections of <hi>Julia,</hi> and flattered into <U+017F>ome
hopes through her ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, in admitting addre<U+017F><U+017F>es and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
made no great <U+017F>ecret for <U+017F>ome time of the inclinations he
had for her: but at length, <U+017F>eized with a fear of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom all the World very much re<U+017F>pected as well for
his reputation as his vertue, and to incen<U+017F>e the Emperour him<U+017F>elf,
who would not have taken it kindlie that his Daughter <U+017F>hould be
cajolled into any other affection then that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> on whom
he had re<U+017F>olved to be<U+017F>tow her, he was forced to <U+017F>mother his fir<U+017F>t
inclinations, and after he had continued for <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>iderable
time in an uncertainty, without being able to fa<U+017F>ten on any choice,
he at la<U+017F>t ran the <U+017F>ame fate with a many others, and became an
admirer of the excellencies of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and accordingly put
him<U+017F>elf into the <U+017F>ame praedicament with <hi>Archelaus, Polemon,</hi>
on the other <U+017F>ide, continued Ma<U+017F>ter of Liberty for a long time,
but at la<U+017F>t was forced to <U+017F>acrifice it to <hi>Marcella,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Octavia,</hi> by her former Hu<U+017F>band, and Si<U+017F>ter, both by Father and
Mother, to Prince <hi>Marcellus:</hi> but his engagement into that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was with very little hope, or rather very little likelyhood of
any good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e; not but that his great worth and high birth
were very con<U+017F>iderable, but, it was the generall belief that the
Emperour had long before de<U+017F>igned his Neece the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e
<hi>Marcella</hi> for Wife to the great <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable
in point of reputation and intere<U+017F>t, as not to be pararelled by
<hi>Polemon,</hi> or indeed by any other per<U+017F>on in the Empire, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it
were by Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> him<U+017F>elf. His younger Si<U+017F>ter by the

an admirable wit, and a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition full of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance,
had al<U+017F>o a great number of Suitors; and you are not
to imagine but that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>uch worth, extractions and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts
were more likely to rai<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires than hopes in the hearts of

                     <p>I have purpo<U+017F>ely given you this <U+017F>mall account that you may
thence infer what a noble and great Court there mu<U+017F>t needs be
at <hi>Octavia</hi>'s, where we were no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then five Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, who,
next to <hi>Julia,</hi> might, not without rea<U+017F>on, pretend to the fir<U+017F>t rank
among all tho<U+017F>e of the Empire, and that had had the honour to
be brought up by the conduct of a per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e vertue
is a thou<U+017F>and times more con<U+017F>iderable then all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

Be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e that I have named to you, that were particularly
related to the Imperial Hou<U+017F>e, or were otherwi<U+017F>e of Royal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
there was at <hi>Rome</hi> a great number of tho<U+017F>e Illu<U+017F>trious
Families, which are no way inferiour to tho<U+017F>e of Kings, as al<U+017F>o of
tho<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>ular Hou<U+017F>es, whereof the chiefes have <U+017F>o often led
Kings in Triumph, and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of Kingdoms as if they had been
their own private e<U+017F>tates. The admirable <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Lucius Metellus,</hi> the Beautiful <hi>Horten<U+017F>ia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Caius Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,
Servilia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Servilius Hala, Flavia,</hi> of the Noble

the di<U+017F>creet <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Catulus,</hi> were, as I may
<U+017F>ay, in re<U+017F>pect of us of the <U+017F>econd magnitude. In like manner,
among the men, the very <U+017F>ame Families, and others of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had produced no <U+017F>mall number of <U+017F>uch, as, in all probability
<U+017F>hould not degenerate from the glory of their Ance<U+017F>tors; and as
to matter of magnificence and gallantry, next to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the
Sons of <hi>Livia,</hi> and the Princes I have already mentioned to you,
young <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> Son to tho<U+017F>e of that name, who died among the

the Wife of <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and it may be well affirmed, that there
never was any thing of o<U+017F>tentation, and magnificence, comparable
to what was <U+017F>een in the publick <U+017F>hews, and diverti<U+017F>ements, that
the<U+017F>e Illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>ons daylie entertained us with, and that with
<U+017F>uch prodigality and profu<U+017F>ions, as it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to meet
with in any other place, then a City that is Lady of the

                     <p>I need not tell you, Si<U+017F>ter, that I have all this while digre<U+017F><U+017F>ed

de<U+017F>cription of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s Court, and that out of a confidence you
would not take it ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to be acquainted with the names of tho<U+017F>e
per<U+017F>ons that are the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable in the Univer<U+017F>e. I <U+017F>hall
therefore now return to our own Familie, and give you a punctual
account of all that you de<U+017F>ire to know concerning it, omitting, out
of de<U+017F>ign, what happened long <U+017F>ince, the more to ha<U+017F>ten to a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what hath happened within the<U+017F>e late years, as well becau<U+017F>e

                     <p>That you may therefore be the better informed as to what
concerns the affairs of our Familie, you are to know, That <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> as I have alreadie told you, had been lo<U+017F>t for <U+017F>ome five
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97242:28"/>
or <U+017F>ix years; That I was at <hi>Rome</hi> expo<U+017F>ed to the cruel per<U+017F>ecution
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> That <hi>Alexander</hi> was, not long before, gone from
<hi>Rome</hi> into the Army in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> whence it was that he came to
you; That <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was brought up in <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s Court, all the
World conceaving miraculous hopes of him; That for our two
Si<U+017F>ters, that were born of <hi>Octavia, Agrippina</hi> was courted by
<hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> and the younger, <hi>Antonia</hi> by <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King
of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and divers other Illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>ons, as well among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> as among tho<U+017F>e Princes that had their education in
<hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s Court, and that for the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, the Daughters
of <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and whom we <U+017F>till looked on as our
Si<U+017F>ters; <hi>Marcella</hi> was courted by <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the general opinion, de<U+017F>igned by the Emperour for the great
<hi>Agrippa;</hi> and the young and fair <hi>Martia,</hi> be<U+017F>ides a many other
Suitors and Adorers, whom her excellent perfections magnetically
drew after her, was mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>tly courted by <hi>Aemilianus,</hi> one of
the hou<U+017F>e of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and young <hi>Catulus,</hi> both per<U+017F>ons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
con<U+017F>iderable as well upon the <U+017F>core of their vertues, as
extraordinary worth and parts. The other Ladies, whom I have
named to you, were al<U+017F>o courted by the mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>ons
about <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> extraction, in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Rome</hi> was, in
point of galantry and magnificence, much beyond what I am able
to repre<U+017F>ent to you. The Emperour, who, as you know, is yet
in the flower of his age, and is naturally very much inclined to
whatever <U+017F>ounds any thing of gallantry, gave him<U+017F>elf the example
as to what tended that way, through the engagement and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he then had, and <U+017F>till hath for <hi>Terentia, Mecoenas</hi>'s Wife, a
Woman of great Beautie, and a va<U+017F>t-wit and under<U+017F>tanding, but
with this di<U+017F>advantage as to her reputation, that the frequent
addre<U+017F><U+017F>es and familiarity of the Emperour did her <U+017F>ome injurie,
as being one, that, having been Wife to a man who<U+017F>e vertue the
whole Empire had a particular honour and veneration for, <U+017F>hould
have carryed her <U+017F>elf with that re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e as might have been
proof again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e reports, which but too too often bla<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t
circum<U+017F>pect behaviours.</p>
                     <p>This excellent woman did the Emperour one day take occa<U+017F>ion

famous Gardens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and all the per<U+017F>ons I have named to
you, with divers others, whom I have not mentioned, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the noble meeting. The fir<U+017F>t diverti<U+017F>ement they were
entertained with, while they expected the other, (which were not
to be had, but by torch-light) was that of Walking, <U+017F>o that the
Company being gotten into tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant walks, they took their
turns about, and <U+017F>aw all the rarities of the Garden, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are admirable, and not below the report that is <U+017F>pread over the
World of it, and the charge, which the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>umptuous of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
had been at about it. The Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e thoughts have
ever been more taken up with what related to her ambition
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97242:29"/>
and State-Affairs, then with any thing el<U+017F>e, pretending to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Emperour's inclinations, and <U+017F>eeming not the lea<U+017F>t

while they walked, was led by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> though <U+017F>he had no great

abutted, as all the re<U+017F>t did, upon a large <hi>Ba<U+017F>in</hi> of Water, which is

From this place, by the means of twelve <U+017F>pacious walks, which
abutt there, may be <U+017F>een all the extremities of the Garden, and
the end of every walk is remarkable for <U+017F>ome object that does a
certain plea<U+017F>ant violence on the <U+017F>ight, and <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es the Spectator
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97242:29"/>
in twelve different manners. That particular walk into which we
were gotten, entertained our eyes onely with the gate of the
Garden, and a pro<U+017F>pect of <hi>Rome;</hi> but all the re<U+017F>t end either with
per<U+017F>pectives, made with <U+017F>o much art, that they deceave the <U+017F>ight,
even to the extremity thereof; or with grotts, admirable as well
for the variety of <U+017F>hells, and the Nacre whereof they are built, as
for the diver<U+017F>ity of the <U+017F>prings and <U+017F>igures, whereby they are
adorned, or with Arbours miraculous for their <U+017F>tructure, or la<U+017F>tly
with de<U+017F>cents of water, ordered with <U+017F>uch extraordinary artifice,
as that falling from an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive height upon a many <U+017F>everal <U+017F>teps,
it makes a confu<U+017F>ed, but withal, a plea<U+017F>ant noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o runs into
a number of little channels, which border the Walks in diver<U+017F>e
places, cro<U+017F><U+017F>e them in divers others, <U+017F>o that people are forced to
go over them upon Bridges, having on both <U+017F>ides Pila<U+017F>ters of
Marble.</p>
                     <p>The twelve principal walks are cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed up and down by an
infinite number of others, wherein it is not hard for one to lo<U+017F>e
him<U+017F>elf; but with this advantage, by way of recompence, that
where<U+017F>oever chance, or your own, inclination di<U+017F>po<U+017F>es of you, the
objects you are entertained with, are every where very delightful
and very <U+017F>urprizing. There are thou<U+017F>ands of rarities in this
Garden, which I do not trouble you with an account of, and for
what I have told, it hath onely been by the way, and <U+017F>omewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
my purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>When the whole Company had taken <U+017F>everal turns about the
Ba<U+017F>in, it divided it <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>everal parties according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
inclinations of the per<U+017F>ons, <hi>Julia</hi> having made a propo<U+017F>ition
to that purpo<U+017F>e, and repre<U+017F>ented that walking wanted that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and diverti<U+017F>ement when there were a many together, which
it had when there is more privacy. For my part I was re<U+017F>olved not
to leave <hi>Octavia,</hi> who began to direct her cour<U+017F>e towards one of
the principal Walks, and my Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Antonia</hi> was as re<U+017F>olved to
keep me company. It was, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, no <U+017F>mal <U+017F>atisfaction
to me, that <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> came and joyned with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to lead me, as
well upon the account of the many excellent qualities I ob<U+017F>erved
in his per<U+017F>on, as al<U+017F>o that I thought it much better, being between
the Brothers, then alone with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> be<U+017F>ides that I cannot
deny, but that I found <U+017F>omething in <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi>'s di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which in
<U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure took off the teadiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e I met with in that of his
Brother, and con<U+017F>equently was <U+017F>atisfied as to the good opinion
which all the World had of him. He was in very good terms
with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as to the difference there had been between them
concerning their loves to <hi>Julia;</hi> in<U+017F>omuch, that he not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
all vi<U+017F>its to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, but it was vi<U+017F>ible in all his actions,
that he had given over all thoughts of her, and <U+017F>ought nothing
with <U+017F>o much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e as the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides,
though he <U+017F>ided as much as he could with his Brother, as in point
of honour he was obliged to do, yet did he not pre<U+017F><U+017F>e his intere<U+017F>t
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97242:30"/>
very much to me, and knowing the aver<U+017F>ion I had for his Brothers
addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the re<U+017F>pects I had for tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he <U+017F>aid
very little to me of his Brother, and <U+017F>poke nothing to the di<U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Rival. 'Twas this day that he entertained me
with abundance of things that were infinitely plea<U+017F>ant, and his
Brother maliciou<U+017F>ly putting him upon <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning
<hi>Julia,</hi> he <U+017F>poke of her with <U+017F>o much mode<U+017F>ty and re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
but withal with <U+017F>o much wit, that I had from that time a greater
e<U+017F>teem for him then I had had before.</p>
                     <p>After us came <hi>Antonia,</hi> led by <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but
the Emperour having <U+017F>ent for <hi>Archelaus,</hi> as having <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
to communicate to him, <hi>Mithridates</hi> <U+017F>tayed alone with <hi>Antonia,</hi>
to his unconceaveable <U+017F>atisfaction. This was it he had <U+017F>ought out
of a long time, and what he could never find before; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
being a per<U+017F>on infinitely confident, he would needs make
his advantage of it, attributing the <U+017F>ilence he had for <U+017F>ome time
ob<U+017F>erved to want of opportunity. And yet all his confidence,
though <U+017F>ommoned together upon this occa<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>tuck not <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e
to him, but that for <U+017F>ome minutes he was at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what to do as
to the de<U+017F>ign he had to di<U+017F>cover his thoughts, and <hi>Antonia</hi> on the
other <U+017F>ide was <U+017F>o terrible upon any occa<U+017F>ions of that nature, that
<U+017F>he was able to make the mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of their <U+017F>trength to tremble.
However he took heart in his re<U+017F>olution, and falling into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
about the departure of <hi>Archelaus; I never made it any que<U+017F>tion,
Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>but that</hi> Archelaus <hi>entertains whatever
orders come from</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar, <hi>with all the re<U+017F>pect and complyance that
may be; but for this la<U+017F>t, I believe it hath been receaved by him, with
a di<U+017F>turbance equal to the <U+017F>atisfaction it hath bred in me.</hi> I <hi>cannot
apprehend,</hi> replies Antonia, <hi>the cau<U+017F>e of either his di<U+017F>content or your
joy, nor <U+017F>ee in this accident any occa<U+017F>ion of either the one or the
other. For</hi> Archelaus, replies Mithridates, <hi>you cannot certainly
but know how unkindly he takes it to be ab<U+017F>ent from you, <U+017F>ince you
are not to be now acquainted with the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he hath for you: and
for</hi> Mithridates, <hi>you may well imagine what joy it is to him to have
the honour to waite on you alone, when I have once told you that he is
involved in the <U+017F>ame chains with</hi> Archelaus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The<U+017F>e words of</hi> Mithridates <hi>made</hi> Antonia <hi>blu<U+017F>h for very indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
though from <U+017F>ome circum<U+017F>tances <U+017F>he was <U+017F>atisfied as to <U+017F>ome
part of that truth; but <U+017F>he would needs pretend that <U+017F>he
under<U+017F>tood not his meaning, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>eem the le<U+017F><U+017F>e incen<U+017F>ed
again<U+017F>t him, whereupon re-a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with an action
full of di<U+017F>dain,</hi> I know not, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> what you mean either
by the <hi>chains</hi> or <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions</hi> of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> but am <U+017F>atisfied, that were
he con<U+017F>cious of any thing which I <U+017F>hould take ami<U+017F><U+017F>e at his hands,
the re<U+017F>pects he hath for me are <U+017F>o great, that he would keep it from
my knowledge. Ah Madam, <hi>replyed he,</hi> is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that you who
pretend <U+017F>o much to a real <U+017F>incerity, can <U+017F>o peremptorily affirm that
the King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> hath never entertained you with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97242:30"/>
affection he hath for you? If ever he did <U+017F>peak to me of it, <hi>replies
the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> it matters not, I gave no credit to what he <U+017F>aid, and
that for me to do <U+017F>o, was the greate<U+017F>t advantage he could ever hope
from <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for after all, when he had done what he could
to per<U+017F>wade me that he had an affection for me, I <U+017F>hould po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have
per<U+017F>waded him in my turn, that I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ubject to a quite contrary
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for per<U+017F>ons, who<U+017F>e affections make them forget the re<U+017F>pect they
ought to ob<U+017F>erve. For matter of re<U+017F>pect, <hi>replies the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magenes,</hi>
I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, it ought to be had for you while life
la<U+017F>ts, and that the lea<U+017F>t violation thereof de<U+017F>erves the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment;
but for a man to be <U+017F>o far from being awanting in point
of re<U+017F>pect, as that he onely pre<U+017F>umes to di<U+017F>cover a love, which for the
greate<U+017F>t part con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in re<U+017F>pect it <U+017F>elf; does he de<U+017F>erve tho<U+017F>e light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and thunder-bolts which you ca<U+017F>t at the guilty? and mu<U+017F>t a
man needs be expo<U+017F>ed to your indignation for telling you, that he
hath an adoration for you, equal to what he hath for the gods, as he
<U+017F>hould be to that of another per<U+017F>on, whom he had done <U+017F>ome affront
to? The ca<U+017F>e is the very <U+017F>ame, <hi>replies the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e very roundly,</hi>
and in my opinion, there <U+017F>hould be no di<U+017F>tinction made between <U+017F>uch
adorations and affronts. How Madam, <hi>cries out Mithridates,</hi> it
<U+017F>eems you allow no difference between the effects of Love, and tho<U+017F>e
of Hatred? When tho<U+017F>e of Love are importunate and trouble<U+017F>ome,
<hi>an<U+017F>wers Antonia,</hi> I think them more in<U+017F>upportable then tho<U+017F>e of
Hatred, and, <U+017F>uch is my humour, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ooner pardon an affect of
Hatred in my enemies, then an expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love in tho<U+017F>e that call
them<U+017F>elves my Friends. Ah Madam, <hi>replies the Prince with an
action full of earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> if it be <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hall advi<U+017F>e the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Mithridates</hi> not to tell you till at the la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>p, that he dies for
you, and I <U+017F>hall be<U+017F>eech you for the future to read in his eyes what you
forbid him to declare with his tongue.</p>
                     <p>Mithridates <hi>had no <U+017F>ooner pronounced the<U+017F>e words, with a
<U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive look on the ground, but</hi> Antonia <hi>ca<U+017F>ting her eyes on
him, with an action full of fiercene<U+017F><U+017F>e;</hi> Mithridates, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
him,</hi> I am now <U+017F>atisfied that you take me for ... <hi>at which word
making a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>top, haply to correct what the ha<U+017F>tine<U+017F><U+017F>e of her
thoughts had almo<U+017F>t forced into her mouth.</hi> No, no, <hi><U+017F>aid the
Prince, interrupting her,</hi> no Madam, I do not take you for <hi>Julia,</hi>
for it was of her that you were going to <U+017F>peak, and the gods are my
witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that though truth it <U+017F>elf, and the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I have had for
that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, might well oblige me to <U+017F>peak advantageou<U+017F>ly of her,
yet mu<U+017F>t I acknowledge that I find no re<U+017F>emblance between you. It was
from my intention, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi> to <U+017F>ay any thing of <hi>Julia,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
it an honour to be any way like her, and am per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he gives
as little entertainment as I do, to <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es as that, you have
entertained me with: but whether that be <U+017F>o or not, if I have de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this unhappy adventure for the pains I have taken to make you
<U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer on an unbe<U+017F>eeming <U+017F>ubject, meerly to avoid the like for
the future, <U+017F>ince I cannot take down your confidence, I <U+017F>hall deprive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97242:31"/>
you of the occa<U+017F>ions, and you <U+017F>hall talk to me in another <U+017F>tile, or never
<U+017F>ee me again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mithridates</hi> at the<U+017F>e words, notwith<U+017F>tanding his great confidence
was <U+017F>omewhat at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and knew not what an<U+017F>wer to make her,
when the incen<U+017F>ed <hi>Antonia</hi> having pronounced them; and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little fa<U+017F>ter to overtake us, <hi>Si<U+017F>ter, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me, <U+017F>tay
for us, and give us leave to be of your company, and participate of
your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e words falling from her <U+017F>omewhat di<U+017F>orderedly, were
enough for me to gue<U+017F><U+017F>e at the truth; <U+017F>o that when <U+017F>he was come
up to us, I could not forbear looking on her with a certain <U+017F>mile, as
if I under<U+017F>tood by her countenance that <U+017F>he was really angry.
Coming to our <U+017F>ide, <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> who was next her, very re<U+017F>pectfully
pre<U+017F>ented her with the hand he had at liberty, and <hi>Antonia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with as much civility receaved it, we walked all five abre<U+017F>t,
after <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> who were <U+017F>ome few paces before us,
and often engaged in our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> talked
in a manner all the time, and though <hi>Mithridates</hi> was a per<U+017F>on
<U+017F>ufficiently inclined to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and mirth, yet came there not
many words from him all the day after. I could not forbear <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
when ever I looked on <hi>Antonia,</hi> who was extreamly troubled
at it. But what was mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant of all, was, when we were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of the <U+017F>pacious walk to go into others that were narrower,
which lye next to the little Rivuletts, and wherein there cannot
walk above three abre<U+017F>t; for <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> being in the middle of the
five, and ju<U+017F>t between my Si<U+017F>ter and me, we were both de<U+017F>irous to
keep him; <hi>Antonia,</hi> to be exempted from the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was
<U+017F>o willing to avoid, and I, becau<U+017F>e I would not be alone with
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and accordingly upon the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>iderations we
both drew <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> with us at the <U+017F>ame time, and to make him the
more <U+017F>ure to us, wrung him hard by the hand.</p>
                     <p>That action <U+017F>urprized him a little at fir<U+017F>t, as not being wont to be
<U+017F>o treated by us, but a while after, being a per<U+017F>on infinitely ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he apprehended our meaning, and could not forbear laughing
at it. He was a while in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence which <U+017F>ide to take, telling us
that he wi<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elf the fate of <hi>Ari<U+017F>tocles,</hi> with abundance of
other things, very witty and plea<U+017F>ant; but at la<U+017F>t, he decided the
controver<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>omewhat to my di<U+017F>advantage, for he left me, becau<U+017F>e
he would be alone with <hi>Antonia,</hi> but telling me withal very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
that he was a better Brother then for to deprive <hi>Tiberius</hi> any
longer of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and that he would waite upon <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who had not the <U+017F>ame engagements to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as I had to his
Brother. <hi>Mithridates</hi> blu<U+017F>hed at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and was forced,
though with much di<U+017F>content, to accept of <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi>'s company: but
not long after, being come to a place where <U+017F>everal walks cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed
one the other, we met <hi>Julia, Agrippina,</hi> and <hi>Marcia,</hi> with <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Domitius, Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and young <hi>Ptolomey</hi> our Brother, and <U+017F>aw
coming on the other <U+017F>ide, the <hi>Emperour</hi> with <hi>Terentia,</hi> the Empre<U+017F>s,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97242:31"/>
                        <hi>Marcella</hi> and divers others, <U+017F>o that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> having given order that
all the Company <U+017F>hould rally, all met together at the end of one
of the walks in a <U+017F>pacious vaulted Arbour, open on three <U+017F>ides,
and having at the three openings, three <U+017F>prings ca<U+017F>ting up water
higher than the roof of the Arbour. There it was that the
Mu<U+017F>ick expected us, and that the mo<U+017F>t excellent voices that <hi>Rome</hi>
could afford, joyned to all the in<U+017F>truments requi<U+017F>ite to make a
noble con<U+017F>ort, gave us a very delightful diverti<U+017F>ment. After the
Mu<U+017F>ick, which la<U+017F>ted not above an houre, all went a walking again,
and walked till night; but this <U+017F>econd time, every one endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to avoid being of their Company whom they could not affect,
<U+017F>o that <hi>Mithridates</hi> being deprived of the company of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who did all <U+017F>he could to <U+017F>hun him, <U+017F>tayed with <hi>Dru<U+017F>us, Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> young
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and others, who came not neer the Ladies for all that day.</p>
                     <p>When the day began to di<U+017F>-lodge, and re<U+017F>ign its place to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
we were all brought into a <U+017F>pacious Bower, <U+017F>o covered over
with the boughs of trees whereof it was made that the violent
rayes of the Meridian Sun could hardly find any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into it,
but that night it had <U+017F>uch an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of light, that it might be <U+017F>aid
it never knew a greater day, that is, that of a thou<U+017F>and torches
fa<U+017F>tened to a hundred <U+017F>umptuous branches <U+017F>parkling with gold and
precious <U+017F>tones, which hanging down from the boughs of the
Bower, produced the noble<U+017F>t effect in the World, and enlightned
a magnificent Theatre that had been <U+017F>et up at one end of it, and
upon which the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ors of the famous <hi>Ro<U+017F>cius</hi> entertained the
Company for two hours.</p>
                     <p>The Comedy being ended, we went into another Bower, not
far from the former, and enlightned after the <U+017F>ame manner, where
we were entertained with a magnificent collation; and that al<U+017F>o
over, the re<U+017F>t of the night was <U+017F>pent in dancing. <hi>Archelaus</hi> danced
with <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> dur<U+017F>t not come neer all the night.
<hi>Polemon</hi> danced with <hi>Marcella,</hi> and had a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with
her, and our Brother <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> with the fair <hi>Martia;</hi> but after
a manner much different from that of the other. For <hi>Polemon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an extraordinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for <hi>Marcella,</hi> who for her part was
not any way moved thereat, and did not much mind the expre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Polemon</hi>'s affection, and <hi>Ptolomey</hi> naturally aver<U+017F>e from love,
unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it were that of his liberty, was little moved at the beauty
of <hi>Martia,</hi> though <U+017F>he were <U+017F>o well furni<U+017F>hed that way as to make
an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on <U+017F>ouls that were mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and had naturally
no aver<U+017F>ion for <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> but lived with him by the directions of
<hi>Octavia,</hi> as if they had been Brother and Si<U+017F>ter. For <hi>Domitius</hi> and
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> their conver<U+017F>ation was ful of freedom, and whereas the
pretentions of <hi>Domitius</hi> were generally countenanced and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and <hi>Agrippina</hi> a per<U+017F>on of a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>atisfied, her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
accordingly met with few traver<U+017F>es of fortune, and <U+017F>o her mind
had little to <U+017F>truggle withal. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Julia</hi> were in the
height of familiarity, in regard no man di<U+017F>puted her with him,
and that he him<U+017F>elf had made his peace with her, as to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97242:32"/>
difference they had had together about the love of <hi>Dru<U+017F>us;</hi> and
for my part, I had my hands full of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who made all the
advantage he could of the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> but the mo<U+017F>t
plea<U+017F>ant part of the <U+017F>tory was a di<U+017F>pute rai<U+017F>ed by <hi>Cypa<U+017F><U+017F>is,</hi> between
<hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> who had waited on her all that day, and who,
upon a very nice and tickli<U+017F>h que<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>aid things worthy the
admiration of all the World. The greate<U+017F>t part of the night
being thus <U+017F>pent, it was thought time to retire, whereupon the
whole Company being di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into Chariots, every one went to,
what was then mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable, re<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>I know Si<U+017F>ter I have not done well thus to digre<U+017F><U+017F>e, or at lea<U+017F>t
there was no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I <U+017F>hould give you <U+017F>uch a particular de<U+017F>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that dayes walking and entertainments, and it is not
unlikely you expected to hear of <U+017F>ome extraordinary accident
<U+017F>ome way relating to this Hi<U+017F>tory. But this <U+017F>hort relation of the
diverti<U+017F>ements of that day, (whereof I have given as brief an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as I could) may be thus far advantageous to you, as to make
you better acquainted, as well with the per<U+017F>ons, as the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
that then were in the Court of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and I have been
<U+017F>o much the larger out of this con<U+017F>ideration, that it was this day
that gave birth to <U+017F>ome things which have <U+017F>ince come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e of
very great con<U+017F>equence. My Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Antonia</hi> and I had layn together
for <U+017F>ome few dayes before, and were extraordinary kind one to
another, as being engaged in a friend<U+017F>hip that allowed as little <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be. As we were undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing our <U+017F>elves
that night, I fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about what had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and though <U+017F>he was extreamly loth
to make me acquainted with it, yet at la<U+017F>t not able to <U+017F>tand out
again<U+017F>t my per<U+017F>ecutions of her, <U+017F>he gave me a punctual account of
all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had had with him, as I have related it to you
already, and di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>o much indignation in the recital thereof,
that notwith<U+017F>tanding the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e which then lay heavy on my
heart, I could not forbear laughing at it, and to torment her with
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about it. But the occa<U+017F>ion I laid hold of to do <U+017F>o, was
yet more hand<U+017F>ome, when, as <U+017F>he put off her cloaths, there fell,
out of one of her <U+017F>leeves, a letter that had been hidden there,
and which was no <U+017F>ooner fallen to the ground, but I took it up,
and having with a great curio<U+017F>ity looked on the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription,
I found written in a hand that was unknown to me. (<hi>To the fair</hi>
Antonia.) I had no <U+017F>ooner eyed that <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription, but pre<U+017F>enting
it to her, and obliging her to read it, <U+017F>he was extreamly at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and perceaving her amazement to be <U+017F>o great as hindred her from
<U+017F>peaking, <hi>Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her, <hi>you have not dealt freely with me,
<U+017F>ince that having acquainted me with the particularities of</hi> Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates'<hi>s
affection, you conceal from me that of another more forunate
Servant of yours, from whom you receave letters.</hi> The<U+017F>e words
put her into a <U+017F>udden blu<U+017F>h; but having <U+017F>oon after recovered her
<U+017F>elf, <hi>Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> replyed <U+017F>he very <U+017F>oberly, <hi>I <U+017F>hall not vindicate my <U+017F>elf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97242:32"/>
to you, and I think you know me better then to believe that I receave
letters from any one. And yet you <U+017F>ee,</hi> replyed I, <hi>that this is very
truely directed to you, and that he that writ it, hath been <U+017F>o much
afraid it <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>carry, that he would needs put your name in the
<U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription in very fair Characters. For that,</hi> replies Antonia,
<hi>be it on the account of his di<U+017F>cretion; but that he hath been <U+017F>o
fortunate in his de<U+017F>ign, as that it <U+017F>hould be known it was directed to
me, is all the <U+017F>atisfaction it will bring him, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, I
am <U+017F>atisfied with the bare <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription, and have no de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee
any more of it. Not but that I am per<U+017F>waded it comes from</hi> Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
<hi>him<U+017F>elf, who will needs accompli<U+017F>h what he <U+017F>o confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
It being not <U+017F>o likely that</hi> Archelaus <hi><U+017F>hould have any hand in it,
<U+017F>ince he talked with me all the evening, and that I cannot believe
every day <U+017F>hould produce per<U+017F>ons guilty of <U+017F>uch an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
However it may be,</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her, <hi>if you are not re<U+017F>olved
to conceal it from me, you will give me leave to read it. You may
as well let it alone,</hi> replies Antonia, <hi>but it would argue in me a
di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of my own <U+017F>trength, <U+017F>hould I forbid you to do it if you are
<U+017F>o re<U+017F>olved. I therefore opened the letter, and began to read aloud
the<U+017F>e words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since that in your judgement there is no di<U+017F>tinction to
be made between adorations and affronts, and that you
think the effects of hatred more <U+017F>upportable than tho<U+017F>e of
love.</p>
                     <p>Now, Si<U+017F>ter, <hi><U+017F>aies Antonia, interrupting me,</hi> was I not in the
right, when I told you it came from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and are they not
his own words in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e that pa<U+017F>t between us? So far, <hi><U+017F>aid I
to her,</hi> I agree with you that <hi>Mithridates</hi> is the Authour of it; but
let us <U+017F>ee what follows, and comfort your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far, as that there is
no new affront offered you in this letter, <U+017F>ince it acquaints you with
nothing but what you knew before. <hi>Antonia</hi> being of the <U+017F>ame
opinion, heard me with much more quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e of thought then before,
<U+017F>o that I began it again, and found it in the<U+017F>e words.</p>
                     <p>SInce that in your judgement there is no di<U+017F>tinction to be made
between adorations and affronts, and that you think the effects of
<hi>Hatred</hi> more <U+017F>upportable than tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Love,</hi> tho<U+017F>e who are de<U+017F>tind
to affront you, <U+017F>ince they are onely <U+017F>uch as are born to adore you,
ought either to conceale the offence from you, or keep the offender
out of your knowledge. For my part, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Antonia,</hi> I am the
greate<U+017F>t of your <hi>Enemies,</hi> <U+017F>ince that I am of all mankind the per<U+017F>on
that hath the greate<U+017F>t <hi>affection</hi> for you, and I tell you that confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which I <U+017F>hould not without trembling, were I not unknown to you.
You have <U+017F>een and known the <hi>per<U+017F>on,</hi> while yet you were ignorant of
his <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;</hi> but now that the <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion</hi> is di<U+017F>covered, it is but fit the
<hi>per<U+017F>on</hi> <U+017F>hould be concealed, that onely his <hi>Love</hi> may be expo<U+017F>ed to
your indignation. And <U+017F>ince it is onely Love that you hate, and not
the per<U+017F>ons that are inclined to love you, if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to engage
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97242:33"/>
the aver<U+017F>ion you have for it, with <U+017F>uch good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e as that you may
be entreated to be more favourable to it, tho<U+017F>e who are guilty of no
other crime, will appear before you in a le<U+017F><U+017F>e odious po<U+017F>ture, when
their crime is pardoned, or at lea<U+017F>t connived at by your indulgence.
The mo<U+017F>t guilty of all tho<U+017F>e that commit any offences of this nature
again<U+017F>t you, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf reduced by your inflexible maximes, to
a cruel nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of either holding his peace, or concealing him<U+017F>elf,
<U+017F>tands in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence at the choice he is to make, which though it be, in
appearance, fanta<U+017F>tick, yet is in its con<U+017F>equences rational enough,
nay haply generous enough, <U+017F>ince that he cannot be charged with any
con<U+017F>ideration of his per<U+017F>on, but onely of his love, and that it is to
induce you to bear with his Love, that he addre<U+017F><U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf to you,
and not to engage you to any affection towards his <hi>per<U+017F>on,</hi> which he
conceals from you, and which he <U+017F>hall conceal, haply, as long as belives.
Pardon him this innocent <U+017F>urprize, which he intends your rigour,
and let onely your Beauty engage again<U+017F>t him, in a ca<U+017F>e wherein,
to puni<U+017F>h the ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his attempt, it wants not the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of
your cruelty.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as I had given over reading, I looked on <hi>Antonia,</hi> who
at the <U+017F>ame time ca<U+017F>t her eyes on my face, with certain di<U+017F>coveries
of a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, not inferiour to what I was in my <U+017F>elf. In a word,
we were both equally <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, and whereas we inferred from
the fir<U+017F>t words of the Letter, that it came from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> we
concluded from the <U+017F>equele, not onely the quite contrary, but
were per<U+017F>waded withall, that the per<U+017F>on who had writ it, had
never made any expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his love to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and that in that
Letter he took occa<U+017F>ion to make the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>coveries of it. 'Tis
true we were <U+017F>omewhat di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful as to that opinion, when we
reflected on the fir<U+017F>t words, which were the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid to
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> and could not apprehend how they could come by
chance <U+017F>o pat into the imagination of the Unknown Lover; but
for all the re<U+017F>t, it had <U+017F>o little relation or con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency either with
the humour, former proceeding of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> or the terms
wherein he was with <hi>Antonia,</hi> that we were <U+017F>atisfied it mu<U+017F>t needs
be <U+017F>ome other, and that one that either out of curio<U+017F>ity or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, might have gotten behind the trees that
were on both <U+017F>ides the walk, wherein the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had pa<U+017F>t,
and li<U+017F>tening attentively to what was <U+017F>aid, had heard <U+017F>ome part
of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Being agreed in this opinion as the mo<U+017F>t probable, we fell into
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon the adventure; <U+017F>o far, that</hi> Antonia <hi>thought there
was <U+017F>ome thing in it <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o extraordinary, that
<U+017F>he could not be angry at it, as <U+017F>he had been before at the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of</hi> Mithridates. <hi>We <U+017F>earched among all the men I have
named to you the per<U+017F>on we could with any likelihood <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect;
but though it was out of all que<U+017F>tion that it was one of tho<U+017F>e
that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the day with us, yet after we had examined them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97242:33"/>
all one after another, we could not fa<U+017F>ten on any one whom we
could charge with it. Divers of them had come neer</hi> Antonia,
<hi>as well during the Comedy, as while they danced, and at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
but of all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>he could remember had had any
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with her, there was not any whom we knew not to be
otherwi<U+017F>e engaged as to matter of affection, or to be much awant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in point of ingenuity, to carry on <U+017F>uch a piece of gallantry.
When we had di<U+017F>covered almo<U+017F>t to wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e about it;</hi> Who it
may be, it matters not, <hi><U+017F>aies Antonia,</hi> he puts him<U+017F>elf to a great
deal of trouble to no purpo<U+017F>e, and if he deprive me of the object of
my indignation, by concealing his per<U+017F>on from me, he al<U+017F>o deprives
him<U+017F>elf, <hi>continued <U+017F>he laughing,</hi> of the acknowledgement I <U+017F>hould
return his affection by not di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf. Ah Si<U+017F>ter, <hi><U+017F>aid I
to her,</hi> how well is this man acquainted with you, and how true is it,
that if you were as ready to make acknowledgements, as to be tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with indignation, he would have taken a cour<U+017F>e quite contrary
to what he hath; but, be he what he will, I do not onely think him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ingenious, but I believe he may carry on his de<U+017F>ign very <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>efully,
and dare pa<U+017F><U+017F>e my word that you have a le<U+017F><U+017F>e aver<U+017F>ion for
him then for <hi>Mithridates</hi> and others, who have been <U+017F>o confident as
to di<U+017F>cover their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions to you. I acknowledge no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>replies
Antonia,</hi> and am of your mind, that if I never know him while I
live, I <U+017F>hall never while I live know whom I ought to hate. However
it may be, <hi>replyed I,</hi> tis out of all doubt, this man hath Vnder<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in that under<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>omething that is great, and <U+017F>igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
very vi<U+017F>ibly that he is a per<U+017F>on of eminent quality, we <U+017F>hall
know him when he <U+017F>hall think it fit. ... And, I hope, <hi>added Antonia,

had abundance of other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this adventure, but it
was <U+017F>o late, or rather <U+017F>o neer day, that we were loath to <U+017F>it up
any longer, <U+017F>o that going to bed a little after, we <U+017F>oon fell

                     <p>For <U+017F>ome dayes en<U+017F>uing, (though it might well be thought,
that the misfortunes of my own life, being at that time <U+017F>uch as
found matter of di<U+017F>content enough, <U+017F>hould have left me but little
curio<U+017F>ity) I made it my earne<U+017F>t bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to find out whom that
Letter <U+017F>hould come from, nay <U+017F>eemed to be much more concerned
in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s than <hi>Antonia</hi> her <U+017F>elf, who looked on all the<U+017F>e things
with the greate<U+017F>t indifference imaginable. And what much
heightned my inqui<U+017F>ition, was, that me thought the adventure
argued <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>o far beyond the ordinary way of proceeding,
that, contrary to my natural inclination, I was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to
<U+017F>ee the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of it. But all the little inquiries I made, proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
for I never could come to the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of any thing;
with <U+017F>o great circum<U+017F>pection had that per<U+017F>on managed all things in

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomey</hi> our Brother, (the onely Brother For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

find you out in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of whom we had not the lea<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the World) lived in <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s Court, after <U+017F>uch a rate as
gave all that knew him occa<U+017F>ion to conceave very great hopes of
him: but as to matter of inclinations, the greate<U+017F>t he <U+017F>eemed to
have, were tho<U+017F>e of his Liberty, nay, though he daily waited on
the faire<U+017F>t Ladies about <hi>Rome,</hi> and was extreamly well entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, yet could it not be inferred from any action of his,
that he had a particular devotion for any. He was a great Lover
of Arms, Hor<U+017F>es, and all Exerci<U+017F>es of the Body, and had a <U+017F>ingular
dexterity therein; but, to <U+017F>igh or pine for a Beauty, was a thing
incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with his humour, as being a per<U+017F>on naturally inclined
to be free and cheerful, and avoided as much as could be all
di<U+017F>traction of thought. The vertuous <hi>Octavia,</hi> who <U+017F>till per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted

wi<U+017F>hed his inclination directed <hi>to Martia,</hi> a Lady courted by the
greate<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and, to <U+017F>peak mode<U+017F>tly of her,
one that had very excellent parts. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> made no difficulty,
to entertain that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e with all the civilities <U+017F>he might expect
from him, nay, di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>omewhat of particular affection for
her, <U+017F>uitably to the good intentions of <hi>Octavia:</hi> but indeed his
flames were come to no great height, though <hi>Martia</hi> were a per<U+017F>on
infinitely lovely, for having a freedom of acce<U+017F><U+017F>e to her every
day, his deportment was accordingly full of cheerfullne<U+017F><U+017F>e and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.
It was much otherwi<U+017F>e with <hi>Martia,</hi> and though <U+017F>he
were of an exemplary vertue and mode<U+017F>ty, yet mu<U+017F>t it withal be
acknowledged, that <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ubje<U+017F>t to much tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of mind, and
having been brought up with <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> as with a per<U+017F>on on whom
her mother had ca<U+017F>t her eies with a de<U+017F>ign to make him her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and lived familiarly with him as with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
friend<U+017F>hip, which, with the names of Brother and Si<U+017F>ter, <hi>Octavia</hi>
would needs have continued among us, had made a greater
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in her mind, then well <U+017F>tood with the <U+017F>erenity and quiet
thereof, <U+017F>o far as that <U+017F>he was no longer able to with<U+017F>tand the
lovely qualities of that Prince, which out of all doubt had
wrought much more upon her inclinations, than hers had upon
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ptolomey.</hi> I had, not without much di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfaction,
taken notice of it my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>everal times chid my Brother
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97242:34"/>
for his backwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e in his acknowledgements of the <U+017F>incere
affection of <hi>Martia:</hi> but the young man, of an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
humour, would make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hift to put me off, telling
me that he loved and honoured <hi>Martia,</hi> as he was obliged
to do, and that he <U+017F>hould be well content to give her the
greate<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ureances <U+017F>he could expect of the devotion he had
for her; but for melancholy, di<U+017F>turbances of mind, and
re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, he looked on them as the de<U+017F>troyers of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and making good what he <U+017F>aid in his actions, he was indeed
very punctual in doing her all manner of civilities, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
nay <U+017F>o far as to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e a more particular affection
for her, then for any other. Yet was it ob<U+017F>ervable withal, that
it was done with a certain di<U+017F>covery of much freedom of mind,
which argued in him <U+017F>uch a mediocrity of inclinations, as that he
would not, to waite on her, abate any thing of his enjoyments,
nor let <U+017F>lip any occa<U+017F>ion that offered it <U+017F>elf to be among the Ladies,
who<U+017F>e company could afford him ought of diver<U+017F>ion. <hi>Martia,</hi>
who is of a very mild di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, endured this indifferent manner
of behaviour a long time, without the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of any
di<U+017F>content thereat: but at la<U+017F>t, looking on it as an evident expre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e and negligence, <U+017F>he began to be troubled,
in<U+017F>omuch that the grief <U+017F>he conceaved thereat, wrought <U+017F>ome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
both in her humour and countenance. All the World took
notice of her <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e; but the motive thereof was ab<U+017F>olutely
unknown, and <hi>Martia,</hi> who made it her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to conceal it
what <U+017F>he could, had haply <U+017F>mothered it to this day, if I had not
ca<U+017F>ually made the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery thereof.</p>
                     <p>During the time that her melancholy grew more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
upon her, taking occa<U+017F>ion to give her a vi<U+017F>it, and finding
her alone, I entreated her of all love to acquaint me with the
cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, which troubled not onely all that knew
her, but my <U+017F>elf more particularly, who (as I was for many con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
obliged to do) had a more than ordinary affection for
her. My care<U+017F><U+017F>es were an<U+017F>wered by <hi>Martia;</hi> after an indifferent
and eva<U+017F>ive manner, yet <U+017F>uch as betrayed much grief and re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Very loath <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be go give me any <U+017F>atisfactory
an<U+017F>wer, and would <U+017F>ay no more then that <U+017F>he knew not any cau<U+017F>e
whence her <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould proceed, and that it mu<U+017F>t be derived
from her temperament or <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of Body. But I, not
<U+017F>atisfied with this an<U+017F>wer, reproached her with a want of <U+017F>incerity,
and was pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her to di<U+017F>cover her mind more freely to a per<U+017F>on
whom <U+017F>he might tru<U+017F>t with any thing, when <hi>Ptolomey</hi> comes into
the Chamber. His fir<U+017F>t appearance wrought <U+017F>uch an alteration
in her, that her colour changed <U+017F>everal times of a <U+017F>udden; and
having ca<U+017F>ually ca<U+017F>t my eies on her countenance, I could not
but immediately take notice of the alteration which my Brothers
coming in had wrought therein. From this di<U+017F>covery I might
well gue<U+017F><U+017F>e at <U+017F>ome part of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and was in a manner
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97242:35"/>
per<U+017F>waded that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> had contributed much to the change of
that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e's di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition.</p>
                     <p>This reflection made me take more particular notice of her
deportment then I had done before, and I ob<U+017F>erved, that while
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> <U+017F>tayed with us, <U+017F>he was at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he found it
<U+017F>ome difficulty to <U+017F>peak. His vi<U+017F>it was indeed but very <U+017F>hort, for
having <U+017F>tayed about a quarter of an hour with us, he told us,
we were too <U+017F>ad for his company, and that he would go to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina's,</hi>
where <hi>Virginia, Horten<U+017F>ia, Telavia,</hi> and <U+017F>everal other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were met, and where he hoped to find more diver<U+017F>ion.
Whereupon going out of the room, he left <hi>Martia</hi> <U+017F>o much
troubled, both at his words, and manner of departure, that the
mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>-ob<U+017F>ervant per<U+017F>on in the World might have perceaved
the di<U+017F>turbance of her thoughts, by the trouble it rai<U+017F>ed in her
countenance. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was my <U+017F>elf much <U+017F>urprized at
<hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s deportment, and angry with him for it, and having
withal ob<U+017F>erved <hi>Martia</hi>'s affliction thereat, I was <U+017F>o much the
more earne<U+017F>t to look further into the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, out of the de<U+017F>ires
I had to <U+017F>erve and oblige her, if it lay in my power. To which
effect reiterating the care<U+017F><U+017F>es and intreaties I had made to her
<U+017F>ome few minutes before, I conjured her by all the friend<U+017F>hip that
was between us, not to conceale from me any longer what her
heart was <U+017F>o much burthened with, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her that that curio<U+017F>ity
in me proceeded not from any thing but the de<U+017F>ires I had to <U+017F>erve
her in that conjuncture, proportionably to the affection I had for
her. But I could not get a word from her, &amp; in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer,
there fell from her eyes <U+017F>ome few tears which <U+017F>he could not po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
keep in any longer, and which <U+017F>he would have concealed from
me by turning her head to the other <U+017F>ide. That di<U+017F>covery rai<U+017F>ed
in me all the compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I could conceave at <U+017F>uch an accident, and
thereupon putting my cheek to hers, with an action that argued
the tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e I had for her, <hi>What Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her, <hi>can you
be <U+017F>o cruel as to conceale from me the cau<U+017F>e of a grief wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much; or have I <U+017F>o poorly de<U+017F>erved your affection,
that you have <U+017F>o little confidence of mine? I dur<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t my life in
your hands,</hi> replies Martia, <hi>nay any thing el<U+017F>e that I thought more
precious; But why will you engage me into a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, whence you
will infer nothing but my foudne<U+017F><U+017F>e and extravagance? Or if you
have any opinion of my prudence, why will you not rather advi<U+017F>e me
to do all that lies in my power to pre<U+017F>erve it? I am <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfied
as to that particular,</hi> replyed I, <hi>that I <U+017F>hall never conceave other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
of you; and that is the rea<U+017F>on I am <U+017F>o importunate with you,
as knowing, that I <U+017F>hall not under<U+017F>tand any thing from you, which
mu<U+017F>t not confirm me in the confidence I have thereof. It argues
the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my obligations to you,</hi> replyed the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>but
be what will the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of it, I cannot have the courage to acquaint
you with my weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and I think I <U+017F>atisfie the duty of our mutual

now left the room, be not in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure the occa<U+017F>ion of
your melancholy, and whether his being awanting in the <U+017F>ervice
he owes you may be <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e of your being di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with

not be acquainted therewith, lea<U+017F>t it made him too in<U+017F>olent, I by
degrees <U+017F>o laid that mild nature, that I brought her to a re<U+017F>olution
of not grieving any longer after that manner, and that <U+017F>he would
rea<U+017F><U+017F>ume her former freedom and plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F><U+017F>e of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, give me leave to acquaint you with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
which the <U+017F>ame day happened to <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and prepare
your <U+017F>elf to hear a very <U+017F>trange accident. He went to <hi>Sabina's,</hi>
as he told us he would, where a great many Ladies met, and among
others, be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e he had named to us, <hi>Helvidia, Sulpicia,
Emilia,</hi> (whom I made mention of in the adventures of <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> &amp; who was <U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince married to <hi>Scipio</hi>) and with
her that inexorable <hi>Tullia,</hi> who had been the cau<U+017F>e of the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of
our Elder Brother. After the death of <hi>Caecinna,</hi> and the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
accident I have already related to you, <U+017F>he retired to <hi>Tu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi>
where <U+017F>he continued <U+017F>ix years, without ever coming once
to <hi>Rome;</hi> during which time <hi>Cicero,</hi> her Brother, had made his
abode in <hi>Africk,</hi> where he was <hi>Procon<U+017F>ul;</hi> but being not long
before returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had brought his Si<U+017F>ter with him,
which to effect he had u<U+017F>ed all the authority he had over her,
otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had <U+017F>till continued her <U+017F>olitude. 'Twas not above
three dayes before that <U+017F>he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where <U+017F>he was thought as
beautiful as when <U+017F>he left it, though <U+017F>he were then about three or
four and twenty years of age, and had a <U+017F>ufficient mea<U+017F>ure of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome alteration in her beauty. Her dre<U+017F><U+017F>e was not after
the exactne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the mode, yet neat, and there was in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<U+017F>uch a conjunction of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and maje<U+017F>ty, that <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
who had never <U+017F>een her before, immediately took notice of her
more than of any of the re<U+017F>t. At his coming in, the company
was gotten into a long Gallery, where they were looking on the
pieces that were hanged about it, yet <U+017F>o as they were divided into
parties, according to the difference of pictures more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was not expected in this company, and if <hi>Sabina</hi>
had had any notice of his coming, <U+017F>he would not have had <hi>Tullia</hi>
there, though <U+017F>he were of her mo<U+017F>t intimate acquaintances: but
he being of a quality that won him a welcom reception every
where, and that the excellencies of his per<U+017F>on recommended him
no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then the rank he was of, he was very kindly entertained,
<U+017F>o far as that <U+017F>ome part of the company came about him at his
entrance into the room. Being a per<U+017F>on of a maje<U+017F>tick look, a noble
carriage of body, and a deportment infinitely taking, <hi>Tullia</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ob<U+017F>erved him, not without <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he viewed him
with <U+017F>uch a look as di<U+017F>covered, that, notwith<U+017F>tanding his being
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Son, he <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>uch to her, as could not rai<U+017F>e her aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion.
Now <U+017F>he being the onely per<U+017F>on in the company to whom
he was unknown, <U+017F>he a<U+017F>ked one that <U+017F>tood next her, what his name
was; which <U+017F>he had no <U+017F>ooner heard, but there ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a tempe<U+017F>t
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97242:36"/>
in her countenance, that the alteration happened therein was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
by all tho<U+017F>e that looked on her. She was once in a thought
to leave the company, whereupon coming up to <hi>Emilia,</hi> and whi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
her in the ear with <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>turbance, <hi>What,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,
<hi>can the World afford me no place of refuge again<U+017F>t the Children of</hi>
Anthony? <hi>Emilia,</hi> who was troubled at the accident, made her
no immediate an<U+017F>wer; but <hi>Sabina,</hi> as Lady of the Hou<U+017F>e, coming
neer her to make excu<U+017F>es for what was happened, and to let her
know that <U+017F>he was as much <U+017F>urprized at <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s arrival, as <U+017F>he
was, told her withal, that he was a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>uch quality, as not
to be forced out of the hou<U+017F>e. Whereupon <hi>Emilia,</hi> having <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
recovered her <U+017F>elf, intreated her not to make any di<U+017F>turbance
in the company, and to remember her <U+017F>elf, that the two publick
di<U+017F>coveries <U+017F>he had made of her aver<U+017F>ion for the children of
<hi>Anthony</hi> had produced effects but too too deplorable; that <U+017F>he
might <U+017F>tay in the room, yet not engage her <U+017F>elf into any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
conver<U+017F>ation with <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and from that day avoid all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of meeting with him; that <U+017F>he would undertake, that
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> <U+017F>hould not endeavour any acquaintance with her, and
that <U+017F>he knew <U+017F>o much of his humour, as rai<U+017F>ed in her a confidence
that he would not be guilty of tho<U+017F>e importunities towards her,
which his Brother had been. <hi>Sabina</hi> added her intreaties to
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and both together prevailed <U+017F>o far with
<hi>Tullia,</hi> that they per<U+017F>waded her to <U+017F>tay with them as long as the
re<U+017F>t did.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who, upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, had taken
notice of <hi>Tullia's</hi> beauty, and had further ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome part of
the trouble which his pre<U+017F>ence had rai<U+017F>ed in her, and <U+017F>ome thing
of what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in that part of the Gallery where <U+017F>he had
retired, being in <U+017F>ome impatience to know the name of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
per<U+017F>on, asked it of <hi>Albinus,</hi> who, making no difficulty, to
give him an account of her, filled him with a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment. He
retreated <U+017F>ome few paces, as <U+017F>omewhat amazed, and looking on
her more attentively than before; <hi>What,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>is this the <U+017F>ame
inexorable</hi> Tullia, <hi>that terrible Beauty, by who<U+017F>e means we have lo<U+017F>t
our Brother?</hi> At the<U+017F>e words he <U+017F>topped, running over in his mind
thou<U+017F>ands of things which pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves confu<U+017F>edly to his
imagination. The relation had been made of the in<U+017F>upportable
treatments which our Brother had receaved from her, and the
<U+017F>ad effects they had produced, rai<U+017F>ed in him <U+017F>uch bitter re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
again<U+017F>t her, as made him abhor her as an over-cruel enemy;
And though he were not ignorant of the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he had to defie
all communication with our hou<U+017F>e, yet was it his judgement, as
well as of a many others, that <U+017F>he was exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively violent again<U+017F>t a
Prince, that had given her <U+017F>o great a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his love, and who,
as to his per<U+017F>on, was very amiable and much re<U+017F>pected. He had
often wi<U+017F>hed a meeting with her, to <U+017F>ee, as he would <U+017F>ay him<U+017F>elf,
what making that terrible per<U+017F>on was of, and to try, whether his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97242:37"/>
<U+017F>oul were <U+017F>o immalleable, and con<U+017F>equently not able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the
influences of her beauty better then that of <hi>Julius Antonius</hi> did.
But <hi>Tullia</hi> being not returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of her coming thither, he had quitted all hopes of it,
nay, lo<U+017F>t all remembrance of her. At la<U+017F>t, having recovered him<U+017F>elf
out of the fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment he had conceaved at the rencounter,
he fortified his heart with more fiercene<U+017F><U+017F>e then ordinary, <U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
all his indignation, to avoid a fate like that of his Brothers.
But he <U+017F>tood not in any need of that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, for, whether it
proceeded from the prejudice he had again<U+017F>t her, or from a certain
Antipathy: he was not guilty of the lea<U+017F>t inclination for her, and
accordingly looking on her with a <U+017F>cornful <U+017F>mile; <hi>Arme thy <U+017F>elf,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf, <hi>with all the charms of imperious beauty, thou
<U+017F>halt not treat me as thou did<U+017F>t my Brother.</hi> He was at fir<U+017F>t in a
mind to be gone, as being unwilling that his pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e
any di<U+017F>traction in a company whereto he had not any invitation;
but not long after perceaving, that all were <U+017F>atisfied with his being
there, and that <hi>Sabina</hi> her <U+017F>elf was not troubled at it, he re<U+017F>olved
to <U+017F>tay, as thinking it no di<U+017F>cretion to deprive him<U+017F>elf of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
to do the enemy of our hou<U+017F>e a plea<U+017F>ure, and being not
much troubled at the <U+017F>pight he thought he did her by his
<U+017F>tay.</p>
                     <p>Being a per<U+017F>on infinitely ma<U+017F>ter of him<U+017F>elf, he immediately
rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed his ordinary plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and while the conver<U+017F>ation
la<U+017F>ted, there fell from him the mo<U+017F>t ingenious things he had <U+017F>aid
in his life, and that with <U+017F>uch a grace, that all the company admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him. Even <hi>Tullia</hi> her <U+017F>elf was as attentive as any, could not
forbear looking on him, and found, to her grief, that her indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not <U+017F>o violent, as <U+017F>he had wi<U+017F>hed it might have been. They
<U+017F>pent the time in <U+017F>everal recreations, they danced, they had a collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>portive, the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant, and, out
of all doubt, the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on in the company, <U+017F>o did he
accordingly, in the dancing, and all the other entertainments,
draw the eyes and ears of the pre<U+017F>ence after him. He <U+017F>ung, he
danced with abundance of grace, nay, he would needs that day
make the greate<U+017F>t o<U+017F>tentation he could of him<U+017F>elf, purpo<U+017F>ely to
put his enemy out of countenance, and to let her know that the
children of <hi>Anthony,</hi> were not <U+017F>o contemptible as <U+017F>he would by
her example have per<U+017F>waded the World. His intention as to <U+017F>ome
part proved effectual, as to the re<U+017F>t, it produced effects much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from tho<U+017F>e which he expected it <U+017F>hould. He <U+017F>poke to all
the Ladies that were pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>everal times, <hi>Tullia</hi> onely excepted,
whom yet he treated not with any incivility, or did any action
that might di<U+017F>oblige her, as well out of a re<U+017F>pect for her <U+017F>ex, as
upon <hi>Sabina's</hi> account, thinking it enough to be at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance
from her, as it were to make <U+017F>hew of re<U+017F>pect, and the fear he was
in to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her. He looked on her often, and he ob<U+017F>erved her
eyes were in a manner alwayes fa<U+017F>tened on his countenance. He
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97242:37"/>
at fir<U+017F>t conceaved her looks to be <U+017F>uch as proceeded from indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but afterwards he was <U+017F>atisfied there was nothing of ho<U+017F>tility in
them, and that her eyes darted no more rigour on him, then any
other of the company. That ob<U+017F>ervation made him the more
<U+017F>elf-conceited<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in<U+017F>omuch, that having that day re<U+017F>olved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ident
even to a degree of in<U+017F>olence, whi<U+017F>pering <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who
<U+017F>tood by him, in the ear, yet without turning his eyes towards
<hi>Tullia,</hi> whom he would by no means offend; <hi>Pray give me your
opinion,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to him, with a plea<U+017F>ant kind of pre<U+017F>umption, <hi>do
not you perceave, that that cruel enemy of ours, who treated our elder
Brother with <U+017F>uch rigour, honours us with her looks? I have taken
notice of it, as well as your <U+017F>elf,</hi> <U+017F>aies Lentulus to him, <hi>and you
would think it very <U+017F>trange, if, in<U+017F>tead of the aver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he hath for
your hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have a contrary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for you. I <U+017F>hould indeed
be extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it,</hi> replies Ptolomey, <hi>but if it <U+017F>hould be
the plea<U+017F>ure of the gods that <U+017F>uch a thing <U+017F>hould come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
to you I <U+017F>hould revenge my Brother. How,</hi> added Lentulus,
taking him to the window, that they might not be heard, <hi>you
would behave your <U+017F>elf barbarou<U+017F>ly and inflexibly towards a Beauty
that had an affection for you, and would act the part of</hi> Tullia <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, if <U+017F>he acted towards you that of</hi> Julius Antonius? <hi>I have
not hitherto,</hi> replyed my Brother, <hi>been any wayes in a condition
to exerci<U+017F>e my cruelty, and when things <U+017F>hall come to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that
you <U+017F>peak of, I <U+017F>hall not be guilty of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>corns and incivilities
towards</hi> Tullia, <hi>which <U+017F>he was towards my Brother, becau<U+017F>e it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
I <U+017F>hould ever be exempted from that re<U+017F>pect which I owe her
Sex. But I would have her to know, that that de<U+017F>tiny, rather then his
own rea<U+017F>on, which forced my Brother into the extremities of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
and extravagance, hath not the <U+017F>ame influence on me, and that
there can but little love be expected from me for a per<U+017F>on guilty of <U+017F>o
much aver<U+017F>ion for an innocent Prince, and one <U+017F>o eminent as</hi> Julius
Antonius <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While <hi>Ptolomey</hi> broke forth into the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and chafed
him<U+017F>elf into exa<U+017F>peration by the <U+017F>ight of that female enemy of
his, there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed things of a quite different nature in the <U+017F>oul of
<hi>Tullia;</hi> in<U+017F>omuch that though that Beauty did all <U+017F>he could to
heighten her dete<U+017F>tation again<U+017F>t <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> yet that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, di<U+017F>arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of its main <U+017F>trength, was <U+017F>o far from contributing any thing
thereto, that it <U+017F>eemed of no force at all, and whether it were
that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw in the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> (<U+017F>on to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and not
to <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who had been <hi>Cicero</hi>'s implacable enemy, and much more
the occa<U+017F>ion of his death than <hi>Anthony</hi>) but one half of its object,
or that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ubmitted to <U+017F>ome unknown power, <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed to
obey in that emergency, and felt her <U+017F>elf di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had kept up her <U+017F>pirit with <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>tancy. In a word, to

much diver<U+017F>ion in an adventure I take but little plea<U+017F>ure in, I love
you too well to conceal any circum<U+017F>tance from you, which may adde
any thing to your <U+017F>atisfaction. I have <U+017F>pent this whole day at the
Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e's, where were all the mo<U+017F>t eminent about the Court, five or
<U+017F>ix onely excepted that were at <hi>Sabina's,</hi> and this evening as I came
away, I found a Letter in my hand-kerchief, and cannot imagine
by what means it <U+017F>hould come thither without my knowledge; and
<U+017F>ince I think it out of all que<U+017F>tion that it comes from the <U+017F>ame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
per<U+017F>on you wot of, I thought <U+017F>it to bring it away with me, that
you might have the full <U+017F>atisfaction of it. <hi>Having with the<U+017F>e words
put it into my hands, I took it without making her any reply, and
having opened it, found therein the<U+017F>e words.</hi>

                        <p>I Have <U+017F>een you this day, and found you brighter and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than the <U+017F>tar from which we derive our light, and have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
of the excellencies of your conver<U+017F>ation. You have
<U+017F>een me, you have looked on me favourably, nay, <U+017F>uch was your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
you have given me leave to entertain you with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as any of tho<U+017F>e that were pre<U+017F>ent, nay, what is yet more, there
were <U+017F>ome not <U+017F>o well treated as my <U+017F>elf, and who<U+017F>e condition I have
been far from envying, as to any thing hath happened this day. Hence
you may <U+017F>ee, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Antonia,</hi> what advantages I make of the re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have taken to conceal from you the name of your enemy. Had
you known me to be that criminel that dur<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ume to adore you,
and <U+017F>ticks not to tell you <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hould have been thru<U+017F>t away with as
much contempt as <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and have been as di<U+017F>contented as
<hi>Archelaus,</hi> who<U+017F>e fortune hath not been much better. But in regard
you could not either in my countenance or yet in my de<U+017F>ignes perceave
the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of what I have in my heart, you have looked on
me, and treated me as an innocent per<U+017F>on, though I really were the
mo<U+017F>t guilty of all the company. See then, incomparable Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,
whether <hi>I</hi> am any wayes to be blamed, for putting this trick upon
you, and pardon it me, <U+017F>ince that, of all tho<U+017F>e that ever were done, it
is the mo<U+017F>t innocent.</p>

No que<U+017F>tion Si<U+017F>ter but it is, <hi><U+017F>aid I, having read out the letter,
and delivering it to her;</hi> he de<U+017F>erves to be pardoned, for there
never was any thing of <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e or circumvention more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>able
than this. That then it your judgement, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi>
but for my part, <hi>I</hi> am not ab<U+017F>olutely of the <U+017F>ame, and there is haply
in this artifice much more malice and de<U+017F>ign then you imagine. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceave, <hi>replyed I,</hi> what malice you can <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect there may be
in it; I can <U+017F>ee nothing but abundance of re<U+017F>pect and care to avoid
the occa<U+017F>ions of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing you. But Si<U+017F>ter, <hi>added I,</hi> can you not
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any one of all tho<U+017F>e you have <U+017F>een to day? The number was
<U+017F>o great, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi> that I know not on whom particularly to
fix my thoughts, for there were pre<U+017F>ent <hi>Agrippa, Mecaenas, Marcellus,
Domitius, Tiberius, Dru<U+017F>us, Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us, Aemilianus, Cinna, Cepio,
Pollio, Flavianus, Servilius, Polemon, Archelaus, Mithridates,

Court, <U+017F>o that among <U+017F>o many, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to make
any certain judgement.</p>
                        <p>Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had been longer upon this <U+017F>ubject, had not <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey</hi>
come into the room, and put us from what we were then
upon, with what he had to <U+017F>ay of another accident had happened
to him. For he had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et his foot in the Chamber, but
crying out to me, as it were in a tran<U+017F>port of joy, <hi>I have <U+017F>een her,
Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to me, <hi>I have <U+017F>een that terrible one, I have <U+017F>een that
inexorable Beauty, and thanks be to the gods, <U+017F>he hath done me no
hurt.</hi> The<U+017F>e words, uttered by him with a certain precipitation,
gave me not any light to gue<U+017F><U+017F>e at the adventure had happened
to him, nor was it likely I <U+017F>hould have imagined any thing neer it;
but <hi>Antonia</hi> having asked him what it might be, he related to us
how he had met with the cruel <hi>Tullia,</hi> at <hi>Sabina's,</hi> how he had
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away the whole day with her, and in a word, gave us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of that meeting, even to the la<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>tances.
I was extreamly troubled at the relation, to <U+017F>ee that inflexible
beauty, as it were newly reviving, by who<U+017F>e means we had lo<U+017F>t
our Brother, and was afraid <U+017F>ome unfortunate accident would have
been the effect of her returne, which I had no <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F>covered to
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> but he made thou<U+017F>ands of prote<U+017F>tations to me, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with oaths, that there was not any woman in the World which he
<U+017F>hould not affect rather than <hi>Tullia,</hi> though he could not deny but
that he thought her very hand<U+017F>ome, and was per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he had
abundance of worth in her. I was over-joyd at tho<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>urances,
as well becau<U+017F>e I could not by any means affect <hi>Tullia,</hi> after the
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of a Brother, <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>he had forced away from us, as becau<U+017F>e
I was de<U+017F>irous that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> <U+017F>hould have been at the <U+017F>ervice of
<hi>Martia,</hi> not onely for the extraordinary perfections of that
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, the affection <U+017F>he had for him, and the re<U+017F>pects I had for
her, but al<U+017F>o out of a con<U+017F>ideration of the advantages of Fortune
which mu<U+017F>t needs have followed upon that allyance, <U+017F>uch as he
had all the rea<U+017F>on in the World to embrace. From that day I took
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97242:39"/>
occa<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>cover my thoughts more and more to him, and to
repre<U+017F>ent to him what obligations he had to <hi>Martia, Octavia,</hi> and
her <U+017F>elf; and, <U+017F>econded by <hi>Antonia,</hi> I made him <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of all
things, that, though he was not much <U+017F>ubject to make over-<U+017F>erious
reflections on things, yet he promi<U+017F>ed us to devote him<U+017F>elf ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to <hi>Martia,</hi> for whom he had an infinite e<U+017F>teem and affection,
and whom he would never give any occa<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy;
in<U+017F>omuch, that giving her a vi<U+017F>it that very night, he made
thou<U+017F>ands of prote<U+017F>tations of his fidelity to her, and that with
circum<U+017F>tances <U+017F>o full of ardor and obligation, that <U+017F>hew was extreamly
<U+017F>atisfied therewith.</p>
                        <p>The very <U+017F>ame night, the unknown <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Antonia</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her with a <hi>Serenade,</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of certain in<U+017F>truments, and
the be<U+017F>t voices in the World. But, we two lying together, <hi>Antonia</hi>
<U+017F>aid it might be as well intended for me as for her, and that among
the voices <U+017F>he knew <U+017F>ome to be of the Emperours Mu<U+017F>ick, whom
none but <hi>Tiberius</hi> could employ; but it was long <U+017F>ince <hi>Tiberius</hi> and
I had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed our <U+017F>elves one to another by <hi>Serenades,</hi> <U+017F>o that
<hi>Antonia</hi> was at la<U+017F>t per<U+017F>waded to the contrary, when, after a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
which was <U+017F>ung in <U+017F>everal parts, the whole Mu<U+017F>ick joyned
together to <U+017F>ing the<U+017F>e words which we heard di<U+017F>tinctly, and which
I could not but remember, as having been <U+017F>ung three or four
times over.</p>

                        <p>There needed but the<U+017F>e words to take away all conte<U+017F>tation
between <hi>Antonia</hi> and my <U+017F>elf, in<U+017F>omuch, that <U+017F>ince it was out
of her power to remedy it, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved, though not without
much trouble, to endure the per<U+017F>ecution. I could not forbear
laughing at the di<U+017F>turbance <U+017F>he was in, and no que<U+017F>tion but I might
have found a great plea<U+017F>ure in the adventure, had my thoughts
been <U+017F>ubject to a certain innocent mi<U+017F>chievou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e, wherein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of our age find them<U+017F>elves no <U+017F>mal diver<U+017F>ion, But, be<U+017F>ides
that I have a natural di<U+017F>-inclination to any <U+017F>uch thing, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of my life have abated very much of my cheerful di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition;
and if it might be thought that I had at that time <U+017F>ome
favourable intervals upon the news which came to Rome of the
great <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who with his <U+017F>word opened him<U+017F>elf
a way to rea<U+017F>cend the throne of his Ance<U+017F>tors, I became on the
other <U+017F>ide more and more <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected at the Court, and it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
threatned I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ecured, as indeed I was, not long after,

There were already five or <U+017F>ix dayes pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
expectation in Rome of a diverti<U+017F>ement which the Emperour
was to have upon the <hi>Tiber</hi> in one of the faire<U+017F>t nights of the
Summer, to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the love he bore <hi>Terentia,</hi> as it was reported,
where by the means of certain artificial fires of the invention of
the Greeks there was made, in above a hundred <U+017F>everal figures, a
new day upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> wherein, becau<U+017F>e it is not of it <U+017F>elf broad
enough for <U+017F>uch a kind of diverti<U+017F>ement, the Emperour hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
a new channel to be made below the City, which is <U+017F>ix times
broader and deeper than the ordinary current: <U+017F>o that with that
light multiplyed by that of a thou<U+017F>and torches, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed
along the banks on both <U+017F>ides, there was <U+017F>een a little <U+017F>ea-<U+017F>ight,
wherein a great number of <U+017F>mall boats, made after the manner of
men of war, and all covered over with artificial fires, cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing and
engaging one the other, according to the order agreed on before,
entertained the Spectators with one of the mo<U+017F>t delightful <U+017F>ights
in the World. The plea<U+017F>ure of the eye was <U+017F>econded by that
which was provided for the ear by the <U+017F>ound of thou<U+017F>ands of war
in<U+017F>truments, which rai<U+017F>ed an echo from the banks of the River
for above a hundred <hi>Stadia</hi> about, and which in<U+017F>tead of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed
noi<U+017F>e, made an harmonious <U+017F>ound with much art, which,
<U+017F>miting the ear, in<U+017F>pired the mo<U+017F>t vigilant with a certain joy, and
rai<U+017F>ed up the <U+017F>pirits of the mo<U+017F>t dull. And whereas the boats
that are up and down the <hi>Tiber</hi> are very little, e<U+017F>pecially in the
ordinary channel, and that there was requi<U+017F>ite a va<U+017F>t number of
them to receave tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons that would participate of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ement,
people were forced to divide them<U+017F>elves into <U+017F>mall
parties, and for the mo<U+017F>t part there went but five or <U+017F>ix per<U+017F>ons in
every boat. This was it that gave occa<U+017F>ion and birth to a thou<U+017F>and
de<U+017F>ignes of gallantry, and obliged the young Romans to prepare
boats for the Ladies they were <U+017F>ervants to, the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>umptuous
could be made for the time. <hi>Tiberius</hi> had provided for me a
very magnificent one, and <hi>Archelaus</hi> another for <hi>Antonia,</hi> with
abundance of intreaties that <U+017F>he would vouch<U+017F>afe to accept of it;
but we, having no inclination to engage our <U+017F>elves into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, had re<U+017F>olved-before hand to take a boat for
<hi>Antonia, Martia,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others of our own <U+017F>ex, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who had taken that charge upon him, and <U+017F>hould
have wayted upon us.</p>
                        <p>But while we were hot upon this re<U+017F>olution, comes a per<U+017F>on of
a goodly pre<U+017F>ence to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Antonia,</hi> and to acquai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t her that
the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e had provided a boat for her, and <U+017F>uch of her Friends
as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be plea<U+017F>ed to take along with her, and had <U+017F>ent him to
conduct them to it, and to take care for all things requi<U+017F>ite, during
the time of that nights diverti<U+017F>ement. Thought <hi>Antonia</hi> knew
not that Officer of the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e's, yet thought <U+017F>he that <U+017F>he could
not with civility refu<U+017F>e what was proffered, and knowing her to
be naturally imperious, <U+017F>he was the more affraid it might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97242:40"/>
her, if <U+017F>he made any difficulty to accept of it. Whereupon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards me, as it were, to ask my advice, and perceiving my
comply ance with her intentions, <U+017F>he returned the man an
an<U+017F>wer, to this effect, That the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e did her too great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but that <U+017F>ince it was her plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>o to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her, <U+017F>he
receaved that favour with the <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>pects which <U+017F>he ought to
have for all tho<U+017F>e that proceeded from her goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e; at which
words <hi>Martia</hi> and <hi>Ptolomey</hi> coming into the room, and having
confirmed her in that re<U+017F>olution, de<U+017F>ired to be of our company,
and we took al<U+017F>o along <hi>Sulpicia</hi> and <hi>Horten<U+017F>ia,</hi> who were come to
give us a vi<U+017F>it. All the re<U+017F>t of the hou<U+017F>e had di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
as they thought fit; <hi>Marcellus</hi> had prepared a boat for <hi>Julia,</hi>
and waited on her; <hi>Domitius</hi> had done the like for <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
and <hi>Agrippa</hi> for <hi>Marcella. Octavia</hi> <U+017F>tirred not out of her Chamber,
where I would have gladly kept her company, had <U+017F>he given me
leave to do it. We went along with that Officer down to the
river <U+017F>ide through the Garden, and at the door the boat waited
for us, which we got into without being able to take notice of the
<U+017F>uptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it, by rea<U+017F>on of the ob<U+017F>curity of the place, which
was not yet enlightned. But we were <U+017F>carce got in, ere the torches
were all lighted of an in<U+017F>ant, in<U+017F>omuch that we were not a little
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed as well at the <U+017F>uddenne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the light, as the objects
that pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves to our <U+017F>ight, which certainly were the
mo<U+017F>t delightful that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>The boat was in the form of a little Galley compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about by
a row of Pila<U+017F>ters, which <U+017F>eemed to be of gold, but was indeed of
wood guilt; without which hung out a hundred arms guilt as the
row of Pila<U+017F>ters, which <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained a hundred great torches of virgin wax,
whereby the darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the night was removed to the
di<U+017F>tance of many <U+017F>tadia. The oars <U+017F>eemed to be of gold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to all the re<U+017F>t, and the Rowers were twelve little Cupids
winged, armed with arrows and quiver, and covered with cloath
of gold in tho<U+017F>e parts of their bodies where it was not requi<U+017F>ite
they <U+017F>hould be naked. At the extremity of the <U+017F>tern grew up a
golden tree, of the height of an ordinary ma<U+017F>t, having at the top
the form of a Scuttle, compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about by a row of golden
Pila<U+017F>ters and twelve arms proportionable to tho<U+017F>e be low, wherein
were tw, lve torches, and in the mid<U+017F>t of all that <U+017F>ight was a Heart
hanginge down, which <U+017F>eemed to be all on fire, and out of
which, by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange artifice there vi<U+017F>ibly i<U+017F><U+017F>ued flames a<U+017F>cending
up towards the <U+017F>tars, and made more light than all the torches. In
the di<U+017F>tances which were between the torches were hung up twelve
Streamers, which were to<U+017F>t up and down by the flames, and the
<U+017F>moke a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>everal wayes, and in which by rea<U+017F>on of the
greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the light, there might be di<U+017F>tinctly <U+017F>een double
A. A's, with other Characters, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>everal waies the word
<hi>ANTONIA.</hi> The <U+017F>ame Letters, and the <U+017F>ame Characters were
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed up and down all over the boat, as al<U+017F>o upon the Pila<U+017F>ters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97242:40"/>
the oars and the ma<U+017F>t, and it was <U+017F>o light<U+017F>ome every where, that
the lea<U+017F>t things could not be more di<U+017F>tinctly di<U+017F>cerned than they
were at that time.</p>
                        <p>But if we were <U+017F>o much <U+017F>urprized by what we were entertained
with, on the out<U+017F>ide of the boat, we could not but be <U+017F>o much
the more, when we were brought into the chamber that was
within it, where we had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et foot, but our <U+017F>ight was
dazled with the lu<U+017F>tre of the gold and other embeli<U+017F>hments,
wherewith it <U+017F>parkled again. Where ever there was any gold
to be be<U+017F>towed, it was with the greate<U+017F>t profu<U+017F>ion imaginable;
and where there was any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to heighten the richne<U+017F>s of the
matter, by the perfection of art, all was done with admirable
dexterity, but with this every where ob<U+017F>ervable, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of <hi>ANTONIA</hi> were <U+017F>cattered up and down all places.
The ground work and the <U+017F>eeling had the <U+017F>ame, and the hangings,
the chaires and the cu<U+017F>hions were of sky-coloured Velvet, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with flames of gold in embrodery, as al<U+017F>o burning Hearts,
Characters of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and the fir<U+017F>t letters of her name. This
little Chamber was admirably enlightned, and perfumed with the
mo<U+017F>t delightfull <U+017F>ents that <hi>Arabia</hi> could afford: and what was yet a
greater convenience, (which was, that we might without <U+017F>tirring
out of the Chamber, participate of that nights diverti<U+017F>ement, and
might be <U+017F>een by all tho<U+017F>e that were upon the <hi>Tiber</hi>) that part of
it which was covered by the hangings, was onely of gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that
as <U+017F>oon as tho<U+017F>e, which were made curtain-wi<U+017F>e for that purpo<U+017F>e,
were drawn, the river lay open to our <U+017F>ights of all <U+017F>ides, the
Chamber it <U+017F>elf was vi<U+017F>ible to all that were in the other boats, and
the light that was <U+017F>cattered by <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a number of torches as were
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed about our Galley, and which enlightned the Chamber fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, as well without as within, made <U+017F>uch a fire
on the river, as found light for all the other boats, and <U+017F>eized with
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw it.</p>
                        <p>You are not I believe, Si<U+017F>ter, much in doubt whether we were
much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed or not, when we found our <U+017F>elves in that little
enchanted ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and you would be <U+017F>oon per<U+017F>waded that we had
been deceaved, and that it was not to the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e that we were
obliged for that magnificent lodging. <hi>Antonia</hi> looked on me, not
knowing what to think of tho<U+017F>e things, and I could ea<U+017F>ily perceave
in her countenance that <U+017F>he was to <U+017F>eek as to all re<U+017F>olution, and
that <U+017F>he was vext to the heart at the trick had been put upon her.
She looked all about for that Officer of <hi>Livia,</hi> but he was vani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as <U+017F>oon they were gotten into the boat, <U+017F>o that there was onely
the <hi>Cupids</hi> that rowed, left for her to wreak her indignation
upon.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, which way <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he looked, <U+017F>he met with
her own Characters and the Letters of her name <U+017F>cattered up and
down among<U+017F>t the burning hearts, and what <U+017F>he was mo<U+017F>t of all
troubled at, was, that the very <U+017F>ame Characters were expo<U+017F>ed in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97242:41"/>
the <U+017F>treamers at the top-ma<U+017F>t, fluttering as it were amid<U+017F>t the
flames of that burning Heart, and, by rea<U+017F>on of the great light
whereby they were encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, were vi<U+017F>ible to all that were
upon the River. The vexation it was to her to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o much aver<U+017F>ion for, had
put her out of all patience, if <hi>Ptolomey, Martia,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf had
not laughed her into a good humour, and told her, that if the
<U+017F>ame thing had happened to us, we had entertained the adventure
with abundance of enjoyment. By this means did we make a <U+017F>hift
to di<U+017F>pel the clouds of her melancholy, and di<U+017F>turbance, and con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at lea<U+017F>ure all tho<U+017F>e rarities which we could not have di<U+017F>cern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight.</p>
                        <p>But this was not our employment alone, for this great fire, and
that admirable object which it di<U+017F>covered, had hardly appeared
on the waves of <hi>Tiber,</hi> but all the boats left the places they had
taken up, to come neerer to that which they wondred at <U+017F>o much
at a di<U+017F>tance. The Torches, the Heart, the Streamers which were,
from the top of the ma<U+017F>t, remarkable on all <U+017F>ides, immediately
drew all the World to it; in<U+017F>omuch that the Emperour him<U+017F>elf,
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this <U+017F>ight as well as others, cau<U+017F>ed his own boat to
approach it, At fir<U+017F>t the report went from one to another that it
was <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, <U+017F>o that all coming as neer as they could to
<hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, there could hardly be any thing el<U+017F>e heard on
the water, but <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, and the greate<U+017F>t part were re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
onely to follow it, not minding much the other diverti<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for which they were a<U+017F><U+017F>embled. The Emperour, <hi>Livia,
Marcellus, Julia, Agrippa,</hi> and all the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable per<U+017F>ons
having compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it about not without a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>
a<U+017F>ked who had be<U+017F>towed that magnificent Galley on <hi>Antonia?</hi>
To which the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e not knowing what to imagine could onely
<U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he had receaved it from the liberality of the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e.
<hi>Livia</hi> began to deny that <U+017F>he had made her any <U+017F>uch pre<U+017F>ent, which
the Emperour hearing, told her <U+017F>he needed not take <U+017F>uch pains to
vindicate her <U+017F>elf, and that it was apparent from all <U+017F>igns and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances
that that exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of gallantry &amp; magnificence proceeded
from the invention and prodigality of <U+017F>ome Lover. But while all
the<U+017F>e eminent per<U+017F>ons were a<U+017F><U+017F>embled about the Galley, <U+017F>ix of the
<hi>Cupids,</hi> who were the Rowers, coming into the Chamber, drew the
hangings, and di<U+017F>covering through the tran<U+017F>parent walls thereof
what was within the Chamber, filled all that were pre<U+017F>ent with a
new a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, and all the places about with a new light, which
both neer and at a di<U+017F>tance was the mo<U+017F>t delightful thing that could
be <U+017F>een.</p>
                        <p>I <U+017F>hall not trouble you with any further particulars of that nights
entertainment, the de<U+017F>cription I have already made thereof having
been haply too long, and therefore <U+017F>hall onely tell you, that, when
all had <U+017F>ufficiently admired <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, and had <U+017F>pent a
long time in talking of it, had almo<U+017F>t tyred them<U+017F>elves in gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97242:41"/>
at the Authour of <U+017F>o <U+017F>umptuous an invention, and had celebrated
this <U+017F>ight beyond tho<U+017F>e that were to <U+017F>ucceed it, they all advanced
towards the place where they were to be entertained with the <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ight,
and the artificial fires, doing our Galley the honour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, as it it had been the Leader of them, the lights of all the
others being as much darkened by ours, as the <U+017F>maller <U+017F>tars are by
the raies of that bright torch whence we derive our day. I <U+017F>hall
not give you any de<U+017F>cription of that nights diverti<U+017F>ements, which
it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed were not unworthy <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s magnificence; but
<U+017F>hall onely tell you, that when all was over, and that it was
thought time for all to retire, <hi>Julia</hi> coming into our Galley, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Marcellus, Agrippina, Domitius, Marcella,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
(for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that I had refu<U+017F>ed the boat he had prepared
for me, thought fit upon point of re<U+017F>entment to continue <U+017F>till in
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s, and accordingly never came neer us) and having <U+017F>eated
them<U+017F>elves about the Chamber upon chairs, the floor or planks
that were under them immediately opened, and we frightned at it,
began to cry out, for fear the boat <U+017F>hould <U+017F>inck, when there ri<U+017F>es
up from below a table covered with as magnificent a collation as
ever could have been <U+017F>erved among the <hi>Romans,</hi> not excepting the
<U+017F>umptuous entertainments of <hi>Lucullus;</hi> nay, <U+017F>uch it was, that
<hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who were not wont to wonder at great
things, were a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the magnificence and the neatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of it.
In a word, what ever came to <hi>Rome</hi> from forreign and remote
Nations that were mo<U+017F>t rare and exqui<U+017F>ite was there, and that
heightned admirably by art, but, what mo<U+017F>t troubled <hi>Antonia,</hi> was,
that what modes or forms <U+017F>oever the <U+017F>ervices were of, or what
figure <U+017F>oever they were di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into, (wherein there had been
more than ordinary care taken) the Characters of <hi>Antonia</hi> were
<U+017F>cattered up and down among<U+017F>t the burning Hearts, after the <U+017F>ame
manner as they had been all about the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. This <U+017F>tirred up
their curio<U+017F>ity afre<U+017F>h, to find out who this <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Antonia</hi>
might be, in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Marcellus</hi> having acquainted <hi>Agrippa</hi> with
what he had receaved from us, they <U+017F>ought and gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed a long
time, but after all could not fix on any per<U+017F>on whom they could
with any probability affirm to be the man. But I <U+017F>hall trouble you
with no more as to that, we made an end of our Collation, we
went away with the re<U+017F>t of the Company, and retired with matter
enough for di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as to to that adventure, but what was mo<U+017F>t
plea<U+017F>ant of all, was, that, abating the trouble which <hi>Antonia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
thereat, as we undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed our <U+017F>elves, <U+017F>he found another
Letter in one of her <U+017F>leeves, though <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he had made
<U+017F>ufficient provi<U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t any <U+017F>uch thing. I was ha<U+017F>ty enough to
read it, and found the words of it to be the the<U+017F>e.</p>

and how I effect that by <hi><U+017F>tratagem,</hi> which I <U+017F>hould never
compa<U+017F><U+017F>e by open ho<U+017F>tility. You have granted the <hi>Unknown
Lover,</hi> what you had denyed Kings that were <hi>profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed</hi> Lovers;
and though he be obliged for this good Fortune to the name of <hi>Livia,</hi>
for which you have had <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>pect, yet is he much more engaged
for it to his own indu<U+017F>try, and the confidence he had to effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign.
You will pardon me that I have entertained you in <U+017F>o poor a
place, <U+017F>ince I acknowledge I cannot conceave any noble enough to
receave you, and cannot wi<U+017F>h you any other then that Heart which
you <U+017F>aw burning this day in the publick <U+017F>acrifice I have made thereof
to you. In a word, my Fortune, whatever it may be, hath been
envyed this day by all that is great and eminent in the Empire,
whence I derive a certain hope that it will one day be envyed
by all that <U+017F>hall think them<U+017F>elves the mo<U+017F>t fortunate in the
World.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, <hi><U+017F>aid I, having made an end of reading the letter,</hi> but
acknowledge, that this man, what ever he may be, is an extraordinary
Gallant, a great wit, and inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ibly magnificent. I grant you all
that, <hi>replyed Antonia,</hi> but you mu<U+017F>t anknowledge withall, that there
is a certain <U+017F>pice of extravagance in his de<U+017F>ign, and that all the
pains he takes will amount to nothing. That I cannot tell you, <hi>reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I,</hi> nay methinks I already perceave he hath effected <U+017F>ome part of
his intentions, for in that he hath declared to you at the beginning,
that there is no other rea<U+017F>on of his recour<U+017F>e to this artifice, then to
induce you to endure the name of Love, and to reconcile you to that
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which you avoid as a Mon<U+017F>ter, becau<U+017F>e you are not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, you mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge that he hath already prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with you, to endure, not onely the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but all the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of it, much beyond what you had <U+017F>uffered in all your life before, and,
in a word, that you have held a greater corre<U+017F>pondence with love,
<U+017F>ince you fir<U+017F>t entertained the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of this one Vnknown Servant
then you did upon tho<U+017F>e of all the re<U+017F>t put together. Ah Si<U+017F>ter,
<hi>replies Antonia very roundly,</hi> what inclinations do I derive from
what you <U+017F>ay to hate him the more, and yet how true is that which
you have ob<U+017F>erved, and I mu<U+017F>t with <U+017F>hame acknowledge it to be <U+017F>uch!
But if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I will remedy it one way or other. What remedy
can you think of, <hi><U+017F>aid I to her,</hi> while you are kept in this ignorance?
This man is haply of <U+017F>uch a nature, that he will not di<U+017F>cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
while he lives, and though we may very well from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cendency
of his thoughts and attempts, infer the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his

mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>approve in me, after the prote<U+017F>tations <U+017F>he hath made her <U+017F>elf,
that the per<U+017F>on was not hateful; and from this defect it is that I
hope for greater advantages then I can expect from either birth or
fortunes.</p>
                        <p>This letter furni<U+017F>hed us with more matter of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and
imagination then all the re<U+017F>t; but at la<U+017F>t, having done all we
could, we re<U+017F>olved not to trouble our <U+017F>elves any further, and to
expect with patience what might be the con<U+017F>equences of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> to whom I had given one of the letters, had
made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to enquire all about, whether there were
any <U+017F>uch hand among tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons of. quality, and never
could meet with any that came neer it, <hi>Marcellus</hi> had done the
like, but to as little purpo<U+017F>e. All that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed before had made no
great noi<U+017F>e, but the Galley occa<U+017F>ioned abundance of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
in<U+017F>omuch that for many dayes after, the talk of all Companies
was of the magnificent Galley of <hi>Antonia.</hi> The King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi>
taking occa<U+017F>ion to make a mode<U+017F>t complaint to her upon her refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al
of the boat which he had provided for her, told her <U+017F>he had
very much rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>light that, when <U+017F>he expected another that
was <U+017F>o magnificent. But <hi>Antonia</hi> <U+017F>atisfied him as much as lay in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97242:43"/>
her power, telling him that it was not for its <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
that <U+017F>he had preferred that Galley before his boat, nor yet out of
any other con<U+017F>ideration, then that it had been proffered her in the
Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e's name, from whom <U+017F>he neither could nor ought to have
refu<U+017F>ed it. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a Prince of a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition ea<U+017F>ie to be plea<U+017F>ed,
was <U+017F>atisfied with that an<U+017F>wer; but could do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e withal then
conceave abundance of jealou<U+017F>ie again<U+017F>t that Unknown Lover,
who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ents were preferred before his, and re<U+017F>olved to do all
that lay in his power to di<U+017F>cover him. <hi>Mithridates</hi> was as earne<U+017F>t
in the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ign as the other, and though he had been <U+017F>lighted
by <hi>Antonia</hi> in <U+017F>uch manner, that, notwith<U+017F>tanding his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
he dur<U+017F>t hardly open his lips before her, to entertain her
with any thing of his love, after the di<U+017F>covery he had once made
to her thereof; yet was not his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion quite <U+017F>mothered, nor his
jealou<U+017F>ie inferiour to that of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> Being therefore both
unfortunate, and their loves encouraged by little hope, jealou<U+017F>ie
had not produced in them its ordinary effect among<U+017F>t Rivals, and
had left in them friend<U+017F>hip enough to vi<U+017F>it one the other, and to
communicate part of what they thought one to another; <U+017F>o that
having mutually acquainted one another with the de<U+017F>ires they
had to di<U+017F>cover who that Unknown Lover might be, who had
made <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ignal demon<U+017F>trations of his gallantry towards
<hi>Antonia,</hi> they re<U+017F>olved to joyne their endeavours to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
and not to leave any thing unattempted to find out the
truth.</p>
                        <p>Many dayes pa<U+017F>t ere any one came wherein they could di<U+017F>cover
any thing, though they had their <U+017F>pies in all places, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
took occa<U+017F>ion to walk them<U+017F>elves in the night about <hi>Octavia</hi>'s
Palace, out of <U+017F>ome hopes they might meet with him, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that he might have <U+017F>ome haunt thereabouts, e<U+017F>pecially at
the time that he was wont to entertain her with <U+017F>erenades, which
he had done <U+017F>everal times. At la<U+017F>t, after abundance of fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e
enquiry, fortune would needs have it, that, one of tho<U+017F>e nights
wherein they were both together on hor<U+017F>eback, without any other
company then that of certain <U+017F>laves, who were afoot, coming into
the <U+017F>treet into which our Chamber looked, they heard the <U+017F>ound
of certain in<U+017F>truments and voices, making an excellent con<U+017F>ort
almo<U+017F>t under our window. They made no que<U+017F>tion but they had
met with what they <U+017F>ought after, as knowing that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had
given over entertaining me with <U+017F>erenades, that <U+017F>ince the departure
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> there was not any per<U+017F>on in <hi>Rome</hi> that had di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
any inclinations for me, and that the lodgings of <hi>Agrippina,
Marcella</hi> and <hi>Martia,</hi> were in another part of the Palace at a
good di<U+017F>tance from that; be<U+017F>ides that they al<U+017F>o knew that the
Unknown Lover had given divers others before, and that, having
not the liberty to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf as others did, he took occa<U+017F>ion
to di<U+017F>cover his intentions by demon<U+017F>trations of gallantry of that
nature.</p>

The two amorous Princes, not doubting but that they were in
the right, re<U+017F>olved not to let <U+017F>lip the opportunity they now had
to be informed of what they were <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to know, and to
attempt any thing rather then not to effect their de<U+017F>ign. They
cau<U+017F>ed no torches to be brought with them, not onely out of a
de<U+017F>ire to avoid being di<U+017F>covered, but indeed that it was but too
light for their de<U+017F>igne, and that the Moon being then in her full,
anything in the <U+017F>treets was ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cernable. Being thus light,
they were no <U+017F>ooner come into our <U+017F>tree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, but they perceave a man
on hor<U+017F>eback, who leaving the place where he was as <U+017F>oon as they
came in <U+017F>ight, went to the mu<U+017F>ick, and bid them give over and
di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves as <U+017F>oon as they could. From this action the
two Princes immediately inferred that it mu<U+017F>t infallibly be the
Unknown Lover; and being ab<U+017F>olutely re<U+017F>olved to make all the
advantages they could of that accident, they came on further
into the <U+017F>treet, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed under our windowes, where they could
neither hear nor find any body. They made a little halt to li<U+017F>ten,
and, whereas the man they had <U+017F>een on hor<U+017F>eback could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
him<U+017F>elf as they could that were a foot, and that the hor<U+017F>e
mu<U+017F>t needs make a great noi<U+017F>e going upon the <U+017F>tones, they could
ea<U+017F>ily both hear and <U+017F>ee him at a certain di<U+017F>tance before, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
what he could to get away. They on the other <U+017F>ide as
carefully pur<U+017F>ued him, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through many <U+017F>treets, following
him <U+017F>till by the noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>eeing him before them. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
perceaving their re<U+017F>olution to follow him, put on <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fa<U+017F>ter, and made towards the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary <U+017F>treets, <U+017F>o to get
out of their <U+017F>ight: but that <U+017F>tood him in no <U+017F>tead, for they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him every where, with <U+017F>o much ob<U+017F>tinacy, that they gave
him at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome ground to imagine, that it would be a hard matter
for him to get off. At length, having forced him into a <U+017F>treet, at
the other end whereof he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>everal torches and Chariots that
might hinder his further pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, he made a <U+017F>tand, and, turning
toward tho<U+017F>e that pur<U+017F>ued him, took one <U+017F>ide of the <U+017F>treet, as it
were to give them the way. But they rid up to him, and <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
oppo<U+017F>ing the de<U+017F>igne he had to make an e<U+017F>cape, <hi>Do not hope,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to him, <hi>to get hence, or to avoid us, if thou do<U+017F>t not
di<U+017F>cover thy <U+017F>elf; and therefore tell us who thou art, if thou would<U+017F>t
have the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age free to be gone.</hi>

                        <p>The Unknown per<U+017F>on retreated <U+017F>ome few paces at this action
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and having reflected a little on what he had to
do, he <U+017F>et <U+017F>purs to his hor<U+017F>e, and quick as lighting fell in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Princes, who were very near one the other, and
ru<U+017F>hing on <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was on his left hand, with all the
violence he could both of him<U+017F>elf and his hor<U+017F>e, (which was
one of the be<U+017F>t in the World) and at the <U+017F>ame time as he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
by, laying hold with his right hand on <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s bridle, he, with
the <U+017F>hock of his hor<U+017F>e, overthrew <hi>Mithridates</hi> hor<U+017F>e and man to
the ground, and with that he gave <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s at the <U+017F>ame time,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97242:44"/>
made him <U+017F>tand upright, in <U+017F>uch manner, that the Prince falling
backwards, and holding <U+017F>till fa<U+017F>t by the bridle, overturned the
hor<U+017F>e upon him<U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>Their fall proved <U+017F>hrewd enough, and their condition <U+017F>uch,
that they found it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to get up again, e<U+017F>pecially
<U+017F>eeing that they were not attended by any, and that the <U+017F>laves
they had brought with them, being afoot, had lo<U+017F>t them in the
<U+017F>everal turnings they had made. At la<U+017F>t, they made a <U+017F>hift to
ri<U+017F>e, not a little brui<U+017F>ed, and, going with <U+017F>ome difficulty, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
one another with no <U+017F>mall confu<U+017F>ion. For, all con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they were not <U+017F>o much troubled at the fall they had receaved,
or the hurt occa<U+017F>ioned thereby, as that they had been <U+017F>o treated by
a <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on, and one they had forced to that action by their own
un<U+017F>atisfied pur<U+017F>uit. They <U+017F>tood a while looking one upon the other,
as not being able to find out terms fit to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e what their hearts
were burthened with; but at length, <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as being the
mo<U+017F>t eager and impatient, was the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>poke, and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
the re<U+017F>entment he had of that adventure in words full of fire,
and vi<U+017F>ible demon<U+017F>trations of his fury. <hi>Archelaus</hi> endured that
unfortunate encounter with more moderation, and told <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
that there was no more happened to them then what they
had de<U+017F>erved, and that ordinarily there was no other <U+017F>atisfaction
to be given to curio<U+017F>ities that were <U+017F>o neer a kin to indi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                        <p>At la<U+017F>t they with much ado got up on hor<U+017F>eback, and returned to
their lodgings, where having gotten into their beds, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep them for <U+017F>ome dayes. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> for his part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
troubled at the adventure, was de<U+017F>irous to conceal it;
but <hi>Archelaus,</hi> being a per<U+017F>on more inclined to <U+017F>incerity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and who<U+017F>e proceedings, in the affection he bore to <hi>Antonia,</hi>
were more clear, made no difficulty to acquaint all tho<U+017F>e that
came to vi<U+017F>it him with the truth of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that the very
next day, it was generally known, and was become the <U+017F>ubject of
all mens talk. We <U+017F>oon under<U+017F>tood it from <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
and the perpetual di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, which all entertained <hi>Antonia</hi> with
about it, added very much to the di<U+017F>quiet <U+017F>he was in before. But
what troubled <hi>Mithridates</hi> more then all the re<U+017F>t, was a Letter that
was brought to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and which <hi>Archelaus</hi> <U+017F>ent him, as <U+017F>oon
as he had peru<U+017F>ed it him<U+017F>elf, as having been directed to both,

                           <hi>I</hi> Am much troubled at the <U+017F>mall misfortune that hath befallen you,
though, out of a de<U+017F>ire of your own <U+017F>atisfaction you were your

learn to beware how you hereafter pur<U+017F>ue, with <U+017F>o much violence, tho<U+017F>e
that would avoid you, and remember that you are to make a bridge
of gold for a retreating enemy. If you are chargeable with no
crime but <hi>curio<U+017F>ity,</hi> disburthen your <U+017F>elves of it, as being a vice
whereof you will find the inconveniences to be far greater than the

<hi>jealou<U+017F>ie</hi> is a <U+017F>elf-di<U+017F>turbing pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, whereof the effects are ever
dangerous, and elude the expectation. Be<U+017F>ides it is not much for
your reputation to be jealous of a per<U+017F>on that's unknown to you; and

                        <p>This Letter had been delivered to one of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Officers,
by a man that as <U+017F>oon as he had done, was vani<U+017F>hed, and could not
be <U+017F>een after, as having gone his wayes without being ob<U+017F>erved by
any one, <U+017F>o that the two Princes were <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame ignorance
they were in before. They were both very much netled at it,
though in a different mea<U+017F>ure, according to their <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions,
and if <hi>Archelaus</hi> was more moderate than <hi>Mithridates,</hi> yet
was he not le<U+017F><U+017F>e moved at the <U+017F>atyrical <U+017F>tile of his Rival. The
la<U+017F>t words of the Letter were tho<U+017F>e that troubled them mo<U+017F>t,
and they thought that fanta<U+017F>tick circum<U+017F>tance of their adventure
the mo<U+017F>t indige<U+017F>tible of any, that among their Friends that came
dayly to give them their vi<U+017F>its, they were to expect him that had
put them into the condition they were in, and who haply might
prove him, they thought the mo<U+017F>t endeared, and could the lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect. This reflection made them look on all that came to <U+017F>ee
them with a certain di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, and taking it for granted that their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97242:45"/>
Rival was of that number, they <U+017F>ought him among them without
any di<U+017F>tinction, and that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>ometimes where they were the
mo<U+017F>t unlikely to find him. They fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with all tho<U+017F>e
that came to them upon that accident, and ob<U+017F>erved their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
while they talked to <U+017F>ee what inferences they might draw
thence, but all proved ineffectual. For <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi>
being per<U+017F>ons that for their rank, their vertue, and the re<U+017F>pects
which the Emperour had for them, were very con<U+017F>iderable among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> there were few among the Families that were mo<U+017F>t
Illu<U+017F>trious that came not to vi<U+017F>it then, <U+017F>o that amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>o great a
number, they made fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e inqui<U+017F>itions for that which in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er
they might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have di<U+017F>covered. <hi>Archelaus</hi> hath told me <U+017F>ince
that he was never at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e in all his life, and that, fearing
he might <U+017F>ee the face of his Rival in all tho<U+017F>e that came neer him,
his thoughts were in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>traction, that for <U+017F>ome minutes he
could not make any return to their civilities: and for <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
he looked on all as enemies, though his re<U+017F>entment was directed

walk in the <U+017F>ame Garden of <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s, whereof I have given you

which they could perceave glittering, ea<U+017F>ily argued them to be
per<U+017F>ons of quality, who <U+017F>eeking <U+017F>olitude as they did, had left
their attendants in <U+017F>ome other part of the garden. The<U+017F>e women

they turned a<U+017F>ide into another walk, and continued their <U+017F>olitude.

The<U+017F>e two young men, having a more than ordinary curio<U+017F>ity, and
who<U+017F>e thoughts were employed in their plea<U+017F>ures wherever they

if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to know who they were. To that end they went into
the <U+017F>ame walk where they were, and had <U+017F>oon overtaken them,
if the Ladies, having perceaved them, had not avoided meeting
with them, by turning a<U+017F>ide, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over one of the Bridges,
to get into <U+017F>ome of the little I<U+017F>les that are made <U+017F>uch by the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and wherein there are in <U+017F>everal places green Arbours, made
of the boughs of trees twi<U+017F>ted together <U+017F>o thick, that when the

way they took, with a de<U+017F>ign to meet them by other turnings,
which they were not unacquainted with, which yet they might
have done without any bodies perceaving what game they were
in chace of. Accordingly, having traced them through divers trees

were no <U+017F>ooner got in, but coming behind one of the Arbours,
on a certain <U+017F>ide at which they could not be di<U+017F>covered, they
heard the voice of a woman <U+017F>inging in the Arbour, and, making
a halt, to give her the greater attention, they found her admirable,
not onely as to the voice, but al<U+017F>o as to the skill whereby it was
not a little heightened. They at fir<U+017F>t heard her at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance,

While <hi>Emilia</hi> was <U+017F>peaking in this manner, <hi>Lentulus</hi> had found

that onely that I can ju<U+017F>tly charge with all the misfortunes I am
fallen into. Do not imagine it any effect of the cele<U+017F>tial vengeance

I have contributed very much to his ab<U+017F>ence, and am charged as the
occa<U+017F>ion of it, yet have I not been troubled with the lea<U+017F>t remor<U+017F>e
for any deportment of mine towards him. Being <hi>Cicero's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I could not upon the fir<U+017F>t addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of his affection to me, be

death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> whom, being to be my Husband within three daies,
he killed in my <U+017F>ight, upon my account, I was certainly di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed
from whatever the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his love might require of me in
his favour. And yet, the powers of heaven are my witne<U+017F><U+017F>es that
I never hated him, that I never wi<U+017F>hed him any ill fortune, that I
have acknowledged his great worth, and that I do at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e,
notwith<U+017F>tanding my pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>entiments, that he is as great as
to point of merit, and as amiable as to his per<U+017F>on as <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is
him<U+017F>elf. So that there is no ground to imagine that the gods <U+017F>hould
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97242:47"/>
inflict all this as a puni<U+017F>hment of my cruelty; but that it proceeds
meerly from my de<U+017F>tiny which in this emergency acts again<U+017F>t me, as
it hath done through all the misfortunes that have happened to our

                        <p>But, my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Tullia, replied Emilia,</hi> <U+017F>ince you would not be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

rea<U+017F>ons which you alledged again<U+017F>t the love and merits of <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> before he became an impardonable criminal by the death
of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> might with much more ground be urged again<U+017F>t the
affection which you have conceived for his Brother; <U+017F>ince that not
being obliged to him for any the lea<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>tration of love, you
cannot but look on him as the Son of <hi>Anthony,</hi> which he is, you
know, no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then his Brother? I am, no que<U+017F>tion, <hi>replyed Tullia,</hi>
obliged by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>ons to do the one as the other, at lea<U+017F>t in
<U+017F>ome part, (for I might tell you, did I <U+017F>tand upon my ju<U+017F>tification;
that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is not by his birth <U+017F>uch a criminal to us as his brother
was, <U+017F>ince that he is Son to Queen <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and not to <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who alone engaged
<hi>Anthony</hi> in that de<U+017F>ign, and exerci<U+017F>ed her cruelty upon the body of
my Father, even after death, by a many abominable indignities) but
<U+017F>uch was my misfortune, that I could not make u<U+017F>e of them, and I
need not tell you, that in tho<U+017F>e of this nature, the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of
rea<U+017F>on are not alwayes infallible. You may further argue, that I
have hardly <U+017F>een <hi>Ptolomey</hi> above once, that he is a Prince younger
than my <U+017F>elf by five or <U+017F>ix years, and a per<U+017F>on that neither does, nor
haply will love me while he lives. All the an<U+017F>wer I have to make to
the<U+017F>e objections, is, That my misfortunes are <U+017F>o much the more to be
bemoaned, and that the rather, out of a con<U+017F>ideration that I have
not contributed any thing thereto my <U+017F>elf, and have endured this
violence to tyrannize over my heart, without the lea<U+017F>t complyance
of my will. Pitty me then, if you plea<U+017F>e, <hi>Emilia,</hi> and charge me
not with an offence which I <U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould take upon me. Tis

us uncapable of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, but onely teach us how to <U+017F>truggle with
them; and if they have not been able to make good the little garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of my heart again<U+017F>t the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of that which now di<U+017F>turbs my
quiet, they will <U+017F>o weaken it, as that it <U+017F>hall not produce therein any
effects that may <U+017F>tain my reputation at the pre<U+017F>ent, or my memory
hereafter. I have been able to look on the Son of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but it
<U+017F>eems under an unhappy con<U+017F>tellation which made me indeed but too
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of what I thought amiable in his per<U+017F>on: I have been able
to pre<U+017F>erve the remembrance of it too dearly for my own quiet; I
cannot think of him without tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I can <U+017F>peak of him with
delight, I can communicate my <U+017F>ufferings to you, I can <U+017F>igh, and as
you <U+017F>ee, weep and bewayle, this <U+017F>ad exchange of my condition. But
this, <hi>Emilia,</hi> is all that this de<U+017F>tructive pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion can work in my <U+017F>oul,
<U+017F>o that all the tempe<U+017F>ts it is able to rai<U+017F>e there, <U+017F>hall not eclip<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e
lights of wi<U+017F>dom, which it is not in the power of any blindne<U+017F><U+017F>e to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97242:47"/>
extingui<U+017F>h. I can pine away, yet conceale from all the World, <hi>Emilia</hi>
onely excepted, the rea<U+017F>on why I do <U+017F>o; and if I mu<U+017F>t endure, even
to death it <U+017F>elf, I can ea<U+017F>ily do it, not onely rather than open my
lips, but rather then become guilty of a wi<U+017F>h that <U+017F>hould any way
<U+017F>tain my reputation, or ca<U+017F>t a blemi<U+017F>h on the former part of
my life.</p>
                        <p>But, when all is done, <hi>replies Emilia,</hi> to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>incerely, could you
not wi<U+017F>h that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> loved you, or can you, with all your Wi<U+017F>dom
and Philo<U+017F>ophy, oppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a wi<U+017F>h? <hi>To this</hi> Tullia <hi>could not for
<U+017F>ome minutes make any po<U+017F>itive an<U+017F>wer; but having a little after
<U+017F>haken off that <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence, and rea<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
blu<U+017F>h, wherewith</hi> Lentulus <hi>could perceive her face all cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The de<U+017F>ire of being loved, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> by that which one loves, is
a thing <U+017F>o natural in us, that I dur<U+017F>t not tell you, that I did not wi<U+017F>h
my <U+017F>elf loved by <hi>Ptolomey;</hi> but you are withall to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf,
that this wi<U+017F>h is <U+017F>o innocent as not to injure my vertue: nay I mu<U+017F>t
adde thus much, that though it <U+017F>hould prove effectuall, yet would not
my condition be any thing the more fortunate, and that <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
him<U+017F>elf, though he <U+017F>hould love me, <U+017F>hould not know while he lived,
that I ever had any affection for him. I <U+017F>hould avoid him as an
enemy, though he were dearer to me than my own life, nay though it
<U+017F>hould co<U+017F>t me this very life, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould keep, to the la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>p from the
knowledge of all the earth, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>entiments which have broke forth
to that of all the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what is then your meaning, <hi>replyed Emilia,</hi> what cour<U+017F>e do
you intend to take, in order to your own quiet? To dye, <hi>an<U+017F>wered
the Daughter of Cicero,</hi> to dye my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Emilia,</hi> if occa<U+017F>ion
require, and I am very much unknown to you, if you imagine, that
I think my life <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable as not to <U+017F>acrifice it to pre<U+017F>erve my
reputation. But I <U+017F>hall do what lies in my power to <U+017F>truggle with
this enemy that hath po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf of my heart, and if the
<U+017F>trength and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of heaven, which I dayly implore, prove <U+017F>uch
as that I may not gain the victory, you <U+017F>hall find, <hi>Emilia,</hi> whether
I have not learned to dye, rather then be guilty of faults which might
make you blu<U+017F>h for my <U+017F>ake. I have acquainted you with the <U+017F>ecret of
my heart, becau<U+017F>e there hath not been any tran<U+017F>action there which
you have not known; but did I imagine it <U+017F>hould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any other per<U+017F>on in the World be<U+017F>ides your <U+017F>elf, I <U+017F>hould think
one hour a long time to <U+017F>urvive the <U+017F>hame I <U+017F>hould conceave thereat,
and you <U+017F>hould be<U+017F>tow on my death tho<U+017F>e tears, which compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion obliges
you to <U+017F>hed, to accompany tho<U+017F>e which my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e forces
from me.</p>
                        <p>As <U+017F>he made an end of the<U+017F>e words, <U+017F>he could keep in no longer
tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>howers of tears which fell down from her eies in abundance,
which yet hindred not, but that <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who looked on her with
attention, or rather with tran<U+017F>portation, thought her <U+017F>o beautiful
in that condition, and was <U+017F>o much moved at her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, the
grace wherewith <U+017F>he delivered them, and the fortune that obliged
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97242:48"/>
her thereto, that pitty; which had by degrees taken place in his
heart, was of a <U+017F>udden changed into a violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. For though
he had <U+017F>een <hi>Tullia</hi> <U+017F>everal times before, yet did it not rai<U+017F>e in him
any inclinations for her, other than what her merit might rai<U+017F>e in
all that knew her; but now in this little interval, wherein grief
appeared <U+017F>o amiable in her countenance, he became her ab<U+017F>olutely
devoted va<U+017F><U+017F>al, and in love with her after <U+017F>uch a manner, that he
had not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>trength to oppo<U+017F>e it, and was not able to hear
the rea<U+017F>on which <U+017F>hould have di<U+017F><U+017F>waded him from loving a per<U+017F>on
who<U+017F>e affections were otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of, and one from whom,
either upon occa<U+017F>ion of that di<U+017F>covery, or out of any con<U+017F>ideration
of her own humour, he was in all probability never to expect any
thing. In a word, love here knew no degrees, but as <U+017F>oon as he
could be <U+017F>aid to love, he might be <U+017F>aid to do it violently, in<U+017F>omuch,
that <U+017F>ympathizing with her in the affection wherein he <U+017F>aw her
involved, he participated thereof <U+017F>o far, that, when he turned
toward <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> my Brother perceived his eyes were red and
big with tears. For his part, he had not been at all moved, either
at <hi>Tullia's</hi> words, or the di<U+017F>coveries of her affection, whether it
proceeded from the re<U+017F>entment he had in heart again<U+017F>t that Lady,
or that naturally he had a <U+017F>oul not over-<U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of love, or that
all the affection it was capable of, was already devoted to <hi>Marcia,</hi>
a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of excellent beauty, and one to whom he ought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of obligations. He was already de<U+017F>irous to remove from
that place, when <hi>Lentulus,</hi> fearing they might be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, and
perceaving by the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Tullia,</hi> that it would trouble her
infinitely if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> had heard her, took
him by the arm and carryed him away. They went thence as <U+017F>oftly
as they had come thither, and made <U+017F>o little noi<U+017F>e, that they were
not perceaved or heard. They went out of the little I<U+017F>le, and
walked a good while ere they <U+017F>poke one to another. <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
knew not what to <U+017F>ay of that adventure, <U+017F>o much was he <U+017F>urprized
at the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F><U+017F>e of it; and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>oul was wounded
by what he had <U+017F>een, and who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits were in <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>order, by
rea<U+017F>on of his newly-conceived pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, could not think of words
whereby to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, and was content onely to look on
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> in whom he could not perceive the lea<U+017F>t alteration upon
that accident, and knew not, whether he <U+017F>hould, out of con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, advi<U+017F>e him to love <hi>Tullia,</hi> or out of tho<U+017F>e of
his own love and intere<U+017F>t, entertain him with the <U+017F>entiments he
had for her him<U+017F>elf. At la<U+017F>t, having taken <U+017F>ome few turns; they
were ju<U+017F>t falling into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when coming to the end of
a walk, that abutted upon that wherein they were, they met full
but with the two Ladies, who had left the Arbour in a manner as
<U+017F>oon as they had, and without the lea<U+017F>t fear that they had been
over-heard by any one, had rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed their walk. They were all
very much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at that meeting, and particularly <hi>Tullia,</hi> as
being the lea<U+017F>t prepared for it, and the mo<U+017F>t concerned in it. Her
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97242:48"/>
eyes were <U+017F>till red with weeping, which <hi>Lentulus</hi> perceiving, and
con<U+017F>equently the condition <U+017F>he was in, could not look on her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a certain trouble and di<U+017F>turbance. They were <U+017F>o neer one
another, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by without <U+017F>alutes, and
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> <U+017F>ubmitting to the a<U+017F>cendent which now began to govern
him, could not follow <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who after a <U+017F>alute full of re<U+017F>pect
turned a<U+017F>ide. <hi>Emilia,</hi> who took notice of his carriage, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulting
at this time <U+017F>o much decorum, as minding the friend<U+017F>hip
<U+017F>he had for <hi>Tullia,</hi> called him, and having obliged him to turn
back; <hi>What now,</hi> Ptolomey, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>do you <U+017F>hun the
Ladies? No Madam, replyed he, but it is not fit that the Son of</hi>
Anthony <hi><U+017F>hould come neer the daughter of</hi> Cicero, <hi>Enmities,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Emilia, <hi><U+017F>hould not be eternal, and I <U+017F>hall not be friends with</hi> Tullia,
<hi>if <U+017F>he make no di<U+017F>tinction between the children of</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>and
tho<U+017F>e of</hi> Fulvia, <hi>who alone wrought all the unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e of their
hou<U+017F>e. Both the one and the other are equally guilty by their birth,</hi>
replies <hi>Ptolomey, nay though they were innocent enough to de<U+017F>erve
that</hi> Tullia <hi><U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h them no hurt, they cannot be <U+017F>o far <U+017F>uch as to
hope for any of her conver<U+017F>ation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This fierce young man not guilty of that tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e he was, in
civility, obliged to, would needs, out of an affected malice, repeat
the <U+017F>ame words to <hi>Tullia,</hi> which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>aid to his
Brother, as he had heard it related; <U+017F>o that after this la<U+017F>t comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he went away, and would have no further di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with
<hi>Emilia.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Tullia</hi> had not <U+017F>poken at all, though
<hi>Lentulus</hi> had come to her, but had fa<U+017F>tned her eyes on the ground,
as being in <U+017F>ome doubt whether <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould approve the proceeding
of <hi>Emilia,</hi> who<U+017F>e intention <U+017F>eemed good to her, but her action
indi<U+017F>creet enough. So that her courage, and the affection <U+017F>he had
for my Brother, rai<U+017F>ed no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>traction within her; but when
<U+017F>he heard tho<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, and <U+017F>aw him go away with <U+017F>o much
di<U+017F>dain, her face was of a <U+017F>udden deprived of all colour, and grief
and vexation pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed upon her heart in <U+017F>uch manner, that after
<U+017F>he had, with <U+017F>ome precipitation, <U+017F>aid to <hi>Emilia,</hi> that <U+017F>he was not
well, and was not able to <U+017F>tand, <U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>wound in her arms.
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> who<U+017F>e eye was but too much upon her, ran to her; and
though her misfortune touched him to the very heart, yet was it
<U+017F>ome joy to him to have her in his arms, while <hi>Emilia</hi> <U+017F>ate down
on the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, and with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> layed <hi>Tullia</hi> by
her, and took her head upon her lap. <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who had not had
the time to go far thence, turned about at the cry which <hi>Emilia</hi>
gave, and <U+017F>eeing, though confu<U+017F>edly, what they were doing, he
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected what the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e might be, though, it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, he
might not think him<U+017F>elf ab<U+017F>olutely the cau<U+017F>e of that accident.
However, though he was not <U+017F>ubject to much love, yet would he
not be awanting in point of civility, and con<U+017F>equently as to that
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which he thought due to her <U+017F>ex; <U+017F>o that when, being
come neer, he <U+017F>aw her in a <U+017F>wound. <hi>Emilia</hi> loo<U+017F>ning her garments
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97242:49"/>
and <hi>Lentulus</hi> in <U+017F>uch amazement, that he knew not what to do; he
ran to the next rivulet, and, having taken up <U+017F>ome water in both
his hands, he brought it, and ca<U+017F>t it on <hi>Tullia's</hi> face. Whereupon
<U+017F>he immediately opened her eyes, and that, time enough to <U+017F>ee
the action of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and to perceave that it was from him that
<U+017F>he received that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. I know not whether the joy or the
confu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he conceaved thereat were the greater; but being
well furni<U+017F>hed, both as to courage and re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he betrayed
not her thoughts of it, and giving my Brother a look <U+017F>uitable to
the different pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>he was then engaged with; <hi>I receave this
kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e from you,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>in requital for what I did your
Brother in the like condition; but it is enough for an enemy, and
you are too too tender of the concernments of your hou<U+017F>e to do me
any more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he turned gently towards <hi>Emilia,</hi> and <U+017F>poke to
her <U+017F>oftly, to entreat them to depart: to which end <hi>Emilia</hi> making
<U+017F>ignes to them, they went their wayes, but, after <U+017F>everal manners;
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> with <U+017F>uch indifference, as if he had not been any way
concerned in the adventure, and <hi>Lentulus</hi> <U+017F>o moved, and <U+017F>o
di<U+017F>tracted in his thoughts, that he hardly knew what he did. Being
come <U+017F>ome paces thence, they met with the women that belonged
to <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Tullia,</hi> whom their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es had left behind,
that they might walk alone, and having acquainted them with
the accident that had happened, they obliged them to go to their
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When they were gotten a good di<U+017F>tance from that place,</hi>
Ptolomey, <hi>who walked after his ordinary po<U+017F>ture of freedom and
cheerfulne<U+017F><U+017F>e, ob<U+017F>erving the di<U+017F>turbance</hi> Lentulus <hi>was in, as well
by his <U+017F>ilence as by the <U+017F>everal expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions thereof that were vi<U+017F>ible
in his countenance;</hi> Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> that you are <U+017F>o
much troubled at this adventure as you <U+017F>eem to be? But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
<hi>replies Lentulus,</hi> that you can be <U+017F>o little as your face and actions
di<U+017F>cover you to be? I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you for my part, <hi><U+017F>aies Ptolomey,</hi> that
I am not troubled a jot at it, and that I look on this adventure as if
it had happened to any other body. How, <hi>continued Lentulus,</hi> hath
neither what you have heard from the mouth of <hi>Tullia,</hi> of the love
<U+017F>he hath for you, nor yet what you have <U+017F>een of the effects of your
di<U+017F>dain on her <U+017F>pirit, rai<U+017F>ed no trouble or alteration in you? Not
a jot, <hi>replies Ptolomey,</hi> and be<U+017F>ides the aver<U+017F>ion I had for that Lady,
I am not much taken with what is be<U+017F>towed on me upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if it hath not co<U+017F>t me <U+017F>omething before, <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hall not make
any advantage of this adventure; and all that I <U+017F>hall do for <hi>Tullia</hi>
that <U+017F>peaks any thing of obligation, is, that I <U+017F>hall not divulge it,
and that I do upon the account of di<U+017F>cretion and her <U+017F>ex. So that

fallen into a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which I <U+017F>hould have wra<U+017F>tled with while I lived,
had it been any way prejudicial to our friend<U+017F>hip. And <U+017F>ince you
are the deare<U+017F>t of my Friends, I <U+017F>hall make no difficulty to tell you,
that being along with you into this garden, as free as your <U+017F>elf from
any love I had for <hi>Tullia,</hi> I am now fallen infinitely in love with her,
to <U+017F>o high a degree, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible your brother could be more.</p>

                           <hi>The<U+017F>e words made</hi> Ptolomey <hi>look on</hi> Lentulus <hi><U+017F>omewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly,
as if he could hardly imagine his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>erious:</hi>
How, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>Lentulus,</hi> that in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, and by
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trange an accident, you <U+017F>hould fall in love with <hi>Tullia</hi>'s So
deeply, <hi>replies Lentulus,</hi> that all the words I can u<U+017F>e are not able
to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e it, and I thought <hi>Tullia</hi> <U+017F>o beautiful in her grief, and <U+017F>o
amiable in her <U+017F>inging and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; that my <U+017F>oul is be<U+017F>towed on
her without ever con<U+017F>ulting my will; I <U+017F>ay be<U+017F>towed, and that in
<U+017F>uch a manner, that I am not in the lea<U+017F>t hope ever to retrive it out
of her power. I know I put my <U+017F>elf to strange extremities, and
that attempting to <U+017F>erve a Lady, prevented by a <U+017F>trong pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for
you, and that one that hath <U+017F>tudyed con<U+017F>tancy and re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>uch as
<hi>Tullia</hi> is, I embarque for a voyage wherein I am <U+017F>ure to meet with
many <U+017F>torms; but when all is done, it is the plea<U+017F>ure of my
de<U+017F>tiny it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o, and it is not in my power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lentulus</hi> went on with abundance of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>ame
effect, which the length of this relation obliges me to forbear
repeating to you, though it put <hi>Ptolomey</hi> into <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment
at the fanta<U+017F>tick adventure, that he could hardly imagine it to
be real. He entreated him, <U+017F>ince he was not re<U+017F>olved to affect that
Lady, never to <U+017F>peak ill of her, nor let the World know what he
did concerning her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which haply the little account and
acknowledgement he made thereof, might in time oblige her to
forget. My Brother promi<U+017F>ed never to <U+017F>peak of it while he lived
to any one but to me, from whom he was not able to conceal any
thing, and engaged for me that I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>uffer that <U+017F>ecret to
take any further aire. Accordingly, he failed not to come that
very night, to give me an account of all that happened to him,
conjuring me to <U+017F>ecrecy, and I could not but be amazed as well
at his relation of the love of <hi>Tullia,</hi> as that of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who<U+017F>e
mi<U+017F>fortune I much bemoaned, becau<U+017F>e he was a per<U+017F>on of a mo<U+017F>t
illu<U+017F>trious birth, and very recommendable among the Romans for
his many excellent endowments. I had al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for
<hi>Tullia,</hi> though I had no rea<U+017F>on to love her, and I blamed <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
for the inflexibility of his heart; but having great re<U+017F>pects for
<hi>Martia,</hi> and looking on that allyance as mo<U+017F>t advantageous for my
Brother and all our hou<U+017F>e, I was very glad not to <U+017F>ee him engaged
in any other affections that might have diverted him from her.
He on the other <U+017F>ide vi<U+017F>ited her oftner than he had done before,
continuing and adding to the demon<U+017F>trations of his affection;
but with this remark, that he did all things with greater indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97242:50"/>
and freedom of <U+017F>pirit then <U+017F>he could have de<U+017F>ired, and in
<U+017F>uch manner, that his love hindred him not from minding his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
diverti<U+017F>ements, or di<U+017F>covering the aver<U+017F>ion he had for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
However, he provided again<U+017F>t the day of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s his
birth, to do for her what all the other young Romans did for the
Ladies they <U+017F>erved, and would come into the exerci<U+017F>es, with the
Livery, &amp; all other demon<U+017F>trations of the engagement he lay under
to <U+017F>erve her. <hi>Lentulus</hi> did the like for <hi>Tullia,</hi> but he under<U+017F>tood
that <U+017F>he was not well, and was not likely to be pre<U+017F>ent at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
You may <U+017F>ome other time have an account of what hath
pa<U+017F>t in the loves of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Tullia,</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly not unworthy your
attention; but be<U+017F>ides that there is not much come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they are not the <U+017F>ubject of my pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and my
relation is <U+017F>o long without it, that I doubt not but you will
excu<U+017F>e me, if I <U+017F>ay not any thing thereof.</p>
                        <p>At length, the day de<U+017F>tined for the celebration of the Solemnity,
and the honour of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s birth being come the whole Court,
all the Nobility, and the people ran to the Sights. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay
nothing to you of the duels fought by the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and the
fighting of <U+017F>avage bea<U+017F>ts, which were the diverti<U+017F>ements of the
people for the morning. The re<U+017F>t of the day was <U+017F>pent in things
of greater magnificence, <U+017F>uch as wherein the Roman Nobility
di<U+017F>covered their greate<U+017F>t pomp and gallantry; and yet I <U+017F>hall give
you but a <U+017F>hort de<U+017F>cription of it, and that out of a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that
lyes upon me to make mention thereof in my relation. There was no
place within <hi>Rome</hi> able to contain the va<U+017F>t number of people that
were to be pre<U+017F>ent at the <U+017F>hews, and that of the per<U+017F>ons that were to
celebrate them. The Emperour therefore, had, without the gates
of the City, in a fair Plain upon the Tiber <U+017F>ide, cau<U+017F>ed a va<U+017F>t tract
of ground to be rail'd in, having left two <U+017F>ides free for the people,
which were bordered with an Amphitheatre of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>teps, on
which an infinite number of people might be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed. He had
cau<U+017F>ed to be rai<U+017F>ed over again<U+017F>t the entrance certain Scaffolds
covered over with rich tapi<U+017F>try, for the Ladies, the Senate, and
<U+017F>uch other per<U+017F>ons as were de<U+017F>tin'd for tho<U+017F>e places. On the fourth
<U+017F>ide were di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed part of the Emperours Guard, who<U+017F>e employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it was to open the railes at the entrance of the Chariots the
hor<U+017F>es and people that were to come in, and all that <U+017F>ide was
wholly taken up by <U+017F>uch as were requi<U+017F>ite for that office, to avoid
all confu<U+017F>ion and di<U+017F>turbance. The place was <U+017F>pacious enough for
the longe<U+017F>t races of either hor<U+017F>e or Chariots, and of <U+017F>uch an
extent, as it was <U+017F>aid, that it was <U+017F>ufficient for the encamping of
an army.</p>
                        <p>The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight was to be that of the Chariots, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by hor<U+017F>e-races, and after that was a combat on hor<U+017F>eback, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two parties with edgele<U+017F><U+017F>e weapons, which the Romans
call <hi>Troy,</hi> and they <U+017F>ay was invented by <hi>A<U+017F>canius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
at his arrival into <hi>Italy.</hi> All the Chariots pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed one after
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97242:50"/>
another, took divers turns about the place along the railes, and
after they had been <U+017F>een by the Emperour, the Ladies, and the
people, when the <U+017F>ignal of the races was given, they were all
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed according to the order they had ob<U+017F>erved in coming in,
at that end of the place which was oppo<U+017F>ite to our Scaffold, in
expectation of the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal at which they were to <U+017F>et forward.
They had all four hor<U+017F>es a-brea<U+017F>t, open before, with one onely
place behind, for the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Chariot, wherein he <U+017F>ate
armed all over, having on, a head-piece, the vi<U+017F>our down, with a
Buckler on his left arm, and two Javelins in his right hand; and
the Chariots, the <U+017F>laves that followed them, the cloaths that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the hor<U+017F>es, and all the Equipage wore the Livery of the
Ladies, as far as they were known. Upon the<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions was it
particularly that the young Romans outvy'd one another to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their inclinations; at lea<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e who had no de<U+017F>ign to keep
them <U+017F>ecret, and to that end was there a great di<U+017F>tance between
the Chariots as they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, that people might the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
the attendance of every Chariot in particular, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any confu<U+017F>ion.</p>
                        <p>The fir<U+017F>t that appeared was that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> all glittering with
gold and magnificent workman<U+017F>hip; his attendance was noble and
full of pomp, and about his per<U+017F>on, and in all his Equipage he wore
the Livery of <hi>Julia.</hi> That of <hi>Tiberius</hi> came next, not inferiour in
point of magnificence to that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with my characters
and colours. That of <hi>Domitius</hi> followed him, with tho<U+017F>e demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations
which argued the affection he had for <hi>Agrippina.</hi> After
that came <hi>Archelaus</hi> with the colours of <hi>Antonia.</hi> Next came
young <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> very neat and gallant in his Equipage, wearing
the colours of <hi>Martia.</hi> Prince <hi>Polemon</hi> followed him with
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Marcella;</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who came after him,
made no difficulty to have al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Antonia.</hi> The next
was <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> with a Livery which none could gue<U+017F><U+017F>e whom
it was for, and whence it was to be inferred, that his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not to have it known. Then came <hi>Lentulus</hi> with that
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and then <hi>Albinus, Aemilianus, Cinna, Cepio,</hi> and a
many others of the mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious <hi>Roman,</hi> to the number of
fifty, it being the Emperour's plea<U+017F>ure there <U+017F>hould be no more
to avoid the confu<U+017F>ion that might have en<U+017F>ued. Though <hi>Agrippa</hi>
was not of an age that made him incapable of the<U+017F>e exerci<U+017F>es,
yet would not the Emperour have him engaged therein, but took
him and <hi>Mecaen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

to order the di<U+017F>tribution of the prizes. And though all the Ma<U+017F>ters
of Chariots had the vi<U+017F>ours of their headpieces down, and were
in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as if they had been ready to fight, yet were they
known as they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, as well by the per<U+017F>ons that were of their
attendance, as by divers other marks, <U+017F>o that it was in us to judge of
the magnificence and graceful carriage of them, which we did, and
gave our opinions thereof very freely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97242:51"/>
This great number of Chariots, (which certainly was the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ight in the World) had gone round about the place, and it
was thought there would not come any more, when the Li<U+017F>ts being
opened again, the place echoed with the noi<U+017F>e of twelve Trumpets
which appeared at the entrance, and began to match a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
after the la<U+017F>t of the Chariots that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed before. They
were mounted on twelve excellent hor<U+017F>es, and their long coats
were of a sky-coloured <U+017F>tuff, which was the colour of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
all covered over with enflamed hearts, and the characters of
<hi>Antonia,</hi> in embroidery of gold; but the noble<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
embroidery that ever had been <U+017F>een at Rome. The flags
which hung at their Trumpets were full of the <U+017F>ame characters.
After the Trumpets, came one after another twenty hor<U+017F>es, led
every one by two <U+017F>laves, who held them in on both <U+017F>ides by two
<U+017F>carfes of the colour and embrodery afore mentioned. The hor<U+017F>es
were of the be<U+017F>t kind of Gennets, and the proude<U+017F>t in their paces
that ever were <U+017F>een; they had in their heads, which they lifted up
with a certain pride, great pennaches of the afore<U+017F>aid colour, and
their maines and tayles tyed up with ribands of gold and sky colour.
The bits of their bridles were enamell'd with gold, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli<U+017F>hed
with precious <U+017F>tones, and they were covered with sky coloured
cloaths hanging down to the ground, and enriched with
the <U+017F>ame embroidery of gold, and the <U+017F>ame characters of <hi>Antonia.</hi>
The cloaths of the <U+017F>laves were of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tuff, and had the <U+017F>ame
trimming. After the<U+017F>e came fifty others cloathed after the <U+017F>ame
manner, without any difference, and went on both <U+017F>ides the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
which immediately followed the twenty hor<U+017F>es.</p>
                        <p>The Chariot had in it four hor<U+017F>es white as the very <U+017F>now,
done with ribands, and harne<U+017F><U+017F>ed as the former. It <U+017F>eemed to be
all of gold, mixt with sky-colour at certain di<U+017F>tances, with
double A. A's, burning hearts, darts, chains, and other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of love and <U+017F>ervitude. The two <U+017F>ides had the form of
two Lyons, that <U+017F>eemed to have <U+017F>umitted to the yoke, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the <U+017F>eat, and <U+017F>erved for a leaning place on both <U+017F>ides. And
behind there was a Cupid made of the height of a man, whereof
the figure was <U+017F>omewhat greater than ordinary, which re<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely on one foot behind, <U+017F>tretched him<U+017F>elf out as it were to
fly, and, having the wings <U+017F>pread, covered therewith the per<U+017F>on
that was in the <U+017F>eat, and <U+017F>eemed to have been put there purpo<U+017F>ely
again<U+017F>t the injuries of the weather, and as it were a covering for
the Chariot. The <U+017F>culpture of that Cupid was admirable, his
face as hand<U+017F>ome as the be<U+017F>t Gravers could have made it, and his
wings glittering with gold and precious <U+017F>tones, which <U+017F>hined in
<U+017F>everal places. In one hand he carried a heart upon the top of one
of his arrows, and in the other a little flag of sky-coloured <U+017F>ilk,
wherein between two chains, and other marks of <U+017F>lavery, might be
<U+017F>een the<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es written in letters of gold:

                        <p>All the re<U+017F>t of the Chariot was open, <U+017F>o that it was ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee
how the per<U+017F>on was accommodated that was within it. He had on
a cuirats and a head-piece of gold, enamell'd with sky-colour, and
enriched, in <U+017F>everal places with <U+017F>tones of a great value. The head-piece
was covered over with a many plumes of blew feathers,
which both backwards and on both <U+017F>ides hung down to his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But in the enamel, as well of the head-piece as the cuirats,
might be ob<U+017F>erved every where the characters of <hi>Antonia;</hi> and the
<U+017F>leeves and the lower part of his under-garment, which came
down <U+017F>omewhat below his knee, being interwomen with gold and
blew <U+017F>ilk, were full of the <U+017F>ame characters, with an excellent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery
of gold, and his bu<U+017F>kins interlaced with gold and blew,
adorned with rich buckles and precious <U+017F>tones. Nor was there
any want of them, about the <U+017F>word he had by his <U+017F>ide. He had
in his right hand two Javelins, with the points guilt with gold, and
in the left, a Buckler of the <U+017F>ame mettal, with the edges enamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<U+017F>uitably to the re<U+017F>t of his Armes, and enriched in the middle
with the picture of the fair <hi>Antonia,</hi> done <U+017F>o like her, that it was
immediately concluded to be the work of the mo<U+017F>t excellent Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                        <p>I thought it not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to give you this <U+017F>hort de<U+017F>cription of him,

had done on all el<U+017F>e that was to be <U+017F>een, though it mu<U+017F>t needs be
acknowledged there was no want of <U+017F>tate or magnificence any
where. But in regard that all the re<U+017F>t were known, and that there
was no means to di<U+017F>cover this la<U+017F>t, either by the per<U+017F>ons of his
attendance, or by any other mark, he drew after him, not onely
the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment and acclamations of the people, but al<U+017F>o the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<U+017F>ity
of all others. And yet though it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to know
either his face or name, yet from <U+017F>ome other circum<U+017F>tances, that
were publick and remarkable enough, it was generally concluded
that it could be no other then the unknown <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who <U+017F>ome daies before had be<U+017F>towed on her the magnificent Galley,
who had overthrown <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and of whom,
under the name of the <hi>Vnknown Lover</hi> there were <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange
reports <U+017F>pread up and down <hi>Rome</hi> and el<U+017F>ewhere. It immediately
ran from mouth to mouth among the Spectators, and all the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
was concerning <hi>Antonia</hi>'s <U+017F>ervant, in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Archelaus</hi>
and <hi>Mithridates</hi> perceaving it, conceaved not a little trouble and
envy thereat, and could not for a certain time recover them<U+017F>elves
out of that di<U+017F>turbance of thoughts which that <U+017F>ight had cau<U+017F>ed in
them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97242:52"/>
                           <hi>Antonia</hi> and my <U+017F>elf were not far from the Emperour, <U+017F>o that,
over-hearing all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which fell not onely from <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> but
all tho<U+017F>e that were about him, upon occa<U+017F>ion of this accident, there
<U+017F>pread <U+017F>uch a redne<U+017F><U+017F>e over <hi>Antonia</hi>'s face, as could not be gotten
off for almo<U+017F>t all that day. And though I was not thereupon
thrifty of my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to her, and earne<U+017F>tly entreated her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
her thoughts to me upon that emergency, yet was it
a long time ere <U+017F>he would as much as open her mouth to make me
any an<U+017F>wer. <hi>Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her, <hi>was it not <U+017F>hrewaly gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed of me
<U+017F>ome daies <U+017F>ince, that your unknown <U+017F>ervant was a per<U+017F>on admirable
as to point of invention and magnificence, and do you not find that
in whatever he undertakes, he eclip<U+017F>es all that is done by others? In
troth,</hi> I <hi>cannot forbear <U+017F>peaking for him, and to tell you, that</hi> I <hi>have
conceived an extraordinary good opinion of him. Antonia</hi> was in <U+017F>ome
uncertainty, whether <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
or make her diver<U+017F>ion of it as others did: but what thoughts
<U+017F>oever her di<U+017F>turbance might in<U+017F>pire her with, yet could <U+017F>he not
but entertain in her <U+017F>oul a certain joy at the advantages of a per<U+017F>on
that loved her, though he did it contrary to her intentions, and the
reputation he acquired, whether <U+017F>he would or no, for his gallantry
and magnificence.</p>
                        <p>But not long after, <U+017F>he had much more rea<U+017F>on, for in fine, Si<U+017F>ter,
(not to tyre you with a relation of all that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed that day, which it
were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to relate to you fully) I <U+017F>hall think it enough to
tell you, that this unknown per<U+017F>on having provided all things for
that day, with all the care and prudence imaginable, and furni<U+017F>hed
him<U+017F>elf with the be<U+017F>t and fleete<U+017F>t hor<U+017F>es that could be had, carryed
away all the prizes, as well for the hor<U+017F>e-races as the Chariots,
leaving behind him at a di<U+017F>tance all that ran with him, and in that
combat on hor<U+017F>eback called <hi>Troy,</hi> he behaved him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>o much
addre<U+017F><U+017F>e and vigour, and did all things with <U+017F>uch an admirable
grace, that he alone drew after him the general acclamations of the
Spectators. In fine, he was by the Emperour him<U+017F>elf declared
Conquerour, how partial <U+017F>oever he might be for <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and
received the prizes, which he came and laid at the feet of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
bending the knee, and bowing to her with a <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion that <U+017F>poke
him her <U+017F>lave. <hi>Antonia</hi> blu<U+017F>hing for <U+017F>hame and vexation, though
haply <U+017F>he was not much di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied at the adventure, did, by the
commandement of <hi>Octavia,</hi> receive them, and immediately after,
the Unknown Lover mounting one of the be<U+017F>t of his hor<U+017F>es, rid
him before us with <U+017F>uch a grace, and <U+017F>eemed to us to be of <U+017F>uch a
noble pre<U+017F>ence, and <U+017F>o well to become the bow of the <U+017F>addle, that
we could not forbear admiring him. A while after, he went in
among the re<U+017F>t, and, taking his time, and making his advantage of
the di<U+017F>order and confu<U+017F>ion they were in, he went out of the Li<U+017F>ts,
and got away with as much <U+017F>peed as could be. His Chariot, and
Equipage were gone long before, for he had given order, that as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97242:52"/>
<U+017F>oon as the Chariot-races were over, all <U+017F>hould withdraw, while
the people were taken up with the other exerci<U+017F>es, wherein he was
to make u<U+017F>e of no more then the hor<U+017F>e he rode on.</p>
                        <p>By this precaution had he taken a cour<U+017F>e, that tho<U+017F>e who were
not concerned in his affairs, <U+017F>hould not follow the per<U+017F>ons that
were of his attendance in order to di<U+017F>cover him, as it might have
been the de<U+017F>ign of divers. But as he retired him<U+017F>elf, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
<U+017F>oever he might be, he could not e<U+017F>cape the eyes of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> who fully <U+017F>atisfied it could be no other than the
<U+017F>ame Rival that had ca<U+017F>t him to the ground, took a re<U+017F>olution
to follow him to the worlds end, and never to leave him till he
had di<U+017F>covered who he was, or that the other had made him <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the injurie he had received from him. He went out of the
li<U+017F>ts <U+017F>oon after him, and perceiving he made all the <U+017F>peed he could
away, he followed him at a di<U+017F>tance towards certain hou<U+017F>es, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he <U+017F>aw he intended, and are di<U+017F>tant from the City about fifty
or <U+017F>ixty <U+017F>tadia. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Mithridatts</hi> was gone,
pre<U+017F>ently imagined the occa<U+017F>ion of his departure, and it being no
le<U+017F><U+017F>e his concernment then the others to be acquainted with his
Rival, would needs follow him, and took his cour<U+017F>e that way which
he was told he had taken.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Mithridates</hi> was gotten far enough before, and
having ob<U+017F>erved that his unknown Rival turned towards a little
Wood on the left hand, he made after him with all the <U+017F>peed he
could, and reached it in a manner as <U+017F>oon as the other. It was with
no <U+017F>mall difficulty that he overtook him, nor indeed had he done
it, had his Rival <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected any thing of his de<U+017F>ign; but ere he
perceived any <U+017F>uch thing, he was gotten <U+017F>o neer him, that all he
could do was to pull down the vi<U+017F>our of his head-piece, which he
had rai<U+017F>ed up to take a little more air, and he did it time enough
to prevent <hi>Mithridates</hi> from knowing him. Having <U+017F>o done, he
would have kept on his way, but <hi>Mithridates</hi> made a <U+017F>hift to get
before him through the trees, and oppo<U+017F>ing his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; <hi>Hope not,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he to him, <hi>to get away this time again, till I have known thee,
and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly till thou ha<U+017F>t made me <U+017F>atisfaction for the many injuries
thou ha<U+017F>t done me.</hi> The Unknown Lover, troubled at this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conter,
was in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence for <U+017F>ome minutes what an<U+017F>wer to make
him; but at la<U+017F>t, perceiving what extremity he was reduced to,
and thinking that, be<U+017F>ides the care he <U+017F>hould take to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e his
voice, the head-piece would contribute <U+017F>o much thereto, as to
make him undi<U+017F>cernable by the other. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to him,
<hi>thou ha<U+017F>t little rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate in pur<U+017F>uing a man that is not
thy enemy, but may become <U+017F>uch through thy importunate per<U+017F>ecution
of him. If thou art my friend,</hi> replies Mithridates, <hi>thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t
not conceal thy <U+017F>elf from me, and if thou art not,</hi> I <hi>little fear thy
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, after the di<U+017F>graces</hi> I <hi>am fallen into by thy means.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As he uttered the<U+017F>e words, he oppo<U+017F>ed his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age more than
before, and held up again<U+017F>t him the point of a Javeline he had in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97242:53"/>
his hand. The Unknown Lover would have avoided fighting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf, but perceaving it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to do it;
<hi>Thou wilt haply have occa<U+017F>ion to remember,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to him, <hi>what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thou do<U+017F>t force me to, and if thou receave any inconvenience
thereby, thou ha<U+017F>t no body to blame but thy <U+017F>elf.</hi> With the<U+017F>e words
they charged one another at the <U+017F>ame time, and having broken
their Javelins on their Bucklers upon which they received them,
they drew their <U+017F>words, and many blows were dealt on both <U+017F>ides.
But my little experience in matter of Combats, permits me not to
give you all the particulars, and therefore <U+017F>hall onely tell you, that
the Unknown Lover finding in one pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s
hor<U+017F>e in <U+017F>omewhat an un<U+017F>ettled po<U+017F>ture, ran his own a-brea<U+017F>t
upon him, and <U+017F>o overturned both him and his ma<U+017F>ter to the
ground.</p>
                        <p>The Unknown Lover thought him<U+017F>elf freed by the fall of
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> and would accordingly have kept on his way, when
there coming before him <hi>Archelaus; Stay,</hi> cried he to him, <hi>having
<U+017F>een</hi> Mithridates <hi>fall, thou ha<U+017F>t done but half thy work, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e thou
conceive me le<U+017F><U+017F>e concerned to know thee then</hi> Mithridates. This
<U+017F>econd <U+017F>toppage put the Unknown Lover out of all patience,
though he very much e<U+017F>teemed the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and
<U+017F>eeing divers others coming from the City, he conceived
he had but little time to loo<U+017F>e, and accordingly without
any further con<U+017F>ultation, he fell upon <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him with blows as to weight, not much inferiour to tho<U+017F>e
he dealt him<U+017F>elf. They fought for a good while on equal termes;
but at la<U+017F>t, the Unknown Lover perceiving the per<U+017F>ons, he had
<U+017F>een before, coming neerer and neerer, runs to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and
laying hold of him, he put on his hor<U+017F>e, which was one of the be<U+017F>t
in the World, to force him out of the <U+017F>adle, and <U+017F>o free him<U+017F>elf
by his fall, as he had done before by that of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> And
certainly, he put <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength to it, that he did what he de<U+017F>ired
in <U+017F>ome part, and drew <hi>Archelaus</hi> out of the <U+017F>adle upon the
crupper, whence he <U+017F>lipped down to the ground: but <hi>Archelaus,</hi>
having, as he fell, gotten hold of the other by the head-piece,
held him with <U+017F>uch force, that he broke the chin-pieces of
it, and taking it with him, his enemies head was naked and
di<U+017F>armed. Upon which <hi>Marcellus, Ptolomey, Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and divers
others being come into the place, ran to the two Combatants, and
in the <U+017F>ight of all tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons, as al<U+017F>o of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
who were gotten up, the face of the unknown Lover was
<U+017F>een, and known to be that of <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> the Son of <hi>Livia,</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of the two Princes that had been wor<U+017F>ted by
him, of</hi> Marcellus, Ptolomey <hi>and the re<U+017F>t, was not ordinary, when
they found</hi> Dru<U+017F>us <hi>to be the Unknown Lover of</hi> Antonia, <hi>who
had <U+017F>erved her, without di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf, with <U+017F>o much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97242:53"/>
and good-liking, and if</hi> Archelaus <hi>and</hi> Mithridates <hi>were
troubled that they had met with <U+017F>o powerful a Rival; they were
in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure comforted as to their di<U+017F>grace, becau<U+017F>e it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the hands of a Prince, who<U+017F>e valour was known to all the
World.</hi> Dru<U+017F>us <hi>was in a little trouble and di<U+017F>order to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf
di<U+017F>covered, as thinking he had not come to that point he <U+017F>hould
have done ere he had been known; but perceiving the misfortune
to be incapable of any remedy, he generou<U+017F>ly re<U+017F>olved to endure
it, and turning towards Prence</hi> Marcellus <hi>and</hi> Ptolomey, <hi>who <U+017F>tood
neer him:</hi> Mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious Princes, <hi><U+017F>aid he to them,</hi> I crave your
pardon for the <U+017F>urprize and <U+017F>tratagems I have u<U+017F>ed towards the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e your Si<U+017F>ter, and the offence I have committed again<U+017F>t you
by <U+017F>erving her without your knowledge. Had I thought my <U+017F>elf
worthy that glory, I <U+017F>hould not have had any recour<U+017F>e to artifice;
but how mean <U+017F>oever I may be as to point of merit, I cannot but hope
from the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake I cheerfully
quitted all the pretentions I had for <hi>Julia,</hi> that he will grant me, out
of an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of favour, that which I dur<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ume to de<U+017F>ire of
him, before I had in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged him to love me, by the <U+017F>ervices
it was in my thoughts to do him. And from Prince <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> a per<U+017F>on
I have ever infinitely e<U+017F>teemed, I do expect, he <U+017F>hould not oppo<U+017F>e me
in the de<U+017F>ign I have ab<U+017F>olutely to <U+017F>acrifice my whole life to the <U+017F>ervice
of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e his Si<U+017F>ter.</p>
                        <p>To this effect was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> which when he had
done, he expected the an<U+017F>wer of the two Princes with that con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which he might well derive from the friend<U+017F>hip they had
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed towards him for <U+017F>ome time before. Tis true, <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi>
was a Prince of <U+017F>o great merit, that he was infinitely e<U+017F>teemed by
all that were of his acquaintance; and from the time that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
was reconciled with him after the duel they had fought for
<hi>Julia,</hi> having di<U+017F>covered his excellent endowments, as well in his
conver<U+017F>ation, as the earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e he ob<U+017F>erved in <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> to purcha<U+017F>e
his affection, he had conceaved more re<U+017F>pects &amp; friend<U+017F>hip towards
him than any other among the Romans, &amp; preferred no man before
him in his inclinations, but only <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>us</hi>'s
Fortunes were <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable by rea<U+017F>on of the authority of
<hi>Livia,</hi> and the intere<U+017F>t his own worth had ju<U+017F>tly gained him with
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> that neither <hi>Marcellus,</hi> nor <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> nor any of the other
Friends of <hi>Antonia</hi> could wi<U+017F>h her a match that were more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.
They accordingly <U+017F>tudied not long for the an<U+017F>wer they
were to make him, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> <U+017F>peaking for both, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that what he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hould be confirmed: <hi>Prince,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to
Dru<U+017F>us, <hi>we have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with you; but it is
onely for the little relyance you have had in our friend<U+017F>hip, and the
e<U+017F>teem we have for you. But that you <U+017F>hall hear more of another time;
and therefore in the interim, <U+017F>ince you have thought</hi> Antonia <hi>worthy

<hi>are of the <U+017F>ame mind, and that, for my part, if in the de<U+017F>ign

                        <p>What <hi>Ptolomey</hi> <U+017F>aid to <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> was to the <U+017F>ame effect, whereat
this Prince was <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfied, that he could not expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his
joy without a certain confu<U+017F>ion. After he had di<U+017F>covered his
re<U+017F>entments thereof to both, as much as he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could, he comes
to <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and made his excu<U+017F>es to them, as
to what was pa<U+017F>t, in the mo<U+017F>t obliging manner that could be.
The<U+017F>e two Princes felt <U+017F>o much grief within, that they could not
think of any con<U+017F>olation, but not <U+017F>o much for the di<U+017F>grace of
their falls, as for that their ill fortune had rai<U+017F>ed them <U+017F>o dreadful
a Rival, and the words they had heard from <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey,</hi>
from which, together with the confidence they were in that
<hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> and <hi>Octavia</hi> would declare for <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> they could not
but infer that the little hope which they had conceived in the
cour<U+017F>e of their affections, would come to nothing. But, however
they were burthened with grief, they received the civilities of
<hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> as they ought, and on their <U+017F>ide craved his pardon for their
indi<U+017F>cretion, and whatever they attempted again<U+017F>t him, while they
knew him not.</p>
                        <p>I <U+017F>ee, Si<U+017F>ter, you are de<U+017F>irous I <U+017F>hould contract this relation, <U+017F>ince
it is indeed of an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive length, and therefore, I <U+017F>hall onely tell
you, without in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting too much on particulars, that, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> made thereto, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> would needs have him, immediately, and in that very
po<U+017F>ture pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and that <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> having oppo<U+017F>ed it
for <U+017F>ome time out of the fear he was in to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, at la<U+017F>t
was prevailed with to come along with them, and followed them
to the City, and <U+017F>o to the Emperours Court, where all the mo<U+017F>t
eminent per<U+017F>ons about it were a<U+017F><U+017F>embled, and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of the
Unknown Lover of <hi>Antonia.</hi> They were yet <U+017F>peaking of him
when <hi>Marcellus</hi> comes into the room, leading in <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> by the
hand; and it was before this Illu<U+017F>trious A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, that <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
having pre<U+017F>ented him to the Emperour, and <hi>Octavia,</hi> brought him
to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and, having di<U+017F>covered him to her for the Unknown
Lover, who had given her <U+017F>uch gallant-like expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his love,
and that in <U+017F>o extraordinary a manner, entreated her to entertain
him, as a Prince that had devoted him<U+017F>elf to her <U+017F>ervice, and
who<U+017F>e inclinations for her were an honour to all their hou<U+017F>e. The
whole A<U+017F><U+017F>embly was nothing but applau<U+017F>es and acclamations at
the <U+017F>ight and di<U+017F>covery of <hi>Dru<U+017F>us;</hi> and being a per<U+017F>on generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
all were glad to hear that it was he who had done <U+017F>uch noble
things for <hi>Antonia,</hi> and cryed out they were worthy one another,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97242:54"/>
and that it was a couple the be<U+017F>t matched of any in the World.
The Emperour conceived an extraordinary joy at it, <hi>Livia</hi> was
well plea<U+017F>ed with the good choice her <U+017F>on had made, and the
Emperour and <U+017F>he together, joyning with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> (having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

him leave, by open ho<U+017F>tility, to take in that heart which he would
have <U+017F>urprized by <U+017F>tratagem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonia,</hi> <U+017F>ome what troubled at the adventure, found it <U+017F>ome
difficulty to recover her <U+017F>elf out of the di<U+017F>order <U+017F>he was in; and
though it be certain that it was <U+017F>ome joy to her to <U+017F>ee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lover changed into <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> who was the per<U+017F>on of all
the Romans, into whom <U+017F>he had mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to wi<U+017F>h him changed,
yet was <U+017F>he <U+017F>till vexed at the artifice he had u<U+017F>ed toward her, and
could not of a <U+017F>udden overcome the re<U+017F>entment which was ri<U+017F>en
thereof in her mind. However <U+017F>he had a command over her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
moderation, and, having rai<U+017F>ed <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> who was on his knees
before her, <U+017F>he onely told him that there was a con<U+017F>onancy between
her will and tho<U+017F>e of the per<U+017F>ons to whom her birth had made her
<U+017F>ubject; and that, (I mean her moderation) <U+017F>he made u<U+017F>e of not

that <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> hath found it true, that all the demon<U+017F>trations
of love that may be have no influence on her <U+017F>pirit, and amount to
no more than the complyance <U+017F>he had for the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of <hi>Octavia.</hi>
He was at la<U+017F>t received into her <U+017F>ervice with the joy and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that very day: and that though he were in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture as topoint
of health, that he could not well undertake <U+017F>uch a voyage
without <U+017F>ome danger, yet had he ab<U+017F>olutely re<U+017F>olved to venture
it, out of the great de<U+017F>ire he had to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the fear he
was in of loo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o noble a prize.</p>
                     <p>Megacles, <hi>having received this intelligence for certain, began to
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e all things in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el in order to his entertainment; and
having under<U+017F>tood that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were de<U+017F>irous to be alone,
he, out of the great re<U+017F>pect he had for them, would not <U+017F>o much
as come neer their Chamber, and was content only to give notice
to one of the women that belonged to</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>that he de<U+017F>ired
that notice might be <U+017F>ent him, when the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were plea<U+017F>ed
that he <U+017F>hould waite upon them, and when they would have any
thing brought to dinner. That done, calling to mind the Unknown
Per<U+017F>on, whom the day before he had re<U+017F>cued from the devouring
waves, and of whom he had conceaved a marvailous good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he would needs give him a vi<U+017F>it, and being come into the
chamber, where he had left him a bed, he found that he made a
<U+017F>hift to get on his cloaths; but that afterwards, being much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the great quantity of <U+017F>alt water he had drunk, he had
been forced to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf again on the bed they had a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him,</hi>
Megacles, <hi>as <U+017F>oon as he came in, cau<U+017F>ed a little window to be <U+017F>ee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97242:57"/>
open to give a little more light to the chamber, and having by that
advantage of light made fre<U+017F>h ob<U+017F>ervations of the good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and hund<U+017F>omene<U+017F>s of the Unknown, he was now much
more <U+017F>urprized at him then the day before, and could not look
on him, but with a certain admiration. The other, who with
much ado knew him again, and reflected on the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he had
received from him, as al<U+017F>o on the conver<U+017F>ation they had had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the more than ordinary pains and earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
in the <U+017F>aving of his life, entertained him with abundance
of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and gave him <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ee through the clouds
of his melancholy, that though he had little love for the good
office had been done him, yet had he abundance of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his good intentions. Adde to that, that all his behaviour,
all his ge<U+017F>ture, nay indeed all things <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>o great, as
if there had been in him a conjunction of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and mode<U+017F>ty
with a noble and maje<U+017F>tick aire, that, notwith<U+017F>tanding all his ill
fortune,</hi> Megacles <hi>felt in, him<U+017F>elf abundance of inclinations to
re<U+017F>pect him, as he would do the per<U+017F>on of</hi> Artax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s <hi>him<U+017F>elf. After
he had <U+017F>ate down by him, that he had felt his pul<U+017F>e, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
of him <U+017F>ome account of his health, the unknown per<U+017F>on
a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a <U+017F>igh, which by its depth <U+017F>eemed to
have come from the bottom of his heart;</hi> My health, <hi><U+017F>aid he to
him,</hi> is but in too good a po<U+017F>ture compared to that of my Fortune;
but whatever it may be, you <U+017F>ee that I do not any way oppo<U+017F>e the
return of it, and that I have kept the promi<U+017F>e I had made you not
to attempt any thing again<U+017F>t my life, while I <U+017F>hall be in your power.
And for that very rea<U+017F>on, <hi>replies Megacles,</hi> you <U+017F>hall continue in it
as long as I can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly keep you, and I <U+017F>hould find it no <U+017F>mall difficulty
to <U+017F>uffer you to leave us, if I had the lea<U+017F>t imagination that you
for<U+017F>ook us, to go and <U+017F>eek out death. When I con<U+017F>ider what po<U+017F>ture
my life is reduced to, <hi>replyed the Unknown, I</hi> think death to be the
onely happine<U+017F><U+017F>e I either can or ought to hope, and yet <U+017F>ince I have had
that of <U+017F>eeing you, having made <U+017F>ome reflections on the things you
told me ye<U+017F>terday, on the <U+017F>trange manner whereby I was delivered out
of the very jaws of death, contrary to all probability, and other
circum<U+017F>tances of my misfortunes, I concluded, that I ought not to put
a Period to my own life, before I had done all that lay in my power
to <U+017F>erve a per<U+017F>on on whom I had be<U+017F>towed it; <U+017F>ince that in all
likelihood <U+017F>he <U+017F>tands in need of it, and that it is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but
that by <U+017F>ome one of tho<U+017F>e extraordinary accidents that happen to
me, but <U+017F>he may yet receive it. Out of this con<U+017F>ideration, and
upon the account of this obligation, rather than out of any hope, or
remainder of love that <hi>I</hi> have for my life, had I taken my cloaths,
and would have begged your leave to be gone; but, to deal truely with
you, the body was not able to follow the motions of the <U+017F>pirit, and
perceiving that all the <U+017F>trength I could mu<U+017F>ter was hardly able
to bear me up, and con<U+017F>equently far from putting that in execution
which I had intended, I was forced to ly down again, till <U+017F>uch time as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97242:57"/>
I <U+017F>hall have recovered it a little better, as I po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly may ere
this day be quite pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. The Gods have the prai<U+017F>e of this good
re<U+017F>olution, <hi>replyed Megacles,</hi> and I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf obliged to
give them thanks while I live for the opportunity they have furni<U+017F>ht
me with to prevent the effects of your de<U+017F>paire, <U+017F>ince that by this
very demurre we have made to it, we may haply have ab<U+017F>olutely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed it. Alas, alas, <hi>replyed the afflicted per<U+017F>on,
with a <U+017F>igh,</hi> how little acquaintance have you with my Fortune!
And how far would you be from that opinion, had you but once an
account of my misfortunes! I <U+017F>hall know them when you <U+017F>hall think
good, <hi>replyed Megacles;</hi> but I <U+017F>hall not de<U+017F>ire it of you, till <U+017F>uch
time as your own inclination <U+017F>hall in<U+017F>pire you to give it me: for, the
little time I have known you con<U+017F>iered, I have conceived <U+017F>uch a
re<U+017F>pect for you, as permits me not to deal with you as I happly <U+017F>hould
with ordinary per<U+017F>ons. That compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate <U+017F>entiment, which you have
for the mi<U+017F>erable, <hi>replyed the Unknown,</hi> you rather derive from
your own vertue, then any thing you might have ob<U+017F>erved in my
per<U+017F>on, which is onely the mark of Heavens indignation, and a ball
continually to<U+017F><U+017F>ed and bandyed by the incon<U+017F>tancies of Fortune. And
therefore a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that the opinion I have conceived, and the
re<U+017F>entment I have, of this compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion you expre<U+017F>s towards me, <U+017F>hould, no
doubt, prevaile with me to make a di<U+017F>covery of my <U+017F>elf to you rather
than to any other per<U+017F>on, if I might thereby convince you of the e<U+017F>teem
I have for you, and were I not obliged to <U+017F>ecrecy out of other con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
then what concern my <U+017F>elf. You may judge of the truth I now
tell you, by the po<U+017F>ture wherein you have <U+017F>een me, and I doubt not but
you are <U+017F>atisfied that he who contemns his life, as I have done, hath
nothing to fear, as to him<U+017F>elf, that might hinder him to di<U+017F>cover
him<U+017F>elf. Till <U+017F>uch time then that I am at that liberty, I <U+017F>hall only
tell you, that whatever incen<U+017F>ed heaven, and the indeprecable de<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
may have ever executed that were mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>upportable, on a great
number of mi<U+017F>erable per<U+017F>ons, is fallen in <U+017F>uch manner on me alone, that
neither the times of our Fathers, nor yet our own could ever afford
<U+017F>uch another example. And whereas you have <U+017F>een divers per<U+017F>ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unfortunate through the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of dignities, friends, e<U+017F>tates, the
affection, nay and the per<U+017F>ons too of all that they could love in this
World; you have in me a draugt of all the<U+017F>e, but I draught, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
times greater than your imagition can repre<U+017F>ent it to you.</p>
                     <p>I have ever bin of opinion, <hi>replyed Megacles,</hi> that your misfortunes
were indeed extraordinary, and your <U+017F>oul hath appeared to me <U+017F>o great
in the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions I have <U+017F>een thereof, that I immediately inferred it
impa<U+017F><U+017F>ible as to ordinary ones. And yet I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ume to tell you
that in the cour<U+017F>e of the World there have been <U+017F>een revolutions
<U+017F>trange enough to rai<U+017F>e up and encourage the mo<U+017F>t cru<U+017F>hed hopes, and
that <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons out of the most dreadful aby<U+017F><U+017F>es of misfortunes,
have as it were in an in<U+017F>tant flown up to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of happini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
and glory. Who could have promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Marius</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t of his
mi<U+017F>eries that glorious change that happened in his condition? and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97242:58"/>
who could have put him into <U+017F>uch a hope, as that out of the fenne where
he had hid him<U+017F>elf for the <U+017F>afety of his life, and out of the dungeon,
wherein he had been expo<U+017F>ed to the mercy of tho<U+017F>e that were <U+017F>ent to
murder him, he <U+017F>hould, within a few daies after, enter <hi>Rome</hi> in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and be rai<U+017F>ed up to the <U+017F>ame height of greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e whence he
had before been ca<U+017F>t down?</p>
                     <p>You find it no <U+017F>mal difficulty, <hi>replied the Unknown per<U+017F>on,</hi> to meet
in all our ages but with this one example, to prove the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of
mans return from misfortune to lo<U+017F>t felicities; but you may ea<U+017F>ily find
an infinite number to demon<U+017F>trate how ea<U+017F>y it is to fall from thrones
into chains, and from fame and happine<U+017F><U+017F>e into <U+017F>hame and mi<U+017F>ery. So
many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> drawn after Chariots, loaden with chains, and
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into pri<U+017F>ons, and among the <hi>Romans</hi> them<U+017F>elves, the great
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and the deplorable <hi>Anthony,</hi> furni<U+017F>h us with examples of it
<U+017F>ufficiently dreadful. A man may endeavour to <U+017F>truggle with Fortune
by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of vertue and a great courage, but not expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of her favours, when <U+017F>he hath once withdrawn them by her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy:
for this envious godde<U+017F>s is much more inclined, and <U+017F>ubject to
pull down what <U+017F>he had once built up, then to rai<U+017F>e up what <U+017F>he had once
brought to ruin. Be<U+017F>ides, there are <U+017F>ome happine<U+017F><U+017F>es, &amp; <U+017F>ome misfortunes
in our lives that have no dependance on fortune, and wherein <U+017F>he is very
little concerned: and whereas <U+017F>he hath no power over mens inclinations,
it were in vain for tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e greate<U+017F>t unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
in the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of an affection, which they thought extreamly precious,
to expect the returne of it from Fortune, and it were fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e for
them, any way to rely on her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. <hi>Sylla,</hi> who <U+017F>eemed to have
made an allyance with her, and who might well attribute more to her
indulgence then he could have done to his own vertue, enjoyed the
continuance of her favours to the end with a more then ordinary
con<U+017F>tancy; and that Greek Captain, whom <U+017F>he in his dreams, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
with Cities be<U+017F>ieged in nets, acknowledged her ever for an
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant godde<U+017F><U+017F>e. But neither of the<U+017F>e two great examples ever
<U+017F>ought any other happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, or feared any other misfortunes then
tho<U+017F>e which are deriveable from her Empire, and <U+017F>he might wel be their
principal divinity, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of all tho<U+017F>e things that could rai<U+017F>e
in them either fears or de<U+017F>ires, and con<U+017F>equently could make them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fortunate or unfortunate: but for my part, who, with all <U+017F>he could
take from me, have lo<U+017F>t what <U+017F>he cannot re<U+017F>tore me to, alas, to what
god can I addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf? Or where <U+017F>hall I find either a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance or
compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, when both heaven and earth have con<U+017F>pired again<U+017F>t me?</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e words fell from him with <U+017F>uch an expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and yet he had uttered them with <U+017F>uch a grace, and in <U+017F>o obliging
a manner, that <hi>Megacles</hi> had not onely all the pitty that could be
for him, but al<U+017F>o all the admiration. He therefore omitted nothing
of what he could <U+017F>ay to him, that he thought might give him
any comfort, and having, before he would <U+017F>tir out of the place,
cau<U+017F>ed victualls to be brought in, he would not leave him till he
had eaten <U+017F>omething. Which done, out of a fear he might be
trouble<U+017F>ome to him, and a con<U+017F>iderantion that re<U+017F>t would do him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97242:58"/>
much good, he left him, and went about tho<U+017F>e things which his
charge obliged him to look after, and particularly to take order
for the bringing of victualls and other nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries from <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in order to their voyage, wherein he was to be <U+017F>o circum<U+017F>pect as
that the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el might not come thereby into any danger of being
di<U+017F>covered. In the<U+017F>e employments and <U+017F>ome other which he had
had, the morning and better part of the day was <U+017F>pent; <U+017F>o that at
la<U+017F>t perceiving it was very late, and that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es had not
called for any thing, he went to their chamber door, and <U+017F>ent to
entreat them that they would be plea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>omething might be
brought them to dinner. It was much about the time that the
fair <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had made an end of her long relation; in<U+017F>omuch,
that upon the <U+017F>ollicitation of <hi>Megacles</hi> and their Women, they
gave way that <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>hould be brought them in, and took a
little nouri<U+017F>hment.</p>

<U+017F>eemed to have <U+017F>lumbered her <U+017F>elf into a deep recollection, gave
a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>tart, and was as it were in a great trouble and di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
but a little after recovering her <U+017F>elf, and fetching a <U+017F>igh

how true is that which I told you this morning concerning the
force of our imagination, and how certain is it that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
which I <U+017F>till have in my <U+017F>oul of the unfaithful and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Son of <hi>Juba,</hi> hath imprinted <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong idea's of him in my
mind, that if his countenance appears not to my eyes, his voice I
am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>mites my ears! Even at that very moment that you might
have ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome alteration in my countenance, I thought I had
heard him di<U+017F>tinctly very neer me, and <U+017F>everal times this day, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I have entertained you with, this <U+017F>ame
deluded imagination of mine brought that <U+017F>ound to my ears, and
had allmo<U+017F>t put me out in my relation. I could not have believed
that for an unfaithful per<U+017F>on there <U+017F>hould have remained <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions in my mind: but alas, how uncon<U+017F>tant <U+017F>oever he may have
been, he is haply dead for my <U+017F>ake, and by the bloud he hath <U+017F>hed by
defending us again<U+017F>t the Barbarians, he hath haply expiated part of
the offence he hath committed again<U+017F>t.</p>

gods to pre<U+017F>erve him, as it is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but it may be <U+017F>o, I cannot,

tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my own heart! What advantage can I derive to my
<U+017F>elf from his innocence? If he were de<U+017F>tined to dye, <U+017F>hould it not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97242:59"/>
be <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction to me that his infidelity hath happened before
his death, that <U+017F>o I might be capable of a comfort which I <U+017F>hould
never have hearkened unto, had he dyed con<U+017F>tant? And if on the
other <U+017F>ide he be living, when I con<U+017F>ider the wretchedne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and the captivity I now am in, which haply will never <U+017F>uffer
me to <U+017F>ee him again, am I not much le<U+017F><U+017F>e unfortunate in that I have
only my own mi<U+017F>eries to bewayle, then if, it being <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant
to me, I <U+017F>hould be obliged to have a re<U+017F>entment of his as much
as if they were my own? And yet all this notwith<U+017F>tanding, <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<U+017F>he with a <U+017F>igh, (proceeding eyther from weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, or that
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on for it)</hi> I cannot repent me of my wi<U+017F>h, and I
<U+017F>hould be glad, though haply it might co<U+017F>t me my life, he were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tant
to me.</p>
                     <p>I am very much of your mind as to that point, <hi>replied Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi>
and accordingly make it out of all que<U+017F>tion, that of all the mi<U+017F>eries
which it is in the power of Fortune to force upon us, there are not any
but are more <U+017F>upportable to a heart <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of a tender affection, then
tho<U+017F>e that proceed from that very affection, as being <U+017F>uch as are all
directly levelled again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame heart that is wounded by them.
There are in our <U+017F>oules <U+017F>everal degrees of tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e, for they are not
equally <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the happine<U+017F><U+017F>es and unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>es of this nature
as of tho<U+017F>e that proceed from other cau<U+017F>es; nay I dare affirm, that
while they have this impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, they have no other con<U+017F>ideration of
the<U+017F>e later, than that they were a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances or ob<U+017F>tacles to tho<U+017F>e which
we look on as purely real and e<U+017F><U+017F>ential. Which granted, I can without
any difficulty believe, that amid<U+017F>t all the misfortunes which the ju<U+017F>t
indignation of heaven may <U+017F>end upon us, the uncon<U+017F>tancy and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the per<U+017F>on beloved, is the mo<U+017F>t indige<U+017F>tible, and mo<U+017F>t grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and in<U+017F>upportable, and, by a certain violence of a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, <U+017F>torms
that strength of mind which might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hold out again<U+017F>t all other
unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>es. And you mu<U+017F>t on the contrary acknowledg, that amid<U+017F>t all
the mi<U+017F>eries through which our inexorable de<U+017F>tinies will needs force
us, the faith and con<U+017F>tancy of the per<U+017F>on we love, rai<U+017F>es up our <U+017F>pirits
into <U+017F>uch a height of con<U+017F>olation and enjoyment of our <U+017F>elves, that
during <U+017F>uch time as we make a <U+017F>trong reflection thereupon, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
in an apathy as to all the re<U+017F>t, all our <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility being taken up

                        <q>I am <U+017F>o much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, <hi>replies Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is not much more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
And this you might ea<U+017F>ily have imagined, though I have
not <U+017F>poken any thing to you thereof, <U+017F>ince it is apparent
enough, that, if, according to the pre<U+017F>umption you have of the
incon<U+017F>tancy of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> you <U+017F>hould once bani<U+017F>h him your heart,
the King my Brother, who<U+017F>e pri<U+017F>oners we are, and who loves you
well enough as you have had <U+017F>ufficient try all, might conceive a
little more hope from your neglect and oblivion of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
then if you <U+017F>till afforded him a place in your affections. And if
that alteration <U+017F>hould once happen, what fortune were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

<U+017F>peaks you a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e nobly born, full of goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and

demon<U+017F>tration of your friend<U+017F>hip, much more then for all the
others you might have given me. But <U+017F>ince you have thought fit
to make this overture to me of your <U+017F>elf, give me leave, Si<U+017F>ter,
to entreat you, by whatever is deare<U+017F>t to your thoughts, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>evere
in that good intention, and I be<U+017F>eech you, by all the good
inclinations you have for me, never to aggravate the mi<U+017F>eries of
my captivitie by <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es as haply the King your Brother
will oblige you to entertain me with on his behalf. I <U+017F>hall not tell
you, that, by his horrid cruelties as well towards my Brother
as your <U+017F>elf, he hath rendred him<U+017F>elf unworthy, both of the
affection he expects from me, and the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which he hopes
you may afford him. Nor <U+017F>hal I adde to that, as I very well might,
how that by the <U+017F>ame cruelty, whereof I have been acquainted
with the abominable circum<U+017F>tances, both from the relations of
<hi>Alexander</hi> and your own, he hath rai<U+017F>ed in my heart the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
horrour that may be for him, whence it comes that I look on
him rather as a Tyger than a great King. But I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tick to
tell you plainly, that, though his life were not <U+017F>tained with any
ba<U+017F>e or reproachable action, though his manners and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97242:60"/>
wanted not that mildne<U+017F><U+017F>e and affability I <U+017F>hould require, though
his per<U+017F>on were more than ordinary amiable, and that to his <U+017F>ingle
Crown he could adde the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> he <U+017F>hould never have
any part in this heart, which I have once be<U+017F>towed, and never
can do a <U+017F>econd time. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath had the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>poiles of it,
and <U+017F>hall carry them with him to the grave; whether he be living
or dead, con<U+017F>tant or incon<U+017F>tant, he onely <U+017F>hall have that advantage.
And if, by his infidelity, I am di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed from the affection which
I ought to have continued to the very la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>p, had he per<U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his; or am, by his death, di<U+017F>engaged, as to him, of a
friend<U+017F>hip, which it is needle<U+017F><U+017F>e to ob<U+017F>erve towards the <U+017F>hades,
there is nothing can di<U+017F>engage me from my <U+017F>elf, that is, from
what I impo<U+017F>ed upon my <U+017F>elf, when I fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubmitted to that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
affection, and con<U+017F>equently, nothing can <U+017F>et my <U+017F>oul at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in order to a <U+017F>econd choice, or into a condition to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any new impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of love. Tis enough that the great
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> hath once given way to love and been taken with the
great perfections of the mo<U+017F>t amiable among men; but the ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
which I might find for my former weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es, would not
haply be accepted for the latter. Expect not therefore from me,
<hi>my deare<U+017F>t Si<U+017F>ter,</hi> what I could not obtain of my <U+017F>elf, for my <U+017F>elf,
though I <U+017F>hould pretend a greater intere<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o,
then that which you repre<U+017F>ent, and imagine that there cannot
be any <U+017F>elicity hoped from an affection contracted by <U+017F>uch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
waies. To do you what <U+017F>ervice I can with the King
your Brother, and to oblige him to treat you more civility, I <U+017F>hall
conceale part of my re<U+017F>entments, and the aver<U+017F>ion I have for
him; and therefore you ought to be <U+017F>atisfied with me, when
you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee me do that for you which I <U+017F>hould never endure
to do one minute formy <U+017F>elf, and con<U+017F>ider the violence I do my
<U+017F>elf for your <U+017F>ake, as no <U+017F>light demon<U+017F>tration of my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip.</p>

                        <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> gave <hi>Cleopatra</hi> many thanks for the promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had made
her to force her inclinations upon her account, and begged her
pardon for what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid concerning her own concernments, and,
in requital, made a prote<U+017F>tation to her, that <U+017F>he would never <U+017F>peak
to her more on the behalf of the King her Brother, and that <U+017F>he
had two great an e<U+017F>teem for tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olutions of fidelity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy
which <U+017F>he had taken, ever to be guilty of any de<U+017F>ign to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
them.</p>
                     <p>Thus were they engaged in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when of a <U+017F>udden they
heard a very great noi<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>hip, and not long after, that it was
upon occa<U+017F>ion of the Kings coming into it. What lectures <U+017F>oever
they might have read one to another of con<U+017F>tancy, they both grew
pale, and were a little <U+017F>tartled at this news, and looking one upon
the other without <U+017F>peaking, they were at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e as to all re<U+017F>olution;
yet <U+017F>o as that there might be <U+017F>ome difference in their thoughts,

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97242:60"/>
grief, that of <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>ubject to more fear. At la<U+017F>t, <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
who<U+017F>e courage was greater than that of <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t

and lean'd, as he came along, upon one of his men; but
his palene<U+017F><U+017F>e was di<U+017F>pelled at the <U+017F>ight of that object by which he
was enflamed, and he made a <U+017F>hift to forget all his weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e to
get near <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who at his fir<U+017F>t coming in was ri<U+017F>en from the
place where <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate. <hi>Artaxus</hi> <U+017F>aluted her with abundance of
re<U+017F>pect, and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was glad to continue him in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and laoth to force him to tho<U+017F>e extremities, which <U+017F>he
might ju<U+017F>tly fear from a man <U+017F>o violent, returned him, though
with a <U+017F>ad and <U+017F>erious countenance, what was due to <hi>his</hi> quality
from a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>hers.</hi> Before he <U+017F>poke to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he ca<U+017F>t his

the ground, not having the confidence to look him in the face.
The fear and confu<U+017F>ion he perceived her to be in, added not a

before he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to the other, and looking on her with

what manner Heaven hath pro<U+017F>pered your de<U+017F>ignes, and how it
hath approved that the Daughter of <hi>Artaba<U+017F>us</hi> <U+017F>hould for<U+017F>ake

                        <q>My Lord, <hi>replies Artemi<U+017F>a, endeavouring to recover her <U+017F>elf a
little,</hi> though my affection was, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, very great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Alexander,</hi> yet was it not <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould have obliged me

                        <q>This makes nothing

much in need of any, having found <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>anctuary in the

                        <p>It is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi>replies</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>not <U+017F>taying for any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer

which the gods and our own courage <U+017F>hall in<U+017F>pire us
with. In the mean time, be not flattered with <U+017F>o fond a hope,
as that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> <U+017F>hould tamely <U+017F>uffer you, in his own dominions,
and almo<U+017F>t in his arms, to carry away a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e that is one of

Father hath alwayes <U+017F>erved him, and dyed in his cau<U+017F>e, through

my <U+017F>elf, in my younger years, have drawn my <U+017F>word of his <U+017F>ide

                           <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> hath not been carryed away,
<hi>replies</hi> Cleopatra, <U+017F>he hath onely fled away from your wrath,
after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aved my Brothers life. It was her obligation to
pre<U+017F>erve it, becau<U+017F>e it was for her <U+017F>ake that he had expo<U+017F>ed it to
that ignominious death, which you had intended he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>uffer. And <U+017F>o after <U+017F>he had thus acquitted her <U+017F>elf towards a
Prince who was not unworthy of her, <U+017F>he was content to follow
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97242:61"/>
him and participate of his fortune in order to the <U+017F>afety of her
life, which <U+017F>he could not hope to have <U+017F>ecure with you after
tho<U+017F>e examples of cruelty which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h in her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</q>

                     <q>
                        <p>Well, Madam, <hi>replyed the King of Armenia,</hi> whether <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
carryed away <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> or <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> carryed away <hi>Alexander,</hi>
it matters not; this is certain, that I received the affront, in the
very heart of my dominions; and that a Prince of the quality of
<hi>Alexander</hi> had no ground in the World to go and remain incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito
in the Court of a King, whom he knew to be his enemy,
whether it were to gain the affections of his Si<U+017F>ter, or out of any
other de<U+017F>ign which he might have had; and that there is not
any Prince in the World, by whom he had not been ill trated
upon <U+017F>uch an account. But though this rea<U+017F>on, and the others I
have already alledged of the intere<U+017F>ts and the <U+017F>ervices of our
hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hould amount to nothing with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> I am now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to another power than his, and <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>ubmitted my
<U+017F>elf to yours, I <U+017F>tand in greater fear of your indignation than
<hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This he <U+017F>econded with <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, after which, he
de<U+017F>ired leave of her to <U+017F>it down, by rea<U+017F>on of his wounds which
had weakened him very much, and were not a little trouble<U+017F>ome
to him. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> laughed in her <U+017F>leeve at this pretended re<U+017F>pect,
and yet was not a little plea<U+017F>ed to keep him in that humour, out
of a fear he might break forth into di<U+017F>order, and accordingly not
much care what violences he put in execution. Nor indeed was
the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Artaxus</hi> any other; it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that his fierce
and cruel nature <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pend it <U+017F>elf long in fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e complyances!
But he thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, while he was yet
in a condition to fear all things, and out of that con<U+017F>ideration
would not make u<U+017F>e of his power, till <U+017F>uch time as he were come
into his own Kingdom. In the interim, he had re<U+017F>olved to do all
that lay in his power to humour <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and omitted no humble
<U+017F>ervices or <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, to make her forget, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, the aver<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>he had conceived again<U+017F>t him. He would needs have the <U+017F>hip to
hoi<U+017F>e up <U+017F>aile at that very in<U+017F>tant, though his Chirurgeon had made
it appeare to him, that the <U+017F>ea was prejudicial to his wounds, and
indeed he had on the other <U+017F>ide <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to fear he might be
<U+017F>urprized upon that coa<U+017F>t, by tho<U+017F>e that were <U+017F>ent out in que<U+017F>t of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> He conceived, and that not without probability, that
he had not e<U+017F>caped <U+017F>o long, had it not been for the little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
there was that tho<U+017F>e who had carryed away <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>tay <U+017F>o neer <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And indeed it was out of that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration
that tho<U+017F>e who went in their pur<U+017F>uit, as well by <U+017F>ea as
by land, had gone the farther from the place where the fact was
done. Be<U+017F>ides the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el was <U+017F>o hidden by a rock, which in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
covered it, that on the land <U+017F>ide it could not any way be <U+017F>een;
and to prevent all <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion from the <U+017F>ea of its being that ve<U+017F><U+017F>el
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97242:62"/>
wherein were the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, order had been taken, that neither
they nor any belonging to them, <U+017F>hould at any time appear upon
the deck.</p>
                     <p>With this precaution, and the<U+017F>e favourable circum<U+017F>tances, <hi>Artaxus,</hi>
not conceiving him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecure, would needs have been gone thence
at that in<U+017F>tant, when a wind, contrary to his de<U+017F>ignes, and con<U+017F>onant
to the wi<U+017F>hes of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es ri<U+017F>es at the <U+017F>ame time; but a wind
<U+017F>o contrary to the cour<U+017F>e they were to take, that it was thought
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to get out of the river, while it blew with the <U+017F>ame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
it had begun, nay there was <U+017F>ome fear, that if they went out
of the place where they were, wherever they had ca<U+017F>t anchor,
it could not be <U+017F>o private as the other. The King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>perated
at this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ailed at the gods and fortune for this misfortune,
but after he had tormented him<U+017F>elf for <U+017F>ome time to no purpo<U+017F>e,
he was forced to give way, and to <U+017F>uffer the remainder of the day
and the night following to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away in expectation of a change.
In the mean time he was retired into a little chamber which they
made a <U+017F>hift to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e him up in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, where he thought fit to
take his re<U+017F>t for <U+017F>ome time and have his wounds dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed.</p>

                        <hi>The two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es had <U+017F>oon notice of this favourable change
of the wind, by</hi> Camilla, <hi>who had heard it from</hi> Megacles, <hi>and this
wench, who was indeed very much e<U+017F>teemed by her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e as
well for her vertue, as her many excellent qualities, after <U+017F>he had
told them the news with a countenance full of joy and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi>
Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> let us not de<U+017F>paire of Heavens
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and <U+017F>ince it begins to declare it <U+017F>elf for us, let us believe
that its a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance will prove ab<U+017F>elute and effectuall, and that it will
never for<U+017F>ake <U+017F>uch great and vertuous Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es in <U+017F>uch a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as you are in. I am very much inclined to hope it, <hi>my dear
wench,</hi> replies the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and we ought to joyne our prayers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be<U+017F>eech the gods to direct tho<U+017F>e to the place where we are, who
in all probability run up and down to our re<U+017F>cue. There is no doubt
to be made, <hi>added the fair Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> but that <hi>Alexander</hi> will <U+017F>earch
the World over in our pur<U+017F>uit; but he goes far enough to find us
while we are <U+017F>o neer the place where he lo<U+017F>t us; tis <U+017F>o much the more
our unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>es, and it will never be believed that tho<U+017F>e who carryed
us away <U+017F>hould make a <U+017F>tay at the gates of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I am of your
mind, <hi>replies Cleopatra,</hi> but the<U+017F>e reflexions availe us nothing,
and all that lies upon us to do, is, to expect with patience what

                     <p>While they were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing thus in their Chamber, <hi>Artaxas</hi>
kept <U+017F>ilence in his, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it were when that from his bed he gave
orders for his voyage. <hi>Megacles</hi> gave him an account of that
admirable unknown per<U+017F>on whom he had relieved, and had di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97242:62"/>
                        <hi>Megacles</hi> told him, that he was too weak and too much ca<U+017F>t down
to be brought before him, in a time that he <U+017F>hunned the light,
and hated life it <U+017F>elf, he re<U+017F>olved to give him a vi<U+017F>it in the place
where he was, after he had taken an houres re<U+017F>t on his
bed.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he employed, when he <U+017F>ees coming in to him, <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus,</hi>

fierce and <U+017F>avage countenances, and, in the head of them, he who
<U+017F>eemed to be their chief, and had as little kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e in his looks as
any of them, though he were very pale, and <U+017F>eemed to have laien
in lately of <U+017F>ome great <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e. The King at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight could not
call the man to mind, not onely by rea<U+017F>on of the alteration wrought
in him by his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as the change which ten or twelve years
had made in his countenance, it being <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince he had <U+017F>een

I have met him, and known him again by a very <U+017F>trange chance, and
in regard that I knew your Maje<U+017F>ty hath had a great e<U+017F>teem for him,

you are now in, I thought <U+017F>it to bring him along with me, out of a

him of his joy to <U+017F>ee him again, and of his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances as far as he
were able, upon what account <U+017F>oever he might de<U+017F>ire them. <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
returned him thanks with much re<U+017F>pect, and proffered to

the main <U+017F>ea, as in that where we now are. I was, not many
dayes <U+017F>ince, the riche<U+017F>t of all the Pirates, and had gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riches enough, to forget all re<U+017F>entment for what had been
taken away from me to be<U+017F>tow on <hi>Herod;</hi> but Fortune hath
ea<U+017F>ed me of a great part of them. The late tempe<U+017F>t, which lay
<U+017F>o heavy on this <U+017F>ea, di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome part of my <U+017F>hips, the re<U+017F>t
have been taken by the Praetor of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as I have received my
<U+017F>elf upon this coa<U+017F>t, a thru<U+017F>t through the body, which left little
hopes of life behind it, and yet I have with much ado recovered
it, and by a miraculous a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance am brought into the condition
wherein you now <U+017F>ee me.</q> 
                        <q>What you tell me, <hi>replyed the King of
Armenia,</hi> I am not onely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, but much troubled at, and
if ever we come into <hi>Armenia</hi> again, I will furni<U+017F>h you with tho<U+017F>e

to the po<U+017F>ture it was in before. But in regard I have heard
a many <U+017F>trange and wonderful things of you, and that without
any order or dependence, I <U+017F>hould be very glad to under<U+017F>tand
from your <U+017F>elf the accidents of your life, <U+017F>uch as are of greate<U+017F>t
con<U+017F>equence as may be<U+017F>t <U+017F>uit with a <U+017F>hort di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, if it may
be done without any inconvenience to you.</q> 
                        <q>I <U+017F>hall be no le<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>atisfied, my Lord, <hi>replyed Zenodorus,</hi> to give your Maje<U+017F>ty
that demon<U+017F>tration of my obedience and re<U+017F>pects, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
the palene<U+017F><U+017F>e which is <U+017F>o vi<U+017F>ible in my face, and proceeds
meerly from the great quantity of bloud which I have lo<U+017F>t, I feel
no inconvenience that <U+017F>hall hinder me from giving you a relation
of my adventures, which were not haply worth your Maje<U+017F>ty's
attention, were it not for one accident, which, being very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
hath accordingly made no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e in the World.</q>
With the<U+017F>e words he came <U+017F>omewhat neerer the bed, and <U+017F>ate in

HISTORY
Of the Pirate
ZENODORUS.</head>
                        <p>I Shall not be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>-ingenious as to deny, that in the life I
have led for the<U+017F>e eight or ten years, I have been forced
to do many actions full of impiety, inju<U+017F>tice, and cruelty;
that I have violated all manner of laws, and committed
all manner of crimes: nay, that by the con<U+017F>tant practi<U+017F>e of
them, I have contracted <U+017F>uch a habit of evil, as I <U+017F>hall
haply find it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to reform my <U+017F>elf of. But I would
withall, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, gladly per<U+017F>wade your Maje<U+017F>ty, that a great
part of the mi<U+017F>chievous inclinations which are grown <U+017F>o powerful
within me, are rather the con<U+017F>equences of my cro<U+017F><U+017F>e Fortune
than the effects of my own nature, and that, if the misfortunes
that have happened to me <U+017F>ince my departure from <hi>Armenia</hi> had
not exa<U+017F>perated my di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and corrupted my manners, I
<U+017F>hould, as I had been born with great inclinations to vertue, have
continued in the <U+017F>ame e<U+017F>teem and reputation that I was in when
your Maje<U+017F>ty was plea<U+017F>ed to honour me with more than ordinary
favours and kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es. I <U+017F>hall contract the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as much as I can, as well becau<U+017F>e I am unwilling to abu<U+017F>e
your attention, as that con<U+017F>idering the condition your Maje<U+017F>tie is
in, it were very un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable for me to <U+017F>pin out any over-teadious
relation.</p>
                        <p>Your Maje<U+017F>ty hath hertofore under<U+017F>tood that I was born in the
Frontieres of <hi>Judaea,</hi> where the Fortunes of my Father were <U+017F>uch,
that through the affluence thereof he had the means to purcha<U+017F>e
the e<U+017F>tate of <hi>Li<U+017F>anias,</hi> which was a <U+017F>mal portion of that Country
endued with <U+017F>overaign power, and without appeal to any other
Monark than the Emperour. <hi>Li<U+017F>anias</hi> had po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed it as <U+017F>uch for a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97242:64"/>
long time; but at la<U+017F>t, having, for certain weighty con<U+017F>iderations,
exchanged it for <U+017F>ome other e<U+017F>tate which my Father had, and
<U+017F>ome monies he had gotten together in the <U+017F>everal employments
he had gone through in the wars, my Father became the peaceable
Lord of it, and I by that means came into a rank which rendred
me the more con<U+017F>iderable among my neighbours. I <U+017F>pent the fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>allyes of my youth in the Armies, and through the natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
I ever had to the wars, I gained therein <U+017F>ome reputation.
I was in that of <hi>Anthony</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>the Parthians;</hi> and being meerly
a Souldier of Fortune, and not minding Factions, I followed the
children of <hi>Pompey,</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and among other <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
I was at that famous <U+017F>ea-fight that happened between <hi>Menas</hi>
and <hi>Menecrates.</hi> That war receiving a Period by the ruine of
young <hi>Pompey,</hi> I <U+017F>ought out new emploiments el<U+017F>ewhere, vi<U+017F>ited the
Courts of divers Kings, and at la<U+017F>t came to yours. You were then but
about 15 or 16 years of age, and it was not long after the taking
of the King your Father. He honoured me very much with his
kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es; but he being <U+017F>hortly after taken by <hi>Anthony,</hi> I had, in
tho<U+017F>e attempts which, young as you then were, you made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his liberty, and afterwards to revenge his death, the honour
to follow you, in a very con<U+017F>iderable employment in your Cavalry;
and I was <U+017F>o happy as to have it from your own mouth, that you
were <U+017F>atisfied with my <U+017F>ervices, and accordingly received tho<U+017F>e
pre<U+017F>ents, and acknowledgement from your liberality which I have
had rea<U+017F>on to celebrate ever <U+017F>ince.</p>
                        <p>But be<U+017F>ides the inclinations I immediately conceived for a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and a grateful Prince which engaged my <U+017F>tay in your Court
longer than in all the re<U+017F>t, another thing that detained me there
was the beauty of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena.</hi> I <U+017F>hall not need tell your Maje<U+017F>ty,
who remembers it well, as having <U+017F>een her, that that Lady was one
of the greate<U+017F>t ornaments of your Court, that by her birth <U+017F>he was
one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, and that in point of beauty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ert,
there was none comparable to her. A man cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any thing more amiable or more excellent than her face, but
the advantages of her mind were no le<U+017F><U+017F>e admirable, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of her vertue was generally known through the whole
Court of <hi>Armenia.</hi> Thou<U+017F>ands of per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ighed for that beauty,
of which number, I had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een her, but I became one.
My love encrea<U+017F>ed from day to day, till at la<U+017F>t, that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion became
as violent in my <U+017F>oul, as ever it had been in any, though the mo<U+017F>t
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by it. I entertained her with all the demon<U+017F>trations I
could of it, with re<U+017F>pect, earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e and a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity; but <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be little moved thereat, and di<U+017F>covered very little re<U+017F>entment
for all tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of love which <U+017F>he received from all the
re<U+017F>t who made their addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her. She was endued with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which nothing could <U+017F>hake, and was <U+017F>ubject to a mode<U+017F>t kind
of <U+017F>everiry, which was proof again<U+017F>t all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Her inflexibility
at that time drew dayly complaints from my mouth, and <U+017F>ighs from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97242:64"/>
my brea<U+017F>t; but if I was troubled at the <U+017F>mall <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e of my
own <U+017F>ufferings, I had <U+017F>till this comfort left me, that the Fortune of
my Rivals was in no better a po<U+017F>ture than my own, and that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>eemed not to incline to any choice, other than that which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
be advi<U+017F>ed to by tho<U+017F>e to whom <U+017F>he ought her birth.</p>
                        <p>But, to be <U+017F>hort, my Lord, (why <U+017F>hould I abu<U+017F>e your patience,
by acquainting you with things that you know?) your Maje<U+017F>ty
was plea<U+017F>ed to employ your authority on my behalf, you <U+017F>poke
your <U+017F>elf for me both to <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> and her Friends. In<U+017F>omuch, that
about the <U+017F>ame time, news being come that my Father was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this life, and that I was ab<U+017F>olute Lord of that little e<U+017F>tate
which he had dyed po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of as a <U+017F>overaign Prince, your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ty
was plea<U+017F>ed to further my intere<U+017F>ts, made appear the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of my allyance, and, to the confu<U+017F>ion of all my Rivalls,
though they were your own <U+017F>ubjects, I carryed away the fair <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ena</hi>
and married her. The Nuptials were <U+017F>olemnly celebrated in
<hi>Artaxata,</hi> and I had gotten into my po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion that beauty for
whom I had <U+017F>uffered <U+017F>o much, and in the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion whereof I
found much more <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e than I had imagined to my <U+017F>elf.
Ala<U+017F><U+017F>e! can I reflect on the<U+017F>e things without dying, and, though
my mind be grown brawny by rea<U+017F>on of the accidents I have run
through, and the barbarous employments wherein I have <U+017F>pent
my life, Can I re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>entment they <U+017F>hould produce in me?
I became po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> and with her of all the excellencies
both of body and mind, that can be wi<U+017F>hed in one <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on.
Nay, what is contrarie to what ordinarilie happens, the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
encrea<U+017F>ed my love, and through the more particular knowledge
that I had of my <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> I di<U+017F>covered a many excellent qualities
which I had not ob<U+017F>erved before in their full lu<U+017F>tre. After I had
made <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tay in <hi>Armenia,</hi> I took leave of your Maje<U+017F>ty, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and carryed away my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> that <U+017F>he might take
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion with me of that little e<U+017F>tate which my Father had left
behind him. I was there received as their <U+017F>overaign, and began to
lead the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant and delightful life that could be imagined.
Thus far, my Lord, hath my life been known to you, thus far was
it innocent.</p>
                        <p>Now may your Maje<U+017F>ty be plea<U+017F>ed to under<U+017F>tand what hath
happened to me <U+017F>ince, and to have <U+017F>o much goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e for me as to
charge my adver<U+017F>e Fortune with <U+017F>ome part of my crimes. In my
little retirement with my <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> I knew not what meant the lea<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>turbance from abroad, and enjoyed all imaginable felicity at
home. My government, though of no great extent, was <U+017F>uch as
I was content with, and though it were envyed by <hi>Herod,</hi> who was
too powerful a neighbour for me, yet with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <U+017F>ome others, I could make a <U+017F>hift to maintain my own,
the love I had for <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> having had <U+017F>uch an influeuce over me,
that I had given over all thoughts of the wars, to which I had
before <U+017F>acrificed all my inclinations. My amiable <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> though
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97242:65"/>
<U+017F>he had marryed me purelie out of the compliance <U+017F>he had for the
commands of her Friends, yet had ever after <U+017F>o much accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
her affections to her dutie, that <U+017F>he had an extraordinary
love for me, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was cenvinced that <U+017F>he ought to love me.
Accordingly might it in a manner be <U+017F>aid that we were in<U+017F>eparable,
for that at all hours of the day, whether we <U+017F>tayed in the chamber,
or went a walking, or a hunting, whither I carryed her <U+017F>ometimes,
and in all manner of diverti<U+017F>ements, <hi>Zenodorus</hi> was never <U+017F>een
without his <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena.</hi> Heaven it <U+017F>elf, I fear me, envyed our felicity:
or, it may be, I was not born for that plea<U+017F>ant kind of life, and
tho<U+017F>e who know me at this day, would find it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to
imagine, I could ever <U+017F>pend my time as I did then.</p>
                        <p>The fir<U+017F>t year of our marriage was not yet run about, when,
among tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons whereof our little Court con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, I took
notice of a young man latelie come thither, for <U+017F>anctuary, as he
<U+017F>aid him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>elf, again<U+017F>t certain enemies that were more powerful than
him<U+017F>elf, who had forced him to leave tho<U+017F>e places where he was
born, and who, having been very courteou<U+017F>ly entertained among
us, <U+017F>et up his <U+017F>taff there. He was called <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and this I may
truely <U+017F>ay of him, that of all the men I ever met with, I never <U+017F>aw
a hand<U+017F>omer, or a more gentile per<U+017F>on, in all his actions, nor a more
amiable in all that appeared outwardly of him. Suitably to the<U+017F>e
good endowments, he immediately in<U+017F>inuated him<U+017F>elf into the
affections of all the World, in <U+017F>o much, that there was no diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ement
appointed between per<U+017F>ons of either <U+017F>ex, but the amiable
<hi>Cleontes</hi> was invited thereto. All the World courted him, all the
World <U+017F>poke well of him, and all the World were extreamly de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to oblige him. He very plea<U+017F>antly received tho<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e and friend<U+017F>hip which were rendred him: and
though he <U+017F>eemed not to be above eighteen years of age, yet did
he di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>uch prudence and conduct in his behaviour, as is <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in per<U+017F>ons of a far greater age. Yet was this particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
in him, that, <U+017F>lighting ordinary per<U+017F>ons, nay indeed many
Ladies, by whom he was not a little courted, he enjoyed him<U+017F>elf
in no other conver<U+017F>ation, but that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> whom he accordingly
honoured with his con<U+017F>tant attendance. In <U+017F>o much that at la<U+017F>t
he got a haunt of vi<U+017F>iting her <U+017F>o often, that he was in a manner
perpetually in her company. And whereas it was none of the mo<U+017F>t
incon<U+017F>iderable perfections of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> that <U+017F>he was admirable in
matter of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and that <hi>Cleontes</hi> was infinitely plea<U+017F>ant in that
kind al<U+017F>o, they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the be<U+017F>t part of their time away with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of mutual <U+017F>atisfaction. Among all the re<U+017F>t that perceived it,
I took notice my <U+017F>elf of the great kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e and familiarity that
was between them, but at the fir<U+017F>t looked on it without the lea<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>turbance, and out of the extraordinary opinion which I had
of the vertue of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> I not onely harboured not the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of them, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the complyances, <U+017F>ervices, and

without the lea<U+017F>t worm of jealou<U+017F>ie, that <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> looked very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
on him, and di<U+017F><U+017F>embled not the plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he took in his
company beyond what <U+017F>he did in that of divers other per<U+017F>on that
came to <U+017F>ee her.</p>
                        <p>Several moneths were pa<U+017F>t and gone in this manner, before ever
I conceived the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of the demon<U+017F>trations of friend<U+017F>hip
that pa<U+017F>t between them; and though I was indeed of opinion that
their familiarity was greater than there ought to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a per<U+017F>on of the quality of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> and a man of the age
and beauty of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> yet did I attribute their weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es to
their youth, and the friend<U+017F>hip which <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> naturallie had for
per<U+017F>ons of good plea<U+017F>ant wits. In a word, their manner of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
made greater impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions on other mens minds then it did on
mine, and among the many per<U+017F>ons that conceived an ill opinion
thereat, there happened to be <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F>creet enough to act the
part of the unlucky crow, and to bring me the tidings of my own
unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e. One above all, a per<U+017F>on I very much credited,
egged on by an imprudent zeal, came to me on a day, and pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not without <U+017F>ome difficulty, as I could perceive, for words
wherein to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions the more mode<U+017F>tly; <hi>My Lord,</hi>

you tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>coveries of their fidelity which they cannot do without
regret and violence to them<U+017F>elves? Or are you re<U+017F>olved not to open
your eyes to <U+017F>ee what is done again<U+017F>t you, while it is yet in your
power to remedy things by mild and gentle cour<U+017F>es, and that evils are

                        </p>
                        <p>This was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of that indi<U+017F>creet per<U+017F>on, which yet had
this effect upon me, that I could not have been more ca<U+017F>t down,
had I received a mortal wound. However I did what I could to
<U+017F>mother the re<U+017F>entment I conceived at his words, and thought it
enough to tell the men, that we ought not to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e our judgement
<U+017F>o lightly of a thing that might be innocent; that I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena's</hi> vertue, and if, through the pardonable eruptions
of youth, <U+017F>he had been too familiar with, and too liberal of her
company to <hi>Cleontes,</hi> I could not thence <U+017F>afely infer it proceeded
out of any unju<U+017F>tifiable de<U+017F>ign or intention. This I <U+017F>poke to him
with a countenance wherein yet he might have ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome
part of the effect of his own di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and, having di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed my
intelligencer, I would be the more at liberty to make reflections
on the knowledg he had given me of my own misfortune. It began
to magnify in <U+017F>uch maner to my apprehen<U+017F>ion, that my <U+017F>oul for <U+017F>ome
minutes was as it were in a tempe<U+017F>t, and my mind over-ca<U+017F>t with
<U+017F>uch clouds as darkened all its former light, the better to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
it to receive melancholy and fatal impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. All that before had
<U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o innocent to me, pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf now to my thoughts
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97242:66"/>
under another form, and calling to mind all the occa<U+017F>ions upon
which I had ob<U+017F>erved too great familiarity between <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> and
<hi>Cleontes,:</hi> I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at my own blindne<U+017F><U+017F>e or rather inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and upon that came to my memory a hundred circum<U+017F>tances
which I condemned all as criminal. O ye gods, how did this fatal
di<U+017F>covery eat into my heart, to make a place there for the greate<U+017F>t
grief it could be capable of! And what deplorable effects did that
<U+017F>elf-tormenting pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion immediately produce there? This black
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion wrought a kind of Metamorpho<U+017F>is in me, in<U+017F>omuch that
I was become quite another man than what I was <U+017F>ome daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Being thus convinced of my want of circum<U+017F>pection, and
con<U+017F>equently of any misfortune, I railed at Fortune, I quarrelled
with heaven, and I took any occa<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>cover my affliction. <hi>Is
it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>that one that is <U+017F>o dear to my heart, this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

all vertuous inclinations, and lo<U+017F>t all the affection <U+017F>he had promi<U+017F>ed

what re<U+017F>olutions would you have me to take? Shall I ever be able to

                        </p>
                        <p>Many dayes did I <U+017F>pend in the<U+017F>e reflections and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, while
in the mean time my countenance began to change with my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and the alteration that happened, there, was <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>ervable,
that all the World took notice of it. <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> was one of the fir<U+017F>t
that ob<U+017F>erved it, and by all demon<U+017F>trations and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of love
took occa<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>cover the grief <U+017F>he conceived thereat; but her
carriage towards <hi>Cleontes</hi> was <U+017F>till after the old rate. And whereas
my eies were now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> much more open than they were before, and
di<U+017F>cerned all things after another manner then I had done in times
pa<U+017F>t, methought, I could perceive in all her actions, <U+017F>o much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and <U+017F>o much love for <hi>Cleontes,</hi> that I made it no more a
que<U+017F>tion, but that I was as unfortunate as I had imagined my <U+017F>elf.
I <U+017F>aw the whole day in a manner was little enough for them to <U+017F>pend
together; they had ever and anon <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret or other to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97242:66"/>
one to another, and when they were at too great a di<U+017F>tance
to <U+017F>peak one to another, they di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed by their eies, and ca<U+017F>t
looks at one another that were more eloquent than any thing of
conver<U+017F>ation, and this to the ob<U+017F>ervation of all the World as well
as my <U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>This alteration <U+017F>eemed very <U+017F>trange, in<U+017F>omuch that all tho<U+017F>e
that had known <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> a little before could not without an exce<U+017F>s
of a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, make any compari<U+017F>on between the<U+017F>e <U+017F>allies of
lightne<U+017F><U+017F>e and liberty and her former re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e and mode<U+017F>ty.
True it is neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e, that notwith<U+017F>tanding all tho<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of affection that pa<U+017F>t between her and <hi>Cleontes,</hi> her carriage
towards me was as it had been ever before, and I could never por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
either from her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e or her countenance, that there was
any abatement or remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion in her love towards me, or that <U+017F>he was
le<U+017F><U+017F>e taken with my per<U+017F>on then at the fir<U+017F>t hour of our marriage.
Her care<U+017F><U+017F>es, and her in<U+017F>inuations were <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke
with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and acted with the <U+017F>ame complyance,
<U+017F>ave that <U+017F>he did it not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly as in times pa<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>he left
me often to go and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and be<U+017F>towed on his
entertainment the be<U+017F>t part of tho<U+017F>e houres which <U+017F>he had before
onely devoted to mine. At la<U+017F>t, my grief was <U+017F>econded and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
by my re<U+017F>entment of tho<U+017F>e things, and after I had been a
long time <U+017F>ad and melancholy, I became at length exa<U+017F>perated,
and <U+017F>tudying how to be revenged of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> I began to di<U+017F>cover
to <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> how that her care<U+017F><U+017F>es had not over me that influence
they were wont to have, that I looked on them as the pure effects
of artifice and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and that I felt my <U+017F>oul changed from
the love I <U+017F>ometime had for her, to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that was mo<U+017F>t
contrary thereto. I gave over looking kindly on her, I
took a bed by my <U+017F>elf, and by degrees forbore all di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with her.</p>
                        <p>She <U+017F>eemed to be as much troubled at this alteration as the mo<U+017F>t
affectionate woman in the World could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be, and gave me
all the demon<U+017F>trations of a grief as violent as any <U+017F>oul can be able
to endure. She u<U+017F>ed all the in<U+017F>inuation that could be, <U+017F>he melted
into tears, and omitted nothing, which <U+017F>he could imagine might
per<U+017F>wade me that <U+017F>he was really moved. In <U+017F>ome intervals, I was
extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of her affliction, and tho<U+017F>e
imperious remainders of love that were yet left in my <U+017F>oul did
partly produce therein the effect <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired; but a little after,
through the cruel prejudice that had taken root there, all was
da<U+017F>hed out again, and I had no more regard to what <U+017F>he did then,
as if it had been meer per<U+017F>onation and <U+017F>ycophancy. At la<U+017F>t, after
a many dayes <U+017F>ilence, <U+017F>he would needs force me to <U+017F>peak, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found me all alone in my chamber, whither I was often wont
to retire <U+017F>ince the change of my humour, <U+017F>he runs to me with her
face bathed in tears, and gra<U+017F>ping my both hands, with an action
full of earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; <q>Ah, my deare<U+017F>t Hu<U+017F>band, <hi><U+017F>aid

you would make be believe, you would not have utterly ruined
it by your own cruel incon<U+017F>tancy. Tis enough for me to be
mi<U+017F>erable, and not that you <U+017F>hould aggravate my mi<U+017F>ery by
your di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and you ought to be <U+017F>atisfied with what

not make any an<U+017F>wer thereto till that <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>ilent a good
while, with an action that di<U+017F>covered her uncertainty, and lo<U+017F><U+017F>e
of re<U+017F>olution. At length, lifting up her eies, which <U+017F>he had all the
time before fa<U+017F>tened on the ground, and directing them on me with
a countenance much more <U+017F>etled and <U+017F>erene than before: <q>My
Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> when I recollect my <U+017F>elf, and call to mind
things that are now pa<U+017F>t, I much acknowledge, that there hath
been <U+017F>ome want of prudence in my carriage, and if I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any fault, no que<U+017F>tion but it hath been out of the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e
of confidence which I have had in your love. I cannot deny but
I have entertained <hi>Cleontes</hi> with very great demon<U+017F>trations of a
particular e<U+017F>teem, nay, I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I have <U+017F>till abundance of
re<U+017F>pects for him, as well upon the account of his own worth, as
for other rea<U+017F>ons which oblige me thereto, and which I <U+017F>hall
acquaint you with, when you <U+017F>hall give me leave to do it: but
I call all the gods witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my innocence, and de<U+017F>ire them
to <U+017F>end me <U+017F>ome exemplary death before your face, if ever I
have injured you as much as in the lea<U+017F>t thought, or ever di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Cleontes</hi> any de<U+017F>ign or intention that you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.
I freely give you leave to take away my life, if in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e
of time you find not my words true, and will accordingly
be <U+017F>orry for the injury you have done me. In the interim, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you to re<U+017F>tore me to your affection, the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e whereof is
much more in<U+017F>upportable to me then would be that of my life.
And <U+017F>ince you have not taken it away from me but upon unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
apparences, which rather argue my imprudence than bad
intentions, I <U+017F>hall make <U+017F>uch provi<U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t the like for
the future, that you <U+017F>hall not have the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> but uttered with <U+017F>o much
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance and <U+017F>erenity, that I began to be per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he might be
innocent; whereupon that love whereof there were <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome
remainders in my heart <U+017F>peaking to me on her behalf, with as much
force as her words, di<U+017F>pelled by little and little <U+017F>ome part of my
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picions, and if it could not ab<U+017F>olutely clear them, and make it
a bright day in my mind, it did at lea<U+017F>t put me into <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture,
as that I was willing to hearken to what it <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted to me for her
advantage, and to expect her ju<U+017F>tification from time, in <U+017F>tead of
condemning her from what was pa<U+017F>t. I immediately acquainted
her with all the tran<U+017F>actions that pa<U+017F>t in my <U+017F>oul, promi<U+017F>ing, that
in ca<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould find her as innocent as <U+017F>he would par<U+017F>wade me <U+017F>he
was, I <U+017F>hould love her with the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that I had ever had
for her, and <U+017F>he entertained that promi<U+017F>e and a<U+017F><U+017F>urance with <U+017F>uch
demon<U+017F>trations of joy, that I could not at that time <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her
guilty of any artifice.</p>
                        <p>From that day <U+017F>he began to live after another rate with <hi>Cleontes,</hi>
that is, with much more re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e and di<U+017F>tance than formerly;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97242:68"/>
<U+017F>he forbore all <U+017F>ecret meetings, and private di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es with him,
and entertained him no otherwi<U+017F>e than as civility required, that
<U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on as <hi>Cleontes</hi> <U+017F>hould be. This alteration occa<U+017F>ioned a
change in my humour, and I began to recover the re<U+017F>t I had a long
time wanted, and was convinced that <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> having been a little
extravagant through the imprudent <U+017F>allies of youth, had by the
<U+017F>trength of her own vertue and good advice recovered her <U+017F>elf.
I al<U+017F>o, for my part, carryed my <U+017F>elf towards her as I had done
formerly, and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my love to her with the <U+017F>ame earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
as I had done before my mind became di<U+017F>ordered by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>y.</p>
                        <p>This la<U+017F>ted for <U+017F>ome months, during which time we lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with as much delight as can be imagined: but not long after,
the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on who had made the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery to me, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to tell me of certain kind and amorous looks, and other
circum<U+017F>tances whence he concluded there was a <U+017F>ecret intelligence
between <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> and <hi>Cleontes.</hi> Now my di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition being before
prepared for impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this nature, I entertained them much
more ea<U+017F>ily then at the fir<U+017F>t time, and ob<U+017F>erving my <U+017F>elf, that
there was a certain violence in that re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> I
fell into my former humour, and that <U+017F>o violently, that I was
likely enough to fa<U+017F>ten on any de<U+017F>perate re<U+017F>olution.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the alteration <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon took notice
of in my countenance, and would know the rea<U+017F>on of it, I an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her with nothing but bloudy reproaches, and the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I
was then po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with, furni<U+017F>hed me with all the words I could
de<U+017F>ire upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion. <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> heard them with much
patience, and at la<U+017F>t, when I had given over <U+017F>peaking, joyning
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with abundance of re<U+017F>olution, but a re<U+017F>oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ful of mode<U+017F>ty, and the demon<U+017F>trations of that confidence which
is ever the attendant of innocency: <q>My Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> I
thought I had reduced my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>uch a behaviour towards
<hi>Cleontes</hi> as you expected, and was of opinion, that I had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him no otherwi<U+017F>e then I ought in pure civility to do. But
<U+017F>ince I have been <U+017F>o unhappy, either through my ill fortune, or
my imprudence, there is now no di<U+017F>pute to be made of it, but
the occa<U+017F>ion mu<U+017F>t be removed, for the corre<U+017F>pondence which is
between <hi>Cleontes</hi> and me, is not of <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>equence, as that we
<U+017F>hould thereby purcha<U+017F>e the danger and inconveniences which
are the effects thereof. I <U+017F>hall not therefore tell you that I will
not <U+017F>ee <hi>Cleontes</hi> any more, or that I will never <U+017F>peak to him
again. No, this is not <U+017F>ecurity enough for you, while <hi>Cleontes</hi>
<U+017F>hall continue in your territories; no, he mu<U+017F>t not tread your
ground; and though it <U+017F>peaks a certain barbarou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
to force away a per<U+017F>on from the place where he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<U+017F>anctuary again<U+017F>t a malicious fortune, yet is not it con<U+017F>iderable
in compari<U+017F>on of the mi<U+017F>chiefes which his abode here hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
or hereafter, may occa<U+017F>ion. I will therefore take it upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97242:68"/>
me to <U+017F>end him hence <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>hall never return again, and
after the term that you <U+017F>hall appoint for his departure is
expired, I promi<U+017F>e you that neither you nor I <U+017F>hall ever <U+017F>ee him
more.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The<U+017F>e words of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> gave me <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, though I
think <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>ome violence when <U+017F>he made that propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me, and <U+017F>o, re<U+017F>olved to grant it her. <q>Well Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid I
to her,</hi> if you expect that you and I <U+017F>hould live together in any
quiet, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that <hi>Cleontes</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ent away. His
longer abode here may haply involve us into <U+017F>ome misfortunes
which we <U+017F>hall do well to avoid, when it lies in our own power
to do it; and therefore I <U+017F>hall intreat you to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e him to
leave us within eight dayes, that is the longe<U+017F>t day I can afford
him to provide for his departure, and to find out <U+017F>ome other
place for his refuge, and that time once expired, I be<U+017F>eech you
let <U+017F>uch order be taken that he may never be <U+017F>een in our domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
again.</q> 
                           <q>I promi<U+017F>e you to do it, <hi>replies Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> and I <U+017F>hall take
occa<U+017F>ion this very day to acquaint him therewith, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
what I can to have things <U+017F>o carryed, as not to rai<U+017F>e among
our neighbours any <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of the true cau<U+017F>e of his departure.</q>
With tho<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he went away and left me, but as <U+017F>he took
leave, <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much affliction in her eies, that it was ea<U+017F>ie
for me to judge, through the con<U+017F>tancy which <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it was not without a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible regret that <U+017F>he was induced
to di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e with the company of <hi>Cleontes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day I <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>peaking together, and I perceived they
were very earne<U+017F>t in their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and, in their ge<U+017F>tures and
looks, di<U+017F>covered much <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e. But conceiving all to be in order
to his departure, I bore with their conver<U+017F>ation, at that time, as
al<U+017F>o what they had in my pre<U+017F>ence the day following, during which
time <hi>Cleontes</hi> took leave of his friends, alledging certain rea<U+017F>ons
to them for his <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden leaving of them. The <U+017F>eventh day,
which was ju<U+017F>t that day before his departure, guided by <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
genius, and my own malicious fortune together, I would
needs take a walk in my Garden. And being de<U+017F>irous of <U+017F>olitude,
and at that very time reflecting on the uncertainty I was in as to
what I <U+017F>hould believe of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> finding appearances of all <U+017F>ides,
as well to demon<U+017F>trate her affection to me, as to <U+017F>atisfie me of her
infidelity, I went a<U+017F>ide from tho<U+017F>e that followed me, and leaving
them <U+017F>ome in one of the faire<U+017F>t knots of the Garden, and others
in the more <U+017F>pacious walks, I went into tho<U+017F>e that were mo<U+017F>t private
and <U+017F>olitary, and <U+017F>o continued my walk in the mo<U+017F>t remote parts of
the Garden. At the furthe<U+017F>t end of the Knot, before mentioned, there
is a little hand<U+017F>ome Grove, and in divers places of the Grove,
Arbours made of the boughs of trees pla<U+017F>hed together. Coming
neer that which lies at the greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tance, I heard the noi<U+017F>e of
<U+017F>ome people talking, and going forward <U+017F>till to come yet <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neerer, and li<U+017F>tening with much attention, I could di<U+017F>cern the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97242:69"/>
voice of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena.</hi> The privacy of the place bred a little worm in
my braine, and I immediately <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected there might be <U+017F>ome
unhand<U+017F>ome action committed; and not willing to let <U+017F>lip an
opportunity; <U+017F>o favourable for the di<U+017F>covery of the truth, I
crept <U+017F>oftly between the trees, and coming neer the Arbour with
<U+017F>o little noi<U+017F>e that I was not heard, I put my head clo<U+017F>e to the
branches whereof it was made, and finding an ea<U+017F>ie pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for
my <U+017F>ight, I pre<U+017F>ently perceived all that was done in the Arbour.
O ye gods, what a <U+017F>pectacle, with what object were my eies
unhappily <U+017F>mitten with! I <U+017F>aw, my Lord, <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t rip up
the<U+017F>e dolefull pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of my life, I <U+017F>aw <hi>Cleontes</hi> <U+017F>et upon a
little table that <U+017F>tood in the midle of the Arbour, holding
<hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> <U+017F>tanding between his legges, compa<U+017F><U+017F>ing her with his
armes, while he was as amorou<U+017F>ly embraced by tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi>
and at the <U+017F>ame time both giving and receiving thou<U+017F>ands of
ki<U+017F><U+017F>es from him. Sighs, tears, and bemoaning expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were
the burthen of their care<U+017F><U+017F>es, and reciprocally wiping off one
anothers tears, they reiterated their ki<U+017F><U+017F>es with <U+017F>o much love,
that a per<U+017F>on the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject of any in the World to <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion,
could never have been per<U+017F>waded but that there might be yet a
further familiarity between per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate. For my part,
I made not the lea<U+017F>t que<U+017F>tion of it, and from that fatall <U+017F>pecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
concluding my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e undeniable, I gave way to the
rage then gaining ground upon me, and <U+017F>tayed not a moment to
con<U+017F>ult upon the re<U+017F>olution I was to take to revenge my injured
love, and to repair the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my honour. I <U+017F>eldom went any
where without my <U+017F>word, and as ill fortune would have it, I had
it it then about me. I drew it, tran<U+017F>ported with fury, and running
to one of the doors of the Arbour with <U+017F>o much ha<U+017F>t, that tho<U+017F>e
two amorous per<U+017F>ons had hardly the time to break off their ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing;
<hi>You mu<U+017F>t dye, ba<U+017F>e perfidious wretches,</hi> cryed I, <hi>you mu<U+017F>t dye,</hi> and
putting my fury in execution upon the fir<U+017F>t object that offered it
<U+017F>elf, it fell upon the fir<U+017F>t object that offered it <U+017F>elf, it fell upon the
unfortunate <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> whom running with my <U+017F>word in at the
brea<U+017F>t, there needed not much <U+017F>trength to force it in up to the hilts.
<hi>Cleontes</hi> had the time to get out at one of the doors of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and had got away as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw me appear with all the
<U+017F>peed he could make: but the unfortunate <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> who <U+017F>tood
neere<U+017F>t to me, receiving the mortal wound, fell down at my feet
in a torrent of bloud; and as <U+017F>he fell, fa<U+017F>tening on my knees, <U+017F>he held
me <U+017F>o that I could not get off from her to run after <hi>Cleontes.</hi> In
the mean time <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> expiring, <U+017F>trove as much as <U+017F>he could to
<U+017F>peak, and with abundance of difficulty made a <U+017F>hift to bring forth
the<U+017F>e words. <q>
                              <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me, <hi>thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>pilt innocent
bloud, which will cry out for vengeance again<U+017F>t thee; but far be it
from me to de<U+017F>ire it of the gods, and I forgive thee my death, which
my own imprudence, and thy want of recollection hath brought me
to: thou wilt find that I have not injured thee, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97242:69"/>
thy <U+017F>elf that thou ha<U+017F>t taken away my life, and medle not with</hi>
Cleontes, <hi>who is.</hi> ...</q> She would have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omewhat el<U+017F>e,
but ere <U+017F>he could bring it out, both voice and life had taken their
leaves of her.</p>
                        <p>This <U+017F>pectacle, you may well imagine was deplorable enough
to move me to <U+017F>ome pitty, and the love which I had formerly had
for <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> whom I <U+017F>aw expiring at my feet, beautiful even in her
palene<U+017F><U+017F>e, and, amid<U+017F>t the very looks of death, as amiable as ever
<U+017F>he had been in her life, mu<U+017F>t in all likelihood force me to <U+017F>ome
compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. But rage and fury being grown predominant over
my <U+017F>oul, and I looking on the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my honour as a thing infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
certain, and from the la<U+017F>t words of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> when <U+017F>he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto me the life of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o indifferent as
to her own, drawing no other conclu<U+017F>ion then that of the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive
love <U+017F>he had for him, my fury derives new <U+017F>trength from that
cruel confirmation, and leaving the body of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> in the hands of
her Women, who were come in at the noi<U+017F>e, out of a place where
they waited hard by, I pur<U+017F>ued <hi>Cleontes,</hi> with the <U+017F>word all
bloudy in my hand, that way that I had <U+017F>een him run away. He
was gotten far enough from me, and I <U+017F>hould have found it no
<U+017F>mall difficulty to overtake him, if at the <U+017F>ame time a noi<U+017F>e had
not been <U+017F>pread about the Garden, that <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> was dead. At
this unhappy news, <hi>Cleontes</hi> <U+017F>tayes, not de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ave his life
after the misfortune which he had been the occa<U+017F>ion of, as I came
into the Knot of the Garden, I <U+017F>aw him coming towards me,
tearing his cloaths, pulling his hair, and filling the place with
his lamentations. In<U+017F>tead of avoiding my <U+017F>word, he would run
upon the point of it, and pre<U+017F>enting his naked brea<U+017F>t to me, he
therein received the mortal thru<U+017F>t which ran him through and
through. After he had gone two or three paces backward <U+017F>tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,
he fell down at the feet of a <hi>Diana</hi> of Alabla<U+017F>ter, which
<U+017F>tood at one of the corners of the Knot, and as he fell embraced
it: <hi>Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e of cha<U+017F>tity,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>receive this life which</hi> I <hi>offer up
up to thee, and if I <U+017F>tain it with my bloud, thou knowe<U+017F>t it is pure
and innocent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There was <U+017F>omething in the<U+017F>e words that <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o mild, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<U+017F>o mournful, that the better part of my fury was thereby abated;
and while a many per<U+017F>ons were running to the place where I
was, the expiring <hi>Cleontes,</hi> turning his eyes from the <U+017F>tatue, and
fa<U+017F>tening them on me: <hi>Barbarous man,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to me, <hi>hope not that
the gods will pardon thee the death of the innocent</hi> Eli<U+017F>ena, <hi>though
I forgive thee mine, and <U+017F>ince I have not life enough left me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thee of her innocence, acknowledge it upon the <U+017F>ight of what
I had never <U+017F>hewn any man, and which thou of all mankind art the
mo<U+017F>t unworthy to <U+017F>ee.</hi> With the<U+017F>e words, contracting together all
the <U+017F>trength he had left, he made a <U+017F>hift to open, or to tear that
which covered his <U+017F>tomack, and by di<U+017F>covering to us a neck and

brea<U+017F>ts, whiter then the Alabla<U+017F>ter which he embraced, ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
us that he was a <hi>Woman.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Artaxus</hi> interrupting <hi>Zenodorus</hi> at this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; <q>Heavens!
<hi>Zenodorus, <U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> what is this that you relate to me,
and what an unfortunate adventure was this of yours? Till
now, though there were things deplorable enough in your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet had I not been moved to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion at any, and I
thought there was <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on in all proceedings, that I
could not bemoane the de<U+017F>tiny of two per<U+017F>ons whom I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
worthy the cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement they received at your hands.
But the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words of your relation having, changed the whole
<U+017F>cene of the adventure, and though there lies no more guilt on
you then there would have done, had it been otherwi<U+017F>e, yet
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e your are <U+017F>o much the more to be pittyed.</q> You
may very well think it, my Lord, replyed <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and with
the <U+017F>ame labour comprehend <U+017F>ome part of what I was not then
able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e. At that <U+017F>ight, that fatal <U+017F>ight, that fatall and
too <U+017F>low di<U+017F>covery, I was in a manner more like a dead carka<U+017F>e
then tho<U+017F>e I had deprived of life; and not able to oppo<U+017F>e all the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions which then made their <U+017F>everal a<U+017F><U+017F>aults on my <U+017F>oul with
as much violence as can be well imagined, nor expre<U+017F><U+017F>e them by
words, I was almo<U+017F>t grown immoveable and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F><U+017F>e in the arms
of tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons that were about me. I apprehended my <U+017F>elf at
the <U+017F>ame to be the murtherer of two Women, of two beautiful
and amiable per<U+017F>ons, and two innocent per<U+017F>ons, whereof one had
been my own Wife, whom I had loved as dearly as my own <U+017F>oul,
and the other meerly upon the account of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
rai<U+017F>ed in me an affection towards her. This demon<U+017F>tration of
the innocence and fidelity of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> did at the fir<U+017F>t reflection on
it <U+017F>tick a <U+017F>word into my heart, much more cruel than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I had pierced her bre<U+017F>t, and the <U+017F>ight of that unfortunate
per<U+017F>on, now no more <hi>Cleontes,</hi> but one of the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t Ladies
in the World, wounded my <U+017F>oul with the mo<U+017F>t violent affliction
that it was capable of: Certain it is, that <U+017F>ome other per<U+017F>on,
endued with a greater tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e of mind than I, who have ever
been of a fierce and har<U+017F>h di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, had not <U+017F>urvived <U+017F>o deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an accident, and yet, <U+017F>uch as I was, I really felt in my
heart whatever a lively and piercing grief can have in it of
torment.</p>
                        <p>After I had recollected my <U+017F>elf for <U+017F>ome time in the hands of tho<U+017F>e
per<U+017F>ons who had taken away my <U+017F>word from me, as having gathered
from the fury of my looks, that it was not unlikely I might do
my <U+017F>elf a mi<U+017F>chief, I drew neerer to that expiring Lady, making
<U+017F>igns to others to endeavour to help her, when perceiving my
intention; <q>Stand away, cruel man, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> and come not
neer me. Thy a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance is more hateful to me then the death
thou ha<U+017F>t given me, and <U+017F>ince the unfortunate <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> who<U+017F>e
death I have unhappily been the occa<U+017F>ion of, is no longer living,

oppo<U+017F>e not the la<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>trations of the friend <U+017F>hip I had for her,
and <U+017F>uffer me to expire without any other regret than that of
having <U+017F>acrificed to my misfortune, a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o vertuous as <U+017F>he
was. O <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena, Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> <U+017F>ince my la<U+017F>t ki<U+017F><U+017F>es proved <U+017F>o fatal to
thee, learn among the dead, where I am coming to enjoy thee
again, that I was unwilling to <U+017F>urvive thee, and that I run after
thee to continue among the <U+017F>hades that friend<U+017F>hip which was <U+017F>o
dear to us hear?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the body of
<hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> which they were carrying out of the Garden, and at that
<U+017F>ight, crying out louder than her weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e could bear, <U+017F>he withal
<U+017F>ent out her la<U+017F>t breath in the arms of tho<U+017F>e that were come about
to relieve her. Among tho<U+017F>e that came immediately after, a
young Gentlewoman that <U+017F>erved her, and who after her example
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>ex by mans cloaths, ca<U+017F>ting her <U+017F>elf upon the body
as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he could get neer it, made the aire echo again with her
cryes and her lamentations, and did a many things worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
which I was not in a condition to take notice of, for that
as the <U+017F>ight of the body of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> which they had very indi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
cau<U+017F>ed to be carryed clo<U+017F>e by me, I grew ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>en<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
and di<U+017F>tracted, and was conveyed away and ca<U+017F>t upon my
bed, where I was carefully looked after, out of a fear I <U+017F>hould
have fallen into de<U+017F>paire. When I had a little recovered my <U+017F>elf,
I ran to the place where they had laid the body of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> and
giving it thou<U+017F>ands of ki<U+017F><U+017F>es with an affection equal to that I had
for her at the beginning of our unfortunate marriage, I did all
that lay in my power to dye neer her, and have a thou<U+017F>and times
<U+017F>ince wondred, that my grief alone <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>trong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do that which no doubt I <U+017F>hould have done with my
<U+017F>word, had I been left at liberty. Her innocency and her vertue
being then but too too well known to me, I became a continual
prey to that remor<U+017F>e, and tho<U+017F>e implacable furies which unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
torment the <U+017F>oule; and, looking on my <U+017F>elf as a Dragon, or
<U+017F>ome horrid mon<U+017F>ter, I made again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t terrible impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
that a man could make again<U+017F>t his mo<U+017F>t inveterate enemies.</p>
                        <p>From the body of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> I went to that of the unfortunate
companion and partaker of her death, and though I had not
had any affection for her while <U+017F>he lived, yet had the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of her de<U+017F>tiny <U+017F>uch an influence upon me, and <U+017F>he had
appeared to me <U+017F>o amiable, even in the la<U+017F>t minutes of her
life, and in the la<U+017F>t words <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke, that my <U+017F>oul was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed
by <U+017F>omething greater then compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and I was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e liberal
of my tears for her death, then for that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena.</hi> When I
was <U+017F>o far recovered, as that I could apprehend any thing was <U+017F>ad
to me, I was very de<U+017F>irons to know who <U+017F>he was, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
that had waited on her, and who after her death had
no rea<U+017F>on to conceal what <U+017F>he had kept <U+017F>ecret while <U+017F>he lived,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97242:71"/>
being brought before me, though <U+017F>he could not look on me
without horrour and dete<U+017F>tation, and being informed what
my de<U+017F>ires were, gave me this account of her; <q>Since you are
<U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to know, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> who this unfortunate
woman, whom you have put to death, was; I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>oon
<U+017F>atisfie you to your <U+017F>orrow, for with that you <U+017F>hall know
what enemies you have rai<U+017F>ed your <U+017F>elf by your crueltie.
She was born among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> of an extraction that is
equally noble with any of the <U+017F>ubjects of <hi>Phraates,</hi> and was
allyed on both <U+017F>ides to the Illu<U+017F>trious Family of the <hi>Ar<U+017F>acides.</hi>
Her name was <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi> and her beauty <U+017F>uch, when it appeared
in its meridian lu<U+017F>tre, under cloaths <U+017F>uitable to her <U+017F>ex, that
the World can afford but few comparable to her. She hath
neglected it very much ever <U+017F>ince, and indeed hath had no
great rea<U+017F>on to be much in love with it, becau<U+017F>e it hath
proved the occa<U+017F>ion of all the misfortunes that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to her. Being brought up about the Queen, as a
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e that could claime <U+017F>ome kinred to her, and having
in a <U+017F>hort time di<U+017F>covered to the whole Court, as well
the beauty of her countenance, as that of her under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<U+017F>he was there generally beloved; but indeed much
more than <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to be, in<U+017F>omuch, that the amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of her per<U+017F>on having enflamed <hi>Phraates</hi> with an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards her, <U+017F>he became accordingly the object of his cruel
per<U+017F>ecution. She endured the torment of it for <U+017F>ome time
with an admirable vertue, and endeavoured to <U+017F>mother the
extravagant inclinations of the King, by all tho<U+017F>e wayes
which in any other <U+017F>oul might have produced that effect.
But her mode<U+017F>ty and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance adding to the eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
the Kings love, he would at la<U+017F>t needs come to violence,
and without any con<U+017F>ideration of the noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia</hi>'s
bloud, which was no other than a branch of his own, he
laid a de<U+017F>ign how to put his wicked re<U+017F>olutions in execution
upon her. This vertuous Lady, who<U+017F>e Father had been
dead many years before, de<U+017F>titute of all protection again<U+017F>t
her King, and that <U+017F>uch a King, as to whom, after he had
put to death his own Father, all crimes ought to be ea<U+017F>ie and
familiar, had no way but to flye, to deliver her vertue from that
tempe<U+017F>t, and there being no way for her to conceale her <U+017F>elf
from <U+017F>o great a King, but by di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>ex, <U+017F>he put on
mans cloaths, and cau<U+017F>ing me to do the like, took onely
me along with her in her flight, and two ancient men-<U+017F>ervants
of her Fathers, who<U+017F>e fidelity <U+017F>he was confident of. After
<U+017F>everal journies to and fro, wherein <U+017F>he had <U+017F>till inviolably
kept the <U+017F>ecrets of her adventure, <U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t came into your
territories. It was not her de<U+017F>ign to make any long <U+017F>tay

might <U+017F>afely enter into a <U+017F>olid friend<U+017F>hip, and in whom <U+017F>he
might repo<U+017F>e a great confidence, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered her <U+017F>elf to her,
acquainted her with her Fortune, and revealed to her what <U+017F>he
had <U+017F>o carefully concealed from all the World. <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi>
entertained the<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>trations of her affection and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with an admirable goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and offered her all the
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that lay in her power. This was meerly the effect
of her genero<U+017F>ity as to a <U+017F>tranger; but not long after, the
vertue and excellent endowments of <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia</hi> having wrought
their effect on the <U+017F>pirit of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> had

age could hardly have furni<U+017F>hed us with a nobler example.
The mutual demon<U+017F>trations which they gave thereof one to
another, with le<U+017F><U+017F>e circum<U+017F>pection than per<U+017F>ons, who<U+017F>e inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

<hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> her <U+017F>elf thought it not either <U+017F>afe or <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable,

communicated to you, as being in <U+017F>ome fear, that either to
put an obligation upon <hi>Phraates,</hi> or to avoid the occa<U+017F>ion of

<U+017F>econd di<U+017F>coveries you made thereof, <U+017F>he cho<U+017F>e rather to be
deprived the <U+017F>ight and company of her friend, then that you
<U+017F>hould be acquainted with the <U+017F>ecret of her life, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
expo<U+017F>e it to any danger. This <U+017F>eparation could not
but occa<U+017F>ion a violent grief on both <U+017F>ides, in<U+017F>omuch, that when
you unfortunately took them in the Arbour, they were taking
their la<U+017F>t leaves one of another, with tho<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>trations of
friend<U+017F>hip which proved <U+017F>o fatal to them. You are but too
well acquainted with what followed, I de<U+017F>ire to be excu<U+017F>ed as
to any further di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with you, and your leave to returne
to that body which I <U+017F>o much loved when living, to render it
my la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervices, and to take <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e for the carrying of it
away out of this cruel country, and, <U+017F>ince it is now beyond all fear
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97242:72"/>
of the violences of <hi>Phraates,</hi> di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e it among the monuments of
her Fathers.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the de<U+017F>olate Gentlewoman,
whereby coming to under<U+017F>tand as well the extraction, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi> I felt the grief and remor<U+017F>e, which I thought
violent enough before, a<U+017F><U+017F>uming new <U+017F>trength to torment me the
more. I was in a perpetual po<U+017F>ture of <U+017F>ighing and <U+017F>obbing,
which being pent up in the cranies of my brea<U+017F>t, forced out
their way with the greater violence, bringing forth with them
words <U+017F>o pittiful, that it rai<U+017F>ed a certain compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in all tho<U+017F>e,
who upon the cruel con<U+017F>equences of my mi<U+017F>take had conceived a
horrour for me. I continually called upon the name of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi>
and with that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> I oftentimes brought out that of <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi>
who<U+017F>e lamentable adventure I was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e troubled at, then I was
for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my wife, whom I had thought <U+017F>o amiable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<U+017F>o dearly loved.</p>
                        <p>I <U+017F>hall not tire you, my Lord, with tedious di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of my
complaints, or with relations of all tho<U+017F>e things which I did for
<U+017F>ome dayes, during the extravagance of my affliction, and <U+017F>hall
onely tell you, that tho<U+017F>e who know me at this pre<U+017F>ent, and know
what cour<U+017F>e of life I have led for the<U+017F>e many years together,
would not ea<U+017F>ily believe the <U+017F>trange effects it wrought in me.
The Gentlewoman, who had waited on <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi> and her two
ancient <U+017F>ervants, having cau<U+017F>ed the body to be embalmed, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it away into their own Country; and that of my <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi>
was di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into a <U+017F>umptuous Monument which I cau<U+017F>ed to be
built for her. I vi<U+017F>ited it every day, and <U+017F>pent whole houres
in wa<U+017F>hing it with my tears, embracing the cold Marble, and doing
a hundred actions which <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covered my love, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and de<U+017F>paire. There was not any thing from which I
could derive any comfort; in the day time I avoided the <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men, and in the night, methoughts I <U+017F>aw perpetually at
my beds head, the unfortunate images of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> and <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi>
<U+017F>hewing me their wounds, and loading me with the mo<U+017F>t bitter
reproaches that might be. During the<U+017F>e imaginations, I was
many times in a manner di<U+017F>tracted, in<U+017F>omuch, that in time,
if I were not grown ab<U+017F>olutely mad, I was at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o far gone,
that I had nothing of mildne<U+017F><U+017F>e, nothing of a <U+017F>ociable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
left in me. By degrees I became more and more <U+017F>avage,
and barbarous, much more than I was naturally inclined to be,
and out of an imagination I had, that all the World ought to
abhorre me, I began to abhorre all the World. Accordingly,
from that time all things fell out contrary to my expectations,
and my crime was <U+017F>uch, that Fortune declared her <U+017F>elf my enemy
as well as men. The King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who was infinitely
troubled at the death of <hi>Arte<U+017F>ia,</hi> immediately re<U+017F>olved to ruine
me, and <hi>Herod,</hi> who watched all occa<U+017F>ions to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97242:72"/>
my Tetrarchy, to joyne it to his own dominions, whereof he
conceived it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ome part, having no pretence of war
again<U+017F>t me him<U+017F>elf, promoted underhand the de<U+017F>ignes of the
<hi>Parthian</hi> King, gave a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through his Country, to the Army
he <U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t me, and <U+017F>upplyed them with provi<U+017F>ions, out of hopes
of getting my e<U+017F>tate into his hands.</p>
                        <p>Things fell out, in a manner as they had de<U+017F>igned they <U+017F>hould,
<U+017F>o that I, who in the height and favour of fortune, had not
been able to oppo<U+017F>e the forces which the King of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
<U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t me, could hardly, in the misfortune, I was
fallen into, lo<U+017F>t as to friends, courage, and all things, make
any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance again<U+017F>t them. The <hi>Parthians</hi> forced me out of
my country, and <hi>Herod</hi> having gotten it into his hands upon <U+017F>ome
treaty there had pa<U+017F>t between him and <hi>Phraates,</hi> he not long after
went and begged it of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> alledgiug that he had <U+017F>ome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
in it, during the time that <hi>Li<U+017F>anias</hi> was in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion thereof.
It was be<U+017F>towed on him, and he was put into po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion thereof
by the Emperour, who <U+017F>ent <hi>So<U+017F>ius</hi> to <U+017F>ettle him quietly in it, and
who accordingly maintained him therein, again<U+017F>t the pretentions
of the King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> This was the occa<U+017F>ion of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
wherein <hi>Phraates</hi> was <U+017F>o much exa<U+017F>perated again<U+017F>t <hi>Herod,</hi>
and which bred the war that hath happened between them <U+017F>ince,
and which was begun by <hi>Phraates</hi> not long after the carrying away
of <hi>Pha<U+017F>ela,</hi> and old <hi>Hircan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time I made a <U+017F>hift to get away with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <U+017F>hips, de<U+017F>titute of all friends and <U+017F>upply, nay indeed lo<U+017F>t as
to all things; for having applyed my <U+017F>elf every where for a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance,
all proved ineffectual, all denyed me. In<U+017F>omuch, that, my mind
exa<U+017F>perated by the con<U+017F>tant malice of my Fortune, I became lo<U+017F>t as
to all vertue and morality; and thence out of an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance I had
that all the World were enemies to me, I became an enemy to all
the World. While my grief, for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena</hi> continued
<U+017F>trong upon my <U+017F>pirits, I was but little troubled at the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my
e<U+017F>tate, and friends; but when time had wrought <U+017F>ome abatement
of it, I could not, without indignation and rage, look on the
change of my condition, and <U+017F>ee <hi>Herod</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of all I had,
and <U+017F>o powerful through the authority of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him in it, that there was but little probability of ever get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out of his hands.</p>
                        <p>This put me upon re<U+017F>olutions of getting that el<U+017F>ewhere which
had been wre<U+017F>ted out of my hands at home, and having yet a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <U+017F>hips under my command, I began to make a Sea-war; fir<U+017F>t
again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e only that had taken away my e<U+017F>tate, and afterwards
again<U+017F>t all Nations, without any choice or di<U+017F>tinction of parties.
I had gotten with me my Nephew <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> as valiant and daring
a per<U+017F>on, as ever followed this cour<U+017F>e of life, who contributed
much to the carrying on of my de<U+017F>igne; in<U+017F>omuch that when I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97242:73"/>
had, by a great number of rich pri<U+017F>es, got together abundance of
wealth, I bought more <U+017F>hips, and <U+017F>o reinforced my Fleet, and
lur'd in a many <U+017F>ouldiers, who found better <U+017F>ervice and pay in our
war, than they would have done in any lawful one. In fine, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<U+017F>o powerful, that I had <U+017F>quadrons of <U+017F>hips on all <U+017F>eas. Having
made <hi>Ephialtes</hi> my Vice-Admiral in tho<U+017F>e parts of the <U+017F>ea which
admitted not of any communication by <U+017F>ea, we went and met by
land, having Hor<U+017F>es and private retreats for that purpo<U+017F>e. So that
of a de<U+017F>olate man, and one that in all probability <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>pent
his whole life in weeping over a Tomb, I became terrible and
dreadful to all Nations, the terrour of all that had any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
with the <U+017F>ea, and famous for thou<U+017F>ands of Pri<U+017F>es, which had made
me the riche<U+017F>t of all the Pyrates that ever were. This cour<U+017F>e of
life have I led for the<U+017F>e ten years very neer, and yet I <U+017F>hall not
entertain you with the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable actions I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in, not onely becau<U+017F>e it would require a long relation, <U+017F>uch
as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly might prove very trouble<U+017F>ome to your Maje<U+017F>ty, but
al<U+017F>o for that I am confident you have already had <U+017F>ome account
thereof, and have, not without a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, heard of the <U+017F>everal
changes of my Fortune. I <U+017F>hall therefore onely tell you, that
during the <U+017F>pace of ten years, that I have followed this trade,
there happened not any thing memorable unto me, in compari<U+017F>on
of what hath come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, within the<U+017F>e few dayes upon the<U+017F>e
very coa<U+017F>ts, there having in a manner at the <U+017F>ame time, fallen into
my hands, two of the mo<U+017F>t beautiful preyes that the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
can afford. And this I am confident you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
when I have told you that in two dayes time, I had in my
power and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al the fair <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> the onely daughter and heir of the great King
of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> I took the Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> ju<U+017F>t at the
mouth of the <hi>Nile;</hi> and this <U+017F>oul of mine, which <U+017F>ince the death
of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> had not entertained the lea<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of love, nor
ever thought it could have been capable of any, remitted <U+017F>ome
part of its Forces, upon the fir<U+017F>t view of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and, by
degrees, became ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>ubject to her Beauties. I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
both of her name and quality; and yet love made me at fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>light the proffers <U+017F>he made me of a con<U+017F>iderable ran<U+017F>ome, and
when afterwards <U+017F>he told me that <U+017F>he was Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> I
would not ab<U+017F>olutely believe what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, out of an imagination
that <U+017F>he might take that name upon her, purpo<U+017F>ely to keep me
within tho<U+017F>e terms of re<U+017F>pect which <U+017F>he perceived I <U+017F>hould not
be long able to ob<U+017F>erve. During that uncertainty, I did all that
lay in my power to per<U+017F>wade her to my will, and having found all
the waies I took ineffectual, I hoped at la<U+017F>t to effect my own <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
by making u<U+017F>e of the power I had over her, when that
during the <U+017F>pace of one night, which I had allotted her to fix
on <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>olution, this Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, daring above her <U+017F>ex, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97242:73"/>
all example, <U+017F>et my <U+017F>hip on fire, which broke forth in <U+017F>everal
places, and ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf into the <U+017F>ea within <U+017F>ome few <U+017F>tadia of
this river. You may well imagine what an a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment I was
in when it came to my knowledge that I had lo<U+017F>t her in that
manner. I made the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>hift I could to repaire the breaches
which the fire had made in my <U+017F>hip, that I might the <U+017F>ooner make
after her into this river, whither I conceived <U+017F>he might get upon
planks, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>ome men, who had ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves
over-board at the <U+017F>ame time with her.</p>
                        <p>We were very bu<U+017F>ie a mending of our <U+017F>hips, when it was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
of Fortune, (to make me <U+017F>ome requital for the former
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e) to <U+017F>end me a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, wherein was the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> which having with much adoe e<U+017F>caped wrack in a
great tempe<U+017F>t that had been, and being not furni<U+017F>hed with men to
maintain her, came and ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf into our hands. We board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her without any great difficulty, and the fir<U+017F>t thing I was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with, was the <U+017F>houts of certain <U+017F>laves, whom I found to
have been my <U+017F>ouldiers, and <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e that I had left
<hi>Ephialtus.</hi> They pre<U+017F>ently gave me an account of the death
of my Nephew, and pointing to a per<U+017F>on that <U+017F>tood neer the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, they told he had been his murtherer. I ca<U+017F>t my eyes
on the man, and notwith<U+017F>tanding the admirable things I could
ob<U+017F>erve in him, yet was I re<U+017F>olved his life <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>acrificed to
the <hi>Manes</hi> of my Nephew, whom I had <U+017F>o dearly loved, and
thereupon cau<U+017F>ed the points of all our <U+017F>words to be turned
upon him. But good gods, how <U+017F>trangely did he behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf!
for pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through our armes without any fear, he comes
up to me, takes hold of me by the midle, and ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf into
the <U+017F>ea, with me in his arms. I was relieved and taken up again
by my own men, not without <U+017F>ome difficulty; but when I had
recovered the danger, ca<U+017F>t up the water I had drunk, and put on
other cloaths, the pre<U+017F>ence of a Beauty which all the World
might admire, but that <U+017F>eemed orewhelmed with an in<U+017F>upporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grief, could not make me forget her, who may be <U+017F>aid to have
<U+017F>et my heart a fire as truely as <U+017F>he had done my <U+017F>hip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
re<U+017F>olving to follow her living, or find out her dead body
about this river, I came hither, and landed with thirty of my
men, leaving the fair prize I had taken in my Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, under the care
of a Lieutenant whom I tru<U+017F>ted her with. I wandred up and down
the river-<U+017F>ide all that day, and could not make the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery
of what I <U+017F>ought, and the next day, after I had <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome part of
the day in the <U+017F>ame enquiry, and having divided my men into
<U+017F>everal parties, in order to vi<U+017F>it more places, I came at la<U+017F>t, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
onely by two of them, neer a <U+017F>pring, where I <U+017F>aw two men
engaged in a furious combat. They were both per<U+017F>ons of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
goodly pre<U+017F>ence, their arms rich and magnificent; but
there was nothing comparable to the valour wherewith they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97242:74"/>
fought, but the animo<U+017F>ity they expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the combat. One of
the two had upon his armes, which glittered with gold, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Eagle <U+017F>pread in divers places, and tho<U+017F>e of his adver<U+017F>ary remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for certain Lyons, cau<U+017F>ing me to ob<U+017F>erve his <U+017F>tature and
action, I at la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covered him to be the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on that had ca<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf over-boord with me in his arms, and whom I had given
over for drowned.</p>
                        <p>I was at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what I <U+017F>hould do upon this occa<U+017F>ion, when,
notwith<U+017F>tanding the attention whereto it might be thought the
combat obliged him, he ca<U+017F>t his eyes towards me, and immediately
calling me to mind, he retreated a little before his enemy, and
having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething to him, which I could not hear, he left him,
and fell upon me with as little mercy as a bird would on his prey.
I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the violence of his proceeding, but though I
had then no other arms about me but my <U+017F>word, yet I <U+017F>aw there
was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I <U+017F>hould put my <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>ome po<U+017F>ture of defence.
When I <U+017F>aw falling dead at my feet upon the dealing of but two
blows, my two companions, who had <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves before me; I
mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that this <U+017F>udden execution frightned me a
little, and <U+017F>eeing my <U+017F>elf without arms, to engage with a man
armed all over, I was afraid to meet with him, and <U+017F>o made away
from him as fa<U+017F>t as ever my hor<U+017F>e could carry me. I rid a great
way, flying <U+017F>till before him, and he had very neer overtaken me,
when coming into a plea<U+017F>ant valley, I met with a per<U+017F>on on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
very <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ly and richly, armed, who <U+017F>ecured me from
him, and in the very <U+017F>ame place had I <U+017F>ight of the admirable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e,
whom I <U+017F>ought after. I was not a little encouraged at this
happy adventure, but being not in a condition to carry her away
without <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, I returned to my companions, and having
met with <U+017F>ome of them, I came back again along with them into
the Valley, and with their help carryed away the fair <hi>Candace,</hi>
on hor<U+017F>e back. Tis true, the greate<U+017F>t part of my <U+017F>oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
were killed by tho<U+017F>e valiant men that engaged with us
at our coming into the place, in<U+017F>omuch that I had but one about
me by that time I got to the river <U+017F>ide. Here it was that I was
<U+017F>atisfyed as to the incon<U+017F>tancy of Fortune, who had treated me <U+017F>o
odly in one and the <U+017F>ame day; for my <U+017F>hips were all gone, and
ca<U+017F>ting my eyes toward the <U+017F>ea, I <U+017F>aw them at a good di<U+017F>tance,
making as much <U+017F>aile as they could away. However I re<U+017F>olved
not to quit my prize, and accordingly carryed her into a Wood
that was hard by, in <U+017F>pight of all the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance <U+017F>he could make.
At la<U+017F>t having made a <U+017F>hift to get from me, while I was upon the
point of recovering her again, I was <U+017F>et upon by divers men
on hor<U+017F>eback, and being run through with a <U+017F>word, I fell
down to the ground with very little hopes of life. That
<U+017F>ouldier of mine who had followed me, <U+017F>aw me fall at a
good di<U+017F>tance from the place; and when our enemies were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97242:74"/>
gone away with the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, he came back to me, meeting in
his way with another party of his companions, which I had <U+017F>ent
<U+017F>ome other way, and had not been engaged in the fight we
had had. They were extreamly ca<U+017F>t down to <U+017F>ee what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in, and perceiving there were <U+017F>ome remainders
of life in me, they carryed me to a poor Country-mans hou<U+017F>e
not far from that place. This man was <U+017F>ent into the City for a
Chirurgeon, having before engaged him<U+017F>elf to keep all things
<U+017F>ecret, and my men having put them both into hopes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
rewards for the good they <U+017F>hould do me, they have
accordingly done as much for me as I could have de<U+017F>ired them.
I had about me both money and jewels to engage them to
<U+017F>idelity and attendance, and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, they have done all
things with <U+017F>o much good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>ecrecy, that they have
brought me into the condition you now find me in, without the
lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of any thing.</p>
                        <p>During the time I remained at that hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch of my men
as had gone <U+017F>everall times to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee
what news were <U+017F>tirring, brought me word that <hi>Candace</hi> was in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it was the Praetor him<U+017F>elf that had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and that the very <U+017F>ame day tho<U+017F>e whom he had
<U+017F>ent to <U+017F>ea had taken my <U+017F>hips, killed all the re<U+017F>t of my men,
together with my treacherous Lieutenant, and recovered the
Beauty I had left with him, who had di<U+017F>covered her <U+017F>elf to be
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Till then had I been ignorant
who <U+017F>he was; but had learned <hi>Candaces</hi> name from her own
mouth, as I told you before, though my people told me, that <U+017F>he
was not known in <hi>Alexandria</hi> for any other then a Lady of
great quality, born in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and one whom it was thought
the Praetor was fallen very deeply in love with. In a word, my
Lord, having lo<U+017F>t my <U+017F>hips, my men, and the noble prizes I
had taken, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I have happily met with, I am
gotten into the condition wherein you <U+017F>ee me, and this very
day, as I was thinking of my departure from that hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus,</hi>
<U+017F>eeking out where there were any provi<U+017F>ions to be <U+017F>old, comes in.
We had been heretofore very intimate friends, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
the alteration, which <U+017F>o many years mu<U+017F>t needs have
made in our faces, yet after we had looked a good while
one upon the other, we called one another to mind, we
embraced, and after we had enquired one after another
what accidents or occa<U+017F>ions had brought us into the<U+017F>e parts,
he told me, that your Maje<U+017F>ty was hereabouts, and made
me believe that my own <U+017F>ervice, and that of the<U+017F>e men I
have left me, might be worth your acceptance, and contribute
<U+017F>omewhat to the furtherance of your de<U+017F>ignes. Whereupon I
thought my <U+017F>elf obliged to follow him, which I did with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97242:75"/>
the greater joy, for that it gives me <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>atisfie
you, that even in the mid<U+017F>t of my misfortunes, notwith<U+017F>tanding
all the changes I have run through, nothing hath been able
to force out of my memory the re<U+017F>entment of your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>es,
or the de<U+017F>ire I have, by all the <U+017F>ervices it lies in my power to do
you, to acknowledge them.</p>

                        <p>THe King of <hi>Armenia</hi> acquaints <hi>Zenodorus</hi> how he had
brought away the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> tells
him what de<U+017F>ignes he had upon them, and is encouraged
in his enterprize by the <hi>Pirate. Artaxus</hi> is <U+017F>et upon by an
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, for the deliverance of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and is
like to gain the victory, when an unknown per<U+017F>on that was
in <hi>Artaxa's</hi> <U+017F>hip, awakened by the noi<U+017F>e, comes in to the
relief of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and forces the <hi>Egyptian</hi> to retreat.
Having <U+017F>ecured the victory, he is known by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to
be <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> whereat <U+017F>he is almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tracted. Vpon her
reproaches to him for the di<U+017F><U+017F>ervice he had done her, he
<U+017F>wounds, but <U+017F>oon after recovers, pleads his ignorance, and
the innocency of his intentions. To expiate his crime, he
undertakes to deliver her out of the hands of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who
thereupon <U+017F>ets his men to kill him, but upon the mediation
of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he is proffered life and liberty. He refu<U+017F>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97242:76"/>
both, is again <U+017F>et upon, kills <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus, Zenodorus,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others, and keeps all in play <U+017F>o long, till a <U+017F>hip of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> coming in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> comes to his relief.
The <U+017F>hips being ready to clo<U+017F>e, <hi>Artaxus</hi> threatens to kill the two
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, whereupon the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, wherein were the
Princes, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> dares not fa<U+017F>ten on the
other. <hi>Artaxus</hi> would have put his barbarous de<U+017F>ign upon
the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es in execution, but is miraculou<U+017F>ly prevented by
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who thru<U+017F>ting him to the other <U+017F>ide of the <U+017F>hip,
<U+017F>ets him<U+017F>elf before the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Marcellus</hi> taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon that interval, boards the <hi>Armenian. Alexander</hi>
would have killed <hi>Artaxus,</hi> but, upon the mediation of <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>a,</hi>
forbeans; yet he, <U+017F>corning life from an enemy, falls upon
his own <U+017F>word. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is charged with, and, at la<U+017F>t,
informed what his ancient infidelity to <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
was, promi<U+017F>es to clear him<U+017F>elf, and is promi<U+017F>ed to be re<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> affection. <hi>Marcellus, Alexander,</hi> and the
two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither the body of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus</hi>
is brought by <hi>Megacles,</hi> who in his way <U+017F>et <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
a<U+017F>hore, to find out <U+017F>ome means to approve him<U+017F>elf a faithful lover
and <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>

THis was the conclu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
and when he had given over <U+017F>peaking, the King
of <hi>Armenia</hi> acknowledged his obligations to him
for the proffers he had made him of his Services,
and by way of requital promi<U+017F>ed him, that, as <U+017F>oon
as they were arrived in <hi>Armenia,</hi> he would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h
him with all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he could de<U+017F>ire, either to re<U+017F>tore
him to his E<U+017F>tate again, that he might spend the re<U+017F>t of his life
in quiet, or put him to <U+017F>ea in as good a condition as he had been
in <U+017F>ome daies before. <hi>Zenodorus</hi> told him on the other <U+017F>ide, that
it was neither prudence nor <U+017F>afe for him to make any <U+017F>tay in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e of the Friends of <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena,</hi> who could not look
on him without a certain horrour, and therefore he relied more
upon the hopes he had put him into, of his furtherances in that
cour<U+017F>e of life which he was re<U+017F>olved to follow. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who
by this unexpected <U+017F>upply was twice as <U+017F>trong as he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in men, not onely well ver<U+017F>ed in Sea-affaires, but much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with tho<U+017F>e coa<U+017F>ts, was not a little glad of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and out of a de<U+017F>ign of engaging <hi>Zenodorus</hi> the more to
<U+017F>erve him, he thought it not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to di<U+017F>cover to him all that
had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, how things then <U+017F>tood, and related to him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how he had brought away the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>a,</hi>
and how that his intentions were to carry them to <hi>Armenia</hi>
as <U+017F>oon as the wind <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve.</p>
                     <p>The Pirate was infinitely plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee a King fallen into that
cour<U+017F>e of life which he had followed for <U+017F>o many yeares, and
being almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf for joy that he had <U+017F>uch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
he encouraged him in his enterpri<U+017F>e, and promi<U+017F>ed him
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e in it, or that he would peri<U+017F>h in his Service. The<U+017F>e
two <U+017F>oules, neer of the <U+017F>ame making, were extreamly glad at
this renewing of their acquaintance, but <hi>Megaeles,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of
a quite different di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and one that could not without a
certain regreet endure the violences of his Ma<U+017F>ter, looked on
the Pirate with horrour, and had <U+017F>hed many teares at the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
adventure of the deplorable <hi>Eli<U+017F>ena.</hi> Having therefore
taken his re<U+017F>t (which he <U+017F>hould otherwi<U+017F>e have done out of a
con<U+017F>ideration of his indispo<U+017F>ition) during the whole time that
this relation had la<U+017F>ted, <hi>Artaxus,</hi> thinking it long <U+017F>ince he had
<U+017F>een the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> ro<U+017F>e up from his bed, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her chamber. But before he was gotten into it calling to
mind that vertuous unknown per<U+017F>on in who<U+017F>e commendation
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97242:77"/>
                        <hi>Megacles</hi> had <U+017F>poken <U+017F>uch great things, and though he were of
a cruell nature, yet upon the account of his courage, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was very great in him, having a certain e<U+017F>teem for noble
and generous per<U+017F>ons, he would needs give him a vi<U+017F>it, and <U+017F>o
went to the place where he was in his bed. The unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
lifted him<U+017F>elfe half up at his coming in, for having heard the
word King often spoken of in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, out of an imagination
that he might be the King him<U+017F>elf who did him that civility, he
received him with abundance of respect, and with as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trations
of cheerfulne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as might be expected from <U+017F>o deep
a melancholy as he then groaned under. The place was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dark, and the day almo<U+017F>t spent; but it was not long e're
torches were brought in, by the light whereof the King <U+017F>oon
di<U+017F>covered the gracefulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the unknown per<U+017F>on; which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
in him not onely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment but much respect for him.
The fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he made to him, was to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e how much he
was <U+017F>atisfied with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances he had received from <hi>Megacles,</hi>
repeating <U+017F>ome part of tho<U+017F>e proffers which <hi>Megacles</hi> had made
him before: and the unknown per<U+017F>on on the other <U+017F>ide, though
he entertained them not as one that had any intention to make
advantage of them, yet acknowledged how great an obligation
he had laid upon him, and did it in <U+017F>uch termes and with <U+017F>uch a
grace as rai<U+017F>ed no <U+017F>mall admiration in the <hi>Armenian.</hi> Having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood
by the account <hi>Megacles</hi> had given of him, that he was
a per<U+017F>on much inclined to Vertue, he thought it not fit to let
him know any thing of his carrying away of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he might not approve of it, whence it may be inferred that
Vertue hath this advantage, that even in the per<U+017F>ons of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable,
<U+017F>he rai<U+017F>es a fear of her <U+017F>elf in the mo<U+017F>t happy and mo<U+017F>t
powerfull. He told him that he had to his no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>atisfaction
under<U+017F>tood, that <U+017F>ince his coming into the <U+017F>hip, he had lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome
part of that aver<U+017F>ion which he had for life, or at lea<U+017F>t that he
would not prove his own executioner as he had intended the
day before. The unknown per<U+017F>on made him an<U+017F>wer, that as to
matter of Life, it was no dearer to him then it had been, when
he had endeavoured to rid him<U+017F>elf of it; but that having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to mind a certain obligation that lay upon him, to continue
it till <U+017F>uch time as he <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>engaged from it, he had re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make one attempt more to meet with <U+017F>ome opportunity
to do it, and con<U+017F>equently not die with a regreet of having omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any part of his duty.</p>
                     <p>That di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, the King a<U+017F>ked him whether he would
goe along with him, in a voyage he intended to make with the
fir<U+017F>t fair wind, or if he had no inclinations to that, whether he
had in <U+017F>ome other de<U+017F>igne any occa<U+017F>ion of his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance? The
unknown per<U+017F>on made an<U+017F>wer, that not able to imagine how he
could do him any <U+017F>ervice by rea<U+017F>on of the de<U+017F>picable condition
whereto fortune had reduced him, and <U+017F>atisfied on the other <U+017F>ide
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97242:77"/>
that being un<U+017F>erviceable he mu<U+017F>t needs be trouble<U+017F>ome, he made
no proffers of his company, but entreated him, that, e're they
<U+017F>et <U+017F>aile thence, he would order him to be <U+017F>et <U+017F>omewhere
a<U+017F>hore.</p>
                     <p>Some further complements pa<U+017F>t between them; but at la<U+017F>t the
King remembring where he was to goe, and impatient to <U+017F>ee the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, put a period to the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and having left the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to his re<U+017F>t, which he <U+017F>eemed very much to want, he went
to the chamber where <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was. He came to her with a
countenance wherein through the Love it di<U+017F>covered, was vi<U+017F>ible
<U+017F>ome part of the di<U+017F>content he was in; and not able to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble
the occa<U+017F>ion of it: <q>All things, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to me, all things oppo<U+017F>e me, while you are again<U+017F>t me,
nay, the winds them<U+017F>elves, which <U+017F>eem to depend of another
power than yours, will never turn to do me any <U+017F>ervice while I
am hatefull in your <U+017F>ight. You may thence al<U+017F>o infer, <hi>replied
the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> the inju<U+017F>tice of your de<U+017F>ignes, <U+017F>ince that where
there is a want of the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of men, the very Elements
fight again<U+017F>t you. We mu<U+017F>t not alwaies, replied <hi>Artaxus,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
the ju<U+017F>tice of the intentions by the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the ob<U+017F>tacles
which we meet within the execution of them; and if you lay
that down as a generall rule without any exception, you mu<U+017F>t
con<U+017F>equently reconcile <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> who are <U+017F>eldome
found to be very great Friends. I am of your mind as to that,
<hi>replies the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> and if Fortune did take part with ju<U+017F>tice,
and afford her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances to vertue, 'tis out of all que<U+017F>tion that
you had been e're this puni<U+017F>hed for the violence you do me, or
at lea<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould not be your Captive. Ah, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aies the
King of Armenia,</hi> do not call her my captive, who her <U+017F>elf hath
me in chaines, and dispo<U+017F>es of me with a <U+017F>overaign power! I
pray give me leave onely to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf, <hi><U+017F>aies Cleopatra,
interrupting him,</hi> <U+017F>ince that there's no Law in the world that
gives you any power over me. The Lawes of Nations, <hi>replies
Artaxus,</hi> are of much le<U+017F><U+017F>e authority than tho<U+017F>e of Love, and
it is onely to the<U+017F>e latter, that men, <U+017F>uch as we are, that like
<U+017F>o many <U+017F>tars of the greate<U+017F>t magnitude, are of the highe<U+017F>t
quality, ought to <U+017F>ubmit them<U+017F>elves. By this law of Love,
whatever my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion puts me upon, is ju<U+017F>tifiable, and all that I
could alleadge, as concerning the affronts and injuries I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from your hou<U+017F>e hath much le<U+017F><U+017F>e of argument in it than
this imperious rea<U+017F>on.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was with no <U+017F>mall trouble that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> endured, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e but even the pre<U+017F>ence of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
and notwith<U+017F>tanding her re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e, no que<U+017F>tion but <U+017F>he had
treated him with a great deale of <U+017F>corn and contempt, had it not
been out of a con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> who<U+017F>e condition pitied
her no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than her owne, and a conceit withall, that there was
no way to keep <hi>Artaxus</hi> within the bounds of civility and respect,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97242:78"/>
but by an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of patience. Supper was brought them in,
and the King to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e his complyance, permitted them to eat
alone, as knowing they would look on it as a favour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by <U+017F>uch behaviour to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble the re<U+017F>olution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to make u<U+017F>e of his power, when he were gotten off a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further from a Countrey where he was not over-confident of
the <U+017F>afety of his prize. He <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome part of the night in di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
of the <U+017F>ame nature with the precedent, and when he
thought it time to leave the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es to their re<U+017F>t, he withdrew
into his own chamber, and before he lay down, gave order that
a good <U+017F>trong guard <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>et in the <U+017F>hip, to prevent all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ignes
the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es might have to get away in the dark. The
two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away this night as they had done the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<U+017F>ave that they were in a much greater feare of their <U+017F>udden
departure than before, if it were not prevented by <U+017F>ome unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from heaven and the kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the winds,
which did them all the favour they could. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> tormented
with his Love and a fear of loo<U+017F>ing his beautifull prize, could
<U+017F>leep but little. The unknown per<U+017F>on di<U+017F>burthened him<U+017F>elf of
frequent <U+017F>ighs which were heard by <U+017F>ome in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el that were
neare<U+017F>t him; And <hi>Zenodorus</hi> bur<U+017F>ting almo<U+017F>t with grief and
rage for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>es he had received, had much adoe to find any
re<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>The day hardly began to appear, when upon the fir<U+017F>t dawning
of it, tho<U+017F>e who were upon the watch di<U+017F>covered a ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell,
which being gotten <U+017F>omewhat neer them while the darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e was
not yet di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated, made all the <U+017F>aile <U+017F>he could towards them,
as having a very good wind, that indeed in a manner forced them
upon the <U+017F>hore. They immediately gave the alarme, and all
being prepared, and in expectation of an engagement with the
other <U+017F>hip, all that were able to bear armes, took them, and
came up upon the deck in order to a fight. There were much
more armes in the <U+017F>hip than were requi<U+017F>ite for the number of men
that were in her, in<U+017F>omuch that the Sea-men who minded onely
the conduct of the <U+017F>hip, could not as <U+017F>he then lay be any way em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
as being in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture as they were loath to quit by
rea<U+017F>on of the advantage of the place, which was <U+017F>o advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that the enemy could not a<U+017F><U+017F>ault them but by one onely <U+017F>ide.
<hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> having put all into armes, and there being
as I told you but one <U+017F>ide to make good, they fortified it with
men, and put it into <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture of defence, that it was as
defen<U+017F>ible as if they had had a far greater number of men.
This charge did <hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> take upon them, becau<U+017F>e
of the wounds which the King had received not long before,
whereby he was <U+017F>till a little indispo<U+017F>ed, and would fain have had
him kept his bed; but he would by no meanes take their advice,
by rea<U+017F>on of the great concernment which he had to make his
party good, and accordingly <U+017F>tarting out of his bed upon the fir<U+017F>t
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97242:78"/>
alarme, he called for armes, and came up upon the deck in the
po<U+017F>ture of a man that wanted not either courage or confidence.
<hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> walked up and down the <U+017F>hip, putting all
things into good order, and <hi>Artaxus</hi> <U+017F>hewing him<U+017F>elf among his
own people in a po<U+017F>ture of fighting per<U+017F>onally with them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to encourage them as well by example as by words. He
omitted nothing of all that he thought might any waies animate
them to fight, and promi<U+017F>eth them extraordinary rewards, if
they behaved them<U+017F>elves gallantly, and came off with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>During all this time the other ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell drew nearer and nearer,
and when it was come within a competent di<U+017F>tance, <hi>Zenodorus</hi>
di<U+017F>covered by the flag, that it was one of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hips that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Praetor <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and which ordinarily lay in the
port of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This di<U+017F>covery exasperated him not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as calling to mind the wounds he had received, and the
great lo<U+017F><U+017F>es he had <U+017F>uffered by the <U+017F>ame enemies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he told <hi>Artaxus</hi> that he need not que<U+017F>tion but he would be
<U+017F>et upon, and that infallibly it was one of the Praetors <U+017F>hips pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
<U+017F>et out by him in the pur<U+017F>uit of tho<U+017F>e that had carried
away <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Upon this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which made <U+017F>ome of the
company tremble, <hi>Artaxus</hi> reiterated the intreaties he had made
to them to defend them<U+017F>elves to the utmo<U+017F>t, and they all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
him, though po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly with unequall re<U+017F>olution; that they
would <U+017F>tand to him, to the la<U+017F>t drop of their blood. The two
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, who had awakened at the fir<U+017F>t noi<U+017F>e that was made,
and had, from what they had di<U+017F>tinctly heard through the <U+017F>hip,
ea<U+017F>ily imagined the truth of what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, got immediately
out of bed, and betaking them to their devotions prayed the
Gods to <U+017F>end them tho<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances whereof they then began to
conceive <U+017F>ome hopes</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of <hi>Egypt</hi> being come up to the
<hi>Armenian,</hi> the per<U+017F>on that commanded it <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf upon
the deck very well armed, and having made <U+017F>ome <U+017F>igne to <U+017F>hew
that he was de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>peak with tho<U+017F>e of the other ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they engaged, a<U+017F>ked for him that commanded the Armenian
ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell. <hi>Artaxus</hi> having <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf to be the man, and a<U+017F>ked
him what his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e was with him; <hi>My bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to
him, <hi>is to find out the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>and tho<U+017F>e that have
carried her away, and if you are any of tho<U+017F>e, you are either to
re<U+017F>tore the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e or prepare to fight. Artaxus</hi> would have been
glad to avoid fighting, as not conceiving him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>trong enough
to deale with his enemies who very much exceeded him in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and accordingly making him an<U+017F>wer, though not without
<U+017F>hame and <U+017F>ome repugnance. <hi>Tho<U+017F>e whom you <U+017F>eek</hi> <U+017F>aid he to
him, <hi>are not among us, and there is very little likelyhood that any
people having made <U+017F>uch a pri<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o neer</hi> Alexandria.
<hi>What you <U+017F>ay,</hi> replies the other, <hi>may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be true, but we <U+017F>hall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97242:79"/>
not take your word, and therefore mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>earch your <U+017F>hip, which we
are empowered to do by the orders of the Praetor and the authority
of</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar. Artaxus, ex a<U+017F>perated at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and perceiving
there was no way to avoid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ighting; <hi>I am not a per<U+017F>on to acknowledg
any orders,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>nor know I any authority, that <U+017F>hould force me
to commit a ba<U+017F>e action, and therefore if it be fightiag that thou
de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t, prepare thy <U+017F>elf for it without <U+017F>eeking any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e words were <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o loud that they were di<U+017F>tinctly
heard by the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and out of a fear that <U+017F>he was
in lea<U+017F>t <hi>Artaxus</hi> might per<U+017F>wade tho<U+017F>e of the other ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell with
fair words, and divert them from their intended de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>he would
needs <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf to them. Finding therefore the chamber
door fa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he ran to a little window that was on one <U+017F>ide of the
<U+017F>hip, and opening it as ha<U+017F>tily as <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed them her
beautifull countenance, which <U+017F>eemed to <U+017F>hine a new day upon
the waves, and lifting up her voice <U+017F>o as that <U+017F>he might be heard;
<hi>Here,</hi> generous men, cried <U+017F>he, <hi>here is</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>whom you look
after, I expect my Liberty from your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and I beg it of you
out of the compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which my misfortune may have rai<U+017F>ed in your
Soules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There needed no more to <U+017F>atisfie all parties <U+017F>o as to re<U+017F>olve
upon what was to be done, in<U+017F>omuch that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>carce delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the<U+017F>e words but the Aegyptian ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell had fa<U+017F>tned her grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
irons in the other. The fight upon the fir<U+017F>t on<U+017F>et was very
terrible, and <U+017F>o much the more cruell in that they were come to
handy blowes, tho<U+017F>e that were come to re<U+017F>cue the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,
having it <U+017F>eems purpo<U+017F>ely forborn to make u<U+017F>e of arrowes out of
a fear they might hurt them. There being therefore on both <U+017F>ides
a many gallant men, and tho<U+017F>e animated by con<U+017F>iderable intere<U+017F>ts
and concernments, they all fought with abundance of valour,
in<U+017F>omuch that within few minutes the waves were dy'd with
the blood of both parties. With the fir<U+017F>t raies of the ri<U+017F>ing Sun
were <U+017F>een the <U+017F>words glittering, and the blowes falling at the <U+017F>ame
time either on the bucklers oppo<U+017F>ed thereto, or on tho<U+017F>e unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
places where the <U+017F>teel found its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to di<U+017F>patch life. And
whereas <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men were onely upon the defen<U+017F>ive, and
<U+017F>tood to their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e clo<U+017F>e and covered with their bucklers,
it was very difficult to force them and <U+017F>o to board the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell. The
fir<U+017F>t that came on of the enemies was ca<U+017F>t over-board, and there
fell more then one by the hands of <hi>Artaxus</hi> him<U+017F>elf. He was
gallantly <U+017F>econded by <hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles,</hi> though this latter
fought with <U+017F>ome regret upon <U+017F>o unhand<U+017F>ome a quarrell. But
after <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>pute, the number of their enemies being <U+017F>till grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than theirs, and being al<U+017F>o better armed than they, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by no le<U+017F><U+017F>e valiant men, and that of <hi>Artaxus's</hi> <U+017F>ide there
were but twenty fighting men, and the re<U+017F>t onely ordinary Sea-men
whom they forced to fight both again<U+017F>t their wills and their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97242:79"/>
cu<U+017F>tome, Fortune began to turn to their <U+017F>ide who fought for the
liberty of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and their Commander having with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
blow upon the head laid <hi>Zenodorus</hi> groveling on the
ground, and gained the places which he had forced him to quit,
his companions took encouragement by his example, and victory
<U+017F>eemed to declare her <U+017F>elf for their <U+017F>ide.</p>
                     <p>Things were come to this pa<U+017F><U+017F>e when the unknown per<U+017F>on,
who re<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elf upon his bed in the bottome of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, and
perceived that through the re<U+017F>t he had taken he had recovered
his <U+017F>trength, having heard the noi<U+017F>e, and at length under<U+017F>tood
the truth of what was done, immediately got on his cloaths.
And though he <U+017F>eemed a per<U+017F>on little concerned in what was done
in this world, yet, his genero<U+017F>ity being not quite extingui<U+017F>hed by
his misfortunes, he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e men,
who had done him <U+017F>uch civill offices in his de<U+017F>pair, and who were
<U+017F>et upon in a ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell wherein he was with them. Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by
this imagination, he <U+017F>tood not to re<U+017F>olve on what he was to doe
in that emergency; <U+017F>o that finding his <U+017F>word lying by him, he took
it, without any other armes, and comes up on the deck; where
meeting with a buckler at his feet, he covered with it his
left arme, and in that po<U+017F>ture went towards tho<U+017F>e that were a
fighting. Ju<U+017F>t as he came in were <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men ready to
quit the place, and their enemies pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing very hard upon them,
began to board the <U+017F>hip in <U+017F>everall places. The unknown per<U+017F>on
<U+017F>tood <U+017F>till a little to con<U+017F>ider how the fight <U+017F>tood, and perceiving
what an ill condition they were in whom he was to relieve, he
ran and <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf in the head of them, and by the fir<U+017F>t blowes
he dealt, let them know that in one <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on, they had met
with an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance far greater than they could have expected. The
two <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t forward men of the enemies <U+017F>ide fell dead
at his feet at two blowes, and ru<U+017F>hing in upon the re<U+017F>t with <U+017F>uch
a force as they were a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at, he di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed the mo<U+017F>t daring,
in <U+017F>uch manner, that in a few minutes, he brought the victory
into di<U+017F>pute which had been before concluded for the other
<U+017F>ide. <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> were immediately <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of this
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which had <U+017F>o much changed the face of their affaires,
and, perceiving him to be the gallant unknovvn per<U+017F>on mentioned
before, becau<U+017F>e he fought vvithout any thing on his face, and
vvithout any armes other than a <U+017F>vvord and a buckler, they
vvere over-joyed at the reliefe they had received in him, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon him as <U+017F>ome miraculous per<U+017F>on.</p>

the mo<U+017F>t confident of the Enemy, calling <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men to

him; and <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men having recovered a little
of their courage at this miraculous a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, came up
to him, and began to fight again with abundance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>During all this time, the fair <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who in a <U+017F>trange di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
expected the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e of a fight on which her liberty, and all
the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of her life depended, after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>pent a good
<U+017F>pace in prayers to the gods for tho<U+017F>e that fought for her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
would needs, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>ee them fight, out of an
imagination that they might derive no final encouragement from
her pre<U+017F>ence. To this end coming to the chamber door, which,
during the time of the di<U+017F>order of the fight, was not guarded, <U+017F>he
found a means to open it, and to get up upon the <U+017F>tern of the <U+017F>hip.
From thence <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>covered how things had pa<U+017F>t, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
much to her grief, that tho<U+017F>e of her party fled before the
dreadful <U+017F>word of the unknown per<U+017F>on, and tho<U+017F>e others whom
his example had animated, and that that man, without arms, by a
prodigious valour, <U+017F>weeping all that came before him, forced the
others into their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el with much more <U+017F>peed then they had made
to get into that of the King of <hi>Armenia; Wo is my lot,</hi> cryed <U+017F>he
at that fight, overwhelmed with grief! <hi>What man is this that the
gods have armed again<U+017F>t me, and why, if they are ju<U+017F>t, have they not
made him one of tho<U+017F>e that came to my re<U+017F>cue, <U+017F>ince that I might
with more rea<U+017F>on expect my <U+017F>afety from his <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>word, then from
the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>o many men, whom he puts to <U+017F>light? Thus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<U+017F>he, <U+017F>ighing and <U+017F>peaking a little lower, <hi>did, not many
dayes <U+017F>ince, my unfortunate, or uncon<U+017F>tant</hi> Coriolanus <hi>fight for me,
and with the <U+017F>ame valour would he fight again, had it but plea<U+017F>ed
the gods to <U+017F>end him to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While <U+017F>he thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed to her <U+017F>elf the unknown per<U+017F>on,
who<U+017F>e valour <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much admired, and was withal <U+017F>o much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed
at, either flung his enemies over board into the <U+017F>ea, or
forced out of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el what ever <U+017F>tood in his way; and, being at
la<U+017F>t come up to the Commander in chief of the contrary party, who
had fought all this time very gallantly, he burthened him with
<U+017F>uch heavy blows, that notwith<U+017F>tanding his extraordinary valour,
not able to bear them, he was forced to retreat towards his own
ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and had gotten his foot into it, when he receives a blow on
the head from the <U+017F>ame dreadful hand, which made him fall to
the ground among his own men, who reached out their arms to
<U+017F>ave him from falling into the <U+017F>ea. The fall of their Commander,
and the death of the be<U+017F>t part of their companions, put the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of all courage, and having, as <U+017F>oon as they could, got
their <U+017F>hip clear from the other, they made all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>t away,
and would meddle no further with either the victory or relief of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Tis inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible what affliction it was to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,
to <U+017F>ee all the great hopes <U+017F>he had conceived vani<U+017F>h of a <U+017F>udden,

valiant, though unknown, per<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e valour had proved <U+017F>o
fatàl to her? She looked upon him <U+017F>ighing, and when, after he
had <U+017F>ecured the victory, he turned his face towards that part of
the <U+017F>hip where <U+017F>he was, which before he had alwayes had upon
his enemies, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eies upon him full of tears. But, O cele<U+017F>tial
powers! What a <U+017F>trange a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, what an incredible <U+017F>urprize
was <U+017F>he in, when in the countenance of that de<U+017F>table <U+017F>tranger

had returned her once more into the power of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw

make the lea<U+017F>t repre<U+017F>entation of what <U+017F>he felt upon that cruel
di<U+017F>covery, and the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F><U+017F>e of the accident wrought <U+017F>o vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on her, and put her into <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>traction, that having not
the command of her con<U+017F>tancy for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall time, <U+017F>he was upon
the point to ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf into the <U+017F>ea at the <U+017F>ight of that ungrateful
per<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>o to <U+017F>acrifice to him a life which he had made <U+017F>o
in<U+017F>upportable to her, by delivering her up to the mo<U+017F>t cruel
enemie <U+017F>he had in the World. She looked on him for a good
while together, out of a fear <U+017F>he might be mi<U+017F>taken, and found it no
<U+017F>mall difficulty to convince her <U+017F>elf of that cruel truth. But at
la<U+017F>t being <U+017F>atisfied that her eies did not deceive her, and that it
was but too too certain that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw no other then the true <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
<U+017F>he was out of all patience <U+017F>o far, that <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered her
grief by <U+017F>uch circum<U+017F>tances and demon<U+017F>trations of it as <U+017F>he was not
able to conceale, and made the <U+017F>hip, and the hollowne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the
adjoyning rock to echo again with the noi<U+017F>e of her lamentations.

                     <p>She had no <U+017F>ooner begun to <U+017F>peak, but <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> (for it was

and perceiving it to be the cele<U+017F>tial countenance of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e

and having, from the very fir<U+017F>t words <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, di<U+017F>covered the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e, that conviction of the malevolence of

fell down in a <U+017F>wound upon the deck. The incen<U+017F>ed <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97242:81"/>
in the fight, <U+017F>he gave tho<U+017F>e notice that were about him to
have a care of him, <U+017F>ince he had fought <U+017F>o well in their
quarrel.</p>
                     <p>Having <U+017F>o done, <U+017F>he found a place to <U+017F>it down where <U+017F>he was,
and leaning her amiable face on her two fair hands, <U+017F>he bur<U+017F>t out
into a rivulet of tears, and deplored the <U+017F>trange and extraordinary
misfortune that had happened to her, by <U+017F>uch complaints, as no
doubt would have moved any <U+017F>oul with compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it
were tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>Zenodorus. Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> who <U+017F>ate by
her, would have comforted her, but not being able to do it, <U+017F>he
wept with her for company, and was not afraid to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Artaxus</hi>
by participating in her lamentations. When the fair Daughter of
<hi>Anthony</hi> had with much adoe di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>obs which made
<U+017F>ome re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance again<U+017F>t the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of her voice, turning upon

tears, <U+017F>et all on fire in the <U+017F>hip, even to the hearts of unmerciful
Pirates; <q>Ah Si<U+017F>ter, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> what fortune was ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to mine, by what means think you am I fallen into the
hands of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> now the <U+017F>econd time! That man who<U+017F>e inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
you pleaded <U+017F>o much, and were <U+017F>o confident of; that
man from whom, incon<U+017F>tant as I had concluded him, I yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, nay, that very man whom you <U+017F>aw, not many

delivers us up him<U+017F>elf, and that into his hands from whom
he had before re<U+017F>cued us, the King, your Brothers. Had it not
been for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his fatal valour, we had been freed;
and it was he alone that forced away, nay, haply, killed tho<U+017F>e
that fought for our liberty. After <U+017F>uch an adventure as this,
never di<U+017F>pute with me again the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of our misfortunes,
and find me but one example in the World that may be parallel'd
with this. I do not think it <U+017F>trange, that <hi>Artaxus,</hi> an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
enemy of our hou<U+017F>e, and one that by his former inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
had di<U+017F>covered the malice he hath again<U+017F>t us, <U+017F>hould treat
me with violence and inju<U+017F>tice: but that he who had <U+017F>ometime
loved me <U+017F>o dearly, whom, to my confu<U+017F>ion, I had loved beyond
my own life, who had <U+017F>uffered <U+017F>o much for my <U+017F>ake, and upon
my account, and had been the occa<U+017F>ion that made me <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o

<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>acrificed thou<U+017F>ands of lives for my liberty, <U+017F>hould

re<U+017F>cuers, purpo<U+017F>ely to return me into the chains and power of
<hi>Artaxus,</hi> and not into his own! Ah Si<U+017F>ter, this, this is what no
ages ever produced any thing comparable to, and tis <U+017F>uch a
<U+017F>trange accident as I am not well able to comprehend, though

                     </p>
                     <p>While <hi>Cleopatra</hi> broke forth into the<U+017F>e lamentations, and that

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97242:81"/>
her the hearing, and wept with her without making any reply,
<hi>Megacles</hi> and diver<U+017F>e others were gotten about <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to recover him again, <U+017F>ome others were employed in ca<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the carka<U+017F><U+017F>es over-board, and to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereof there was no great number. But before they went
to vi<U+017F>ite them, having looked all about the body of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
they could not find any wound about him: and, yet though they ca<U+017F>t
water in his face, and u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everall other remedies, all could not
bring him to him<U+017F>elf again. <hi>Megacles,</hi> who had the greate<U+017F>t
re<U+017F>pect of any for him, made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e very earne<U+017F>tly to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him, be<U+017F>ides that when they reflected on the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he had
done all that were in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, all did accordingly conceive
them<U+017F>elves obliged to relieve him. <hi>Artaxus</hi> knew not how he
<U+017F>hould entertain this <U+017F>trange emergency, and though his fir<U+017F>t mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were inclined to gratitude and acknowledgement, for the
great <U+017F>ervices he had received from that valiant per<U+017F>on, yet tho<U+017F>e
which immediately <U+017F>ucceeded them began to rai<U+017F>e a terrible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbance
within him. From the words of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which fell
from her in the violence of her grief, contrary to her ordinary
prudence, he concluded that that man mu<U+017F>t needs be his Rivall.
But that grieved him not <U+017F>o much as to con<U+017F>ider that it was a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
very precious in the affection of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the hi<U+017F>tory
of the King of <hi>Mauritania's</hi> Love to that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e being a thing
known all over the world, from the gracefulne<U+017F><U+017F>e, from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and from all the other demon<U+017F>trations and characters of a
great <U+017F>oule that were di<U+017F>coverable in that valiant man, he was
ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded that it was <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and con<U+017F>equently he that
of all the world <U+017F>hould be mo<U+017F>t his enemy, and whom he <U+017F>hould
accordingly be mo<U+017F>t jealous of in the love he had for <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
Yet could he not find in his heart to hate him <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, as well
for the con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>ervice he had received from him, as that
from <U+017F>everall circum<U+017F>tances it was very probable he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in his affection, and that from the reproaches of infidelity
which the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e made him, he could infer no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than that
that Prince had <U+017F>or<U+017F>aken her. In this confu<U+017F>ion of imaginations
he was at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, that he knew not what re<U+017F>olution to take,
ca<U+017F>ting his eies <U+017F>ometimes on the Prince that was <U+017F>till in a <U+017F>wound,
and <U+017F>ometimes on the afflicted Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e. Be<U+017F>ides, it being not
his opinion alone, that the unknown was the very <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on he
thought him, it went from one to another, that without que<U+017F>tion
it was the valiant King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> So that, coming at la<U+017F>t to
the eares of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as incen<U+017F>ed as <U+017F>he was again<U+017F>t him; yet

                     <p>To this effect was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this generous Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e; and

not wi<U+017F>h his death, nor endure the very thought that he <U+017F>hould
die for want of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. 'Twas for this rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
his infidelity before <hi>Artaxus,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to make him the le<U+017F><U+017F>e

the grief he conceived thereat was <U+017F>o great, that he found it no

he met with</hi> Cleopatra <hi>in that po<U+017F>ture, than that he <U+017F>hould have

Would<U+017F>t thou dazle my own eyes in this, as thou would<U+017F>t

to per<U+017F>wade me that I am extravagant and out of my wits?
It is indeed but too too true, replyed <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> that you have
<U+017F>een me with my <U+017F>word drawn fighting for your enemies, and I
may pre<U+017F>ume to affirm, that I haply made their way to a victory,
which without my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance it is likely they had not carried.
It is not therefore my de<U+017F>ign to ju<U+017F>tifie the events, but onely my
own intentions, which if con<U+017F>idered alone, I dare affirm my <U+017F>elf
innocent, if there can be any innocency in an offence whereof the
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e hath proved <U+017F>o fatal to you. You may be plea<U+017F>ed to
remember, that there are not many daies pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince I fought in
your defence again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame enemies, whom I have this day
<U+017F>erved, and there is but little likelihood I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ince that time
have contracted any friend<U+017F>hip with them to prejudice the love
I have for you. For this man, <hi><U+017F>aid he, looking on Artaxus,</hi> whom
you would have me take notice of as King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he knows
how that it is but <U+017F>ome few minutes <U+017F>ince I fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw him, and
whether I di<U+017F>covered the lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire to be acquainted with him.
And for tho<U+017F>e others, <hi><U+017F>aid he, pointing to</hi> Megacles <hi>and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi>
you may have haply learnt from them, whether
they had not recovered me out of the waves into which I
had ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf from the top of the rock that covers us,
through the de<U+017F>pair which the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of you had put me into.
They can further tell you what trouble they had to make me
admit of life, and they know, whether it were out of any other
motive than that of gratitude, and a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the obligation I
ought them for their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances, that I took up arms in their
quarrel when they were <U+017F>et upon. The<U+017F>e truths cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to you, all tho<U+017F>e that hear me are now become my
enemies, <U+017F>ince they are tho<U+017F>e that did you violence, and yet I
appeal to them whether I affirm any thing which is not true.</p>

of this adventure, expected to <U+017F>ee what would be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of it
without <U+017F>peaking one word, and that all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>tood about him

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97242:84"/>
out of the regret it was to me that I could not relieve you, when
it hath been known, that in other very con<U+017F>iderable misfortunes,
to which my life hath been expo<U+017F>ed, I have never been charged
with want of con<U+017F>tancy to <U+017F>upport them, but the<U+017F>e very enemies
that hear me, know whether, upon their earne<U+017F>t intreaties, I have
prolonged my life out of any other de<U+017F>ire then that of making

bloudy revenge, here <U+017F>he might with no <U+017F>mall plea<U+017F>ure have looked
on this victime which the Prince <U+017F>acrificed to her, <U+017F>ince it was this
man that had <U+017F>eized her, and carried her in his armes into the
<U+017F>hip.</p>
                     <p>This <U+017F>udden di<U+017F>patching of <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus</hi> did a little cool the courage
of his companions; but it withall animated them to revenge him;
and the King, who had loved <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus</hi> very dearly, being extreamly
grieved at his fall, cryed out to his men to take heart, and would
have been in the head of them, had he been in his ab<U+017F>olute
<U+017F>trength, and if <U+017F>ome of his own, who would not have him to
hazard his life, had not <U+017F>tood in his way. But this they did partly
out of a de<U+017F>ire to plea<U+017F>e him, and the fear they were in at the <U+017F>ight
of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s dreadful <U+017F>word, and partly out of a certain repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
they felt in them<U+017F>elves to put to death a valiant Prince, who
not long before had <U+017F>o generou<U+017F>ly hazarded his life for their <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Tho<U+017F>e that were the mo<U+017F>t forward to <U+017F>econd <hi>Ari<U+017F>tus,</hi> met
with a de<U+017F>tiny, not much different from his, and he who was <U+017F>o
violent to be revenged for his brothers death, coming on a little
too ra<U+017F>hly, lo<U+017F>t his re<U+017F>entments, with his life, by a thru<U+017F>t which
for want of arms found a way into his belly, and which made him
fall down into a rivulet of his own bloud. The deaths of the<U+017F>e
two men made their companions more circum<U+017F>pect, and more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the length of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s <U+017F>word. The valiant Prince look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them with a certain contempt, and frightning them the
more by menacing ge<U+017F>tures; <hi>It is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a matter,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to
them, <hi>as you conceived it, to take away a mans life, who knows how
to defend it, the advantage of number and arms does not alwaies bring
victory with it, and if I dy this day, as it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I may, by your

Having <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words to them, he kept his former po<U+017F>ture,
that is, <U+017F>tood clo<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>hips <U+017F>ide to avoid being <U+017F>et upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and warding off the blowes which were made at him with
his buckler, he looked like lightning on his enemies, and when
any one of them in<U+017F>tigated either by <U+017F>hame or the cries of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus</hi>
grew more daring then his companions, he neglected not
either time or occa<U+017F>ion to make him repent his forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and
alwaies directed his <U+017F>word <U+017F>o fortunately and with <U+017F>uch force
and execution, that it ever proved either the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of death
or <U+017F>ome cruell wound. At la<U+017F>t <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> to whom this kind of
engagement was more familiar than to any of the re<U+017F>t, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hamed

cowardice and ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e, comes on before them, and, intending
to direct his <U+017F>troke at the Princes bare head, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> warded
it off with his buckler. But, having many adver<U+017F>aries to deale
with, and they directing <U+017F>everall blowes at him at the <U+017F>ame time,
he could not <U+017F>o well put off that of the Pirate, but that his <U+017F>word
<U+017F>liding down along the buckler fell upon his <U+017F>houlder, and gave
him a <U+017F>light wound. <hi>Zenodorus</hi> perceiving the Prince to be in
<U+017F>ome di<U+017F>order, would needs be at him again, and taking his <U+017F>word
with both hands, he lifted it up high in the air, with a de<U+017F>igne
and hope to cleave the Prince his head a<U+017F>under; but at the very
<U+017F>ame time the <U+017F>on of <hi>Juba,</hi> exa<U+017F>perated at the blow he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
gave him a back-blow with <U+017F>uch force, that the edge
of the <U+017F>word meeting with the Pirate at the wri<U+017F>ts, which were
not covered with any armes, cut them both off, <U+017F>o that both
hands and the <U+017F>word fell down at the feet of tho<U+017F>e that were
fighting. The unfortunate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
condition, was loath to live any longer, whether that
<U+017F>trange misfortune rai<U+017F>ed in him an aver<U+017F>ion for life, or that he
was per<U+017F>uaded that through his cruell wounds it would have run
out with blood. So that having remained <U+017F>ome little while as it
were in an irre<U+017F>olution what to do, and <U+017F>ent forth a dolefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
towards heaven, he of a <U+017F>udden flies at the Prince,
with a de<U+017F>igne to thru<U+017F>t him over-board into the <U+017F>ea. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he might have effected it, if the Prince perceiving he made
towards him, had not <U+017F>tepped a<U+017F>ide with <U+017F>o much agility, that
the de<U+017F>perate Pirate not meeting with any thing to <U+017F>tay him,
and thru<U+017F>ting forwards with the whole weight of his body fell
over the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell into the Sea, where having no hands to do him
any <U+017F>ervice in point of <U+017F>wimming, or to fa<U+017F>ten on any thing if

that it might come up time enough to relieve the Prince, if he

could not be in a condition to <U+017F>tand an engagement with tho<U+017F>e that
came again<U+017F>t him, e<U+017F>pecially, when the men he had le<U+017F>t, found it
<U+017F>uch a difficulty to take away the life of a <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on: <U+017F>o that
he was in a fear both of loo<U+017F>ing <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> without whom he did
not much care for life, and al<U+017F>o to loo<U+017F>e that very life again<U+017F>t
which he had armed <U+017F>uch powerful enemies. Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with this
fear, he looked all about him, and perceiving he was at no great
di<U+017F>tance from the <U+017F>hore, he had <U+017F>ome thought to quit the <U+017F>hip, and
accordingly to avoid a fight which mu<U+017F>t needs prove di<U+017F>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to him upon the <U+017F>ea. But this reflection was no <U+017F>ooner in
his mind, but he con<U+017F>idered withall that that flight into the land,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97242:88"/>
be<U+017F>ides the di<U+017F>honour of it, would prove fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that,
though he <U+017F>hould with much ado get a<U+017F>hore, yet could he not
get <hi>Cleopatra</hi> out of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el till he had di<U+017F>patched <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
out of the way. Nay all this granted as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and that he were
delivered of that ob<U+017F>tacle by the death of the Prince, he conceived
him<U+017F>elf le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>afe upon the land than he was upon the <U+017F>ea, it being
in a Country where all things were at the command of his enemies,
and where he was not likely to meet with any retiring place for
him<U+017F>elf, or any to conceal <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom he could not think of
for<U+017F>aking without death.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e difficulties, with a many others, coming immediately
into his imagination, made him <U+017F>oon quit the de<U+017F>ign he had at fir<U+017F>t
framed to him<U+017F>elf, and thereupon he took an ab<U+017F>olute re<U+017F>olution
to fight it out, and to defend his beautiful prize to the very la<U+017F>t
ga<U+017F>p. In this re<U+017F>olution, looking up to heaven with eyes <U+017F>parkling
with indignation, and an action expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the very depth of de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair;
<hi>Though gods and men,</hi> cryed he, <hi>and all the elements combine
to ruine me, yet <U+017F>hall they not abate a jot of my courage, and if I mu<U+017F>t
peri<U+017F>h, implacable de<U+017F>tinies! you <U+017F>hall find I can do it without either
ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e or remor<U+017F>e.</hi> With the<U+017F>e words, he returns to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
as conceiving it ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that he <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>patched
out of the way before the enemy were come up; and thinking
it now pa<U+017F>t time to dally, and that he was to make all the ha<U+017F>t he
could with him, he comes up to him in <U+017F>uch manner, that the
Prince, after he had warded off certain blows which the other had
made at him, <U+017F>truck him over the head with all the <U+017F>trength he
had. The goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the head-piece <U+017F>aved him from death;
but it was not able to hinder him from being <U+017F>tunnied in <U+017F>uch wi<U+017F>e,
that after he had <U+017F>taggered a while, he fell down within <U+017F>ome few
paces of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra. Megacles</hi> ran immediately to help
him, and <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> out of the excellency of her good nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what <U+017F>he ought her own bloud, came to him, and took
up the vi<U+017F>our of his head-piece, to give him a greater freedom of
breathing, and more aire.</p>
                     <p>While he continued in that condition, <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> running to
tho<U+017F>e that were <U+017F>til fighting again<U+017F>t <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and who po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly,
notwith<U+017F>tanding his miraculous re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, would have di<U+017F>patched
him at la<U+017F>t, comes up to them without any fear, and liftng up her
voice that <U+017F>he might be the better heard; <hi>Hold your hands,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he
to them, <hi>and if you expect any favour from tho<U+017F>e whom you <U+017F>ee coming
to our a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, make no further attempt on the life of a Prince,
on whom your own, will, within the<U+017F>e few minutes, depend. Tis the
onely way you have left you to <U+017F>ecure your lives, for you are not to
hope for any mercy, if you be take you not to your own Prince, and by
complyance make your <U+017F>elves worthy the pardon which I promi<U+017F>e you.</hi>
The<U+017F>e words proved effectual upon <U+017F>ome part of tho<U+017F>e that heard
them, and particularly upon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who were mo<U+017F>t of
them per<U+017F>ons of con<U+017F>iderable quality. The<U+017F>e were content to do

as the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e would have them, and, giving over <U+017F>ighting, went
to <U+017F>ee how their King did: but the Pirates, in whom the death of
their leader, and the de<U+017F>paire of pardon wrought a different effect,
were ob<U+017F>tinate in the de<U+017F>igne they had conceived to take away
<hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s life, and, though there were but one half of them
left, yet de<U+017F>paired not of revenging the death of <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prince, perceiving him<U+017F>elf ea<U+017F>ed, not onely of the greate<U+017F>t
part of this enemies, but al<U+017F>o of the mo<U+017F>t dangerous and mo<U+017F>t
valiant, valewed not much tho<U+017F>e that remained; and though he
mu<U+017F>t needs be very much weakned, as well by the continual action
he had been in, as by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>light wounds he had received, yet
was he now in greater hopes than ever of gaining the victory, and
delivering <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who had onely
been <U+017F>tunned with the heavy blow he had received, comes at length
to him<U+017F>elf, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance they had given him; but ere he had
<U+017F>o far recovered him<U+017F>elf as to know all that were about him,
and become ma<U+017F>ter of his <U+017F>trength, that is, before he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to di<U+017F>cern what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>hip, and to give out orders
about any thing, the other that was coming in to the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and which had already been known to be one of tho<U+017F>e
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was gotten <U+017F>o neer, that they could hear them
hollow that were within her, and in a manner di<U+017F>cern their
faces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> having got up, and taken his <U+017F>word again, looked about
him of all <U+017F>ides, and perceiving that all his hopes were vani<U+017F>hed,
he was convinced his final ruine was at no great di<U+017F>tance. He
<U+017F>ighed again for very grief and rage, as conceiving him<U+017F>elf not to
be in a condition either to execute his revenge, or keep <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
in his po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and therefore was at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e and irre<U+017F>olution,
that he knew not what <U+017F>ide to take. While in the interim, the
other <U+017F>hip came on <U+017F>till with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>peed and <U+017F>uch hollowing, that
it was out of all que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>he was an enemy, and indeed within a
few minutes after <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> perceived, in the head
of tho<U+017F>e that were coming to their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, that they might be known to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es
had rai<U+017F>ed up the vi<U+017F>ours of their head-pieces. If <hi>their</hi> joy was
extraordinary, the grief of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who, upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight knew
<hi>Alexander,</hi> was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e violent. He bla<U+017F>phemed again<U+017F>t Heaven,
and railed at his evil fortune, and that hateful <U+017F>ight filled him no
doubt, upon the fir<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ion thereof, with fatal re<U+017F>olutions.
<hi>We mu<U+017F>t peri<U+017F>h,</hi> cryed he, <hi>but it is but ju<U+017F>t we bury under our ruines

thy <U+017F>elf thou <U+017F>hall not laugh at the defeat of</hi> Artaxus. With the<U+017F>e
words he comes up to the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, and looking on them with
eyes red with bloud and fire, he put them into a greater fright
then ever they had known before; <hi>See here,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>the<U+017F>e are

that thy hope hath deluded thee, and all thou art to expect from
this enterprize, is the death of the<U+017F>e two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es. Thou

                     <p>The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> had made this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e without the lea<U+017F>t
interruption, while <hi>Alexander,</hi> <U+017F>eeing him in that cruuel po<U+017F>ture
again<U+017F>t the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, had given order to tho<U+017F>e that were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

ab<U+017F>olutely at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what to think of <U+017F>o terrible a <U+017F>pectacle. Upon
the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of that Barbarian, and his inhuman attempt, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
would have broke out again<U+017F>t him with all its violence;
but fearing, on the other <U+017F>ide, by his precipitation, to lo<U+017F>e what
was a thou<U+017F>and times dearer to him then his own life, his love
tyed up his hands, with con<U+017F>iderations as <U+017F>trong as the other, and
kept him in an irre<U+017F>olution full of perplexity. Thence it was,
that he not onely forbore interrupting <hi>Artaxus</hi> while he <U+017F>poke,
but al<U+017F>o when he had given over, was not able to make him any
reply, and onely looked on him with much confu<U+017F>ion, and as if he
had been in a trance. <hi>Marcellus</hi> was al<U+017F>o afraid for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
whom he loved as dearly as he could a Si<U+017F>ter, but his <U+017F>oul being
not, upon this occa<U+017F>ion, capable of <U+017F>uch a violence of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as

though we were to expect it, we think it much more <U+017F>upportable
then the life he prepares for us.</q>

                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> was in a manner <U+017F>atisfied that the<U+017F>e words of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>

as <U+017F>he expected they <U+017F>hould, and fearing to be <U+017F>urprized, he
lifted up his arme as he drew near to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who was gotten

the<U+017F>e words he ri<U+017F>es with his <U+017F>word in his hand from the place
where he was <U+017F>et, and rowling his dreadful eyes about him, gave
all notice as it were of the horrid re<U+017F>olution he had taken. The
two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, who were be<U+017F>t acquainted with his furious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
ran behind their defenders, and the Princes <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves

                     </p>
                     <p>Having uttered the<U+017F>e words, with a furious action he turned the
point of his <U+017F>word again<U+017F>t his brea<U+017F>t, and directing it to a certain
place where there was nothing of arms to oppo<U+017F>e its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, he fell
upon it <U+017F>o of a <U+017F>udden, that no man had the time to prevent him,
and that <U+017F>o effectually, as to his de<U+017F>ign, that the murdering <U+017F>word
meeting with no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, ran him quite through, and, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
through tho<U+017F>e parts which are mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the pre<U+017F>ervation
of life, deprived him of it in a moment. Though that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
King had drawn upon him<U+017F>elf the dete<U+017F>tation of all tho<U+017F>e that
were pre<U+017F>ent at his death; yet were there <U+017F>ome among them, who
could not but pitty his misfortune: and though <hi>Alexander</hi> were a
per<U+017F>on that of all men had the mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t ground to hate him, yet
was he extreamly troubled for him, even to the <U+017F>hedding of tears
at that deplorable adventure. <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> ran immediately to her
brother with a face over-flown with tears, and bewailed his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e
with all the lamentations, which an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of good nature could
put into a womans mouth. <hi>Cleopatra, Coriolanus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>
thought them<U+017F>elvs concerned in it meerly out of a con<U+017F>ideration of
genero<U+017F>ity, and not long after, they all jointly acknowledged the
ju<U+017F>tice of the gods in that example, and <U+017F>ubmitted to their will
in the puni<U+017F>hment of that cruel King. <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>till about the
body of <hi>Artaxus</hi> with <hi>Megacles</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the <hi>Armenians,</hi>
who had their lives given them upon the mediation of <hi>Cleopatra.
Cleopatra</hi> returned her thanks to <hi>Marcellus</hi> and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi>
for their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> not able to <U+017F>tand for wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e
by rea<U+017F>on of the continual action he had undergone for <U+017F>o long
time, and the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e he was in, through certain wounds he
had received, was <U+017F>ate down, and looked on what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97242:91"/>
di<U+017F>tracted by different reflections, when <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ca<U+017F>ting their eyes on him, knew him. Their a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment was
not <U+017F>mall at that accident, for <hi>Alexander,</hi> having been acquainted
by <hi>Marcellus</hi> with the pretended infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he was
no le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>urprized then <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to find him with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Now
<hi>Alexander,</hi> having ever loved the per<U+017F>on, and re<U+017F>pected the vertue
of the Son of <hi>Juba,</hi> thought not the ground he had to hate him
<U+017F>o great as <U+017F>hould oblige him to forget the e<U+017F>teem he <U+017F>ometimes
had had for him. But <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who<U+017F>e re<U+017F>entment proceeded from
a more violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, could not ab<U+017F>olutely moderate him<U+017F>elf in
that emergency, and looking accordingly on the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
with a countenance wherein might be <U+017F>een the lively characters of
his a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment: <q>What, Si<U+017F>ter, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> is the King of
<hi>Mauritania</hi> among you? And is that Prince, who is guilty of
<U+017F>o horrid an infidelity both again<U+017F>t you and me, <U+017F>o neer <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>

that without it, yours had come too late, and I had been
yet in the hands and power of the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> I never
que<U+017F>tioned, replies <hi>Marcellus,</hi> but that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t
valiant Prince upon earth; but we may as little doubt, for your
part and mine, but that of all men he is the mo<U+017F>t unfaithful both

reflections wherein his thoughts were employed before, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

There was nothing omitted in that affair, either as to <U+017F>olemnity

it hath rai<U+017F>ed in the heart of your friend, and that very ju<U+017F>tly,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having thus di<U+017F>burthened her thoughts by this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
<hi>Camilla,</hi> whom the vertue of that Prince had ever obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to <U+017F>ide with him, perceiving he was mute and immoveable
at the<U+017F>e reproaches, comes to him, and in few words acquainted

truth how all things were managed between <hi>Volu<U+017F>ius</hi> and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F><U+017F>adours.

fearing his <U+017F>ilence might be thought an argument of his guilt, he
comes nearer to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and <U+017F>etting one knee to the ground;
<q>Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> I humbly crave your pardon, for my
having charged you with any thing unju<U+017F>tly; I <U+017F>hould have
known, that you are ju<U+017F>t in all things, and thence have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that your change could not proceed but from a cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereto. I might haply, not without rea<U+017F>on, hope it from
your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that you would
have proved my advocate to your <U+017F>elf, and plead my cau<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t
the artifices and de<U+017F>ignes of my enemies. And this it was not
hard for you to take notice of, <U+017F>ince there was little likelyhood
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o much court the allyance and friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
when I was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of the throne of my Ance<U+017F>tors, having
<U+017F>lighted it in a time when I had no favour or fortune to hope
for but from him alone, or that I <U+017F>hould voluntarily offer him
the homage of my kingdomes after I had conquered them by
open war, and the defeat of his forces, when I had not long
before refu<U+017F>ed them of him upon tho<U+017F>e very termes. But, in
fine, <U+017F>ince I have not been <U+017F>o fortunate as to find that protection
in you, and that you have really been per<U+017F>waded that I had been
guilty of a ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o improbable as that, and, if I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume
to <U+017F>ay it, <U+017F>o di<U+017F>con<U+017F>onant to the other actions of my life,
it concernes me to endeavour my own ju<U+017F>tification, and to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

doubt, is the Authour of this cruell intrigue. I hope, through
the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the gods, to make my innocence apparent to
all, and am confident that within a <U+017F>hort time I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>pell all
the<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>ts of plots and prejudice. But, Madam, you may be
plea<U+017F>ed to remember, that when you bani<U+017F>hed me out of your
<U+017F>ight for ever, and pronounced that dreadfull <U+017F>entence, which
hath occa<U+017F>ioned all my lo<U+017F><U+017F>es, I was ma<U+017F>ter of two great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
which I came to pre<U+017F>ent you with, and that through the
de<U+017F>pair you put me into, you deprived me not onely of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
but even of the de<U+017F>igne I had to go and maintain them, as
no doubt I could have done again<U+017F>t all the forces of the
Univer<U+017F>e. Through that misfortune is it now come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e
that I have nothing left me, as having lo<U+017F>t, not onely the crowns
I had conquered, but al<U+017F>o the Friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> from whom
I was to hope for all I could expect. So that when I <U+017F>hall return
again into your <U+017F>ight, in a condition innocent enough to hope a
readmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion into your favour, I <U+017F>hall have no Crowne to offer you
nor indeed a refuge in any part of the earth, it being not <U+017F>o

ea<U+017F>ie for me to expect a <U+017F>econd revolt of my Subjects, after I

orders he hath <U+017F>etled in the Provinces <U+017F>ince his la<U+017F>t conque<U+017F>t

in order to my ju<U+017F>tification, <U+017F>o to <U+017F>atisfie both my love and my
duty, by both which I am equally obliged thereto: and when
I <U+017F>hall have effected it, I <U+017F>hall either, out of a complyance with
the will of the gods, not di<U+017F>turb a better fortune, which it is in

you, with honour, into her former favour and affection. They
are but the ju<U+017F>t rewards of your fidelity, if you have continued
in it, and the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your Kingdomes <U+017F>hall loo<U+017F>e you nothing in

                     <p>With the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he reached forth her hand to rai<U+017F>e him up,

after they had given her a little time to recover her <U+017F>elfe, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated

in <hi>Alexandria. Agrippa,</hi> under who<U+017F>e protection they had
ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, falls in love with <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> but out of con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

(generally known by the name of <hi>Cleomedon</hi>) comes to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
upon intelligence that Queen <hi>Candace</hi> was there,
with whom he hath a <U+017F>ecret interview in the night time. He
entertains her and <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> with a continuation of his Hi<U+017F>tory.
He gives battle, with 16000 men, to <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> who had 100000.
is left for dead in the field, but afterwards miraculou<U+017F>ly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who was left in a condition not much better.
The next day after the battel, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Lady,
coming into the Field to <U+017F>eek the body of her beloved <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
is brought al<U+017F>o to that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whom, as having
killed him, and not long before a Brother of hers, <U+017F>he would
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97242:96"/>
have run through with a dagger, but is prevented by <hi>Eteocles.</hi>
Making a <U+017F>econd attempt to do it, <U+017F>he finds <U+017F>omething in his
countenance, which being taken with, <U+017F>he hath compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on
him, cau<U+017F>ing him and <hi>Eteocles</hi> to be carryed to her Ca<U+017F>tle, where
they were nobly entertained, and recovered of their wounds.
<hi>Eurinoe,</hi> having given order for the enterrement of her dear
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> he miraculou<U+017F>ly recovers to life, and is brought by
<hi>Pelorus</hi> to a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters hou<U+017F>e of his, where he is <U+017F>ecretly cured, and
informed of all that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es at <hi>Eurinoe's.</hi> She falls in love
with <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whom <U+017F>he much pre<U+017F><U+017F>es to promi<U+017F>e her a mutual
affection: but he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in his former re<U+017F>olutions of vertue,
and con<U+017F>tancy towards <hi>Candace,</hi> all proves ineffectual. Several
conferences they had together to that purpo<U+017F>e, mo<U+017F>t of which are
over-heard by <hi>Teramenes,</hi> who thereupon conceives a great
e<U+017F>teem for <hi>Cleomedon.</hi> At la<U+017F>t <hi>Teramenes</hi> is reconciled to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
and by the mediation of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> they are married before
his departure thence; and, in requital of his good offices,
furni<U+017F>h him with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. He goes to <hi>Telemactrus</hi>
and <hi>Oni<U+017F>thenes,</hi> to whom he di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf, and acquaints

IN the mean time, the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e
of the <hi>Parthians</hi> were gotten into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
after that the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es had been di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into their
<U+017F>everal lodgings, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had already taken order
for the entertainment of the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> did the
like for the accommodation of <hi>Artaban.</hi> This latter,
though he were not looked upon as a per<U+017F>on of a royal rank,
as <hi>Tygranes</hi> was, yet was he treated with as much re<U+017F>pect as any of
tho<U+017F>e that wore Diadems; and the great reputation he had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<U+017F>uch as was already <U+017F>pread over the whole earth, added to the
gracefulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his countenance, and that maje<U+017F>tick aire which
was <U+017F>o remarkable in his per<U+017F>on, made <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Praetor of
<hi>Egypt</hi> con<U+017F>ider him as a man worthy all the reverence and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
that might be due even to the <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars.</hi> Though by an
extraordinary indulgence of good fortune he had come off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wounds, having been engaged in <U+017F>o great a fight as he was that
day, yet was he not <U+017F>o throughly recovered of tho<U+017F>e he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before, but that the action he had been in had weakned him
<U+017F>o much, as that he <U+017F>tood in need of <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t. <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> could have
wi<U+017F>hed he <U+017F>hould take his ea<U+017F>e for a certain number of daies; but,
not able to per<U+017F>wade him to it, by rea<U+017F>on of the impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility which
he urged there was he <U+017F>hould forbear waiting on her for <U+017F>o long
time, after he had <U+017F>o miraculou<U+017F>ly met with her again, <U+017F>he laid her
commauds on him not to <U+017F>tir out of his bed for that night, and
the be<U+017F>t part of the next day, though <U+017F>he did no <U+017F>mall violencce
to her <U+017F>elf meerly out of the tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he had for his health.
He obeyed her commands with that re<U+017F>pectful <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which,
notwith<U+017F>tanding his heat and fiercene<U+017F><U+017F>e, he had ever ob<U+017F>erved
towards her, and, receiving the lodgings appointed him, and the
Officers whom <hi>Cornelius</hi> ordered to waite on him, with abundance
of <U+017F>atisfaction and re<U+017F>pects, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over that night in his bed
with reflections much different from tho<U+017F>e which he had had, for
<U+017F>ome that preceded it. Certain it is, that that great <U+017F>oul, great
even among tho<U+017F>e that could pretend mo<U+017F>t to greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e, though
it were not immoderately <U+017F>ubject either to grief or joy, was at
this time <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of both: for as it had, in the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> made
tryal of the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>pight that a malicious fortune could do him;
<U+017F>o in the happy recovery of her, he had met with the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t
<U+017F>atisfaction he could be capable of.</p>

During the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant entertainments of his thoughts, reflecting
on the many extraordinary accidents that checquered his life, and
not a little delighted with the con<U+017F>ideration of tho<U+017F>e many victories
that had rai<U+017F>ed his fame to <U+017F>o a high pitch, and the noble demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations
of his affection to his Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, he could hardly for <U+017F>ome
time <U+017F>o much as think of the misfortunes he had already run
through, or the oppo<U+017F>ition he might for the future meet withall,
through either the cruelty of <hi>Phraates,</hi> or the trouble<U+017F>ome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
between him and the King of the <hi>Medes.</hi> All this <U+017F>ignified
very little with him, when it came into his mind that he had found
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> again, that, by many di<U+017F>coveries, he found her not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed
that <U+017F>he had met him, that he was within the <U+017F>ame walls with her,
and that in a place, where <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood not in fear of any thing from
either the authority or tyranny of <hi>Phraates.</hi> 
                        <q>O ye immortal gods,
<hi><U+017F>aid he at la<U+017F>t, directing his thoughts to Heaven with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
acknowledgment,</hi> O yee a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant deities, who have ever deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me out of tho<U+017F>e aby<U+017F><U+017F>es of misfortunes, whereinto an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably
malicious Fortune, and the ingratitude of men have
often forced me! I humbly acknowledge your power in this
miraculous effect of your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and I repine no longer for
what I have <U+017F>uffered, either from the hands of ungrateful men,
or from the contrary di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of my de<U+017F>tiny, <U+017F>ince you have been
plea<U+017F>ed at length to re<U+017F>tore me my <hi>Eli<U+017F>a.</hi> I have not forgotten
how much I am obliged to celebrate your divine a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances, not
onely for a many victories which have proved the means to rai<U+017F>e
me to <U+017F>ome name and rank in the World, but al<U+017F>o for the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
protection which you thought fit to afford me, as well
amid<U+017F>t the <U+017F>words of my enemies, as the angry waves. There is
therefore much le<U+017F><U+017F>e rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould forget, that, at the point of
de<U+017F>pair, you re<U+017F>tore my Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and with her tho<U+017F>e felicities
which are not <U+017F>ubject either to the incon<U+017F>tancy of Fortune or the
ingratitude of men</q>.</p>
                     <p>From this con<U+017F>ideration his thoughts were taken up with
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> and he began to reflect on the ob<U+017F>tacles and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
he might fear from him, and his unfortunate meeting with
him; and certainly, <U+017F>uch a reflection, had it happened at <U+017F>ome
other time might have moderated, if not di<U+017F>turbed, his joy, but,
as things <U+017F>tood now, it was not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable as to come into
ballance again<U+017F>t his pre<U+017F>ent happine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Whereupon, calling to
mind how that during the <U+017F>mall time he had been felicified with
the company of his <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> he had ob<U+017F>erved that her affections were
ab<U+017F>olutely devoted to him, and that <U+017F>he had all aver<U+017F>ion that could
be for <hi>

                           </gap>igranes,</hi> he could not but rai<U+017F>e his thoughts to a certain
confidence, that all the hindrance he might fear from that Rival
would not be able to injure his Fortune. The protection which
<hi>Agrippa</hi> had put him in hopes of amounted to <U+017F>o much, as to win
him into a belief, that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> would not any way oppo<U+017F>e him, and
the con<U+017F>tancy he had perceived in <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> towards him, though <U+017F>he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97242:97"/>
were not naturally guilty of too much forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e, made him
imagine that though all the world <U+017F>hould be again<U+017F>t him, yet was
his happine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>urely grounded on the affection of his Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,
that nothing could <U+017F>hake it. Amid<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e imaginations wherein
it might be <U+017F>aid he placed a certain felicity, his greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F>quiet,
was, that he wanted the <U+017F>ight and pre<U+017F>ence of his <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> for <U+017F>ome
few houres; and the impatience he was in to <U+017F>ee her again,
made him look on that one night, and a peice of the next
day as if it had been a year, <U+017F>o triviall <U+017F>eemed to him
the con<U+017F>ideration of his re<U+017F>t in compari<U+017F>on of that of his
Love.</p>
                     <p>But if his reflections troubled and interrupted his <U+017F>leep, that of
the great <hi>Agrippa</hi> might be <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>ubject to greater di<U+017F>tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had for <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> having already arrived to
its full <U+017F>trength, and being come to <U+017F>uch a height as that all the
force of his under<U+017F>tanding and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was not able to oppo<U+017F>e
it, the effects it had wrought in his <U+017F>oule were accordingly <U+017F>o vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that he could expect no other i<U+017F><U+017F>ue thereof but perpetuall
and inevitable di<U+017F>quiet. And though it had been meerly out of
the con<U+017F>ideration of his own vertue, which would not <U+017F>uffer him
to deny the doing of a good action, when an opportunity offered
it <U+017F>elf to do it, that he had protected <hi>Artaban,</hi> again<U+017F>t the armes
and power of <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and purely out of genero<U+017F>ity had taken
his part rather than that of the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> yet was it not
in his power to forbear looking on him as his Rivall, and that not
as a Rivall out of favour and <U+017F>lighted, as <hi>Tygranes</hi> was, but as one
much e<U+017F>teemed by <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and con<U+017F>equently as the only per<U+017F>on that
had been <U+017F>o fortunate as to engage her affections. He had, it
<U+017F>eems, that very day ob<U+017F>erved very evident demon<U+017F>trations of the
mutuall re<U+017F>pects that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between them. And whereas, on the
other <U+017F>ide, the revolutions which had happened in the Kingdome
of the Parthians and that of the Medes by the valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Artaban</hi> were of <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>equence as that they were
knowne all over the world; in like manner, his inclinations for
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and the ingratitude of <hi>Phraates,</hi> made no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e among
the Romanes and by that meanes was come to the eares of <hi>Agrippa</hi>
<U+017F>o that when he looked on <hi>Artaban</hi> he mu<U+017F>t needs con<U+017F>ider him
as that per<U+017F>on, who of all men was the mo<U+017F>t likely and mo<U+017F>t able to
cro<U+017F><U+017F>e him in his love, or rather as the only man that could ruine all
his pretences.</p>
                     <p>This con<U+017F>ideration made him <U+017F>igh for very griefe, and if his
vertue had not been <U+017F>o great, no que<U+017F>tion but he had repented
him of the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he had given him: but, having withall a great
and gallant <U+017F>oule, and all his re<U+017F>entments conformable to the noble
fame he had acquired, he could not be troubled that he had done
what he ought to have done, and thought it <U+017F>ufficient onely to
quarrell at the cro<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e of his Fortune without being guilty of
a wi<U+017F>h that <U+017F>hould any way derogate from his vertue. Nay, he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97242:98"/>
was not able to conceive any aver<U+017F>ion for <U+017F>uch a Rivall, and tho<U+017F>e
excellent qualities which might oblige him to fear <hi>Artaban,</hi> were
no le<U+017F><U+017F>e powerfull in obliging him to love him, as repre<U+017F>enting to
him, that he might by the <U+017F>ame means de<U+017F>erve the friend<U+017F>hip of
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> as he had obtained the love of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a.</hi> And yet all this
hindered not but that he wi<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elf loved by <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and all
the great vertue he was ma<U+017F>ter of, could not oppo<U+017F>e in him a
de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>o naturall to tho<U+017F>e that Love, nor prevaile with him to
quit <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> to <hi>Artaban,</hi> though he were very much in her favour,
and not unworthy her affections. He was <U+017F>atisfied that how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t
<U+017F>oever he might be to gain her love, all his endeavours
would prove ineffectuall, and yet his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion exa<U+017F>perated by
that kind of de<U+017F>pair <U+017F>eemed to grow more and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
and to <U+017F>eate it <U+017F>elf in his <U+017F>oule with more empire and
authority.</p>
                     <p>From this therefore he concluded; that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for
him to give over loving <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and thereupon re<U+017F>olved to do all
that lay in his power to force her inclinations from <hi>Artaban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> and
to give a check to the favour <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to afford him. But,
in regard that all his thoughts were comformable to honour and
genero<U+017F>ity, and out of a con<U+017F>ideration that he could not, without
prejudice to both, di<U+017F>turb a noble affection grounded on extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Services, and that, between per<U+017F>ons that had ca<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
under his protection, in a place where he had all power in
his own hands, and where, in all likelihood, he could not make u<U+017F>e
of his authority, without a certain kind of tyranny, he
<U+017F>ought but a meane to reconcile his <hi>Love</hi> to his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
and to manage the former without prejudice to the
latter.</p>
                     <p>Upon the<U+017F>e reflections he re<U+017F>olved to di<U+017F>pute the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
fairly with <hi>Artaban,</hi> without any advantage as to matter of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

<U+017F>ervices, and not make u<U+017F>e of his credit in the Empire, or the

de<U+017F>irous to engage with him in a combat; wherein all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is of his <U+017F>ide? And what quarrell can be ju<U+017F>tly have
again<U+017F>t me when I <U+017F>hall with no other force, than that of Love,
a<U+017F><U+017F>ault a heart already delivered up to his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>all, and that a
heart favourably prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed for him with all that may make
him happy, to my prejudice. I am not engaged to him either
upon any account of Friend<U+017F>hip, or obligation, and therefore
<U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>hould per<U+017F>wade me tamely to <U+017F>it down in
my own mi<U+017F>ery, out of a fear of thwarting his happine<U+017F><U+017F>e.
There are few per<U+017F>ons haply that have <U+017F>uch a command of their
inclinations, as to confine them<U+017F>elves to tho<U+017F>e rules which I
propo<U+017F>e to my <U+017F>elfe, and it is in Love rather than policy, and to
gain the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of what a man mo<U+017F>t affects, rather than to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97242:98"/>
gain a kingdome, that it is lawfull to employ all armes, and to
make u<U+017F>e of all manner of forces. And yet to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
I might make to my <U+017F>elfe, of having abu<U+017F>ed my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
again<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons to whom it is contrary, I will by no means
make u<U+017F>e of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus's</hi> favour, or the power I have in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but <U+017F>hall be content to be unhappy while I live, if
my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e cannot be effected by other waies than
tho<U+017F>e.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he recollected him<U+017F>elfe for <U+017F>ome few minutes,
as if he were extreamly well <U+017F>atisfied with the re<U+017F>olution he had
taken. But not long after, reflecting on the difficulty of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri<U+017F>e,
and the little hope he had to bring it to any effect:
<q>It is true, <hi>continued he,</hi> that by this cour<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould avoid that
remor<U+017F>e and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>cruples which might ri<U+017F>e in my mind, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing,
by my power, a man who<U+017F>e vertue is not inferiour to
my own: but, alas! if this be the way to quiet my con<U+017F>cience,
it is al<U+017F>o the onely cour<U+017F>e I can take to cru<U+017F>h my hopes; that is,
I undertake a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e whereof I cannot expect the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>hould be fortunate. <hi>Artaban</hi> is already very much in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and be<U+017F>ides the eminent <U+017F>ervices, whereby he
hath de<U+017F>erved her favour, he is otherwi<U+017F>e worthy of it upon
the account of the great excellencies of his per<U+017F>on, as much
as for the noble effects of his Love. So that there is very little
probability, that a Soule engaged not onely by a great merit
and very con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>ervices, but al<U+017F>o haply by a <U+017F>trong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
can ea<U+017F>ily be di<U+017F>engaged by a new affection, if I neglect
my advantages, (which alone may come into compari<U+017F>on
with tho<U+017F>e of my Rivall) and meerly upon the account of
merit deale with a merit, which is <U+017F>o far from being inferiour
to my own, that it hath already wrought in the <U+017F>oule of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a,</hi>
all that I could hope, or rather all that I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reflection troubled, and ca<U+017F>t him down very much; but
not long after taking encouragement from that little <U+017F>hadow of
hope which ever offers it <U+017F>elfe even to the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable;
<q>Why, <hi>added he,</hi> may it not be lawfull for me to hope? There
happen daily revolutions no le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>trange than what I am about
to undertake, and if a man may be pardoned a little <U+017F>elfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
upon <U+017F>ome certain occa<U+017F>ions, I may hope <U+017F>omething beyond
the ordinary rate of men. My per<U+017F>on is not unacceptable to
tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ee me, I have <U+017F>ome name among men, my ranke is
con<U+017F>iderable enough to work <U+017F>ome effect on the inclinations of
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> to the prejudice of a man, to whom heaven, though it
hath be<U+017F>towed on him great advantages, hath denied <U+017F>ome
part of tho<U+017F>e which it was but requi<U+017F>ite he <U+017F>hould have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Let us hope then if we
may pre<U+017F>ume to do it, or at lea<U+017F>t, let us not ab<U+017F>olutely de<U+017F>pair,
<U+017F>ince that hope is a vertue <U+017F>o much inclined to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t any one, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97242:99"/>
it hardly for<U+017F>akes the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate that are, though in their
greate<U+017F>t and la<U+017F>t extremities.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus were <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Artaban</hi> treated by love, (who at this
time, in a City where the <hi>Ptolomeys</hi> had reigned, was taken up with
nobler employments then haply he had met with in all the extent
of his Empire) while Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and Prince <hi>Philadelph,</hi>
were entertained by him with <U+017F>uch enjoyments as to all others
were incomprehen<U+017F>ible. The<U+017F>e two Lovers, who, after <U+017F>o many
traver<U+017F>es of fortune, and <U+017F>o many tempe<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>aw them<U+017F>elves at the
feet of their amiable Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, as it were in a <U+017F>ecure Haven, could
not without <U+017F>ome difficulty apprehend the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
when they reflected on their pa<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>eries, and may
in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort be <U+017F>aid to have found that, in the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of
their joy, which they had avoided in their afflictions and dangers.
All that day was <U+017F>pent in tran<U+017F>ports, <U+017F>uch as the prudence of their
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es would have moderated, though ineffectually; and
though tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> <U+017F>hould, proportionably to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
and the accidents had happened to him, (which indeed
had been of the mo<U+017F>t dangerous and extraordinary) have expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
in all probability <U+017F>omething more vehement then could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Philadelph;</hi> yet was it certain, that in the
<U+017F>oul of the Prince of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>omewhat that argued
a greater tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility of affection. For, this <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
having happened equally to both that they had met with
the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es they adored, and whom they <U+017F>ought out <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly,
<hi>Philadelph</hi> had this advantage, that now he had by many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
demon<U+017F>trations di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elf to be admitted to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e
which he was not before a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of, and found that his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Delia,</hi> who, while they were in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> could never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
to declare what <U+017F>entiments <U+017F>he had for him, made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to afford him, even in the pre<U+017F>ence, and with the con<U+017F>ent, of
her Brother, the greate<U+017F>t proofs of affection he could have de<U+017F>ired,
from a vertue, <U+017F>uch as was that of <hi>Delia.</hi> Above a hundred times
that day had he embraced her knees, with expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of love
particular to his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and the mode<U+017F>t <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> mildly putting
him back, could not but with joy ob<U+017F>erve the continuation of that
noble affection, whereof he had given her <U+017F>o many obliging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trations
in <hi>Cilicia.</hi> The more he called to mind tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant
entertainments, the more it added to his acknowledgments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omuch,
that the fair <hi>Olympia,</hi> whom <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had already
acquainted with all the particulars of their Hi<U+017F>tory, conceiving
an affection towards <hi>Philadelph,</hi> upon the account had been given
her of his generous way of proceeding, took occa<U+017F>ion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> more and more in the re<U+017F>entments <U+017F>he had
thereof.</p>
                     <p>Yet was not this felicity of <hi>Philadelph</hi> without <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>turb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
for the experience he had of the King of <hi>Armenia</hi>'s di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition,
(which was <U+017F>uch as admitted no reconciliation with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97242:99"/>
put him, not without <U+017F>ome ground, into a fear he might
refu<U+017F>e his allyance, and, out of the hatred he had him for his
hou<U+017F>e, rai<U+017F>e him <U+017F>ome new difficulties. <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> her <U+017F>elf was not
ab<U+017F>olutely free from that fear, and could not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph,</hi>
when he di<U+017F>covered his to her: but <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> gave him
the be<U+017F>t con<U+017F>olations and a<U+017F><U+017F>urances he could, by promi<U+017F>ing him
that he would further his intere<U+017F>ts as much as lay in his power,
even though the King his Brother <U+017F>hould oppo<U+017F>e them, and that
he would peri<U+017F>h rather then that <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> <U+017F>hould be any other mans
then <hi>Philadelph.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, when it came to the wor<U+017F>t, they had this
cour<U+017F>e to gain the con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> <U+017F>till left them, which was
to make u<U+017F>e of the authority of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who had <U+017F>uch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that he could not deny him any
thing, having <U+017F>ome intentions, to that very end, to ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves
under the protection of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who had <U+017F>ometimes proffered it
them, and making no doubt but that he would employ the utmo<U+017F>t
of his intere<U+017F>t to effect their quiet, not onely upon their own
intreaty, but al<U+017F>o upon the recommendation of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had
promi<U+017F>ed to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them with all the power he had with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
The <U+017F>ame mediation they thought would prove effectual
with the King of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who in all probability would gladly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the de<U+017F>ires of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> though, on that <U+017F>ide, all that was to
be done was to <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> in regard <hi>Philadelph</hi> was fully
re<U+017F>olved not to be troubled at any ob<U+017F>tacles, which through the
means of the King his Father, might any way delay his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> his trouble was much le<U+017F><U+017F>e, as being not
obliged, as <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> was, to be guided by the will of his Brother,
and knowing no rea<U+017F>on he could alledge to di<U+017F>approve the allyance
of <hi>Olympia.</hi> However, he hoped he <U+017F>hould not want <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars</hi>
Authority, if it were requi<U+017F>ite, and doubted not but he <U+017F>hould find
him favourable in an occa<U+017F>ion which of its <U+017F>elf was <U+017F>ufficiently
<U+017F>uch. The con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Adallas</hi> he <U+017F>tood not at all upon, as thinking
it unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and, be<U+017F>ides that he had already given it, he had,
by the incon<U+017F>tancy of his proceedings, given them but too clear a
di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation from all ordinary proceedings. The greate<U+017F>t regret he
now had, was, that he wanted a Crown to pre<U+017F>ent <hi>Olympia</hi> withall,
as <hi>Adallas</hi> had <U+017F>ometimes ca<U+017F>t it in his di<U+017F>h. For though that
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>eemed to be very well <U+017F>atisfied with his pre<U+017F>ent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to prefer his per<U+017F>on before all the Empires of the World,
yet had it been no <U+017F>mall difficulty to him to dige<U+017F>t the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure
he conceived thereat, had there not been a certain hope left, that
with the help of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>word which had defended <hi>Thrace</hi> with
<U+017F>o much valour, he might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly rai<U+017F>e <hi>Olympia</hi> to the dignity of
her Ance<U+017F>tors. Be<U+017F>ides, it mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome grief to him, to
ob<U+017F>erve, in the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es countenance, the alteration, which her
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>ufferings had wrought therein; but he doubted not
but that in an age, <U+017F>uch as was that of <hi>Olympia,</hi> joy might recover
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97242:100"/>
what <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e had taken away, nay, he was further of opinion,
that the change which her condition had received that very day,
had in that <U+017F>mall <U+017F>pace of time retrived no <U+017F>mall part of her
beauty.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e four, mutually loving, and mutually beloved per<U+017F>ons,
having thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the day together, under<U+017F>tood at night, and not
long after the return of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> <U+017F>ome part of what had
happened to them, and how that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had
almo<U+017F>t been carryed away: but what they heard was with <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and confu<U+017F>ion. And therefore <U+017F>ince it was very late, &amp; that
they were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were <U+017F>afely arrived in the palace

being only to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e how much they concerned them<U+017F>elves in
their adventure, and their de<U+017F>ires to be acquainted with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Candace,</hi> and the fair <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> being retired to
the lodgings appointed them, after they had endured the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation
of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of an houre, were
no <U+017F>ooner left alone with the women that attended them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them<U+017F>elves delivered of the company that had hindred
them from entertaining one another when they had the greate<U+017F>t
de<U+017F>ire and opportunity to do it, they cau<U+017F>ed their chamber door
to be made fa<U+017F>t, that they might di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with greater privacy
and liberty. After they had looked upon one the other, with
eyes wherein might be perceived <U+017F>ome part of what they had to
<U+017F>ay, they embraced one another with as much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as if
it had been a long time <U+017F>ince they had met. Whereupon, <U+017F>itting
down together upon a bed, <hi>Candace</hi> began fir<U+017F>t to <U+017F>peak, and pre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing <hi>Eli<U+017F>a's</hi> hand between her own, with an action expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the

                        <q>No more of that, I be<U+017F>eech you, <hi><U+017F>aies Candace, interrupting
her,</hi> I do not expect any acknowledgments, from you, of an
affection, which, being but too much your due, the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
I make you thereof cannot be exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive, nay I que<U+017F>tion not but
your merit will force as much from all the World be<U+017F>ides. But
<U+017F>ince it is lawful for me to rejoice with you, now that all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of your weeping is taken away; do you not expect I <U+017F>hould
reproach you with a felony you are guilty of towards me, for
having <U+017F>tollen from me a man, who<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t inclinations, if I am
not much mi<U+017F>taken, were directed to me? And con<U+017F>equently you
will give me leave to charge you with the trick you put upon me,
in that, when you related to me the great actions of <hi>Artaban,</hi>
you would not let me know that it was <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and that, when
I gave you an account of the fir<U+017F>t actions of <hi>Britomarus,</hi> you
would not tell me it was your <hi>Artaban.</hi>

                        <q>You charge me with two things, <hi>replyed the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> whereof
I <U+017F>hall find it no great difficulty to clear my <U+017F>elf. For the former,
which is, that I have robbed you of the heart of <hi>Artaban,</hi> I am
to tell you, that the age and condition he was of when he was
with you, con<U+017F>idered, there is little probability he <U+017F>hould lift up
his eies <U+017F>o high as you; and that further, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that might
happen, the treatment he received from you, <hi>continued <U+017F>he <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
might haply di<U+017F>place you out of his heart, <U+017F>o that there
might not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity he <U+017F>hould meet with <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi>
the more to alienate his inclinations from you. And for the latter,
which is, that I had not di<U+017F>covered to you that <hi>Artaban</hi> was the
<U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on with <hi>Britomarus,</hi> I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that I have ever
been ignorant of it as well as your <U+017F>elf; that <hi>Artaban</hi> never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with any thing that had happened unto him before
I knew him, and that, being <U+017F>atisfied that his greate<U+017F>t glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
in the memorable actions he had done, whereof tho<U+017F>e of
mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence we had the knowledge of, I was never guilty
of a curio<U+017F>ity to know any more of his fortune then he was
plea<U+017F>ed of him<U+017F>elf to communicate to me, out of a fear of
engaging him in a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which he <U+017F>hould take no great
delight in.</q>

                        <q>I am very much troubled, <hi>added the Queen of Aethiopia,</hi> that
I have acquainted you with that particularity of the fir<U+017F>t begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of his life, though it di<U+017F>cover as much of the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
his courage, as the gallant actions he hath done <U+017F>ince, and could
I have thought that <hi>Britomarus</hi> was <U+017F>ometime to be <hi>Artaban,</hi> I
<U+017F>hould not have let you known how he had lived with me, in a
condition not proportionable to the rank which he now de<U+017F>erves
to be in among men. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your your <U+017F>elf, <hi>replyed Eli<U+017F>a coldly,</hi>
that you have not done him any ill office by that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
that <hi>Artaban,</hi> having onely told us that he was of noble birth,
hath not been with you in any employment, which might dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
ought from the nobility of his blood. On the other <U+017F>ide,
<hi>added <U+017F>he, with an action more free and cheerful,</hi> I <U+017F>hall not blu<U+017F>h
when I tell you, that you put me into no <U+017F>mall joy, when you
let me know that <hi>Britomarus</hi> had had <U+017F>ome inclinations for
you; and, if I <U+017F>hould think it any mi<U+017F>fortune or malice of my
de<U+017F>tiny to have complyed with the affection of a man, who<U+017F>e
birth is di<U+017F>proportionable to my own, I <U+017F>hould have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
withal, that I were not the fir<U+017F>t of my rank and quality to
whom he had addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, and thence fall into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration,
that he might very well lift up his eyes to me, when he
had had the confidence to do it, you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This were but a very <U+017F>light comfort, <hi>replyed the Queen,</hi> but
indeed you <U+017F>tand not in any need of it, <U+017F>ince the vertue of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban</hi>
is <U+017F>uch as may both rai<U+017F>e him to Crowns, and without

he hath for you, and the con<U+017F>ideration he may have of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
I made to him to that purpo<U+017F>e, there is <U+017F>o much advantage
in the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> as that he will not onely de<U+017F>ire it,
but endeavour by all wayes to purchace it; nay I dare further
promi<U+017F>e you upon the experience I have of the genero<U+017F>ity of
<hi>Artaban,</hi> that, if ever any occa<U+017F>ion offer it <U+017F>elf, he <U+017F>hall with the

                        <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> having <U+017F>poken to this effect, <hi>Candace</hi> <U+017F>pent a few minutes
as it were in a deep recollection, not making her any an<U+017F>wer at
all. At la<U+017F>t, awaking as it were out of it, and lifting up her head,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>poke to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e with much more earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e then <U+017F>he

how that when <hi>Tigranes</hi> would have carried you away, you had
been relieved by a certain man that laid him groveling on the

                        <q>Tis very right, Madam,
<hi>replyed the Prence<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> I have been relieved by a very miraculous

per<U+017F>on: one that mu<U+017F>t certainly be <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> <U+017F>ince it was not
<hi>Artaban.</hi> The di<U+017F>traction and trouble I was in hindred me
from taking better notice of him, onely thus much I can

rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome wound or <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e; that he <U+017F>eemed to be much
about the age of <hi>Artaban,</hi> and though I cannot haply
<U+017F>peak of <hi>Artaban</hi> without partiality, yet methinks, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uring
all things by the little notice I could take of him
in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, that either in point of beauty or

                        <q>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

than <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> that you received that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as being <U+017F>atisfied
that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it be <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> no man can come <U+017F>o near, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>e

it plea<U+017F>e the gods, my mo<U+017F>t amiable Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e! to afford me a

really he and no other, who had done us that <U+017F>ervice. And
this I the rather wi<U+017F>h, not onely out of a reflection that you
had received it from a Prince I infinitely love, and could not do
me the like more to my <U+017F>atisfaction in my own per<U+017F>on then he
hath in yours, but al<U+017F>o out of a con<U+017F>ideration that this action
might in <U+017F>ome part take away the aver<U+017F>ion which <hi>Artaban</hi> hath
for him, and might prove a likely means of a reconciliation,
and as it were a <U+017F>hort introduction to that Friend<U+017F>hip which we
would e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h between them, as by fortune and the <U+017F>ympathy

owner of it was in no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>turbance and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment. <hi>Candace</hi>
having looked upon her, knew by her demeanour that <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ay to her: whereupon, cau<U+017F>ing her to come nearer,
<U+017F>he commanded her to di<U+017F>cover before the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e the cau<U+017F>e of
that di<U+017F>turbance which was <U+017F>o apparent in her countenance. <hi>Clitia</hi>
having looked about her, and perceiving there was none in the

the Queen by the hand, with a certain unu<U+017F>uall eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e;
Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> the newes I am to acquaint you with, is,
no doubt, the be<U+017F>t I could ever bring you; but indeed it is <U+017F>o
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97242:102"/>
great that you may well pardon the di<U+017F>turbance it hath put me
into and which you took notice of. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> is in this pallace,
nay is come up upon the Terrace, and <U+017F>taies at your chamber-door.
O ye heavenly Powers! <hi>Clitia, <U+017F>aies the Queen, in a
manner out of her <U+017F>elf,</hi> what do<U+017F>t thou tell me? Is <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> at
my chamber-door? He is, replies <hi>Clitia,</hi> in the little Gallery
which abutts upon the terrace, where he expects my return
and your commands to waite on you. Taking advantage of the
night and the confu<U+017F>ed number of per<U+017F>ons that are in this palace
he hath made a <U+017F>hift to get in; and being acquainted with all
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the place, as having not onely been born here,
but <U+017F>pent his youth in it, he hath without any difficulty got to
your lodgings, and hath walked upon the terrace, till <U+017F>uch
time as he <U+017F>aw me appear, and, by the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I had with
<hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> knew my voice. Whereupon, having called me
<U+017F>oftly by my name, he acquainted me with his own, and not
long after with his per<U+017F>on, whereof I had an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>o well
graven in my memory, that it would not have been very
hard for me to have di<U+017F>cerned him in the greate<U+017F>t darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Clitia</hi> gave this account of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> the beautifull
Queen was in a manner overwhelmed with an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of joy,
which, by a plea<U+017F>ant authority, got the dominion of her Soule; and,
though fear and di<U+017F>quiet endeavoured to di<U+017F>turb it, yet was there
a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity they <U+017F>hould give place to the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>allies of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend their effect, till the fir<U+017F>t violence of the other were
<U+017F>pent. The Queen, ca<U+017F>ting one arme about <hi>Clitia's</hi> neck, <hi>Ah</hi>
Clitia, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her, <hi>it is certainly decreed, that it is from you
I mu<U+017F>t expect all the mo<U+017F>t happy tidings, and it was you that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
brought me word into the garden at</hi> Meroe, <hi>of the life
and return of</hi> Cae<U+017F>ario, <hi>at a time when I bewailed his death, and that
I had renounced all the enjoyments of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words, <U+017F>he would have put a hundred
que<U+017F>tions to <hi>Clitia,</hi> and that all of a <U+017F>udden, upon that accident:
but <U+017F>he told her, that the time <U+017F>he had was to be otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>pent,
and that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve either to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> at the place where
he expected her return, or permit him to come into the chamber.
Now was it that fear began to di<U+017F>turb her joy; and if, on the one
<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he were <U+017F>atisfied to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o near the Prince <U+017F>he
dearly loved, <U+017F>he trembled, on the other, when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered,
that he was in a Palace whereof <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus's</hi> Lieutenant had the
command, and that a place where he mu<U+017F>t expect no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than
to lay down his life, if he were di<U+017F>covered. This fear made her
to <U+017F>hake again, and put her to <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e that <U+017F>he knew not what
re<U+017F>olution to take, looking <U+017F>ometimes on <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes on <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
as if it had been to a<U+017F>k their advice what <U+017F>he were be<U+017F>t to do.
The fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who had received <U+017F>o great
con<U+017F>olations from the Queen, together with <U+017F>uch remarkeable
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97242:102"/>
demon<U+017F>trations of Friend<U+017F>hip, conceived her <U+017F>elf extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not onely in the joy, but al<U+017F>o in the fear which <U+017F>he now
<U+017F>trugled with, and would have been as glad as the other to find
out a way to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> with as little danger as might be. But,
after they had continued for <U+017F>ome time in uncertainty and at a
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be taken, they at la<U+017F>t thought it the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t
way that he <U+017F>hould be brought into the chamber, it being then
<U+017F>uch a time of the night that it was not likely they <U+017F>hould be
troubled with any more vi<U+017F>its, e<U+017F>pecially there being convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
enough to hide him in ca<U+017F>e it were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and that <hi>Clitia</hi>
proffered, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had brought him into the chamber, to go
out upon the terrace along with <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> and to walk there a
while, to <U+017F>ee if any body came by whom they might be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed.
Be<U+017F>ides all which, it made <U+017F>omething for the <U+017F>ecurity of the Prince
that he was, not onely, not known in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but al<U+017F>o his
death was more firmly believed there, then in any other part of
the world. Upon all the<U+017F>e grounds <U+017F>ummed up together, yet not
without a great deale of doubt and terrour, the Queen comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Clitia</hi> to go and fetch him in, whereupon <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> thinking her
<U+017F>elfe obliged in di<U+017F>cretion and civility to go into her own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that they might be at a greater freedome in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
would have done it, but <hi>Candace</hi> embracing her would
not permit it, and entreated her to be pre<U+017F>ent at her felicity,
as <U+017F>he had been at the happy meeting between her and her
<hi>Artaban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> at the entreaty of <hi>Candace</hi> <U+017F>taies in the room, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after <hi>Clitia</hi> returns, bringing along with her the <U+017F>on of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ar</hi>
into the chamber. At that fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, the<U+017F>e two excellent
<U+017F>oules felt in a moment all that a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>uch as theirs could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in a longer <U+017F>pace of time, and their fir<U+017F>t looks communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one to another, of an in<U+017F>tant, what their hearts meant of
greate<U+017F>t tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever the Prince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at the door, the Queen ran towards him, with an action,
whence he might ea<U+017F>ily infer, how welcome his pre<U+017F>ence was to
her; and the <U+017F>on of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hands and embraced
her knees with <U+017F>uch tran<U+017F>portations of joy, as might well convince
her that his Love had not admitted of the lea<U+017F>t diminution or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion.
<hi>Candace,</hi> after <U+017F>he had embraced him very earne<U+017F>tly with
both her armes, while he was yet in that <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive po<U+017F>ture, rai<U+017F>ed
him up, and entertained him with all tho<U+017F>e Care<U+017F><U+017F>es which were
<U+017F>uitable to her dignity and mode<U+017F>ty, con<U+017F>idering withall the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of her affection. During the fir<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<U+017F>atisfaction and joy, their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was accordingly confu<U+017F>ed,
and incoherent; but when the violence of tho<U+017F>e were over, <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace,</hi>
retreating <U+017F>ome few paces back, as it were to take the
better notice of the Prince; <q>What <hi>Cleomedon, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi>
the gods it <U+017F>eems have thought fit to re<U+017F>tore you to me, after <U+017F>o
many dangers as I had run through my <U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>o many
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97242:103"/>
others wherein I had left you?</q> 
                        <q>But, Madam, <hi>replies the Prince,</hi>
it was then decreed I <U+017F>hould find you, after I had <U+017F>o unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
lo<U+017F>t you, and what is more, I do not onely find you living,
and full of goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e for me, but I meet with you in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in the Palace of my Fathers; and in that very Chamber, wherein
I drew the fir<U+017F>t mouthful of air, and <U+017F>aw the fir<U+017F>t beams of light.</q>
                        <q>Tis an accident, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>replies Candace,</hi> that <U+017F>peaks
<U+017F>omething extraordinary, and if you are <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at it, I mu<U+017F>t
needs be not a little moved thereat. O how does this <U+017F>econd
life which I here receive, <hi>added the Prince,</hi> make the Palace of
the <hi>Ptolomey's</hi> much more dear and precious in my apprehen<U+017F>ion
then the former which I ought it, and how ea<U+017F>ily can I bear with
the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of the command of it when I find therein what is a
thou<U+017F>and times more dear to me then thou<U+017F>ands of Empires and
thou<U+017F>ands of lives.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he would have added much more, to the <U+017F>ame
effect, and the beautifull Queen, who<U+017F>e affection was not inferiour
to his, though, out of the civility and re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>uitable to
her <U+017F>ex, <U+017F>he moderated her <U+017F>elf the more, looked on him with a
certain delight, and had plea<U+017F>antly <U+017F>econded him her <U+017F>elf in the
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his love, had <U+017F>he not thought it unhand<U+017F>ome to
<U+017F>uffer any more, before the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> till <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi>
had taken notice of her and <U+017F>aluted her. Upon that account,
mildly interrupting him, <U+017F>he obliged him to turn towards <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi>
and prepared him to <U+017F>alute her as the greate<U+017F>t Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e upon
earth, and the be<U+017F>t friend <U+017F>he had in the World. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> however
he might be tran<U+017F>ported at the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Candace,</hi> was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed,
and in a manner dazled at that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> and, coming neer her with
a re<U+017F>pect, which her admirable beauty, and the words of <hi>Candace</hi>
ea<U+017F>ily forced him into, <U+017F>aluted her with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as the
mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>iderable of mankind might do the heire<U+017F><U+017F>e of the throne
of the <hi>Ar<U+017F>acides,</hi> and received from her all the civility <U+017F>he could
have done him, had he been po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>our of the Empire. He was
not at all <U+017F>urprized to meet with <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> whom he knew before to be
in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and with <hi>Candace,</hi> but looking more earne<U+017F>tly in her
face, he thought he had <U+017F>een her that very day once before, and
the fair <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> taking more particular notice of him, di<U+017F>covered in
his, that he was the <U+017F>ame man whom <U+017F>he was talking of <U+017F>ome
few minutes before, and who had that day relieved her again<U+017F>t the
violence of the King of <hi>Media.</hi> She no <U+017F>ooner perceived it, but
but her gratitude and acknowledgment working their effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, <U+017F>he turned towards <hi>Candace,</hi> with a countenance which
partly expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had of that obligation. <hi>Madam,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her, <hi>our wi<U+017F>hes are accompli<U+017F>hed, and if you find in this
Prince a per<U+017F>on infinitely dear to you, I find in him, that of my
valiant defender, and look on him accordingly as one whom I ow,
not onely my liberty, but al<U+017F>o the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e I have to be bear with
you.</hi>

                        <hi>The<U+017F>e words put the Prince into a mode<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h, and receaving

have done no more for you then you might have received from any

                     <p>Having thus expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to

not <U+017F>uffer him to entertain any <U+017F>uch thought, and after <U+017F>he had

left for dead, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for <U+017F>uch in my apprehen<U+017F>ion, as you did

                        <p>I Mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that in the battle wherein, with 16000.
men, the greate<U+017F>t part wounded and unfit for <U+017F>ervice, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with an Army of 100000. I did not do like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
General, or a man that had before commanded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and gained Victories. But it is al<U+017F>o to be acknowledged,
that it was not out of any hope of victory, that I came into the
field, but meerly out of a de<U+017F>ire to dye, proceeding from the de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
whereto the misfortunes of my great Queen had reduced
me, and to endeavour even at my death to <U+017F>hake, if not overthrow,
the perfidious u<U+017F>urper of her Crown and Liberty. Be<U+017F>ides, having
con<U+017F>idered all things, I found my <U+017F>elf not in a condition to make
my party good by retreating before the army of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> which
was come of a <U+017F>udden upon us into that very field, where not
many dayes before I had defeated 35000. men, and killed <hi>Antenor,</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> by whom they were commanded. I <U+017F>hall
not therefore <U+017F>pend any further time to ju<U+017F>tifie that action, which
will be thought more pardonable, among per<U+017F>ons prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by a
violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>uch as was that of mine, then among per<U+017F>ons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of war; and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>hall onely
tell you, that I was not fortunate enough to effect what I had
undertaken, though I had the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> fall in
the mid<U+017F>t of his men with two or three wounds about him, and
had this comfort in my misfortune, that, with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my
own; I <U+017F>aw the field covered with a number of carka<U+017F>es three
times greater then that which I could make when I fir<U+017F>t came
into it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="205" facs="tcp:97242:105"/>
At la<U+017F>t it was my lot to fall, loaden with wounds, among<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e that covered the ground with their carka<U+017F>es, and, as my
good fortune would have it, my faithfull Governour <hi>Eteocles,</hi>
who <U+017F>till kept as near me as he could, having fought it out a little
longer, fell al<U+017F>o not far from me, with <U+017F>uch wounds about him,
as had deprived him of all <U+017F>ence and apprehen<U+017F>ion. The Enemy
<U+017F>pent the remainder of the day in <U+017F>hipping the dead, and in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
or burning their friends, but in regard that about that place
where we were, the air was grown a little infectious by rea<U+017F>on of
the precedent battle, the Generalls thought not fit to make any
longer <U+017F>tay there, and thereupon marching all away in the night,
they encamped at a good di<U+017F>tance thence upon the way to <hi>Meroe</hi>
in<U+017F>omuch that there were none left in the Fields but the
dead, or at lea<U+017F>t what were thought <U+017F>uch by tho<U+017F>e that left
them.</p>
                        <p>Now the wounds of <hi>Eteocles</hi> proving not very great, and that
his weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e proceeded not <U+017F>o much from their danger as the
great lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood he had undergone, he made a <U+017F>hift to recover
him<U+017F>elf a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as it was night, and I am in this extreamly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him, that e're he had be<U+017F>towed many minutes to reflect
on the condition he was in him<U+017F>elf, he came to <U+017F>ee what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me. He <U+017F>ought me out, and with much ado found
me, notwith<U+017F>tanding the darkene<U+017F><U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e I was not far from
him, and crawling along as he could to get a little nearer me, he
came and felt me all over, trying by all the waies he could whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any life in me. The cold air of the night <U+017F>tayed
the bleeding of my wounds, in<U+017F>omuch, that <hi>Eteocles</hi> finding me
cold as ice all over, his fir<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ions concluded me ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed this world, but at la<U+017F>t laying his hand on my brea<U+017F>t,
he found by the palpitation of my heart, that there were <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>mall remainders of life in me. The weak hope which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
di<U+017F>covery rai<U+017F>ed in him, filled him with all the joy he
could, in that condition, be capable of, and though he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of paines about me to recover me to <U+017F>ome degree of
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, yet all his endeavours proved ineffectuall, in<U+017F>omuch
that the whole night, which at that time of the year, was of the
<U+017F>horte<U+017F>t, was over e're he could do any good with me. He many
times endeavoured to get upon his feet, and to go <U+017F>eek out
<U+017F>ome held, but his weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e was <U+017F>uch that he was not able, and
e're he could halfe get up, he fell down again by me. I <U+017F>hall not
trouble you either with the complaints that fell from him, or
the griefe it was to him, that he could not effect what he
de<U+017F>ired, and it were but to make my relation the more tedious to
in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon <U+017F>uch frivolous particulars.</p>
                        <p>The Sun was gotten into his chariot when I fir<U+017F>t began to open
my eies, and to breath, in <U+017F>uch manner that <hi>Eteocles</hi> perceived it.
He immediately creeps neerer my face, almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elfe
for joy, gave me <U+017F>o many ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>poke to me with <U+017F>o much
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97242:106"/>
earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that at la<U+017F>t he ab<U+017F>olutely recovered me to life again.
I began to feele and to <U+017F>ee, but had not the power to <U+017F>tir, and
though I <U+017F>aw <hi>Eteocles,</hi> yet did I not perfectly know him, but as
it were by <U+017F>ome broken remainders of an Idaea halfe forced out
of my memory. In the mean time he perceived it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for him any way to relieve me, and though he <U+017F>aw I was come to
my <U+017F>elfe, yet did he in a manner put it out of all que<U+017F>tion that I
would die for want of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and, out of the fear he was in
it might <U+017F>o come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, he importuned heaven with cries and
exclamations, and did all that lay in his power to call in <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
to our reliefe. Yet were they not his cries that wrought
that effect; but it happened by an adventure very <U+017F>trange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,
whereof, for many rea<U+017F>ons, I thought fit to give the
Queen but a <U+017F>lender and imperfect account, but <U+017F>hall now relate at
large, <U+017F>ince it hath been your plea<U+017F>ure to command it from
me.</p>
                        <p>I had already made a <U+017F>hift to open my eies fully, though all I
could do was onely to <U+017F>tir them a little, when <hi>Eteocles</hi> heares the
neighings of certain hor<U+017F>es and the noi<U+017F>e of their going, which
made him imagine that there were <U+017F>ome people coming towards
us. He thereupon lookes about him, and perceives a chariot
coming into the field, among the dead bodies wherewith it was
covered, and a man riding on hor<U+017F>eback before the chariot, as
if he had been a guide to tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons that were within it.
Tho<U+017F>e were onely two women, one whereof filled the aire with
the dolefulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her Lamentations, and there followed the
chariot onely three <U+017F>laves, all a<U+017F>oot. At la<U+017F>t, when they were
come quite into the field, the heaps of dead bodies hindering
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the chariot, the women, that were within it, were
forced to alight, and the man, that was on hor<U+017F>eback having done
the like, took the more con<U+017F>iderable of the two by the arme, and
led her towards the place where we were. <hi>Eteocles,</hi> whom this
accident put into a great hopes of relief, took very much notice
of all that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and di<U+017F>tinctly heard the mournfull cries and
expo<U+017F>tulations of that di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Lady, which certainly were
<U+017F>uch as might have been heard many Stadia's. Her hair was loo<U+017F>e
and di<U+017F>hevelled, as if <U+017F>he had been fallen into <U+017F>ome extravagance,
her eies <U+017F>howred down teares, her brea<U+017F>t almo<U+017F>t rent with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of her<U+017F>ighes, in a word, her deportment was no other then
that of a per<U+017F>on di<U+017F>tracted and ready to fall into de<U+017F>pair.
<q>Terrible death, <hi>cried <U+017F>he,</hi> implacable devourer of mankind,
which appeare<U+017F>t to me here in <U+017F>o many formes! is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,

No doubt, but he came by his own death out of the over

him upon him, and with that little remainder of <U+017F>trength he

we were, or rather the de<U+017F>perate condition of our lives, took up
his thoughts <U+017F>o much, that he could not afford her any longer
attention. But indeed it was not long ere he had another motive
to di<U+017F>cover us, when the man that waited on that afflicted Lady,
being come neerer me, and having pre<U+017F>ently known me, out of a
confidence he was of that I had fallen in that place, and knew me
very well by <U+017F>ight, perceived withal that my eyes were open, and
that I was not quite dead. They had not <U+017F>tripped me naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

they had taken away the excellent armour wherein I had fought,
and whereby I was <U+017F>o remarkable in the battel. <hi>Eteocles</hi> had
wiped the bloud off my face, <U+017F>o that the man could with le<U+017F><U+017F>e

his Lady: <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to her, <hi>if revenge may abate any thing

de<U+017F>irous to execute her revenge with a grater <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>he
would needs look upon me, and <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he lifted up her arm fixed
her eyes on my countenance. <hi>Eteocles</hi> hath told me <U+017F>ince, that even

in <U+017F>ome places, playing with my cheeks, by rea<U+017F>on of a little wind
that then blew, heighthed the little beauty which <U+017F>till remained

whitne<U+017F><U+017F>e, in a Country where ordinary degrees of whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
are thought rare and admired. In fine, for my part, I know
not with what advantage I appeared in the <U+017F>ight of that incen<U+017F>ed
woman; but the arm <U+017F>he had lifted up remained in that po<U+017F>ture,
and at the <U+017F>ame time having gently turned my eies upon her,
with a feeble groane, her indignation was di<U+017F>armed at that
object, and the weapon fell out of her hand the <U+017F>econd
time.</p>
                        <p>The man that waited upon her, thinking he did her a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<U+017F>ervice in egging her on to take the intended revenge,
put the weapon into her hand the third time, and encouraging her
to the action <U+017F>he would have done, was ready to help her to put it
in execution, when the woman looking very pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately upon him;

looked <U+017F>till more and more earne<U+017F>tly, and the more <U+017F>he looked on
me, the more <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to <U+017F>truggle with her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and by all
her deportment it was ea<U+017F>ily vi<U+017F>ible to tho<U+017F>e that took notice of
it, that there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>trange things in her <U+017F>oul, and that there was
an engagement of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion there, whereof <U+017F>he was not over-confident
which <U+017F>hould have the victory. Sometimes <U+017F>he would take her

and brought to the place where we were, into which I was

full of de<U+017F>pair and extravagance, which in all probability
were the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the mo<U+017F>t violent love that a <U+017F>oul could be
capable of: and now you are to know that when <U+017F>he left the place,
whence <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed us to be conveyed away, <U+017F>he hardly <U+017F>o much as

who might <U+017F>tand in need of her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>he thought it enough
to give <hi>Pelorus</hi> order to cau<U+017F>e the body of <hi>Teramenes</hi> to be carryed
away, and to <U+017F>ee it buried.</p>
                        <p>They pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ent into the next Town for Surgeons, by whom

not come to the knowledg of my name who knew me not by <U+017F>ight.
And the<U+017F>e being excellent men in their profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, their endeavours
proved <U+017F>o <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>eful on me, that, ere that day was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, they
brought me ab<U+017F>olutely to my <U+017F>elf again, and within a few dayes
after undertook to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> and <hi>Eteocles,</hi> that I <U+017F>hould not dy of

that a<U+017F><U+017F>urance with as much joy as if her life were concerned in the
pre<U+017F>ervation of mine; but for my own part, I can truly affirm that
I received it without any, and that after I had recovered my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and began to make my fir<U+017F>t reflections on the wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in, I had almo<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf, through my own de<U+017F>pair
into that danger out of which they took so much pains to deliver
me. Whereof this certainly mu<U+017F>t be the rea<U+017F>on, that the violent
de<U+017F>ire of death which had forced me to engage in the <U+017F>ight, being

whereby he endeavoured to make me apprehend, that I did not
onely betray a great want of prudence, but that I was guilty of a
capitall crime again<U+017F>t my Love, by courting my own death, at a
time, that my life might be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Queens <U+017F>ervice, and
that <U+017F>ince I had not received any tidings that <U+017F>he was either dead,
or married to <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> there was no rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould ru<U+017F>h into
extremities which I might overtake time enough, when tho<U+017F>e
misfortunes were come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. To be <U+017F>hort, he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the<U+017F>e
things to me with <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on and conviction, that I began to
acknowledge the truth of them, and to <U+017F>ubmit to his judgement,
that it was not well done of me, to hazard upon <U+017F>uch light grounds
a life which I had be<U+017F>towed, and con<U+017F>equently could not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e

any <U+017F>ervice out of it. Upon this con<U+017F>ideration I was content they
<U+017F>hould endeavour my recovery, and entertained with great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
the care they took of me.</p>
                        <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>on as I had arrived to <U+017F>uch a degree of recovery as that I
was able to endure di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Eteocles</hi> came and told me what
place I was in, and by what adventure I was brought thither, and
at the <U+017F>ame time acquainted me what aver<U+017F>ion <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had had
for me upon account of the death of her Brother and her Love,
and what affection <U+017F>he had conceived for me of a <U+017F>udden. Now
his health being in a much better po<U+017F>ture then mine, as having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over keeping his bed, while I was yet in great danger, he
had had more lea<U+017F>ure to informe him<U+017F>elf of all that he was de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know, and had under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was a widow of
very great quality, that her friends and her hu<U+017F>band had alwaies
kept her at a di<U+017F>tance from the Court, that <U+017F>he had had two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
very deeply involved in the intere<U+017F>ts of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> whereof
the younger was <U+017F>lain in the late Battle, and the elder had <U+017F>taied
at <hi>Meroe</hi> by the orders of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> who affected him very much,
and repo<U+017F>ed great tru<U+017F>t in him; that <U+017F>he had been very earne<U+017F>tly
courted, <U+017F>ince her widow-hood, by that <hi>Teramenes,</hi> on whom
<U+017F>he had be<U+017F>towed, <U+017F>o many teares, a per<U+017F>on it <U+017F>eems of very great

very dearly, and that after many great traver<U+017F>es and revolutions
<U+017F>he was upon the point of marrying him with the con<U+017F>ent of her
friends, when death deprived her of him. <hi>Eteocles</hi> acquainting
me with all the<U+017F>e things, told me withall how circum<U+017F>pectly I
<U+017F>hould carry my <U+017F>elf, that I might not be di<U+017F>covered by any other
per<U+017F>ons then tho<U+017F>e whom <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was forced to tru<U+017F>t with that

<U+017F>ecret, not doubting but that, if <U+017F>uch a misfortune <U+017F>hould happen
my life mu<U+017F>t needs be in manife<U+017F>t danger, as well by rea<U+017F>on of the

who, out of all que<U+017F>tion would never <U+017F>uffer me to live, <U+017F>hould

and in a word one of the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons that ever I

my own <U+017F>idelity.</p>
                        <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as I was grown any thing capable of conver<U+017F>ation, I
had her perpetually at my bed-<U+017F>ide, and I <U+017F>oon ob<U+017F>erved in all
her deportment what <hi>Eteocles</hi> had told me before of her affection.
Her mode<U+017F>ty indeed was <U+017F>uch, that <U+017F>he would not in words di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what her heart was burthened with; but her eies betraied
<U+017F>ome part of it, and all her actions <U+017F>ufficiently confirmed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation
which <hi>Eteocles</hi> had made of her. During <U+017F>ome few
daies, at fir<U+017F>t, while the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e of my recovery was yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and my fever very violent, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid little to me, and I <U+017F>aw
her not but at <U+017F>ome certain times; but when I was a little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and permitted to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he was very liberall of her
company. She was one day at my bed-<U+017F>ide, where <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed
to be extreamly <U+017F>atisfied to <U+017F>ee my health in <U+017F>o good a po<U+017F>ture,
when I, venturing to <U+017F>peak, more than I had done before, took
occa<U+017F>ion to give her thanks and to make all the acknowledgement
I could of her care and tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e towards me, and commended
the genero<U+017F>ity <U+017F>he exerci<U+017F>ed towards a man who had been of a
party contrary to that of her Friends, and withall <U+017F>o unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as by the chance of war to do her a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. She pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
bore with my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and taking her advantage of my
<U+017F>ilence, <q>My lord, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> I have done no more for you
than your vertue de<U+017F>erved; but <U+017F>hall entreat you not to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
meerly to a con<U+017F>ideration of genero<U+017F>itie all that I have done
to <U+017F>erve you. After you had not onely been the death of my
Brother, but al<U+017F>o deprived me of a per<U+017F>on I infinitely loved, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97242:110"/>
one with whom I was upon the point of marriage, there was
no reflection of genero<U+017F>ity <U+017F>trong enough to oblige me to do an
action, whereby, I cannot but incur, if it be known, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of all the world, and the indignation of all my kinred,
and you may therefore well judge, that it mu<U+017F>t proceed from
<U+017F>ome more powerfull motive, that I conceived my <U+017F>elf engaged
to relieve you. I <U+017F>hall take it upon what ground you plea<U+017F>e,
<hi>replied I,</hi> but you will give me leave to imagine that it is meerly
to your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e that I am to attribute the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances I have
received from you, <U+017F>ince I had not any waies de<U+017F>erved them.
If it be meerly upon the account of <hi>goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, replied <U+017F>he with a

if I am onely <hi>good</hi> to you, how <hi>cruell</hi> am I to my <U+017F>elf! It would
be an infinite trouble to me, <hi>replied I,</hi> to think that the good

when my health <U+017F>hall be in another po<U+017F>ture than it is now,
I <U+017F>hall heartily <U+017F>pend this life, which I have received from your

engagement in my actions <U+017F>ince, and in fine you but too too well
perceive all the tran<U+017F>actions of my <U+017F>oule, for me to trouble my
<U+017F>elf to acquaint you therewith by my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es. I am not
naturally very much inclined to make declarations of this kind,
but I have not been able to contain my <U+017F>elf in an adventure ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
prodigious, and whereof all the con<U+017F>equences mu<U+017F>t needs

                        </p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Eurinoe</hi> put a period to her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e not without great
di<U+017F>coveries of confu<U+017F>ion, and I was in too much di<U+017F>order my <U+017F>elf,
not to be a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed thereat, as perceiving my <U+017F>elf reduced out of

thought it fit to make her <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer, and after I had <U+017F>tudied
<U+017F>ometime to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e it with <U+017F>uch obliging expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions as that I

thought my <U+017F>elf obliged for onely to your <hi>pitty.</hi> This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e
is too great not to be e<U+017F>teemed and acknowledged by a

I mu<U+017F>t therefore promi<U+017F>e you that you <U+017F>hall find my heart as

This was all I <U+017F>aid to her for the fir<U+017F>t time, and I was not able
to judge, whether <U+017F>he were <U+017F>atisfied or di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at it, for that
<hi>Pelorus,</hi> who<U+017F>e fidelity <U+017F>he began to mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t, comes into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which obliged her to fall upon <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and not
long after to leave the roome.</p>
                        <p>The di<U+017F>coveries of this affection of <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had made <U+017F>ome
further impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions upon me, if my <U+017F>oule had not been then
<U+017F>trugling with other afflictions which I thought more in<U+017F>upportable

                        <p>That part of the Ca<U+017F>tle into which we were di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed was at
<U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from all the re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons that were in
the others, knew nothing of what was done where we were,
<hi>Eurinoe</hi> having <U+017F>o ordered things that all was carried on with the
greate<U+017F>t caution and <U+017F>ecrecy imaginable. By this means had I all the
accommodation and attendance I could de<U+017F>ire, in<U+017F>omuch, that,
having kept my bed a moneth, I at la<U+017F>t began to <U+017F>it up, and to
walk a little about the room. Now had I <U+017F>o much of <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s
company, that <U+017F>he was in a manner never from me, making it her
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, by all her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, though ever cloathed with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ty
enough, to convince me of the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of her affection.
I, on the other <U+017F>ide, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elf with as much acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, of the obligations I ought her, as
well becau<U+017F>e I thought it no more then civility to do <U+017F>o, as upon
the advice of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who would not have me by any means to
exa<U+017F>perate her, and was afraid of the dangers it was yet in her
power to bring us into.</p>
                        <p>But <U+017F>he in the mean time was not <U+017F>atisfied with my <U+017F>imple civilities,
and expected I <U+017F>hould engage my heart in a love proportionable to
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs towards me. I, on the contrary, avoided all the occa<U+017F>ions of <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing to her which might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, though I <U+017F>aid not
ought that the might be mi<U+017F>taken in, or on which <U+017F>he might ground
any thing of affection. But one day, after <U+017F>he had pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me very
much to re<U+017F>olve on <U+017F>omething, yet in a way full of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and
mode<U+017F>ty, I thought fit to di<U+017F>cover my thoughts more particularly
then I had done any time before. Looking on her therefore in the
mo<U+017F>t obliging manner I could; <q>Faire<U+017F>t <hi>Eurinoe, <U+017F>aid I to her,</hi> I have
this unhapine<U+017F>s for one, among many others that are my perpetual
attendants, that I cannot convince you of the <U+017F>incerity of my
intentions, and the real acknowledgments I have for all the great
demon<U+017F>trations you honour me with of your affection. This mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
happens to me, for that I really have too great an e<U+017F>teem
for you, to make prote<U+017F>tations to you beyond what I am able to
make good; but <U+017F>ince you will needs oblige me to open my heart
to you, with that freedom which I owe a per<U+017F>on to whom I owe
my life, and of whom I have received <U+017F>uch extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of affection, I mu<U+017F>t tel you, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that, <U+017F>ince you
are acquainted with my name and per<U+017F>on, it is not to be doubted
but you have had <U+017F>ome account of my life, and con<U+017F>equently
know how far I am at liberty to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my affections. There
are few per<U+017F>ons in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> but know it, and therefore without
obliging me to di<U+017F>cover my <U+017F>elf any farther, be plea<U+017F>ed to reflect
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97242:112"/>
on what I can, and what I ought to do, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that
I <U+017F>hall be infinitely de<U+017F>irous to afford you all the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of

                           <hi>Eurinoe</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be a little da<U+017F>hed at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and it was
<U+017F>ome time ere <U+017F>he could make any an<U+017F>wer thereto, but at la<U+017F>t,
having <U+017F>ufficiently recollected her <U+017F>elf; <q>I have, indeed, with all
the Kingdom, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> heard of the love you have for the
Queen, the great actions you have done for her <U+017F>ervice, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
which the late King had to be<U+017F>tow her on you, and the
hopes you may, upon ju<U+017F>t grounds, have conceived, that you
may obtain her, and I am not <U+017F>o far blinded by my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but
that I am <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the di<U+017F>parity there is, as well
in regard of nature as fortune, between <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
upon the account both of quality and beauty; nor is my extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
come to that height, as that I would di<U+017F>pute with Queen
<hi>Candace,</hi> the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a heart to which <U+017F>he hath any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But my Lord, you are withal not ignorant, how that, on
that <U+017F>ide, all your hopes are bla<U+017F>ted, that <hi>Candace</hi> hath now lo<U+017F>t
both her Kingdom and her liberty, and that all the good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<U+017F>he may have for you, <U+017F>tand you in no <U+017F>tead. She hath haply
be<U+017F>towed her <U+017F>elf on <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> who is ma<U+017F>ter of her per<U+017F>on as
well as of her dominions; and the inclinations <U+017F>he hath had for
you, if they have not already, will no doubt give way to that
cruel nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, which allows her not the liberty to make choice
of a hu<U+017F>band.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The<U+017F>e words, wherein I perceived there was abundance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bality
and truth, came very neer my heart, and not being able to
conceal it from <hi>Eurinoe;</hi> 
                           <q>The news you tell me is very doleful,
<hi><U+017F>aid I to her,</hi> and yet you tell me nothing but what I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
I have been acquainted with the u<U+017F>urpation of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi>
and the captivity of <hi>Candace,</hi> but I know withal, that the gods
are ju<U+017F>t and omnipotent, and that by a turning-ca<U+017F>t of their power
and ju<U+017F>tice, they may overturne <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> and rai<U+017F>e <hi>Candace</hi> into
the Throne. There have been <U+017F>een among men revolutions as
<U+017F>trange as that, and we mu<U+017F>t not quit hope till the utmo<U+017F>t extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of misfortune.</q> But <U+017F>uch a hope as that, <hi>replyed Eurinoe,</hi>
cannot be well grounded, and as it is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but you
might alone counterballance, and haply overturn the fortune of
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> if you had had <U+017F>ufficient forces to oppo<U+017F>e him, for you
are not ignorant that there is not any body left which he needs
fear, or that can with any probability prevent his e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hment
in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> I can do it yet my <U+017F>elf, <hi><U+017F>aid I to her, not able to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e
my thoughts, what nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>oever there were I <U+017F>hould do it,</hi>
I may yet haply thwart that fortune which you think <U+017F>o well
e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, and put him to as great a hazard upon the u<U+017F>urped
throne he is in, as he was in when he had the command of a
hundred thou<U+017F>and men. Ah, my Lord, <hi>replies Eurinoe,</hi> tru<U+017F>t not
too much to that unfortunate pre<U+017F>umption. Your courage is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97242:112"/>
<U+017F>ufficiently known, but Fortune is not your friend, and your life
is dearer to me then that I can, without trembling, reflect on the
danger you mu<U+017F>t expo<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf to. Your fear, <hi><U+017F>aid I, <U+017F>miling,</hi>
is haply for <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> as knowing well that a mi<U+017F>erable per<U+017F>on
that is carele<U+017F><U+017F>e of his own life, may endanger tho<U+017F>e of the mo<U+017F>t
powerful and mo<U+017F>t fortunate. Cleomedon, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> you
do not, I hope, any way doubt, but that your life is much dearer
to me then that of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> <U+017F>ince I value it above my own. I
<U+017F>hall not take the pains to per<U+017F>wade you any further as to that

                        <p>She would have <U+017F>aid more, had it not been for <hi>Eteocles</hi> coming
into the room, before whom <U+017F>he would not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t any longer on
that <U+017F>ubject. In the mean time, my greate<U+017F>t care was to ha<U+017F>ten my
recovery, being upon thorns to fa<U+017F>ten on <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>acrifice
the remainders of my life, with <U+017F>ome advantage, to the <U+017F>ervice of
my faire<U+017F>t Queen. But the more I recovered my health, the more
did <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s dimini<U+017F>h, in<U+017F>omuch, that at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was brought <U+017F>o
low by that unfortunate pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that I could do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then pitty
her, if I may u<U+017F>e that term with mode<U+017F>ty, and was extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that I could do nothing to comfort her.</p>
                        <p>I was at la<U+017F>t grown <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, that I dur<U+017F>t venture out of my
chamber, and to go into a fair garden where <U+017F>he would needs have
me to walk with her. I did it, though with much difficulty, <U+017F>he
being forced to help me ever and anon by rea<U+017F>on of my weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e.
'Twas in this place that <U+017F>he made her complaints to me with more
freedom then <U+017F>he could do in the chamber, and vvhere I vvas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times extreamly put to it, though I am obliged to give her this
character, that, in all the mo<U+017F>t violent expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
I never ob<U+017F>erved any thing to fall from her that was unhand<U+017F>ome
or prejudicial to mode<U+017F>ty. I urged to her, but to no purpo<U+017F>e, the
fidelity I ought to the Queen, and one day above all having pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
it to her more earne<U+017F>tly then at other times; <q>Cruel man, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
me,</hi> you have but that onely argument to elude me withal, and
I am confident, that it is without any hope that you make it a
cloak for your cruelty. I have told you <U+017F>everal times, that I
would not di<U+017F>pute your heart with <hi>Candace,</hi> could you but think
of her with any likelyhood of obtaining her; but you know
well enough that <U+017F>he is lo<U+017F>t as to you, and yet thru<U+017F>t a dagger into
the brea<U+017F>t of an unfortunate woman who loves you but too well,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97242:113"/>
and pretend fidelity to a per<U+017F>on that cannot think on you, and,
no doubt, does not.</q>

                        <p>The<U+017F>e words, which I was extreamly moved at, furni<U+017F>hed me
al<U+017F>o with an an<U+017F>wer thereto, wherewith I thought <U+017F>he would be
in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>atisfied; yet <U+017F>o as that I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>tand engaged
to any thing, and thereupon taking her by the hand, and wringing
it, with an action that argued <U+017F>omething of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate affection
more then ordinary; <q>Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid I to her,</hi> it is no <U+017F>mall affection

more, which <U+017F>hall ab<U+017F>olutely convince you of my reality.
Since therefore you have already declared that you would not
di<U+017F>pute my heart with <hi>Candace,</hi> and that it is onely upon the <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al
of her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e that I mu<U+017F>t be yours, I prote<U+017F>t to you, by all

vow to you, <U+017F>uch as nothing <U+017F>hall ever oblige me to break, that
if <hi>Candace</hi> be lo<U+017F>t as to me, and that I <U+017F>urvive her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall
never love any thing but the fair <hi>Eurinoe.</hi>
                           </q> Though <U+017F>he could
not derive any advantage from the<U+017F>e words, if rightly under<U+017F>tood,
and that I hazarded nothing by promi<U+017F>ing not to love ought but
her, in ca<U+017F>e I could love any thing after the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Candace,</hi> yet
I ob<U+017F>erved that this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e wrought that effect which I expected
it <U+017F>hould, and that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely appea<U+017F>ed, that for many
daies her thoughts were in a more then ordinary <U+017F>erenity, during
which time I grew <U+017F>tronger and <U+017F>tronger, in<U+017F>omuch that I
thought my <U+017F>elf able, within a few days to get on hor<U+017F>e-back.</p>
                        <p>Now was it that my di<U+017F>quiets per<U+017F>ecuted me afre<U+017F>h, as having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
armour, nor hor<U+017F>es, and knowing no means how to procure
any, but onely through the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> whom I was very
much afraid to make any propo<U+017F>ition to upon that account, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confident <U+017F>he would do all that lay in her power to prevent my
departure at lea<U+017F>t as long as <U+017F>he could. And certainly I was not
mi<U+017F>taken in the opinion I had conceived of her, and accordinglie
as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood, that I was upon <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>olutions to be
gone, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o extreamly troubled at it, that I thought it would
have proved impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to comfort her. This put me into a <U+017F>trange
di<U+017F>turbance, as well out of the fear I was in, that her de<U+017F>pair
might produce <U+017F>omething that <U+017F>hould prove prejudicial both to
her <U+017F>elf and to us, as the improbability there was I <U+017F>hould get out
of her hou<U+017F>e, in the condition I then was in, without her con<U+017F>ent,
or indeed without her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. My thoughts were continually
employed in finding out <U+017F>ome expedient, and con<U+017F>ulting with
<hi>Eteocles,</hi> who was to <U+017F>eek in it as much as my <U+017F>elf, when our di<U+017F>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
were determined by an adventure that happened, and at which
you will not haply be a little a<U+017F>torni<U+017F>hed.</p>
                        <p>During the time that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was troubled mo<U+017F>t with a fear of
my departure, and that I found my <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch a condition as that I
might get on hor<U+017F>eback within three or four dayes, <U+017F>he took me
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97242:113"/>
along with her, as <U+017F>he had done diver<U+017F>e times before, to walk in
the garden. And in regard I had now fully recovered my <U+017F>trength,
<U+017F>he carryed me into the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary walks, and mo<U+017F>t remote,
having with her that Gentlewoman, whom <U+017F>he had entru<U+017F>ted with
this <U+017F>ecret from the beginning, as if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood much upon the
decorum and civility <U+017F>he had alwayes ob<U+017F>erved towards me. After
we had taken <U+017F>ome few turns, we <U+017F>ate down upon a <U+017F>eat made of
tur<U+017F>s, at the end of a walk, on both <U+017F>ides of which was a high and
thick hedge-row, and there, after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in the
remon<U+017F>trances <U+017F>he ordinarily entertained me with. <q>How cruel
man, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me,</hi> can you po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly prevaile with your <U+017F>elf to
for<U+017F>ake me, and leave me in an indignation that I have made no
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon your heart by <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations, of a
perfect affection? It <U+017F>eems then, that neither what I have done
in order to your <U+017F>afety, nor what I have done again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf by
expo<U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elf to the indignation and re<U+017F>entments of my friends,
nor the violence I did for your <U+017F>ake, to an ancient and earne<U+017F>t
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, could never move that in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <U+017F>oul of yours, and you
make it a light matter to for<U+017F>ake me for ever, and to leave me at
a time, when you cannot doubt but that the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends

                        </p>
                        <p>There fell abundance of other things from her, with <U+017F>uch a
torrent of words, as I knew not how to <U+017F>tand again<U+017F>t. But when
that was <U+017F>pent, and that <U+017F>he had given over <U+017F>peaking, <q>Eurinoe,
<hi><U+017F>aid I to her,</hi> I <U+017F>hall not leave you, till <U+017F>uch time as you give me
the liberty to do it, and <U+017F>hall be your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>atisfied that I ought to
be at a greater di<U+017F>tance from you, as well in regard of your
concernments as my own. By the di<U+017F>covery I have made to you
of my thoughts you have under<U+017F>tood that I am obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
once more to do <U+017F>omething for the <U+017F>ervice of an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, to whom you know my life hath been long
<U+017F>ince devoted, and I were unworthy your e<U+017F>teem if I <U+017F>hould
ba<U+017F>ely for<U+017F>ake her in the misfortunes whereto <U+017F>he is reduced.
This is it I am obliged to do, as to what concerns my <U+017F>elf; and
for your part <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t give me leave to tell you, that
what may be thought lawful and haply commendable in your
carriage, during the extremities whereto my wounds had
brought me, would not be thought <U+017F>o after the recovery of my
health, and that it would prove very unhand<U+017F>ume, and much
prejudiciall to your reputation, that a per<U+017F>on of my age, and
one to whom you pretend an affection <U+017F>hould make any longer
abode in your hou<U+017F>e. What may have been kept <U+017F>ecret hitherto,
cannot be any longer, for time does at la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover things that
are mo<U+017F>t concealed. You have abundance of vertue, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
though you have been overcome by <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and it is your
vertue as much as the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances I have received from you, that
I conceive my <U+017F>elf obliged to e<U+017F>teem you for. Since then your
vertue is really more then ordinary, <U+017F>uffer it not to be <U+017F>tained
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97242:114"/>
with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pots, which it will be hard for you to get out again,
and endeavour to pre<U+017F>erve your reputation among<U+017F>t men by
actions conformable to tho<U+017F>e of your life pa<U+017F>t. You will pardon
me for being <U+017F>o free as to give you this advice which, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your
<U+017F>elf, proceeds from a heart full of grateful apprehen<U+017F>ions, as
al<U+017F>o if I pre<U+017F>ume to beg no other love from you, then <U+017F>uch as
you would afford a Brother, <U+017F>ince that you perceive by the
po<U+017F>ture of my affairs, that I cannot love you otherwi<U+017F>e then as a
<U+017F>i<U+017F>ter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I had not till then <U+017F>poken in <U+017F>uch terms to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> whence it
came that <U+017F>he was the more <U+017F>urprized thereat, in<U+017F>omuch, that for
a long time <U+017F>he was not able to make any reply. And yet I think <U+017F>he
had bethought her of <U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ay, when our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was
interrupted by a little noi<U+017F>e which we heard behind the hedg-row,
again<U+017F>t which we were <U+017F>ate, and not long after, by the appearance
of a man, who, being come into the walk, made all the ha<U+017F>t he
could towards the place where we were. <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> thoughts being
employed at that time much more then mine, I took notice of the
man before <U+017F>he did, and <U+017F>aw that he was of a very goodly pre<U+017F>ence,
a noble and maje<U+017F>tick air, and had a very fair countenance for a
man of that nation, though he <U+017F>eemed to be weak and brought
very low, and di<U+017F>covered in his eyes <U+017F>ome dreadful re<U+017F>olution.
Being, for my part, ignorant what occa<U+017F>ion might bring him thither,
I was very glad of a <U+017F>word I had by my <U+017F>ide, which <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me the day before, and had begun to wear it but that very day,
to make u<U+017F>e of, if need were, in a Country where I was to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
all things: but <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> who had thought before that it was
either <hi>Eteocles</hi> or <hi>Pelorus,</hi> ca<U+017F>t not her eies on him, till <U+017F>uch time as
he was come up almo<U+017F>t to us. At the <U+017F>ame time the woman that
was with her gave a <U+017F>hriek, which <U+017F>he hearing, and endeavouring
to find the cau<U+017F>e of it in the countenance of that man, <U+017F>he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie
found it, when <U+017F>he knew him to be her unfortunate <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
on who<U+017F>e death <U+017F>he had be<U+017F>towed <U+017F>o many tears, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who<U+017F>e bodie <U+017F>he had made <U+017F>o much lamentation, and done things
that <U+017F>ufficientlie argued her extravagance and de<U+017F>pair. At this
<U+017F>ight <U+017F>he gave a great <U+017F>hriek, as <U+017F>he brought forth the name of
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> and the terrour <U+017F>he conceived thereat was <U+017F>o great, that
<U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>wound upon the <U+017F>eat where <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ate. Her
action, that of the woman that was with her, and the name of
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> which they pronounced, put me into an imagination it
might be his gho<U+017F>t, or haply he him<U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>erved by <U+017F>ome
miracle.</p>
                        <p>During that uncertainty, retreating back a little, when he

Were I onely the gho<U+017F>t of Teramenes, <hi>replied the man,</hi> it were

<U+017F>halt not need to fear in this deplorable condition, him, whom
thou coulde<U+017F>t look upon without any dread in the head of an

woman, who<U+017F>e heart thou ha<U+017F>t gotten from me after thou
had<U+017F>t taken away my life not onely in her opinion, but in that
of all the world be<U+017F>ides. I was thine enemy upon the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

upon the wound I received from thy hands, which hath brought
me to the extremities of life and death, and <hi>I</hi> have yet a more

might have proved fatall to one of us; but the words that
have fallen from thee, and which <hi>I</hi> have over-heard, have
wrought a change in my thoughts, and <hi>I</hi> have found <U+017F>o much
vertue, prudence and goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e in them, that they have taken

not in a manner where <U+017F>he was, was not able to <U+017F>peak, and had
not the confidence to look upon him. With this, <U+017F>he found it no

<U+017F>mall difficulty to be per<U+017F>waded that <hi>Teramenes</hi> was living, though

you could find in your heart to give him ki<U+017F><U+017F>es when he was
dead, and wa<U+017F>h his face with <U+017F>o many teares! But can I think
that change any miracle, cruell and ungratefull <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> when
I am <U+017F>o well acquainted with that of your <U+017F>oule; and that I am
not ignorant, how that, in the <U+017F>ame minute, you were <U+017F>een to
pa<U+017F><U+017F>e from, the effects of the mo<U+017F>t violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the world,
to a mortall oblivion of him that had adored you with <U+017F>o much
fidelity, and to new inclinations for a dying man, whom you
had never <U+017F>een before, and one that had been the death of tho<U+017F>e
per<U+017F>ons whom you thought deare<U+017F>t to you. I return, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
I return, almo<U+017F>t from hell to reproach you with your prodigious
incon<U+017F>tancy, and the gods have been plea<U+017F>ed to re<U+017F>tore me to
life contrary both to your expectation and my own, that I might
come and repre<U+017F>ent to you, the many oaths and prote<U+017F>tations
wherein you have called them to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, to your promi<U+017F>es of
an eternall affection for me. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that you can call them
to mind without remor<U+017F>e and confu<U+017F>ion, and can <U+017F>o many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations
of my love, which you <U+017F>ometime valued at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
rate, come into your memory, and not rai<U+017F>e in you either a
<U+017F>ecret grief or a <U+017F>ecret repentance? Your hand was lifted up
to thru<U+017F>t a dagger into the heart of my Murtherer, and by an
extravagance of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, you were hurried into extremities not
ordinary to your <U+017F>ex, when that fatall <U+017F>ight gave a check to
your cruelty, and that new love, po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elf of your <U+017F>oule
in an in<U+017F>tant, forced thence the unfortunate <hi>Teramenes</hi> in <U+017F>uch
manner, that you hardly remembred he had once lived. In the
mean time, my life was pre<U+017F>erved to my greater misfortune, and
I wi<U+017F>h it had plea<U+017F>ed the gods to have put a period to it at that
very minute when your affection cea<U+017F>ed, and that their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
and that of men had not proved <U+017F>o effectuall as to re<U+017F>tore it me,
to make me fall into the greate<U+017F>t unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e that ever man
groaned under. Do you imagine, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that heaven hath
not a puni<U+017F>hment for <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange an in<U+017F>idelity, and that the
cries of a de<U+017F>perate and an injured Lover, will not bring upon
your head tho<U+017F>e misfortunes which his Love permits him not to

To this effect was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Teramenes,</hi> which fell from
him with a certain action, that rai<U+017F>ed in me abundance of pittie,
and he would have <U+017F>aid more, had not the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of his grief
prevented him, when <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> having quite recovered her <U+017F>elf, as
convinced, both by the things which <U+017F>he heard, and by what <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus</hi>
had told her, would needs <U+017F>top the torrent of his words.
Whereupon, <U+017F>mothering that confu<U+017F>ion and remor<U+017F>e which had tied
up her tongue <U+017F>o long, <U+017F>he looked on <hi>Teramenes,</hi> not without <U+017F>ome

trouble, and not of that confu<U+017F>ion and remor<U+017F>e which thou
do<U+017F>t reproach me with, and though it might haply have proved
more advantageous to my <U+017F>elf to have continued my affections

a misfortune which I have not any way contributed to. With
what ju<U+017F>tice, <hi>Teramenes,</hi> can<U+017F>t thou charge me with any infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

I had promi<U+017F>ed thee to the very la<U+017F>t minute of thy life, or did
we per<U+017F>wade one another that our Love <U+017F>hould la<U+017F>t beyond this
life? What law is that which engages one to this eternity of
affection towards the dead, or by what <U+017F>ymptomes, could I judge
that thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t return to life, after I had cau<U+017F>ed thee to be
brought out of the Field in order to thy buriall? Tho<U+017F>e demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations
of love which I gave thee, and what el<U+017F>e thou mai<U+017F>t
have under<U+017F>tood from the unfaithfull <hi>Pelorus,</hi> were they the
effects of an ordinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and was there not ground enough
thou <U+017F>houlde<U+017F>t be <U+017F>atisfied with a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which engaged me to
do things beyond the bounds of rea<U+017F>on? To revenge thee, I
became, contrary to my naturall inclinations, more cruell than a
Lyone<U+017F><U+017F>e, and would have attempted the life of an expiring

to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. If I therefore were moved thereat, if the will

<U+017F>ince, (as thou art too well informed to be denied any thing)
his excellent endowments, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uperiour irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible power,
have forced my inclinations, and taken that place in my heart,
which was not to be eternally kept empty for one that was dead,
do<U+017F>t thou find in this misfortune that horrid infidelity which
thou reproache<U+017F>t me with, or did<U+017F>t thou imagine that my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
were as great to thy gho<U+017F>t, as they were, while living, to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97242:116"/>
thy <U+017F>elf? No <hi>Teramenes,</hi> think not that thou can<U+017F>t accu<U+017F>e me with
any ju<U+017F>tice, and if thou ha<U+017F>t been <U+017F>o unhappy to loo<U+017F>e my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
by an adventure <U+017F>o prodigious quarrel, with heaven,
who<U+017F>e will it was it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o, and not with my will which
hath contributed nothing thereto. As to the misfortune which
thou bewaile<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much, my condition is not a jot happier than
thine, and thou mai<U+017F>t el<U+017F>ewhere find a better fortune than thou
can<U+017F>t expect with the unfortunate <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> while in the mean
time it is de<U+017F>tined <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be eternally mi<U+017F>erable, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to that cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement of heaven, which thou <U+017F>aie<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t fall

                        </p>
                        <p>The period of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> was a <U+017F>hower of tears
which it lay not in her power to keep in any longer. Whereupon
<hi>Teramenes</hi> whom it put to the extremity of grief, by rea<U+017F>on there
could not be a greater confirmation of the reality of his unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
ca<U+017F>ting a dreadfull look upon her: <q>No, no, Eurince, <hi><U+017F>aid
he to her,</hi> I <U+017F>hall accu<U+017F>e you no longer, but acknowledge with
you, and <U+017F>ubmit to that irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible power which hath forced
your inclinations. But in regard my life might do your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<U+017F>ome prejudice in the world, though my tongue were <U+017F>ilent
and that it is not to be doubted but that I am now as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as ever I was amiable in your <U+017F>ight, it is but ju<U+017F>t my life
<U+017F>hould here determine, and that in <U+017F>uch a manner, that you
may not be therein mi<U+017F>taken a <U+017F>econd time. The greate<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
I now have at my death, is, that I leave you an unfortunate
woman, and if the vertue and con<U+017F>tancy of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> could
but give him leave to forget <hi>Candace</hi> to enjoy you, as you have,
to gain him, forgotten <hi>Teramenes,</hi> the la<U+017F>t intreaty I were to make
<U+017F>hould be, that he would be le<U+017F><U+017F>e cruell to her, and not
aggravate any further a revenge which I de<U+017F>ire not you <U+017F>hould
take.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With the<U+017F>e words he drew out a dagger he had about him, and
li<U+017F>ting up his hand, would have thru<U+017F>t it into his brea<U+017F>t, if I had
not fa<U+017F>tened upon him, and <U+017F>taied his hand, though onely with <U+017F>o
much force as to prevent him from executing his re<U+017F>olution.
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> perceiving his de<U+017F>ign fru<U+017F>trated, looked on me very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbedly,
and endeavouring to <U+017F>natch the dagger which I had
taken out of his hands; <q>Cleomedon, <hi><U+017F>aid he to me,</hi> content
your <U+017F>elf that the experience I have of your vertue, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<U+017F>o far upon me, that I would not have the effects of my
de<U+017F>pair fall upon you, and <U+017F>ince I am willing to <U+017F>pare tho<U+017F>e by
who<U+017F>e means I am become mi<U+017F>erable, purpo<U+017F>ely that <hi>I</hi> might
execute all my revenge upon my <U+017F>elf, hinder me not from free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my <U+017F>elf from tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries which <hi>I</hi> groan under upon your
account. I will hinder you to lay violent hands on your <U+017F>elf,
<hi><U+017F>aid I to him,</hi> if it lie in my power to do it, and it <U+017F>hall not be
my fault, if you do not find out <U+017F>ome expedient be<U+017F>ides that
of death, to get out of tho<U+017F>e misfortunes whereof I am the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97242:116"/>
innocent cau<U+017F>e. <hi>Eurinoe</hi> knows very well, that it is not upon
any hopes that I have given her that <U+017F>he per<U+017F>everes in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <U+017F>he hath for me, and I here give you a full di<U+017F>covery of
my thoughts, when I tell you, that I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf a very
wretched per<U+017F>on, and abominable in the <U+017F>ight of Heaven, if a
love <U+017F>o faithful as yours <U+017F>hould come to an unfortunate end by
my means.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having with the<U+017F>e words taken away the dagger from <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
I turned towards <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> in whom the deportment and
la<U+017F>t words of her hu<U+017F>band had rai<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I <U+017F>aid
to her all tho<U+017F>e things which pitty could <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t to me on her
behalf, and alledged to her all the rea<U+017F>ons which I thought might
any way oblige her to di<U+017F>-lodge me out of her heart, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit
her faithful <hi>Teramenes.</hi> For <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>he was not able to
make me any an<U+017F>wer, other then that of a <U+017F>hower of tears, which
being at la<U+017F>t over, <U+017F>he very earne<U+017F>tly rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
charged me with the greate<U+017F>t cruelty and ingratitude imaginable.
I heard all with abundance of patience, and not di<U+017F>covering the
lea<U+017F>t trouble thereat, I took occa<U+017F>ion to repre<U+017F>ent unto her, what
might be the con<U+017F>equences of an ob<U+017F>tinate per<U+017F>everance, in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and that directed to a man engaged in another love,
one that was ready to take his leave of her, and <U+017F>hould not haply
ever <U+017F>ee her again; nay, which is more then all, one, that, though he
were not called away by the affection he had for the Queen, could
not make any abode with her, but to the utter ruine of her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
be<U+017F>ides the little probability there was <U+017F>he would be <U+017F>o
extravagant, as to entertain in her hou<U+017F>e the murderer of one
of her Brothers. To this I added what <U+017F>he might fear from her
other Brother, who was <U+017F>till with <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> and that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t
needs expect he would have <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ignes, not onely again<U+017F>t her
life, but mine al<U+017F>o, as being dear to her, but that, on the contrary,
<U+017F>he could not but be happy with <hi>Teramenes.</hi> it being out of all
doubt that he had an extraordinary affection for her, <U+017F>ince the
demon<U+017F>trations <U+017F>he had received thereof were very remarkable:
that he was approved and recommended to her by her friends,
and, in a word, that it was the onely means to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ure
not onely in her own mind, but al<U+017F>o in her hou<U+017F>e and
fortunes.</p>
                        <p>While I thus di<U+017F>burthened my thoughts to <hi>Eurinoe, Teramenes,</hi>
having ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at her feet, bathed them with his tears, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that, whether it were upon that <U+017F>pectacle, which <U+017F>tirred up
in her the embers of her former affections, or that <U+017F>he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the rea<U+017F>on and truth of the things I repre<U+017F>ented to
her, and withal lo<U+017F>t all hope of being loved by me, and haply
imagined <U+017F>he might never <U+017F>ee me again, after a doubtful engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein we <U+017F>pent the be<U+017F>t part of the day, <U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t began
to yield. Whereupon looking on <hi>Teramenes,</hi> with a milder coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97242:117"/>
then before, <U+017F>he turned towards me, and told me <U+017F>he
would do what I <U+017F>hould advi<U+017F>e her to, and that, being become mine
through the means of <U+017F>ome unknown power, <U+017F>he now <U+017F>ubmitted
again to the <U+017F>ame power, which <U+017F>he was not able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf for joy, after he had given thou<U+017F>ands
of ki<U+017F><U+017F>es to her feet, ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at mine, embracing me by the
knees, calling me the authour of his <U+017F>afety, and his tutelary angel,
and making all the earne<U+017F>t prote<U+017F>tations he could to me, that he
would heartily <U+017F>pend, to do me any <U+017F>ervice, that life which I had
prevented him from de<U+017F>troying, and made him happie in. And
knowing on the other <U+017F>ide that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> might be in <U+017F>ome fear he
<U+017F>hould afterwards remember the change that had happened in her
affections, and accordinglie conceive <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>contented thoughts
of the love <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome time had for me, he, to rid her of that
fear, made thou<U+017F>ands of prote<U+017F>tations to her, that it <U+017F>hould never
come into his mind again. He told her that he ab<U+017F>olutely attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
that accident to the extraordinary merit of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
which might produce no le<U+017F><U+017F>e miraculous an effect any where: but
in fine, that, however he might <U+017F>eem to quarrel with her, he was
confident of her vertue, not onely upon the former expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
<U+017F>he had made thereof, but al<U+017F>o from that very demon<U+017F>tration of it,
which, when he lea<U+017F>t expected any <U+017F>uch thing, he had heard from
the mouth of <hi>Cleomedon;</hi> that, for my part, he <U+017F>hould never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the lea<U+017F>t jealou<U+017F>ie or ill thought of me, out of a confidence I
<U+017F>hould never prove unfaitful to <hi>Candace,</hi> either for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> or any
other per<U+017F>on in the World.</p>
                        <p>Here am I forced to contract my relation, for that, <U+017F>hould I make
it my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to repeat all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed upon this
occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>atisfie and convince <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> it would take up more
time then I have <U+017F>pent in the account of all I have given you
already. At la<U+017F>t I made an ab<U+017F>olute reconcilation between <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
and <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> who endeavoured, all that lay in her power,
to conceal before him, the violence <U+017F>he did her <U+017F>elf upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
and prevalid with her <U+017F>o far upon the earne<U+017F>t intreaties of
that Lover, that I got her to promi<U+017F>e that <U+017F>he would be married to
him before my departure thence, as <U+017F>he might very well do, being,
as <U+017F>he was, altogether at her own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, and knowing withall
that her marriage with <hi>Teramenes</hi> was approved of, and de<U+017F>ired by
all her friends.</p>
                        <p>At la<U+017F>t we would needs know of him, how he had recovered to
life, and had carried his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> never <U+017F>o
much as <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected any <U+017F>uch thing. He, in few words, acquainted
us, how that, after we had been brought into the Ca<U+017F>tle, <hi>Pelorus</hi>
returning to the place, where he had left him, with a letter to
carry him away, found him recovered out of that mortal <U+017F>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wherein he had continued all the night, and <U+017F>ome part of the
day; that this man, being one that had been brought up in his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:97242:117"/>
<U+017F>ervice over-joyd at the accident, had taken <U+017F>uch pains about him,
that at la<U+017F>t he brought him <U+017F>o far to him<U+017F>elf, that he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of what was <U+017F>aid to him. To this <hi>Pelorus</hi> added, That <hi>Teramenes</hi>
had commanded him to carry him to <hi>Eurinoe's,</hi> as having no place
where he might well retire any neerer, and that thereupon he
had been forced to acquaint him with the truth of all that had
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, as having far greater re<U+017F>pects for his Ma<U+017F>ter then he had
for <hi>Eurinoe:</hi> That <hi>Teramenes</hi> had almo<U+017F>t dyed in good earne<U+017F>t at
that cruel news, and that neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e, out of a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the
con<U+017F>equences of that adventure, and to apply tho<U+017F>e remedies
which time and his own re<U+017F>entments <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t unto him, he
was content to be carried to a hou<U+017F>e that belonged to a Si<U+017F>ter of
<hi>Peloruus</hi>'s, not far from <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle, where he might not onely
be privately looked after in order to his perfect recovery, but al<U+017F>o
be in a place, where he might every day under<U+017F>tand, by <hi>Pelorus,</hi> what
was done at <hi>Eurinoes:</hi> That all things came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e as <hi>Teramenes</hi>
had de<U+017F>ired, and that he had been waited on and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with
<U+017F>o much care as might be, by per<U+017F>ons concerned in his wellfare,
and <U+017F>uch as had not anyway betrayed the <U+017F>ecret committed to their
tru<U+017F>t: That this had been done with the greater ea<U+017F>e, by rea<U+017F>on of
<hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s continual employment about me, and the little curio<U+017F>ity
<U+017F>he was then guilty of, to enquire what was done in her neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
That he brought <hi>Teramenes</hi> notice every day of what was
done at the Ca<U+017F>tle, in regard he might go and come to his Si<U+017F>ters
hou<U+017F>e without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion: That <hi>Teramenes</hi> conceived <U+017F>uch
a grief and affliction thereat, that many times he was upon the
point of di<U+017F>covering all, not doubting but that <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> and
<hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s Brother, and all of that party would <U+017F>oon find out
<U+017F>ome means to di<U+017F>patch me, when they were once acquainted
with the place of my abode, but that he had been per<U+017F>waded
to the contrary, partly by his intreaties, who de<U+017F>ired him to
delay it, and partly by tho<U+017F>e remainders of love which he <U+017F>till
had le<U+017F>t in him for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake principally it
was that he forbore putting that bloudy de<U+017F>ign in execution;
that at la<U+017F>t, through the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of tho<U+017F>e that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about his recovery, he was come to the po<U+017F>ture of
health wherein he <U+017F>aw him, and that having notice given him,
that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> and my <U+017F>elf walked every day in the Garden,
he would needs come thither, to over-hear our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and to take his opportunity to be revenged
of me in <U+017F>uch a manner as might lea<U+017F>t prejudice the reputation
of <hi>Eurinoe;</hi> That he had many times over-heard our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
through the hedge-row, but that in tho<U+017F>e which I made to
<hi>Eurinoe,</hi> he had found <U+017F>o much prudence and vertue, that he
immediately changed his re<U+017F>olution, and that perceiving I had
no affection for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> he thought <U+017F>it to make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereof, and had then di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elf to us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97242:118"/>
my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance upon the opinion he had of my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>ity.</p>
                        <p>Thus did <hi>Teramenes</hi> give us an account of his adventure,
and prevailed <U+017F>o far with <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that <U+017F>he pardoned <hi>Pelorus,</hi>
who in tho<U+017F>e tran<U+017F>actions had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed a greater love to his
ancient Ma<U+017F>ter then to his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. But to what purpo<U+017F>e
<U+017F>hould I <U+017F>pin out the particulars of this relation, all things were
compo<U+017F>ed, quiet and <U+017F>erenity of thoughts began to cha<U+017F>e away all
former di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfactions, onely <hi>Eurinoe</hi> di<U+017F>covered by certain <U+017F>ighs
that her <U+017F>oul was not ab<U+017F>olutely recovered, and, three daies after,
finding my <U+017F>elf in a condition to depart thence, I charged
<hi>Eurinoe</hi> with her promi<U+017F>e, and in my pre<U+017F>ence obliged her
to marry <hi>Teramenes.</hi> There happened <U+017F>ome particulars in this
action which I carefully concealed from <hi>Teramenes,</hi> and the
next day I pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them, to accommodate me with tho<U+017F>e
things that were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for my departure, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to tho<U+017F>e places which I was obliged to go to, promi<U+017F>ing
them, I <U+017F>hould acknowledge, when it <U+017F>hould plea<U+017F>e the gods to
enable me, the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances and kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e I had received from
the officions <hi>Eurinoe. Teramenes</hi> granted my reque<U+017F>t, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
us with cloaths, arms, and hor<U+017F>es, and would have gone
along with me, had I accepted of his company: but I gave him
thanks for his kind pro<U+017F><U+017F>ers, and told him, that I was <U+017F>atisfied
he <U+017F>hould be no longer my enemy, without engaging him to
be any way <U+017F>erviceable to me again<U+017F>t <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> who was
much his friend, and <U+017F>o intreated him not to di<U+017F>cover any thing
he knew of me, and to promote the report which was already
<U+017F>pread abroad of my death. And this I was the more confident he
would do, not onely upon the promi<U+017F>e he had made to do it,
but al<U+017F>o out of a con<U+017F>ideration of his own intere<U+017F>t, which would
advi<U+017F>e him not to publi<U+017F>h a thing, that might exa<U+017F>perate <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F>us</hi>
again<U+017F>t him. They al<U+017F>o taught me an invention which
proved very fortunate to me; for, perceiving I was <U+017F>omewhat
troubled how to conceal my <U+017F>elf in the places I was to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e
through, by rea<U+017F>on of the fairne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my face, <U+017F>o different from
the complexion of the men of that Country, they gave me
a certain water, which is commonly u<U+017F>ed among the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi>
by tho<U+017F>e that are de<U+017F>irous of a more <U+017F>hining black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
in the countenance, and having made experience of it
fir<U+017F>t on my hands, they afterwards therewith painted my
face, as al<U+017F>o that of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> <U+017F>o that after three wa<U+017F>hings,
we were growne as blac<U+017F>h as if we had really been <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi>
They gave me a little Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e Bottle full of it, to
carrie along with me, and <U+017F>hewed me the way to take it
off, when I had a mind to do it, which was, onely with
warm water and certain herbs put into it. In this po<U+017F>ture,

after <U+017F>ome bemoanings from <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> which <U+017F>he was not
able to forbear, and thou<U+017F>ands of prote<U+017F>tations which I
made her, to acknowledge her extraordinary favours,
if ever Fortune proved kind to me, I departed from
that hou<U+017F>e without any other company then that of <hi>Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles,</hi>
and one <U+017F>ervant on hor<U+017F>eback, <hi>Teramenes</hi> be<U+017F>towed

                        <p>The de<U+017F>igne I then had was <U+017F>ecretlie to get to tho<U+017F>e
whom I knew to be <U+017F>till my Friends, and were de<U+017F>irous to
<U+017F>erve their Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and had a zeale for the memory of
their late King, hoping, that upon my returne they would
be encouraged to attempt <U+017F>omething for the <U+017F>ervice of their

made to them, of attempting <U+017F>omething again<U+017F>t the Tyrant,

THe fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians</hi> and the Queen
of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> had hearkened hitherto with great
attention to the relation of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> without
offering to interrupt him, but when he was come
to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> looking on the Queen with
a <U+017F>miling countenance; <q>You were very much to

this particular of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario's</hi> life, becau<U+017F>e, in my judgement it is
none of the lea<U+017F>t important. But I withall perceive that you
purpo<U+017F>ely avoided all occa<U+017F>ion of giving me any account of the
Love of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> out of a fear you were in, that I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ome glimp<U+017F>es of the jealou<U+017F>ie you may

Madam, <hi>replied the Queen (with an action wherein <U+017F>he <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be as indifferent and as little earne<U+017F>t as the other</hi>)
which is, that the greate<U+017F>t part of tho<U+017F>e things which he hath
related, was not come into my knowledge; and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were for the rea<U+017F>on you alledge, or for <U+017F>ome other yet
unknown to me, <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> had given me but an imperfect account
of that adventure, and had not di<U+017F>covered the particulars
thereof that were of mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence.</q> You are very much
in the right, Madam, <hi>replies Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> for indeed, I <U+017F>hould glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have avoided giving you any account of it, could I well have
done it, and the little inclination I have to engage my <U+017F>elf in a
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this nature might have exempted me from doing
it now, had you not laid your ab<U+017F>olute commands upon me to
that purpo<U+017F>e. I have therefore made a <U+017F>hift to get through the
fir<U+017F>t and longe<U+017F>t part of my narration, <U+017F>ince you have already
acquainted this great Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e with the entertainments that
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between us in the garden, as al<U+017F>o all that happened even
to the day, on which, after I had brought in four thou<U+017F>and
men of tho<U+017F>e I had drawn in to our party by the means of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
and <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> I forced the palace, and that <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi>
having <U+017F>aved him<U+017F>elf by getting into the Citie, I led you through
the garden to a ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell which I had provided to carry you along
the <hi>Nile</hi> to the cittie of <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> a place then at our devotion. Of
all the<U+017F>e things, <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> I have given the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e an
exact account, all you have yet to inform us of, is, what hath

greate<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence, and I cannot but extreamly wonder you
<U+017F>hould not be more impatient to know whether you have not <U+017F>till
a Crown to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of.</p>
                     <p>After I had brought you to the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, and there left you,
though not without much violence to my <U+017F>elf; to put the de<U+017F>igne
we had undertaken in execution, which we had in <U+017F>ome part effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
in as much as concerned your liberty, but as to what was yet
to be done were in a very ill po<U+017F>ture by rea<U+017F>on of the e<U+017F>cape of
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> I returned to the palace, where I found all my men
ab<U+017F>olutely re<U+017F>olved to make good what they had gotten, and to
fight for your intere<U+017F>t to the la<U+017F>t ga<U+017F>pe. I encouraged them in
that de<U+017F>igne by all the words I thought might any way animate
them, and put them into a po<U+017F>ture of maintaining the Palace, in
the be<U+017F>t order I po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could. I made no doubt but that <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F>us,</hi>
as being a man much experienced in matters of war, would
come immediately and <U+017F>et upon us with all the force he could of
a <U+017F>udden make, knowing that it concerned his <U+017F>afety to recover
pre<U+017F>ently what he had lo<U+017F>t, before tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>upplies came in to us
which we expected. This he accordingly put in execution, as I
had imagined he would, and he was no <U+017F>ooner gotten into the
City, but he forced all the Citizens to take up armes, though the
main motive of their obedience was their fear, their inclinations
being ab<U+017F>olutely for their Queen; and in the mean time having
given order that all the troops that were in the <U+017F>uburbs and about
the Citie, <U+017F>hould rally under the command of <hi>Theogenes</hi> and
<hi>A<U+017F>anor,</hi> he got a con<U+017F>iderable body together, and came again<U+017F>t
the Palace with abundance of fury. You know, your <U+017F>elf, Madam,
that all the fortification there is about it, is a ditch with a low
<U+017F>tone-wall flanked here and there with certain Towers. The
ditch may <U+017F>oon be filled, as being neither very broad nor very
deep, yet not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily but that it would co<U+017F>t a great many men to
do it, the palace being made good by a con<U+017F>iderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, and tho<U+017F>e all re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ell their lives at the deare<U+017F>t
rate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> having made his a<U+017F><U+017F>aults upon that <U+017F>ide of the palace
which lies towards the City, <U+017F>ent at the <U+017F>ame time to <U+017F>ecure all
the boats that were upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> that he might not onely have
the command of the river to carry on the <U+017F>iege again<U+017F>t us, but al<U+017F>o
prevent us from making any e<U+017F>cape that way. Nay I doubt not
but that, if he had had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of your departure, he
would have <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome boats after you; but you might have been
<U+017F>o far before he bethought him of that cour<U+017F>e, that I was out of
all fear of your being taken before your arrivall at the City of
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> where you were expected. <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> made his approaches
and carried on the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, as a man that very well knew what
he had to do; and cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome part of his <U+017F>ouldiers to bring turfs,
<U+017F>tones, faggots, and all <U+017F>uch other things as were fit to fill up the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97242:121"/>
ditch, he began to do it with abundance of earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but there
being within a con<U+017F>iderable number of old <U+017F>oldiers, and <U+017F>uch as
were well ver<U+017F>ed in matters of war, and far greater then was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
for the defence of the palace, while I gave order that
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, the re<U+017F>t were di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed upon the
battlements, and <U+017F>howering down arrowes upon the Stormers
that were below, they filled the ditch much more than all tho<U+017F>e
other things did which the enemy had brought thither to that
purpo<U+017F>e. I had, as good fortune would have it, found out in
the palace, an infinite number of arrowes and all other armes,
which it <U+017F>eems <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed to be brought in thither, and
which was yet a further happine<U+017F><U+017F>e going into that chamber
which he had appropriated to him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ince his pretended Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I there met with my own armour enriched with Eagles of
gold, the very <U+017F>ame which I had been <U+017F>tripped of after the battle,
and which had been brought to him, as well for their <U+017F>umptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
as to put him into a greater a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my death. I
have been informed <U+017F>ince that it was an officer that had fought
under my command in the war of <hi>Nubia,</hi> and one that had
<U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pects for me, that had hindred his companions from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off my head, to pre<U+017F>ent it to <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> as they were once
re<U+017F>olved to do, and was content onely to <U+017F>trip me of my Armour
and to pre<U+017F>ent him with them. This accident I looked on as a
good omen, and thereupon putting them on with much joy, I
imagined my <U+017F>elf more hardly conquerable in them than I had
been before. I very diligently vi<U+017F>ited all tho<U+017F>e places wherein my
pre<U+017F>ence might be any way <U+017F>erviceable, and omitted nothing that
contributed ought to our defence, no more then <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> did
on the other <U+017F>ide to carry on the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault. I once perceived him,
amid<U+017F>t a many of his Soldiers, i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out his orders with much
earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and having di<U+017F>covered my <U+017F>elf to him by a great
<U+017F>hout, I took a bow and arrowes in my hand, and <U+017F>hot twice at
him, the latter arrow coming <U+017F>o near his head, that he dur<U+017F>t not
continue any longer in the place where he was; and perceiving
that, at the <U+017F>ame time, I cau<U+017F>ed him to be <U+017F>hot at <U+017F>everall
waies, after he had threatned me by cries and ge<U+017F>tures, he retired
to a place where he was more <U+017F>ecure. From that time I <U+017F>et upon
him the be<U+017F>t Archers I had, to <U+017F>hoot continually at him a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as
ever he <U+017F>hould appear, by which means it came to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that he
was le<U+017F><U+017F>e confident in the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault then he had <U+017F>hown him<U+017F>elf
before.</p>
                     <p>The number of men that I had within the palace was <U+017F>uch,
that I might have ventured to <U+017F>ally out, and have forced back
the more daring of the Enemies <U+017F>ide; but it was my greate<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to gain time, in expectation of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>upplies which
<hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> was to bring me, and which were rai<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>o much
privacy, in the Cities that were <U+017F>till under our command, that
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> had not the lea<U+017F>t intelligence thereof, and in the mean
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97242:122"/>
time to keep <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> <U+017F>o in play, that, directing all his force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
us, he might make the le<U+017F><U+017F>e provi<U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e I had about me in the palace I had four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men lying dormant in the Citie, in certain hou<U+017F>es whereof we
were confident, and under the command of <hi>Clinias</hi> a Nephew of
<hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes;</hi> and the<U+017F>e were ordered, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the <U+017F>upplies were
come, to joyne with them at a place appointed, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e
them<U+017F>elves of a gate of the City to make way for the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>ome part of my de<U+017F>igne to the principall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
encouraging them to play the men that day, and promi<U+017F>ing
them they <U+017F>hould be relieved, if not the night following, at
farthe<U+017F>t the next morning. There was no great need of this <U+017F>olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation,
for they all fought with <U+017F>uch eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that, though
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> had in <U+017F>ome places filled up the ditch, and had brought
<U+017F>ealing ladders to <U+017F>torme the place, yet all came to no other
effect then that tho<U+017F>e who were mo<U+017F>t forward to get up, were rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
down into the ditch, as it were to abate the confidence of tho<U+017F>e
that were to come after them.</p>
                     <p>You would haply think my relation very tedious and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<U+017F>hould I give you a particular account of all the actions
of that day, and therefore, I <U+017F>hall think it <U+017F>ufficient to tell you,
that the Gods (who no doubt, had a vengeance in <U+017F>tore for the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi>) took away the light of his rea<U+017F>on in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency,
and, depriving him of <U+017F>ome part of his ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
were plea<U+017F>ed, that, blinded by the violence he was in to
reduce us, he bent all his forces to do it, in <U+017F>uch manner, that he
made not any provi<U+017F>ion for the <U+017F>ecurity of the City. Upon this
account was it that he <U+017F>pent the whole day in a<U+017F><U+017F>aults again<U+017F>t us,
but to no purpo<U+017F>e, and having hardly taken one houres re<U+017F>t in the
night, he was at us again before day, much more furiou<U+017F>ly then
before.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> having landed in the I<U+017F>land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any difficulty, was, with the advantage of the night, gotten
to the very gates of <hi>Meroe,</hi> and, at the break of day, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <U+017F>ignall which we were agreed upon with <hi>Clinias,</hi> he was
pre<U+017F>ently at the gate, whither all his men, coming to him from <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
quarters, came about him, and, before that tho<U+017F>e who were
then upon the guard could perceive whether they were Friends
or Enemies, they fell upon them, cut off tho<U+017F>e that made any
re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and having forced the re<U+017F>t to fly, <U+017F>et open the gate
for <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes.</hi> Yet could not this be done with <U+017F>o little noi<U+017F>e,
but that tho<U+017F>e who were upon the walls, though but few, and
tho<U+017F>e not much minding what was done, did, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as it was
light, di<U+017F>cover the forces of <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> and accordingly give the
alarme; but, before it could come to the place where <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi>
was, <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> was gotten into the City, his troops coming in
<U+017F>till like waves, and meeting with nothing that any way oppo<U+017F>ed
them. He brought in along with him three thou<U+017F>and hor<U+017F>e, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97242:122"/>
about <U+017F>even or eight thou<U+017F>and foot, all choice men, and <U+017F>uch as
were ready to <U+017F>acrifice their lives for the ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e wherein they
were engaged. <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> u<U+017F>ed all the expedition he could to
get in his forces, which he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into the more <U+017F>pacious <U+017F>treets
and other large places that ly neer that gate, and when he <U+017F>aw
that the greate<U+017F>t part were come in, and that the re<U+017F>t would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
without any hindrance, he advanced towards the palace, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all to the <U+017F>word that he met with in armes. He cau<U+017F>ed it to
be cried wherever he came that the Citizens <U+017F>hould lay down
their armes, and that no violence <U+017F>hould be done to tho<U+017F>e that
would not fight for <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us.</hi> It were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ent
to you what a di<U+017F>traction <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> was in, when word was
brought of that misfortune, and what imprecations he made
again<U+017F>t heaven, when he perceived him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>urprized by tho<U+017F>e
very enemies, whom not long before he had <U+017F>lighted for their
weakene<U+017F><U+017F>e: and yet he withall <U+017F>aw that he had but little time
to loo<U+017F>e in con<U+017F>ultation, and that in<U+017F>tead of carrying on the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault
again<U+017F>t the palace, he mu<U+017F>t make head again<U+017F>t <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> and fight
him.</p>
                     <p>He accordingly re<U+017F>olved to do it, and thereupon, rallying all
the forces he had abont him, and giving order that his hor<U+017F>e
<U+017F>hould mount, he mounted al<U+017F>o him<U+017F>elf, and leaving a <U+017F>mall
number before the Palace to keep us in play, he took all the re<U+017F>t
along with him to engage with <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes.</hi> I had under<U+017F>tood by
a <U+017F>ignall from <hi>Clinias</hi> that the <U+017F>upplies were come, and ea<U+017F>ily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
what might have followed, in<U+017F>omuch, that, finding that I
might either freely <U+017F>ally out, or at the wor<U+017F>t meet with <U+017F>uch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
as I might well overcome, I thought it not fit to <U+017F>ight any
longer behind dead walls; and <U+017F>o leaving twelve hundred men
to make good the Palace, though a le<U+017F><U+017F>e number might have <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to do it, I commanded out all the re<U+017F>t, and getting up of a
good hor<U+017F>e, whereof I found no <U+017F>mall number about the Palace,
and which I di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed among the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable of tho<U+017F>e that
were about me, I cau<U+017F>ed the great gate of the Palace to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and drew out into a <U+017F>pacious place not far from it. Tho<U+017F>e
that endeavoured to oppo<U+017F>e our pa<U+017F><U+017F>age were immediately cut in
pieces, and the re<U+017F>t, running away, made all the ha<U+017F>t they could to
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was no <U+017F>ooner got into the City, but I cau<U+017F>ed it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
every where, as <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> had done before, that the
Queen pardoned the Citizens, provided they laid down their
armes, and this, running from one to another, proved <U+017F>o ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
that the greate<U+017F>t part of the inhabitants took occa<U+017F>ion to
go home to their own hou<U+017F>es, by which means <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi>'s
party became much weaker then it had been. However, the
number he had about him was far greater then that of our forces;
but he could not make any advantage of their number in the
<U+017F>treets, where the engagement was not the <U+017F>ame as it would have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97242:123"/>
been in an open field. <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> was already engaged with <hi>Ori<U+017F>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and upon the fir<U+017F>t encounter there was abundance of bloud
<U+017F>pilt on both <U+017F>ides. As I was marching towards the place where I
thought to have found them, I met with <hi>A<U+017F>anor</hi> in my way, in the
head of a party which he was carrying to the relief of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us.</hi>
I immediately charged him, and it happening that we met in a
<U+017F>pacious place, the engagement proved accordingly very hot
and bloudy. The <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e al<U+017F>o for <U+017F>ome time was very doubtful,
but at la<U+017F>t victory declared her <U+017F>elf for the ju<U+017F>ter cau<U+017F>e, and,
<hi>A<U+017F>anor</hi> being killed, with the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable of tho<U+017F>e that were
about him, the re<U+017F>t ran away in di<U+017F>order towards the place where
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> was fighting again<U+017F>t <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> and certainly there it
was, that bloud and blows were not <U+017F>pared, and that we had by
much the wor<U+017F>t end of the <U+017F>taff. <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> fighting with his men
like one that had all at the <U+017F>take, had charged <hi>Ori<U+017F>ihenes</hi> with
<U+017F>uch fury, that the brave<U+017F>t of his men lay upon the ground, and he
him<U+017F>elf, being unhor<U+017F>ed, di<U+017F>puted the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e on foot with little
hope of victory, nay, it would not have been long ere he had lo<U+017F>t
his life, had not <U+017F>ome of the be<U+017F>t affected and <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t of his men
<U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves before him, and relieved him with much eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e.
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> making all the advantage he could of that overture of
victory, forced his enemies to retreat, fighting them <U+017F>till even into
the <U+017F>pacious place of <hi>Meroe.</hi> There it was that he thought to give
them an ab<U+017F>olute defeat, by rea<U+017F>on of the advantage of the place,
and the di<U+017F>traction they were already in, when I, coming to their
relief another way, which I found free, got up to that place with
my Troop, and immediately crying out, <hi>Candace, Candace,</hi> and
tho<U+017F>e that followed me, <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> we revived tho<U+017F>e that were
ready to quit the field, and abated their confidence, who expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing le<U+017F><U+017F>e then victory. The pre<U+017F>ence of the two chiefs
added very much to the bloodine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the engagement, which
was upon my coming rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed, and, having <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome of my
men to relieve <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> who<U+017F>e danger I had under<U+017F>tood, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to meet with <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> as knowing that in his per<U+017F>on
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted all the war. I took notice of the place where he was, and
he immediately knew me. I am ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded that it was not
his de<U+017F>ire to avoid fighting, being, by the acknowledgment of all,
a man valiant enough, and no le<U+017F><U+017F>e concerned in my death then I
could be in his: but the mo<U+017F>t devoted to his intere<U+017F>ts that were
about him, <U+017F>etting them<U+017F>elves before him, many were laid on the
ground that I was forced to di<U+017F>patch to come up to his per<U+017F>on.
At la<U+017F>t we came together, notwith<U+017F>tanding the oppo<U+017F>ition of our
men, and running at him full of fury; <hi>The day is now come,</hi> Tyrant,
<U+017F>aid I to him, <hi>that thou mu<U+017F>t render up the Crown with thy own life
into the bargain.</hi> He made me <U+017F>ome an<U+017F>wer, which I could not
hear by rea<U+017F>on of the noi<U+017F>e, and the heat I was then in, and
received me with a re<U+017F>olution not mu<U+017F>t different from what I
brought. But, being ever and anon hindred by our men, who came
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97242:123"/>
in between us, and that e<U+017F>pecially by his, who fell upon me on all
<U+017F>ides, I grew the more eager to determine the difference, and that
was it had almo<U+017F>t co<U+017F>t me my life. I had made two blows at <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F>us,</hi>
with <U+017F>uch good fortune, that they gave him two wounds,
whereupon he began to look on me as one that fought with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
confidence of victory, when my hor<U+017F>e, by rea<U+017F>on of many
hurts he had received, fell down <U+017F>o of a <U+017F>udden, that I had much
ado to get my feet out of the <U+017F>tirrups, and to <U+017F>tand before <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi>
who taking me at that advantage, was upon the point of running
over me, I could not avoid the <U+017F>hock of his hor<U+017F>e, in<U+017F>omuch that
he had almo<U+017F>t overthrown me, but in that po<U+017F>ture leaning on my
own hor<U+017F>e that lay dead between my legs, with my left hand, I,
with my right, thru<U+017F>t my <U+017F>word into the belly of his, <U+017F>o that when
he was coming at me, he felt him falling down under him. In
that interim I clo<U+017F>ed with him, to avoid the <U+017F>hock of his men, and
in that di<U+017F>order finding a place unarmed, I run him with my <U+017F>word
through the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> <U+017F>tretched forth his arms as he was falling with his
hor<U+017F>e, but, in regard that I <U+017F>tood neer him, he very furiou<U+017F>ly ca<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf on me, and, by his weight forcing me to the ground, he
fell upon me, as he breathed out his la<U+017F>t, and fa<U+017F>tned on me in <U+017F>uch
a manner, that I found it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to get from under him,
all goared and covered with his bloud. The danger I was
in by rea<U+017F>on of that di<U+017F>advantage, had been very great, had I not
been relieved by diver<U+017F>e <U+017F>tout men, wo re<U+017F>cued me from the rage
of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi>'s friends, and, notwith<U+017F>tanding all they could do, got
me on hor<U+017F>eback again. This, Madam, was the fate of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi>
the u<U+017F>urper of your Dominions, and your precious Liberty, and
you may <U+017F>ee in it how that the ju<U+017F>t gods decreed he <U+017F>hould
peri<U+017F>h by his hands, to whom, of all men, that revenge was
mo<U+017F>t due.</p>
                     <p>Upon his death, tho<U+017F>e that were of his party were <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t, as
to courage and re<U+017F>olution, that the mo<U+017F>t eager in the cau<U+017F>e could
hardly be gotten to fight much longer. When I <U+017F>aw the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
they made was very weak, and that <U+017F>ome were running away in
the <U+017F>treets, ca<U+017F>ting away their arms, I con<U+017F>idered, Madam, that they
were your <U+017F>ubjects, and thereupon, out of a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>pare their
bloud, I cryed, and cau<U+017F>ed it to be cried up and down, that if they
laid down their arms, the Queen would give them their lives, and
would forgive all that was pa<U+017F>t. Some particular friends of <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>us</hi>
would not accept of this proffer, but would needs be killed, and,
among the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> Brother, who<U+017F>e life I would gladly have
<U+017F>aved for his Si<U+017F>ters <U+017F>ake: but all the re<U+017F>t, perceiving there was no
<U+017F>afety but by that means, and having, for the mo<U+017F>t part, <U+017F>ided with
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> purely out of fear, laid down their arms, and cried up
and down, <hi>God <U+017F>ave Queen Candace.</hi> I immediately thereupon
<U+017F>ent orders every where, that none <U+017F>hould be put to the <U+017F>word; and
it was <U+017F>o religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erved, that, after <U+017F>ome few minutes, there
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97242:124"/>
was no more bloud <U+017F>pilt. All tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi>'s party went in
among the Citizens, who had laid down their arms as <U+017F>oon as I
was gotten out of the Palace: and our men, though in arms and
victorious, began to treat the others as their Country-men and
companions. <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> who, having been <U+017F>et on hor<U+017F>eback again
by the relief which I had <U+017F>ent him, had joined with me, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him<U+017F>elf with abundance of valour, rid all about the City by
my order, and <U+017F>o appea<U+017F>ed the remainders of the di<U+017F>order, that
when the dead bodies were removed out of the <U+017F>treets, it could
hardly be imagined there had been any fight.</p>
                     <p>All things being thus compo<U+017F>ed, I <U+017F>ent out orders, that the more
con<U+017F>iderable of tho<U+017F>e that had followed <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> as well Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
as <U+017F>ouldiers, <U+017F>hould come to me in one of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pacious
places in the City, and, after I had entertained them with a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
(which it were not fit to trouble you with a recital of) wherein,
having in, the fir<U+017F>t place, repre<U+017F>ented to them the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of their
crime, I made them, in the next, apprehen<U+017F>ive of that of your
goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, who were gratiou<U+017F>ly plea<U+017F>ed, even at a time that they
might be puni<U+017F>hed with <U+017F>everity, to pardon them <U+017F>o horrid an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and forget all that was pa<U+017F>t; provided that for the future
they did tho<U+017F>e things which were expected from them. And that
I exhorted them to do with a true remor<U+017F>e, and to repair their
crime, by a fidelity as remarkable as their defection had been. All
the inhabitants an<U+017F>wered me with cries and tears, and, pronouncing
your name on their knees, they called all the gods to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e the
<U+017F>incerity of their intentions, and prote<U+017F>ted they had done nothing
again<U+017F>t you, but by force, and out of the fear they were in of the
power of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us.</hi> The <U+017F>ouldery, for the mo<U+017F>t part, returned
me the <U+017F>ame an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>o that after I had taken a new oath of
allegiance from them all in your name, I di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>embly,</hi>
permitting all to follow their occa<U+017F>ions, and <U+017F>uch as had friends
dead, to bury them. I al<U+017F>o gave way, that tho<U+017F>e that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a more particular affection to <hi>Tiraba<U+017F>us,</hi> <U+017F>hould take away his
body in order to an honourable enterrement, as knowing, Madam,
your genero<U+017F>ity to be <U+017F>uch, as permits not your re<U+017F>entments to go
beyond death. And thereupon, having my thoughts wholly taken
up with you, and yet not thinking it <U+017F>afe to leave <hi>Meroe</hi> that very
day, for fear of the accidents that might happen upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden
a revolution, I <U+017F>ent <hi>Clinias</hi> Expre<U+017F><U+017F>e to you, to give you an account
of all that had pa<U+017F>t, and to intreat you to remain at <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> till the
next day, at which time I <U+017F>hould have waited on you, bringing along
with me your people of <hi>Meroe,</hi> who were infinitely de<U+017F>irous of your
returne.</p>
                     <p>Having gone <U+017F>o far, I <U+017F>pent all the re<U+017F>t of the day, and <U+017F>ome
part of the night in pacifying and compo<U+017F>ing all things, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
the <U+017F>hortne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the time, there was <U+017F>uch order taken,
that it was hardly perceiveable that there had been any revolt in
<hi>Ethiopia.</hi> But what grief it was to me, what di<U+017F>traction I was in,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97242:124"/>
the gods onely know, the next day, when I found <hi>Clinias</hi> returned,
telling me, that you had been expected to no purpo<U+017F>e at <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi>
whither you came not at all, and where there had not bin any thing
heard of you. Being extreamly troubled at this account of you,
I immediatelie left <hi>Meroe,</hi> having onely <U+017F>taied <U+017F>o long as to leave
orders with <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes</hi> to take care of all things till your returne,
and, taking certain boats, and <U+017F>uch a number along with me, as I
thought fit, of tho<U+017F>e I could be<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t, I made all the ha<U+017F>t I could
to <hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a.</hi> There I <U+017F>oon met with the cruel confirmation of your
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and under<U+017F>tood from tho<U+017F>e that you had left to command
there in your ab<U+017F>ence, that they had neither <U+017F>een nor heard any
thing of you. The<U+017F>e unfortunate tidings rai<U+017F>ing the greate<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>traction imaginable in my thoughts, put me to <U+017F>uch extremities,
as I had never been acquainted with before; and the violence of
my affliction taking away for <U+017F>ome time the u<U+017F>e of my rea<U+017F>on, I
had much ado to forbear revenging my <U+017F>elf upon <U+017F>uch as had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
nothing to the misfortune. I did nothing the re<U+017F>t of that
day, and all the next night, but wander up and down upon the
<hi>Nile,</hi> while thou<U+017F>ands of per<U+017F>ons were <U+017F>earching in other places to
the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>But all proving ineffectual, I thought it my be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to return
to <hi>Meroe,</hi> out of a conceit, that, without all que<U+017F>tion, you had
been taken by <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons that <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us</hi> had <U+017F>ent after you, and
that, by <U+017F>ecuring tho<U+017F>e that were yet there, of the friends of
<hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi> <U+017F>omething might be di<U+017F>covered, when there comes to
<hi>Ba<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Marchant <U+017F>hip, by which I under<U+017F>tood, that as
they <U+017F>ailed up the <hi>Nile,</hi> they had met with the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi>
with four <U+017F>hips, and had e<U+017F>caped being taken by him, by making
to land, which they were not far from, and that they had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
<U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e to him, by rea<U+017F>on of the narrowne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the River in that
place above any other, that they could ea<U+017F>ily perceive there were
<U+017F>ome Ladies pri<U+017F>oners in his Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, whereof they had <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome
upon the deck, and heard the cries of others ecchoing all over the
River; and that afterwards, coming further into the River, after
the Pirate was gone by, they met with abundance of carka<U+017F>es
<U+017F>loating, and found all the circum<U+017F>tances of a great and bloudy
engagement. From this di<U+017F>our<U+017F>e, which the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I was then
di<U+017F>tracted by ea<U+017F>ily induced me to believe, I immediately inferred,
all circum<U+017F>tances con<U+017F>idered, that it mu<U+017F>t needs be you, Madam,
that was fallen into the hands of the famous Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi>
who<U+017F>e name was grown dreadful in all the<U+017F>e coa<U+017F>ts, and who was
the be<U+017F>t acquainted of any therewith, by rea<U+017F>on of the perpetual
inroads that he made upon them. You may ea<U+017F>ily imagine, Madam,
that it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to make you <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the grief
it was to me to hear the<U+017F>e fatal tidings, and that all I am able to <U+017F>ay
will come very far <U+017F>hort of what I then felt upon the fir<U+017F>t enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of that cruel account of our malicious Fortune. This
was it that put me out of all patience, and in a manner took away
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97242:125"/>
the u<U+017F>e of my rea<U+017F>on, in<U+017F>omuch, that the gods may well pardon
me, if, during the time that that extravagance la<U+017F>ted, I did not
alwaies ob<U+017F>erve that re<U+017F>pect which a man <U+017F>hould never be guilty
of any breach of towards them. Nay, me thought the age I was
then po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort excu<U+017F>able, and that misfortune,
happening at a time when I expected all the kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of fortune, <U+017F>eemed to me <U+017F>o great, that I could not imagine
it <U+017F>upportable by the greate<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tancy in the World. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e,
thinking it too great a lowne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>pirit to loo<U+017F>e time in
lamentations and fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e complaints, I <U+017F>ent <hi>Clinias</hi> back, again to
<hi>Meroe,</hi> with orders directed to <hi>Ori<U+017F>thenes,</hi> to hearken out every
where after you, in ca<U+017F>e the tidings I had received of you <U+017F>hould
prove fal<U+017F>e, and to <U+017F>ecure the mo<U+017F>t intimate friends of <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us,</hi>
to find out, by that means, whether you had been taken by any
orders of his, and, having given him that charge, I took up three
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that lay in the haven ready to <U+017F>et <U+017F>ail, accompanied by all
tho<U+017F>e I had about me, that I thought able to fight, and made all
the <U+017F>peed I could towards the mouth of the <hi>Nile,</hi> into the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea. I thought it no <U+017F>uch difficulty to make after
<hi>Zenodorus,</hi> though with a number of ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, much inferiour to
his, and, no doubt, le<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>erviceable as to matter of engagement, and
all the fear I was in, was, that I <U+017F>hould not find him, <U+017F>o far was I
from any thoughts of being wor<U+017F>ted, if I were <U+017F>o fortunate as to
meet with him.</p>
                     <p>We got out of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tred into the <U+017F>ea, being
ab<U+017F>olutely to <U+017F>eek what cour<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hould take; but, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood
that <hi>Zenodorus</hi> came, often to <hi>Pelen<U+017F>ia,</hi> and the ports
adjoining to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to <U+017F>ell <U+017F>ome part of what he took upon
tho<U+017F>e coa<U+017F>ts, I imagined I might there hear of him, and <U+017F>o thought
fit to make towards <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I <U+017F>hall not, Madam, trouble you
with the complaints I made during the time of this <U+017F>ad cour<U+017F>e, nor
the doleful reflections which tormented my thoughts without the
lea<U+017F>t intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as indeed I ought to have been,
of a misfortune that deprived me of the happines of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence;
but this was not yet the greate<U+017F>t of my afflictions, and
when I imagined to my <U+017F>elf, that my faire<U+017F>t Queen was in the
hands of a mercile<U+017F><U+017F>e Pirate, and repre<U+017F>ented to my <U+017F>elf all the
dangers whereto <U+017F>he might be expo<U+017F>ed, (and to which, as I have
<U+017F>ince under<U+017F>tood from <hi>Eteocles,</hi> it was but indeed too too true that
<U+017F>he was) I was at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of all patience, in<U+017F>omuch that I could
hardly forbear ca<U+017F>ting my <U+017F>elf into the <U+017F>ea. At la<U+017F>t, we were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the <U+017F>ame tempe<U+017F>t which proved <U+017F>o favourable to you
again<U+017F>t the in<U+017F>olencies of <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and which hath been the
occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>o many accidents upon the<U+017F>e coa<U+017F>ts at the <U+017F>ame time;
and this al<U+017F>o grew <U+017F>o implacable to us, that our veilels were di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>ed,
in <U+017F>uch manner, that I could never yet learn any tidings of
the other two, and know not but that they are long <U+017F>ince devoured
by the waves: and that wherein I was in my <U+017F>elf, after we had,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97242:125"/>
for two whole daies <U+017F>trugled with the <U+017F>ame cruelty of weather,
that you had met with, was at length ca<U+017F>t upon this coa<U+017F>t within
a hundred Stadia of this City, <U+017F>o <U+017F>hattered, that it was ab<U+017F>olutely
unfit for the <U+017F>ea. I left <U+017F>ome part of my men to get the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell
repaired, as at <hi>Alexandria</hi> they might with all freedome do, there
being free commerce between the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
leaving orders with them that they <U+017F>hould expect to hear from
me in the port of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that they <U+017F>hould make enquiry
every where after the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus.</hi> And <U+017F>o, taking onely
twelve along with me, proportionably to the number of hor<U+017F>es
that we had in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, we all mounted, and having, for <U+017F>ome
time rid all together along the <U+017F>hore, I thought it not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e that
we divided into parties, it being the more likely way to find out
what we <U+017F>ought, and thereupon <U+017F>hewing them a little village
which I knew, and whereof I gave them the name, I entreated
them, that, after they had vi<U+017F>ited all the places about <hi>Alexandria</hi>
they would all meet there at night.</p>
                     <p>This was done as it had been re<U+017F>olved, and for my part I would
have no more in my company but onely one E<U+017F>quire, by rea<U+017F>on of
the aver<U+017F>ion, which, through melancholy, I had for all company.
All that day was <U+017F>pent in a fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>earch, and at night meeting
at the rendez-vous appointed, we there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it over, wanting
nothing as to the accommodation of the body, if the mind could
have taken any re<U+017F>t. The next day, I named to them another
<U+017F>mall town di<U+017F>tant from this place about two hundred Stadia,
where was appointed the meeting for the night following, and
<U+017F>o, dividing into <U+017F>everall parties, as the day before, directing them
to take other cour<U+017F>es then they had done, went my <U+017F>elf as
before, attended onely by a <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on in the qualitie of an
E<U+017F>quire.</p>
                     <p>I had wandred up and down for <U+017F>ome part of the day, when,
finding my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>weltred with heat, and the weight of my Armour,
which I had not put off all this time, I would needs take a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
re<U+017F>t, and refre<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf at a <U+017F>pring that lay in my way in the
mid<U+017F>t of a very plea<U+017F>ant valley. With this re<U+017F>olution I alighted
at a certain di<U+017F>tance from the <U+017F>pring, and, having given my hor<U+017F>e
to the E<U+017F>quire, I <U+017F>ate down by it, and putting up the vi<U+017F>our of my
head-piece, I drunk of the water, and lay down on the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e,
where no doubt I had taken <U+017F>ome little re<U+017F>t, had my grief been <U+017F>o
<U+017F>upportable as to afford me <U+017F>uch an intervall. I had not been there
many minutes, when there comes to the place where I was, a man
accoutred much after the <U+017F>ame rate that I was, and, as I conceive,
with the <U+017F>ame intention. His armes were very <U+017F>umptuous, and
he was of a goodly pre<U+017F>ence: but I thought him quite another
man, when he had put up the vi<U+017F>our of his helmet, as I had, and
that, ca<U+017F>ting my eies on his face, I found he had the be<U+017F>t counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in the world? We <U+017F>aluted one another very re<U+017F>pectfully,
though that in his face, as well as mine, were vi<U+017F>ible the characters
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97242:126"/>
of more than ordinary <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e. After he had quenched his
thir<U+017F>t, which it <U+017F>eems had forced him thither, he began to look
more earne<U+017F>tly on me, and he had no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his eie on my
face but he thought he <U+017F>hould know me. His behaviour obliging
me to look on him with the like earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, methought the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of his face were not <U+017F>trange to me, and, notwith<U+017F>tanding
the alteration which <U+017F>even or eight yeares might have wrought
therein, I pre<U+017F>ently was per<U+017F>waded I had <U+017F>een him <U+017F>omewhere
before.</p>
                     <p>We looked thus one upon the other, with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence on
both <U+017F>ides, when he, fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf, and speaking to me
with an accent which I was not unacquainted with; <hi>I know not,
<U+017F>aid he to me, whether you would find</hi> Britomarus <hi>in my countenance
as I would do</hi> Cleomedon <hi>in yours.</hi> There needed no more than
the<U+017F>e words to put me out of all doubt, that it was no other
then the <U+017F>ame audacious <hi>Britomarus,</hi> with whom, while we were
yet both very young, I had had that great falling out in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
and who<U+017F>e valour and genero<U+017F>ity I had <U+017F>o much admired. And
though I <U+017F>hould have gladly concealed my <U+017F>elf from any other
per<U+017F>on, yet could I not imagine it pardonable in me to do it from
<hi>Britomarus,</hi> after I had reflected on tho<U+017F>e things that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed

manner of <U+017F>peaking to me; <q>You are very much in the right,
<hi><U+017F>aid I to him,</hi> I am <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and though it is with much ado
that I called you to mind, yet now I am ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>atisfied that
you are <hi>Britomarus.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>'Tis very true, I am <hi>Britomarus,</hi> replied
he, and I mu<U+017F>t tell you moreover, that I am <hi>Artaban.</hi> Under
this latter name I am much more known among men then under
the former; under that name I have gained <U+017F>ome battles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Kingdomes for ungratefull Kings, and have done tho<U+017F>e
actions, which have haply rai<U+017F>ed me to that rank, whereto I told
you at our la<U+017F>t parting, I was in hopes to rai<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf. I have
mea<U+017F>ured my <U+017F>word with Kings, who have not thought it
any di<U+017F>honour to them<U+017F>elves; I have rai<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome of them, I
have pulled down others, and I have not met with any greater

                     </p>
                     <p>There needed no more than the word <hi>Artaban,</hi> to <U+017F>atisfie me
as to <U+017F>ome part of tho<U+017F>e things which he told me, the reputation
of <hi>Artaban</hi> being <U+017F>o much <U+017F>pread all over the world, that few were
ignorant of the great actions he had done. On the other <U+017F>ide, by
rea<U+017F>on of the acquaintance there had been between me and <hi>Brito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi>
I was ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded that he was <hi>Artaban,</hi> as finding in
him all things extreamly conformable to what I had known in the
other. I hearkened to his violent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with much patience,
to <U+017F>ee what would be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of it, when he, proceeding;
<q>I do not, <hi><U+017F>aid he to me,</hi> tell you the<U+017F>e things of my <U+017F>elf, <hi>Cleomedon</hi>
to derive any vain reputation thence, but to give you occa<U+017F>ion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97242:126"/>
to remember that, when I was affronted by you, and forced to
quit the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Candace</hi> for your <U+017F>ake, I told you, as we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that a day might haply come, wherein I <U+017F>hould be in a
condition once more to mea<U+017F>ure a weapon with you. Not but
that the cau<U+017F>e of that re<U+017F>entment of mine hath long <U+017F>ince been
taken away, and that the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es which were <U+017F>lighted by
<hi>Candace,</hi> have Been entertained by a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e who is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
either to <hi>Candace</hi> or any other Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world; not
al<U+017F>o but that I am <U+017F>atisfied that the aver<U+017F>ion which I have ever
naturally had for you, is unrea<U+017F>onable, <U+017F>ince your excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
ought in all ju<U+017F>tice to gain you the e<U+017F>teem of all the
world. On the other <U+017F>ide, it is not unlikely, but that there may be
<U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion, nay haply nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, that both of us <U+017F>hould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our armes el<U+017F>ewhere, and upon that con<U+017F>ideration I <U+017F>hall
not oblige you to turn yours again<U+017F>t me: but you will be plea<U+017F>ed
to remember, when we <U+017F>hall meet with a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
that <hi>Britomarus</hi> is arrived to that condition
which he <U+017F>aid he <U+017F>hould come to, and dares mea<U+017F>ure
a <U+017F>word not onely with <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> but with all the Princes upon

                     <p>This fiery di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Artaban</hi>'s, though it rai<U+017F>ed in me a
certain e<U+017F>teem for the per<U+017F>on, yet was I not a little incen<U+017F>ed at,
and my thoughts being ea<U+017F>ily put into di<U+017F>order by rea<U+017F>on of the
affliction I was in, there needed but a <U+017F>mall matter to put me out
of all patience. Not but that I was extreamly troubled at this
adventure, as <U+017F>uch as obliged me to a fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e engagement, in a
time which I was to employ in finding out other enemies; but
there being no grief <U+017F>o great as to <U+017F>mother the Love of glory, I
thought, that, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which <hi>Britomarus</hi> had made, well
con<U+017F>idered, I could not with honour avoid fighting, though he
had left it to my choice. Upon this reflection looking on him
with an eie, which ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered how much I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at what he had <U+017F>aid; <q>Artaban, <hi><U+017F>aid I to him,</hi> I am very
ready to believe of you all that you <U+017F>ay of your <U+017F>elf, as al<U+017F>o all
that Fame hath <U+017F>pread abroad concerning you, and am withall
<U+017F>atisfied, that the cau<U+017F>e of your re<U+017F>entments hath been taken
away by the change of your affections; but, it <U+017F>eems, though
there be no quarrell between us out of any con<U+017F>ideration of
jealou<U+017F>ie, I am yet to be accountable for your aver<U+017F>ion, and
though there want not haply other occa<U+017F>ions of far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
than the motives of our differences that call me el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
yet will I be obliged for my liberty to pro<U+017F>ecute them,
to my <U+017F>elf and not to your civility. Let us not remit to another
time and other opportunities, what we may determine in this. It
is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible we may not meet with another <U+017F>o favourable, and we
were both equally blameable if we <U+017F>hould now part and avoid an
engagement that is now become nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and for which it
<U+017F>eems you come <U+017F>o well prepared.</q>

With the<U+017F>e words I ro<U+017F>e up from the place where <hi>I</hi> lay, and
after I had put on and fa<U+017F>tened my head-piece, and taken my
buckler from my E<U+017F>quire, I got up on hor<U+017F>eback, and rid forth
into the mo<U+017F>t delightfull part of the plain. <hi>Artaban</hi> was not a
per<U+017F>on to be expected, he had his foot in the <U+017F>tirrup a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as my
<U+017F>elf, and being immediately, come up to me, he ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered
by all his deportment, that he was the per<U+017F>on Fame publi<U+017F>hed him
to be. The fir<U+017F>t ou<U+017F>et proved very furious, and the indignation
I was in to think that he <U+017F>hould continue an unju<U+017F>t aver<U+017F>ion during
<U+017F>o many yeares for a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure I had innocently done him, and
for which <hi>I</hi> had made <U+017F>uch <U+017F>atisfaction, cau<U+017F>ed me to fight with no
le<U+017F><U+017F>e animo<U+017F>ity again<U+017F>t him, then I had done <U+017F>ome few daies before
again<U+017F>t <hi>Tiriba<U+017F>us.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t blowes that were dealt on both <U+017F>ides
were hearty and heavy enough; but being both very well <U+017F>killed
in the u<U+017F>e of the Buckler, there were a many exchanged ere there
was any wound received on either <U+017F>ide. At la<U+017F>t being more and
more exa<U+017F>perated by this triall of our <U+017F>trength, we engaged one
another with le<U+017F><U+017F>e circum<U+017F>pection, in<U+017F>omuch that both his armour
and mine began to be dy'd with the blood, which our <U+017F>words
drew out of our bodies. That <U+017F>pectacle heightning our courage
added al<U+017F>o to our animo<U+017F>ity, and no doubt but that the end of
the combat would have proved fatall to one of us, nay it may be
to both, by rea<U+017F>on of the great equality of our force, when a
certain man on hor<U+017F>eback riding at a <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>tance from us, and
making a <U+017F>udden halt, <U+017F>taied for <U+017F>ome little time to look on us.
For my part, I could <U+017F>ee nothing in the man that might divert me
from minding what I was then about: but <hi>Artaban</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner
ca<U+017F>t his eie on him, but he gives a great <U+017F>hout, and at the <U+017F>ame
time, gave me <U+017F>uch a blow over the head that I was for <U+017F>ome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<U+017F>tunn'd with it. However, I made a <U+017F>hift to recover and
that immediately, and was thinking to drive towards him, when,
looking about, I perceived him at a great di<U+017F>tance from me, riding
with all the <U+017F>peed his hor<U+017F>e could make, after the man we had
<U+017F>een, and pur<U+017F>uing him <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely, that it was not long ere a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that was in the plain deprived me of the <U+017F>ight of him. This
accident put me very much to a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, as being too well acquainted
with the valour of my Adver<U+017F>ary, to imagine that it was out of
any motive of fear that he avoided fighting. No, I was far from
conceiving any <U+017F>uch thing of him, as knowing him to be as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and as <U+017F>tout a man as ever drew <U+017F>word: but being already
exa<U+017F>perated by the <U+017F>ight of my blood <U+017F>liding down along my
Armour, I would needs run after him, either to decide our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
or know of him the rea<U+017F>on why he had left me in the mid<U+017F>t
of it.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon ob<U+017F>erving the way he had taken, I followed the
track of his hor<U+017F>e, with all the <U+017F>peed I could make, and within a
<U+017F>mall time came into a place where I found him engaged in a
combate with another man that <U+017F>eemed to be no le<U+017F><U+017F>e valiant
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97242:127"/>
then him<U+017F>elf. But, my greate<U+017F>t Queen, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay no more as to
what pa<U+017F>t then, becau<U+017F>e you were your <U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>ent and <U+017F>aw all,
having <hi>Eteocles</hi> with you, and another valiant per<U+017F>on, who made
it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to part us. There it was that I had the happinne<U+017F><U+017F>e
to <U+017F>ee you like a fla<U+017F>h of lightning, and ju<U+017F>t at the minute that I
began to feel the fir<U+017F>t motions of joy for that adventure, I <U+017F>aw
you carried away, once more, by the man whom <hi>Artaban</hi> had
pur<U+017F>ued, who was returned thither with his companions, and
was the <hi>Pirate Zenodorus,</hi> as I have under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince by
<hi>Eteocles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fair Queen, who had been pre<U+017F>ent at that action, and had
ob<U+017F>erved all till <U+017F>he was carried away, was <U+017F>o well acquainted with
all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, that he might well forbear all further account thereof.
Whereupon the Prince related to her, how that he had followed
her <U+017F>o long, till at la<U+017F>t, through the great lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of bloud, and the
weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e he was reduced to, by rea<U+017F>on of his wounds he fell off
his hor<U+017F>e; how he had been relieved by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and not long
after by his own Brother, Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e
<hi>Artemi<U+017F>a.</hi> He afterwards entertained her with an account how
they had brought him to the hou<U+017F>e where they had taken <U+017F>anctuary
them<U+017F>elves; how that <U+017F>ome few daies after, when he had in <U+017F>ome
mea<U+017F>ure recovered his health, he had been acquainted with the
Hi<U+017F>tory of their loves, and yet, though he had not the lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t
of their vertue, and friend<U+017F>hip, that he thought it not fit at that
time to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf to them, as not knowing whether <U+017F>he
might take it well at his hands.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards acquainted her with the arrival of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and her being in that hou<U+017F>e, to whom al<U+017F>o he had not
di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elf, and how that the next day <U+017F>he had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away again with <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a. Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> aggravated to the Queen
the affliction he conceived at that misfortune, as being not in a
capacity to afford his Si<U+017F>ter the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances he ought, and to go
along with <hi>Alexander</hi> after tho<U+017F>e that had carried her away; yet
told her withal, that it was his re<U+017F>olution to have done it, and that
he would have put on his armour, if <hi>Alexander</hi> him<U+017F>elf had not
prevented him; and if <hi>Eteocles</hi> had not taken <U+017F>uch order, that
he could get neither arms nor hor<U+017F>es for that day: that the next
day towards the evening finding him<U+017F>elf a little <U+017F>tronger, he got
out of his bed with an intention at the <U+017F>ame time to <U+017F>eek out both
<hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and was got to one of the windows,
whence, ca<U+017F>ting his eye upon the adjoining wood, he had <U+017F>een a
Chariot pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by, wherein he had perceived the Queen, with the
fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> whom he knew not, that upon
that happy <U+017F>ight, joy taking its former place in his <U+017F>oul, friend<U+017F>hip
had <U+017F>ubmitted to love, and the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> troubled him
the le<U+017F><U+017F>e by rea<U+017F>on of the recovery of <hi>Candace:</hi> That he would
immediately have run after her, but, not long after, <hi>Eteocles,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the room, and having communicated that good news to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97242:128"/>
him, had intreated him to have a little patience, and to give him
leave to run alone after the Chariot, to find out the truth of that
adventure; That accordingly <hi>Eteocles</hi> got on hor<U+017F>eback, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the track of the Chariot, and tho<U+017F>e that conveyed it, into
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither having got in undi<U+017F>covered, he had informed

<U+017F>he was a Lady of great quality, born in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> that the<U+017F>e

<hi>Artaban</hi> had relieved him, and helped him on hor<U+017F>eback, after his

thereupon retired till night, at which time, through the help of
the darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, he made a <U+017F>hift to get into the City, and, knowing
what part of the Palace the Queen was lodged in, he, without any

If I have <U+017F>uffered much for you, I mu<U+017F>t yet confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you have

It is but ju<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be a pre<U+017F>ent made to you, as it were, in

                     <p>Having by the<U+017F>e words engaged him to <U+017F>ilence, <U+017F>he fell upon
<U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, wherein <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered to him what trouble
<U+017F>he was in for the danger whereto he expo<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, by coming
into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he mu<U+017F>t expect no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then death if he

<U+017F>een in his countenance) to venture on hor<U+017F>eback, and take <U+017F>uch
pains as he did. The Prince, after he had thanked her for the

my <U+017F>elf, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> it is not <U+017F>o great as you imagine it, and
be<U+017F>ides the difference there is between the face of a child of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, and that of a man of four and twenty, the report
that is <U+017F>cattered up and down the world of my death hath taken
<U+017F>uch root, and is particularly <U+017F>o much credited by <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> that
it were no <U+017F>mall difficulty to per<U+017F>wade people to the contrary:
and for my health, I find, that through the joy which the gods
have been plea<U+017F>ed to afford me, by meeting with you again, I
have recovered my <U+017F>trength in <U+017F>uch a mea<U+017F>ure, that within three
or four dayes I <U+017F>hall be in as good plight and condition as ever I
was, either to do any thing in point of arms, or to waite on you

that you were in this City, and expect your orders with that
<U+017F>ecrecy which <hi>Eteocles</hi> hath engaged them to. I <U+017F>hall be content
to remain either with them, if you think it good, or in the hou<U+017F>e
where I have already made <U+017F>ome abode, and where, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment

my <U+017F>elf, which would force me to ha<U+017F>ten my departure hence,
were it not that the company of this fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without an infinite affliction ever quit, doth prevail with me
to wave all re<U+017F>olutions of that nature.</q>

                     <p>The<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words fell from her with a certain <U+017F>mile, whereupon

<U+017F>ince that through the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of the gods, and the valour and
conduct of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> we have recovered the Kingdom of our

more acceptable to me then that which I may receive by this

                     <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Candace</hi> was accented with <U+017F>o much affection,
that <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> could not forbear embracing her, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her many
times together, giving her withal many thanks for this demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her friend<U+017F>hip, in terms wherein <U+017F>he fully expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed how
extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <U+017F>he was thereof. At length, turning to <q>
                           <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi>
I <U+017F>hould have feared, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> that the difference there is
between you and <hi>Artaban</hi> might have engaged you to employ
the interre<U+017F>t you have with the Queen, to oppo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>anctuary
and entertainment <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to pro<U+017F><U+017F>er me, as knowing the
inclinations he hath for me, and haply having under<U+017F>tood the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97242:129"/>
marks of a more then ordinary e<U+017F>teem which I have for him:
but <U+017F>ince you have been <U+017F>o fortunately generous, as to have done
her, with joy, the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>he could have expected from
the be<U+017F>t of her friends, I cannot but hope, that, through the
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Queen, who will make it very much her bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
to per<U+017F>wade you thereto, you will not be <U+017F>o exa<U+017F>perated
again<U+017F>t him, as to deny him your frien<U+017F>hip, if he de<U+017F>ires it of you,
as he is obliged to do.</q> 
                        <q>Madam, <hi>replies Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> I can make an
unfained prote<U+017F>tation to you, that I never had any hatred again<U+017F>t
<hi>Artaban,</hi> and from the e<U+017F>teem I have ever made of his admirable
endowments, it may ea<U+017F>ily be inferred, how extreamly I was
troubled to find in him <U+017F>o much aver<U+017F>ion for me. In<U+017F>omuch,
that without engaging by this action, the Queen, or your <U+017F>elf, to
a belief that it proceeds from the re<U+017F>pect and complyance I have
for your commands, I <U+017F>hall gladly embrace his friend<U+017F>hip, and
give him what a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of mine you <U+017F>hall think fit.</q>

                        <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be extreamly joyd at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ario's,</hi> whereupon the Queen, de<U+017F>irous to unite tho<U+017F>e two
extraordinary per<U+017F>ons by a friend<U+017F>hip great as that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her<U+017F>elf and <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> knowing that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> had had <U+017F>ome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
account of the great actions of <hi>Artaban,</hi> as al<U+017F>o of the
affection he had for <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> acquainted him in few words with
what of mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence he was yet ignorant of. In<U+017F>omuch, that
by that relation <U+017F>he gave him <U+017F>uch a character of <hi>Artaban,</hi> that he
looked upon him as the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t generous of men, and
repre<U+017F>enting to him the difference there is between tho<U+017F>e elevated
<U+017F>ouls in whom noble actions rai<U+017F>e onely an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of e<U+017F>teem
and re<U+017F>pect, and tho<U+017F>e other reptile ones, wherein they produce
envy and enmity, to de<U+017F>ire with earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e, the acqui<U+017F>ition of his
friend<U+017F>hip.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted but that the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> was an
infinite <U+017F>atisfaction to <hi>Candace;</hi> and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide,
could gladly have <U+017F>pent whole ages in her company, and yet not
be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of their length; but yet, be<U+017F>ides the fear which upon
his account <hi>Candace</hi> was perpetually in, the night was in a manner
<U+017F>pent, and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> thought it too great a pre<U+017F>umption to delay any
longer the repo<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e two great Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es. So that he was
obliged to recommend them to their re<U+017F>t, having fir<U+017F>t obtained
the Queens leave to waite on her the next night at the <U+017F>ame hour,
and promi<U+017F>ed, that he would entertain <hi>Artaban</hi> with all friendly
embraces, if it <U+017F>hould prove his fortune ever to meet him again.
A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he was gone, the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es went to their beds, and
by rea<U+017F>on of the alteration that had happened that day in their
fortunes, having di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e cruel di<U+017F>turbances which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
their repo<U+017F>e, thy fell into <U+017F>uch a quiet <U+017F>leep, that it was
very late the next day ere they awoke.</p>
                     <p>Thus was this night pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over by tho<U+017F>e many illu<U+017F>trious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
who were then at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the next day a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97242:130"/>
                        <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> had notice brought them, that <hi>Candace</hi> and
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> were awake, they left their own lodgings with an intention
to give them a vi<U+017F>it, and to let <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> under<U+017F>tand how much they
thought them<U+017F>elves concerned in what had happened to her the
day before. They would by no means give way that <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Philadelph</hi> <U+017F>hould follow them, though it was no <U+017F>mall
torment to them to be out of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>o much as
one minute, and indeed they were not over-earne<U+017F>t to do it at
that time, knowing well, that by rea<U+017F>on of the difference of <U+017F>ex
they had not the <U+017F>ame freedome with the others to vi<U+017F>it Ladies
before they were dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Be<U+017F>ides <hi>Philadelph</hi> was a little troubled
by what he had under<U+017F>tood of the arrivall of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and the
attempt he had made to carry away <hi>Eli<U+017F>a.</hi> And being withall a
kin<U+017F>man and friend to the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and that it was by
his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance and that of <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> that <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
had recovered his Kingdome, he knew not well, how he <U+017F>hould
behave him<U+017F>elf towards <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> for whom he had already concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
abundance of re<U+017F>pect, and for whom <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> who<U+017F>e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
he was wholly to be guided by, had a very great affection.
At la<U+017F>t he re<U+017F>olved not to do any thing that <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> might take
ami<U+017F><U+017F>e at his hands, or prejudice the re<U+017F>pect he had for <hi>Eli<U+017F>a;</hi> but
he thought he might <U+017F>afely go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Tygranes,</hi> having under<U+017F>tood
that he was in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thereupon taking his leave of
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> for <U+017F>ome time, he went to give him a vi<U+017F>it. And
yet before he was gotten out of doores he called to mind the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
enmity that was between the King of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> though there had been a peace concluded between
tho<U+017F>e two Crownes by the intere<U+017F>t and Authority of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi>
And accordingly, fearing that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was <U+017F>till wedded to
the quarrell wherein his hou<U+017F>e had been engaged, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
an enemy to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> he entreated him for his <U+017F>ake, to
moderate the re<U+017F>entments there might be yet remaining in him as
to that affaire, and to do that Prince no ill office, if he did not
by <U+017F>ome deportment of his, oblige him thereto. <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi>
who was a per<U+017F>on of an excellent good nature, promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph</hi>
to be guided in all things by him, and <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all company by his departure, he went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Agrippa</hi>
whom he extreamly honoured for his vertue, and who<U+017F>e friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
he was very de<U+017F>irous to pre<U+017F>erve that he might make u<U+017F>e of
it, either upon his own account or <hi>Philadelphs,</hi> again<U+017F>t
the implacable humour of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> whom he <U+017F>tood much in
fear of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tygranes</hi> had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away the night in <U+017F>uch fits of madne<U+017F><U+017F>e and
exa<U+017F>peration, as had hardly allowed him the re<U+017F>t of <U+017F>ome few
minutes, and brought him into an humour, which made him unfit
company for all in a manner, <hi>Philadelph</hi> onely excepted. But
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he ca<U+017F>t his eies on that Prince whom he had infinite love
for, and whom he was obliged to for the recovery of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97242:130"/>
all his melancholy and extravagant re<U+017F>entments vani<U+017F>hed to
make way for that exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of joy which filled him at a <U+017F>ight <U+017F>o
little expected. He found it <U+017F>ome difficulty to imagine to him<U+017F>elf
that it was really <hi>Philadelph;</hi> but when the Prince had by his
words and care<U+017F><U+017F>es, confirmed what his eies dur<U+017F>t not ea<U+017F>ily decide,
the <U+017F>atisfaction it was to him proved an excellent remedy to
alleviate his di<U+017F>contents, and, <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed thereby, his behaviour towards the Prince
was <U+017F>uch as could not proceed but from a violent and cordiall

                     <p>After the fir<U+017F>t complements, ordinary upon the occa<U+017F>ion of

what <U+017F>trange adventure had brought him to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
<hi>Philadelph,</hi> having made the <U+017F>ame demand to the other, they
reciprocally <U+017F>atisfied one the other; and entertained one
another with an account of their la<U+017F>t adventures, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

could not but much wonder, that that fair <hi>Delia,</hi> of whom he

was the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> that was reported to be dead long
before with her Brother <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and Si<U+017F>ter to <hi>Artaxus</hi> their

the indeprecability of <hi>Artaxus</hi> and that of the King his own Father
might yet put a many rubbs in their way; but, all notwith<U+017F>tanding,
he thought him<U+017F>elf happy in having con<U+017F>ecrated his life to the
mo<U+017F>t amiable and mo<U+017F>t vertuous Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e upon earth, and that he
expected no le<U+017F><U+017F>e from the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and the

the world affords not any thing comparable to her beauty,
not any thing greater than the rank <U+017F>he is in among the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es
of the earth, and that the Crown of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> whereof
<U+017F>he is yet pre<U+017F>umed to be the lawfull heir, is, next to the Roman
Empire, the greate<U+017F>t Monarchy in the world. But on the other
<U+017F>ide, yo are to con<U+017F>ider, that this <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>hunns you, hates you,
preferrs before you a per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>e revenues con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in his <U+017F>word,

As for the revenge you <U+017F>peak of, and which you <U+017F>ay you ought
to endeavour for the affront hath been done you, I know not
on whom you <U+017F>hould execute it, and if you take my opinion,
I think it is onely of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> that you have received that affront.
I <U+017F>hall not revenge my <U+017F>elf on <hi>Eli<U+017F>a, replied the King of the

I could never attempt any thing again<U+017F>t her, but it mu<U+017F>t wound

<U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hamefully preferrs before me, and will cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e a per<U+017F>on

cannot look on him as a per<U+017F>on that Kings <U+017F>hould contemne.
This you can te<U+017F>tifie more than any other, and con<U+017F>equently
when I con<U+017F>ider the things he hath done as well for you, as for

                        <hi>Philadelph</hi> would have <U+017F>aid more to that purpo<U+017F>e, as being not
able to forbear giving that acknowledgement of <hi>Artabans</hi> vertue
which all the world confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to be its due; but ob<U+017F>erving in the
countenance of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> that he was not well plea<U+017F>ed with di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
of that nature, he thought fit not to continue it, and
not long after falling into <U+017F>ome other talk, for <U+017F>ome time,
they went together to give a vi<U+017F>it to <hi>Agrippa. Tigranes</hi> made
<U+017F>ome difficulty to go, by rea<U+017F>on of the hindrance he had done him
in his de<U+017F>ign the day before; but con<U+017F>idering withal that, by rea<U+017F>on

partly on him, he went along; <hi>Philadelph</hi> having before hand
made him promi<U+017F>e, that he would not di<U+017F>cover any di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfaction
towards <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who was no enemy of his, and had made the
<U+017F>ame promi<U+017F>e as to him.</p>

                        <hi>Agrippa</hi> entertained all the<U+017F>e Princes with much civility, and,
being a man that derived no pride from the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his
fortune, becau<U+017F>e it was indeed below his vertue, he treated them
with all the honour due to their dignity. And knowing that in
<hi>Alexandria</hi> they had not all things <U+017F>uitably to their rank, nor had
that attendance, they were wont to have, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> who had not any retinue at all, he invited them to
dine with him, excu<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf for being <U+017F>o free with them, out of
a re<U+017F>pect of their pre<U+017F>ent condition in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was <U+017F>uch,
that they could not have tho<U+017F>e accommodations at their own

<hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> entertained them with an account of it; but, being unwilling

came and acquainted the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Artaban</hi> was at the door
de<U+017F>irous to waite on her. She, with a certain agitation which <U+017F>he
was not able to conceal, gave order he <U+017F>hould come in, <U+017F>o that at
the name of <hi>Artaban, Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> and <hi>Olympia</hi> prepared them<U+017F>elves
for a <U+017F>ight which they had long been infinitely de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee.
<hi>Artaban</hi> was immediately admitted, and came in with that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
countenance, and maje<U+017F>tick deportment, which rai<U+017F>ed in
all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw him, re<U+017F>pect and admiration. <hi>Olympia</hi> was a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed

<hi>Britomarus,</hi> the <U+017F>ame <hi>Britomarus</hi> that had courted her with a very

e<U+017F>teemed him for his great worth, and who, not long before,
had, in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> protected her again<U+017F>t the violences of <hi>Antigenes,</hi>
and re<U+017F>tored her into the hands of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> after he had
delivered him out of the chains of the Pirates, as <U+017F>he had related
to <hi>Philadelph</hi> two daies before. The<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t obligations put upon
them by <hi>Britomarus</hi> were of <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>equence, that in a mind, <U+017F>uch

Nor indeed either could <U+017F>he, or would <U+017F>he, di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it,

                     <p>The other three Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es could not but wonder very much at

the other with a certain e<U+017F>teem and veneration. And certainly

                     <p>During all this long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the prudent <hi>Agrippa</hi> made

<hi>Agrippa</hi> <U+017F>hould imagine, that his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had wrought

The extremitie he was reduced to, by the inexorable <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

<U+017F>o much good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e in the beginning, that he boarded the

and a great number of per<U+017F>ons of quality from <hi>Rome,</hi> were in
their way towards the Port. As they went, <hi>Agrippa</hi> fell into di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
with <hi>Artaban,</hi> whom he could not but admire in whatever
related to his per<U+017F>on, and hardly forbore <U+017F>ighing, when he con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the many excellent qualities which made him both ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and dreadful. Yet was it not in his power to have any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
for him, as well by rea<U+017F>on of the natural propen<U+017F>ion he had
to vertue, as that the per<U+017F>onage of <hi>Artaban</hi> was <U+017F>uch, as if it had

<hi>Agrippa's</hi> love for <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> who e<U+017F>teemed him very much for his
great actions, and much more for his moderation amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a

was obliged to him for the refuge he had afforded him again<U+017F>t
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> looked upon him with very much re<U+017F>pect, and a mo<U+017F>t
unfained affection. The complements that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between them
all the way to their coming into the Port, were accordingly <U+017F>uch
as well expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the mutual admiration and e<U+017F>teem they had one
towards another. They were hardly well gotten into it, but they
perceive a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el making all the <U+017F>aile <U+017F>he could towards them, and
and was already within <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance, as that they could di<U+017F>cern

had no <U+017F>ooner ob<U+017F>erved them, but they told him it was the <U+017F>ame

de<U+017F>ign he was then engaged in, and upon that account <hi>Agrippa</hi>

that to be the onely way to hear what news they might bring of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> They had not long to expect, for that within a few

                        <hi>Agrippa,</hi> being a particular friend to all of the hou<U+017F>e of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and one that had a more than ordinary honour for
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> was extreamly elevated at that <U+017F>ight, nay indeed a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
at that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom he thought not to be near
that Country, and of whom there had no tidings been heard;
no more than of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> <U+017F>ince they both le<U+017F>t <hi>Rome,</hi> much
about the <U+017F>ame time. There was a very great friend<U+017F>hip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> though it had been often
imagined at <hi>Rome</hi> that the great authority of <hi>Agrippa</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
alteration in that particular, and that there had been many
reports <U+017F>pread abroad, that <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to whom the Empire was
de<U+017F>igned, looked with <U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>y on the great credit of that
Favorite of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars,</hi> and had <U+017F>ome thoughts to pull him a little
lower. This <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion had prevailed very much among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but tho<U+017F>e, who were acquainted with the vertue of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> were of another opinion: and be<U+017F>ides that
the excellent good nature of <hi>Marcellus</hi> was <U+017F>uch as forced on
him an e<U+017F>teem and affection for <hi>Agrippa;</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
loved him and looked upon him no otherwi<U+017F>e than as if he had
been indeed the Son of his Benefactor, and accordingly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
what lay in his power to moderate his fortune <U+017F>o as that
he might not conceive the lea<U+017F>t jealou<U+017F>ie thereat.</p>
                     <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he had perceived tho<U+017F>e illu<U+017F>trious per<U+017F>ons on the
deck, he would not <U+017F>tay their coming a<U+017F>hore, and thereupon,
taking <hi>Artaban</hi> along with him, took a boat and went to receive
them in their own ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, and at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome of his

<hi>Cleopatra</hi> <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e two great per<U+017F>ons appearing, one whereof
was unknown to her, came towards them with that amiable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty
which purcha<U+017F>ed her a certain empire over all that <U+017F>aw her,
addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom <U+017F>he knew to be one of the
be<U+017F>t friends <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>he entertained him in the mo<U+017F>t obliging way
that could be, and <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed <hi>Artaban</hi> in <U+017F>uch manner with the
<U+017F>ight of her admirable beauty, that how <U+017F>trangely <U+017F>oever he might
be prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> he could neither <U+017F>uffer that
lu<U+017F>tre without being dazled, nor forbear acknowledging the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which heaven had be<U+017F>towed on that beauty beyond all

<hi>Agrippa</hi> pre<U+017F>ented him to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by recommending him to her
under the famous name of <hi>Artaban,</hi> and giving him withall a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

Upon that, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> being advanced to <U+017F>alute <hi>Artaban,</hi> who<U+017F>e

breathed out his la<U+017F>t, and called to mind the hot conte<U+017F>tation
there had pa<U+017F>t between him and the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and how
far he had him<U+017F>elf endeavoured to reconcile them. <hi>Artaban</hi> al<U+017F>o
knew him, and knowing him withall to be Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom
all the Empire had a love and re<U+017F>pect for, gave him no le<U+017F><U+017F>e ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <p>That done, <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>aluted one another as two

into their company. <hi>Marcellus</hi> thought it then un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to
give any particular account of his adventures, and <U+017F>o, onely to
give <hi>Agrippa</hi> <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, told him, that he came into <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
ju<U+017F>t at the time, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was going to take <U+017F>hip,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97242:143"/>
to find out the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es; and that, having met him and known
him upon the Port, after they had embraced one another, with
that fraternall affection wherein they had been brought up by
<hi>Octavia,</hi> he had acquainted him with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and
the de<U+017F>ign he had to relieve her, and that upon that account of
her, he without any further di<U+017F>puting of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, went aboard
re<U+017F>olved to run the <U+017F>ame fortune with him.</p>
                     <p>But when the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to give <hi>Agrippa</hi>
a particular account of her being taken and her deliverance, <U+017F>he
looked on <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> as not knowing whether <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould make any mention of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in whom
the concernments of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> might have altered his inclinations.
But <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was <U+017F>atisfied of the vertue of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed
her to give him a faithfull relation of all without di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing
any thing, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her out of the confidence he had of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nero<U+017F>ity,
that he would rather relieve than cru<U+017F>h the mi<U+017F>erable.
Upon this confidence of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e gave <hi>Agrippa</hi> a
brief narrative of what had happened to her <U+017F>ince her la<U+017F>t carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, whereof the accidents of greate<U+017F>t importance had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that very day, and <U+017F>urprized him in <U+017F>uch manner, by the
relation of the great performances of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and by that
of the King of <hi>Armenia's</hi> death, that he could not for <U+017F>ome time
recover him<U+017F>elf out of the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment which the con<U+017F>ideration
of <U+017F>o many extraordinary occurrences had rai<U+017F>ed in him. And
thereupon taking occa<U+017F>ion to let <hi>Cleopatra</hi> know that it was not
without rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>he repo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much confidence in him, he
related unto her, how he had met with the di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
in the wood the night before <U+017F>he was carried away the <U+017F>econd
time; how that that unfortunate Prince had di<U+017F>covered him<U+017F>elf to
him by his <U+017F>peech, and how that, not being able to do him any
other <U+017F>ervice, he had be<U+017F>towed on him his own hor<U+017F>e, and
had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the night in the woods, after he had
<U+017F>pent the day in pur<U+017F>uit of tho<U+017F>e that had carried her
away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> could not forbear celebrating the genero<U+017F>ity of <hi>Agrippa</hi>
upon that occa<U+017F>ion, and being before more then halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the innocency of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> <U+017F>he was not a little glad
to find that, even in his misfortunes, <hi>Agrippa</hi> continued that
Friend<U+017F>hip towards him which he had ever had for him. <hi>Artaban,</hi>
before whom, upon the engagement of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had to that
purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>atisfied <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> were related the prodigious effects of
the valour of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> was very much plea<U+017F>ed with that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e;
and being acquainted with that Prince by rea<U+017F>on of the
combat wherein he had been engaged again<U+017F>t him in the pre<U+017F>ence
of <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and by the abode they had both <U+017F>ince
made at <hi>Tiridates</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, and, having accordingly conceived very
much affection and a more than ordinary e<U+017F>teem for him, he
thought him<U+017F>elf very much concerned, in what he had heard <U+017F>aid
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97242:144"/>
of him, and though he concealed what he knew of him, becau<U+017F>e
he <U+017F>aw there was not any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to <U+017F>peak of it, he was earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
de<U+017F>irous to meet with <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion wherein he might <U+017F>erve
him. And indeed it was partly upon that ground that he had <U+017F>o
generou<U+017F>ly proffered his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in order to the relief of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
at a time when the po<U+017F>ture of his health, and other allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
motives might well have procured him a di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation from
engaging in that enterpri<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Upon that reflection, looking on <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> and perceiving the
teares <U+017F>tanding in her eies for the death of the King her Brother,
he was troubled at the misfortune of that Prince, though he was
neither taken with his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition nor his per<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>o gave the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e his Si<U+017F>ter the be<U+017F>t words of comfort he could. He
thought not fit to tell her any thing of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> or <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Agrippa</hi> and he had <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olved before, that <U+017F>he might
be the more <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them; and yet when he heard
her called in the <U+017F>hip by the name of Queen <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a,</hi> he could
not forbear telling them, that they <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty to give
her that title before the Kings death were publi<U+017F>hed, and that
he had a certain imagination that <U+017F>he would not be Queen of
<hi>Armenia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e made <hi>Agrippa</hi> <U+017F>mile, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> perceiving
would fain have known the meaning of it, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Cornelius</hi> was come with two chariots, followed by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of people whom the tidings of <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> arrivall
had drawn down to the port. The name of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was in <U+017F>o
much veneration in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the children of that great
Queen were <U+017F>o dear in the account of the people, who had
<U+017F>een them born and brought up in their City, that they could
not under<U+017F>tand that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi>
her Brother, whom they had <U+017F>ometimes, upon the commands of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> reverenced in a manner as gods, were coming into their
City, without running before them with exclamations, and <U+017F>uch
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as could not admit any thing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thereto, but upon <U+017F>uch another occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed did <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> much mi<U+017F>-interpret
tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of their affection, for they could not look on
either the walls or people of that City, wherein they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their fir<U+017F>t breath, where they had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over their fir<U+017F>t
yeares with <U+017F>o much reputation, and whence, after the deplorable
ruine of their hou<U+017F>e, they departed ten years before to follow
as far as <hi>Rome</hi> the fortune and the triumphall chariot of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
but the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the commemoration mu<U+017F>t force them
to <U+017F>hed tho<U+017F>e teares which it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to keep in.
And it was the more ob<U+017F>ervable in <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for that <U+017F>he never
gave over weeping from the port even to the palace, the <U+017F>ight
whereof multiplied her grief when <U+017F>he could not look on it onely
as the magnificent hou<U+017F>e of the <hi>Ptolomey's,</hi> but that al<U+017F>o where
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97242:144"/>
the unfortunate <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the deplorable <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had lo<U+017F>t
their lives with the Empire, not to mention thou<U+017F>ands of other
<U+017F>ad circum<U+017F>tances, which at the <U+017F>ame time pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed into their
memory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius</hi> had <U+017F>o ordered things, that <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,
Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> as al<U+017F>o <hi>Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Artaban,</hi> were
not lodged within the Palace, becau<U+017F>e that had been re<U+017F>erved for
the Emperour and the <hi>Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> who were to come thither within
two daies, and how <U+017F>pacious <U+017F>oever it might be, the Emperours
retinue was <U+017F>o great, that there would be but little lodging to <U+017F>pare
for other per<U+017F>ons. But for the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra, Cornelius</hi>
thought it not fit to lodge her out of the Palace, but had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her certain rooms within that which had been de<U+017F>igned for
<hi>Octavia.</hi> And <hi>Candace,</hi> either to leave the more room for the
Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, or that <U+017F>he could not be without the company of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi>
was, upon the de<U+017F>ires of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, gone along with her, and
had left her lodgings void; <U+017F>o that <hi>Cornelius</hi> finding none more
convenient for the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> changed his former re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of her into the place which before had been
taken up by the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were alighted out of the Chariots,
they met, at the bottom of the <U+017F>taires, with <hi>Eli<U+017F>a, Candace, Olympia,</hi>
and <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> with <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> coming to meet
them. <hi>Agrippa</hi> immediately <U+017F>hewed <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> and <hi>Candace</hi> to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
to whom he had <U+017F>poken of them before in the Chariot,
and tho<U+017F>e two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es coming up clo<U+017F>e to her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aluted them,
with <U+017F>entiments not much different from that admiration which
they expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed at the <U+017F>ight of her divine beauty. She knew <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi>
to be <U+017F>ole heir to the Empire of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and looked on
<hi>Candace</hi> as a Prince of the royal progeny of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
made the return of civility to both, which upon the <U+017F>ight of
their countenances they might have chalenged from all the World;
and at the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> <U+017F>aluted <hi>Olympia,</hi> who, knowing her
to be Si<U+017F>ter to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> was, through a forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
affection, come up to her. <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> entertained, with very much
civility, the effects of an affection, whereof <U+017F>he yet knew not the
cau<U+017F>e. But when, after <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>engaged her <U+017F>elf out of her
embraces, and received tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> whom <U+017F>he
fir<U+017F>t met in her way, <U+017F>he was going towards <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe,</hi> who <U+017F>tretched
out her arms with a cordial friend<U+017F>hip to entertain her, and at the
<U+017F>ame time ca<U+017F>t her eie on her countenance, as al<U+017F>o on that of <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
who <U+017F>tood clo<U+017F>e by her, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>eized by <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment,
that had it not been for <hi>Artaban,</hi> who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the cau<U+017F>e thereof, and came forward purpo<U+017F>ely to hold
her up, <U+017F>he had fallen all along on the ground.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Ar<U+017F>inoe</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, and embraced her with

The<U+017F>e words of <hi>Artemi<U+017F>a</hi> cau<U+017F>ing <hi>Philadelph</hi> to look on the

acknowledge my incon<U+017F>tancy to you; but I cannot forbear
making this confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to you, that that <hi>Delia,</hi> for whom

though my Si<U+017F>ter were the mo<U+017F>t amiable per<U+017F>on in the World,
I <U+017F>hould never approve that change in your inclinations, and I
<U+017F>hould no longer continue that e<U+017F>teem towards you, which I <U+017F>ome

could not forbear laughing at it in <U+017F>uch a manner, as put

much <U+017F>atisfaction to a many things, whereof, as having had
an imperfect account of them before, he was very much plea<U+017F>ed

a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the Princes were departed the roome, the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es
imagining, not without rea<U+017F>on, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> might <U+017F>tand in need

which were clo<U+017F>e by. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> upon their importunity laid her
<U+017F>elf upon the bed, and re<U+017F>ted for an houre; but that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
<U+017F>he got up, any having under<U+017F>tood what quality <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> was

<U+017F>he went to that of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a.</hi> The two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es quarrelled very

<U+017F>he made them an<U+017F>wer, that the re<U+017F>t which her body might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
was not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable to her as the obligation <U+017F>he thought

honour to wait on them, which <U+017F>he was not able to di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e with

                     <p>The two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es made her an<U+017F>wer with equall civility, and

well out of a con<U+017F>ideration of her excellent endowments, which
might produce that effect in any one, as upon the account of

whom you have no other account of then that <U+017F>he is a per<U+017F>on of
<U+017F>ome quality born in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and cannot a<U+017F>pire above a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity

it were <U+017F>upererogatory in you to look for any el<U+017F>ewhere; and
as for your being born in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> you are never, for that, the
le<U+017F><U+017F>e worthy of our affections and our re<U+017F>pects. I am not, I mu<U+017F>t

of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Eli<U+017F>a's</hi> familiarity and behaviour towards

your quality mu<U+017F>t needs be of the highe<U+017F>t, and I <U+017F>hall haply
know more of it, when you <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>o well acquainted with

                        <q>I know not, <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> whether I can with

which naturally engages me into a very great confidence

                     <p>Upon this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Candace, Cleopatra</hi> a<U+017F>ked her pardon,
in ca<U+017F>e, through an ignorance of her quality, <U+017F>he had been awan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

to <U+017F>erve her, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o happy as to find them. And
thereupon reflecting on the la<U+017F>t words that fell from her whereby
<U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf obliged for the recovery of her Crown to

                        </q> 
                        <q>It is very true, <hi>replied Cleopatra,</hi> that
I have <U+017F>een him in that hou<U+017F>e, where I <U+017F>taid one night and <U+017F>ome
part of the next day, till <U+017F>uch time as I was carried away thence:
<hi>Alexander</hi> procured me the <U+017F>ight of him in his bed, which he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97242:150"/>
was confined to by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome wounds, <U+017F>o that I could not
<U+017F>ee him with as much advantage in that condition, as, no
que<U+017F>tion, I <U+017F>hould have done in another. But to mea<U+017F>ure
him by that little ob<U+017F>ervation I then made of him, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as well in his countenance as his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>omething
that argued a certain grandeur much beyond the ordinary
rate of men; and it now comes into my mind, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
procured me that <U+017F>ight of him as a per<U+017F>on of a great and
noble fame, and told me withall, that his name was much
cried up in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for many famous victories.</q> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi>

and <hi>Alexander,</hi> tho<U+017F>e tidings of a per<U+017F>on whom you once
thought very deare, which may prove very advantageous to
me, and very much further the de<U+017F>igne I have to purcha<U+017F>e
your friend<U+017F>hip; and it is for that onely rea<U+017F>on, that I a<U+017F>ked
you whether you had <U+017F>een him, and that I am de<U+017F>irous to
give you another <U+017F>ight of him before this night be quite pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
if you give me the liberty to do it.</q> 
                        <q>It cannot be,

                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> perceiving this obliging conte<U+017F>tation of the two
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, found it no great difficulty to give them <U+017F>atisfaction;
and indeed they were both of them <U+017F>o amiable, that <U+017F>he was ea<U+017F>ily
inclined to afford them tho<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>trations of her affection
which they de<U+017F>ired, that is, <U+017F>uch as could not well be denied them.
But the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Candace,</hi> whence <U+017F>he might have inferred
that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs have <U+017F>omething of news to acquaint her with,
rai<U+017F>ing a certain curio<U+017F>ity in her, <U+017F>he could not forbear di<U+017F>covering
to her the de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>he had to be <U+017F>omewhat better iuformrd then <U+017F>he
was, of her affairs, as al<U+017F>o of tho<U+017F>e of the fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the
Parthians. Which they were no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, but they
were both very ready to afford her that <U+017F>atisfaction, and having
obliged her to ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf on the bed, upon which they <U+017F>ate by
her; <hi>Candace</hi> gave her a more brief account than <U+017F>he had done
to <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> of the adventures of the greate<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equence that had
happened to her; but in her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered nothing of
the birth of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> and calling him all the way <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
repre<U+017F>ented him onely as a Prince come for refuge into her
dominions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having admired the <U+017F>trange accidents of <hi>Candaces</hi>
life, and expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed how much <U+017F>he was moved thereat, with no <U+017F>mall
affection, gave hearing afterwards to what <U+017F>he was yet to learn of
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a;</hi> I <U+017F>ay what <U+017F>he was yet to learn, for the greate<U+017F>t
part thereof was already come to her knowledge from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reporter of all things, Fame, who had divulged the mo<U+017F>t
memorable of her adventures. By the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of the two
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> became better acquainted then <U+017F>he had been
before, with both <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and looked on them as
the onely two in the World, whom <U+017F>he might ju<U+017F>tly compare to
her own <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and having under<U+017F>tood from them the de<U+017F>ign
they had to have them reconciled that night, and to oblige them
to forget the great differences that had been between them, <U+017F>he
very much approved their re<U+017F>olution. And being further <U+017F>atisfied,
that <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> for very good rea<U+017F>ons, could not come to vi<U+017F>it
<hi>Candace</hi> till <U+017F>uch time as all other people were in their beds, <U+017F>he
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured the Queen that <U+017F>he would gladly return into their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at that time, if <U+017F>he thought it <U+017F>it, that <U+017F>he might take better
notice then <U+017F>he had done before of two men <U+017F>o particularly ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
as al<U+017F>o to under<U+017F>tand from <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> what the Queen had
put her in hopes of, concerning him. They continued their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
of this nature till <U+017F>upper time drew neer, and having di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their de<U+017F>ires to eat together, all things were accordingly
prepared in a Parlour, not far from their lodging rooms, whither
they were conducted, and immediately after <U+017F>upper, returned to
<hi>Cleopatras</hi> Chamber, to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the evening with <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould

                        <hi>Eli<U+017F>as</hi> Chamber, when all were withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after they were gotten into the Chamber, as they
had imagined, they were vi<U+017F>ited by <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who
had <U+017F>upped together at <hi>Agrippas, Cornelius</hi> having, as it <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>eem, <U+017F>pent that evening with the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> with whom
he had contracted a friend<U+017F>hip, and was engaging in <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ignes
of his. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who<U+017F>e company was infinitely plea<U+017F>ant, when
His mind was in a <U+017F>erenity free from the tempe<U+017F>ts of his di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
entertained the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es for <U+017F>ome time, with an account

when in the mean time <hi>Agrippa,</hi> finding an opportunity to <U+017F>it by
<hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> <U+017F>o as that <hi>Candace</hi> was not <U+017F>o neer her as <U+017F>he was wont to
be, that fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e could not avoid, but that he might <U+017F>peak to
her, yet not be over-heard, and con<U+017F>equently that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her with his love. She would have called <hi>Candace</hi> to a
relief which they mutually afford one the other, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
again<U+017F>t both <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> could <U+017F>he without
incivility have done it: but <hi>Agrippa</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of that rank,
and, withal, of <U+017F>uch worth in him<U+017F>elf, that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on, was afraid to di<U+017F>oblige him, and thereupon
re<U+017F>olved to endure his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as being out of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity forced
to do it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agrippa</hi> having thus broken the ice, and removed the fir<U+017F>t diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,

after <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of an indifferent nature, perceiving that he
might <U+017F>peak without any fear of being heard: <q>Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <hi><U+017F>aid
he to her,</hi> that, in a place where I have the honour to waite on you

                     </p>
                     <p>No doubt but <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> was <U+017F>ufficiently troubled at the<U+017F>e words,

<U+017F>hould forbid my mouth to tell you <U+017F>o much, it were very hard
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97242:151"/>
for my eies to afford you the <U+017F>ame obedience, and that they <U+017F>hould

that you do not feel all that you would have me believe; and
I cannot but have that confidence of your genero<U+017F>ity, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of what your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e might very well put me in fear of,
I <U+017F>hall find onely, where you are, a <U+017F>anctuary again<U+017F>t that per<U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I have run through <U+017F>o many dangers to avoid.</q> 
                        <q>I
<U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate man in the World,
<hi>replyed Agrippa,</hi> if you <U+017F>hould look with the <U+017F>ame eies on the love
of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and that which I have for you, and call that by the
name of per<U+017F>ecution, which is, on the contrary, a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion full of
re<U+017F>pect and veneration, <U+017F>uch as mine is, as you do the violence
of a Prince, who, by force and tyranny hath <U+017F>ought that which
he <U+017F>hould have patiently expected from your own good liking.
I knew, Madam, that the enterpri<U+017F>e, I engage my <U+017F>elf in, is of
no <U+017F>mal difficulty, when I would di<U+017F>pute a heart prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by
another affection, and that an affection dearly purcha<U+017F>ed by
an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of merit, and which you have, not without much
rea<U+017F>on, conceaved for him, who, of all men, hath <U+017F>hewn him<U+017F>elf
the mo<U+017F>t worthy of it, as well by his vertue, as the tran<U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of his actions. But I <U+017F>hall entreat you withall to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf, that it is not by condemning it, that I <U+017F>hall endeavour
to ruine it, to my advantage; and ob<U+017F>erve, that I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Artaban</hi> to be worthy of his fortune above all the men I
have known, and, that it is not my own will that inclines me to
traver<U+017F>e his affections, but that it proceeds meerly from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
you do me, which is <U+017F>uch as I have ineffectually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to overcome by all the rea<U+017F>ons which you could your
<U+017F>elf have alledged again<U+017F>t it. Do not therefore con<U+017F>ider what I
do again<U+017F>t him as a voluntary action, which might be condemned,
but as a forced action, and con<U+017F>equently rather de<U+017F>erving your
pitty, then his re<U+017F>entment; and pardon, if you plea<U+017F>e, the de<U+017F>ign
I have to di<U+017F>pute your affections with him, which I <U+017F>hall not do
out of any con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars</hi> authority, and the power he
hath inve<U+017F>ted me with through the whole extent of his Empire,
but by my love and <U+017F>ervices.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this effect was the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e
finding <U+017F>ome comfort in the conclu<U+017F>ion of it, and in what he had
<U+017F>aid to the advantage of <hi>Artaban;</hi> 
                        <q>It hath ever been my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion,
<hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> that, what de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>oever you might be
engaged in, you would make u<U+017F>e of no other force then
that of vertue it <U+017F>elf to effect it; and that is it indeed which
makes you more con<U+017F>iderable then the ranck you are in, or the
friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> and it is from the <U+017F>ame vertue that I am
inclined to hope you will overcome a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which may haply
expo<U+017F>e your reputation to <U+017F>ome reproach by thwarting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97242:152"/>
and felicity of tho<U+017F>e that ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves under your
protection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e words troubled <hi>Agrippa</hi> more than any thing el<U+017F>e could
have done, as being levelled at him in point of genero<U+017F>ity and
honour; and indeed, great <U+017F>ouls, <U+017F>uch as was really his, are far
more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of this nature, then tho<U+017F>e which proceed
meerly out of a con<U+017F>ideration of difficulty or danger. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
was at a little lo<U+017F><U+017F>e what return to make thereto, but when
he had recollected him<U+017F>elf a little; <q>It is not for <hi>Agrippa, <U+017F>aid
he to her,</hi> to afford protection, within the territories that are
under the <U+017F>ubjection of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> to a daughter of the King of
<hi>Parthia. Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> may be <U+017F>aid to protect you, and I may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
my <U+017F>ervices to his protection; but it concerns me ever to
be <U+017F>uppliant and <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive to you, and to account my <U+017F>elf your
va<U+017F><U+017F>al, rather than your Protector: under this qualification of
va<U+017F><U+017F>allage, which I conceave honourable enough for me, and not
under that other of protection, which I could not pretend to
without in<U+017F>olence, it may be lawful for me, upon equal terms, to
engage again<U+017F>t my Rival, and in this kind of engagement, I <U+017F>hall
not <U+017F>eem very dreadful to a per<U+017F>on, of who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ide the victory is
already declared.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He would have <U+017F>pun out this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to a greater length, had
not <hi>Candace,</hi> troubled to <U+017F>ee the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o engaged, <U+017F>tarted a
que<U+017F>tion to her, purpo<U+017F>ely to break it off, and, not long after, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
her to quit <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and to participate of their conver<U+017F>ation.
It continued not long that night, for <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> to oblige
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> to withdraw the <U+017F>ooner, bid <hi>Cleopatra</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
telling her, that, the better to recover the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much
wanted, it was but fit <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould go to it <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>ooner then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
Whereupon the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es departed to their own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> having taken their leaves of them,
left the room at the <U+017F>ame time.</p>
                     <p>The two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es were no <U+017F>ooner alone, but <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> acquainted
<hi>Candace</hi> with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between her and
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> gave her an account at the
<U+017F>ame time of what <U+017F>he had had that day with <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they advi<U+017F>ed with one another what they <U+017F>hould do in that
ca<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in deliberating whether they <U+017F>hould
acquaint their Lovers with that new emergency. They found very
<U+017F>trong rea<U+017F>ons on both <U+017F>ides, as well to oblige them to do it, as to
divert them from it, and they were ab<U+017F>olutely unre<U+017F>olved what to
do, when <hi>Artaban</hi> comes into the room. Tis, out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion,
that <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> was infinitely de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee him, yet could <U+017F>he
not look on him at <U+017F>uch an hour, without blu<U+017F>hing at the freedom
<U+017F>he gave him; and though <U+017F>he loved him to that degree which <U+017F>he
conceived her <U+017F>elf obliged to do, as well by way of recompence
for his great <U+017F>ervices, as out of her own inclination, yet had <U+017F>he
not ever granted him any favour that derogated from the <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97242:152"/>
ob<U+017F>ervances of honour and her <U+017F>ex; and had not been per<U+017F>waded
to this <U+017F>ecret enterview, but out of complyance with <hi>Candace,</hi>
who<U+017F>e authority, rather then any thing el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>atisfied her <U+017F>cruples,
and prevailed with her to grant it in order to the interview which
<U+017F>he <U+017F>o much endeavoured between <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> and him. <hi>Candace,</hi>
though <U+017F>he had no le<U+017F><U+017F>e devotion to vertue then the other, might
pre<U+017F>ume upon a greater liberty, and be<U+017F>ides, that <U+017F>he could not
<U+017F>ee <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> but at <U+017F>uch hours, <U+017F>he was ab<U+017F>olutely at her own di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al,
as well in regard of her per<U+017F>on as her dominions. Adde
to that, that in her favouring <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> and be<U+017F>towing on him her
Crown with her per<U+017F>on, as <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olved, <U+017F>he complyed with
the will, and obeyed the commands of her father, who, in his life
time, and at his death, had publickly declared <U+017F>uch an intention, and
had ab<U+017F>olutely ordered it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> entertained <hi>Artaban</hi> with her ordinary <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e and
mode<U+017F>ty; and <hi>Candace,</hi> having treated him with all manner of
civility, <q>You are now <U+017F>atisfied, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> that I am not
much inclined to revenge, and that notwith<U+017F>tanding the re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which your incon<U+017F>tancy might well rai<U+017F>e in me again<U+017F>t
you, I yet think it not much to procure you <U+017F>uch favours as
you had not haply ever received before.</q> 
                        <q>I mu<U+017F>t indeed confe<U+017F><U+017F>e,
<hi>replies Artaban,</hi> that this favour is a pure effect of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e;
but <U+017F>hall not acknowledge, if I may be <U+017F>o free with you,
that you had any great re<U+017F>entment to <U+017F>truggle with, for a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e
you were not any way <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of.</q> 
                        <q>The lo<U+017F><U+017F>e cannot be thought
light, <hi>replies Candace,</hi> when one loo<U+017F>es <U+017F>uch a man as <hi>Artaban:</hi>
but it hath been the plea<U+017F>ure of our de<U+017F>tinies to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of us
both otherwi<U+017F>e, and for that rea<U+017F>on it is but fit we forbear all
reproaches. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you withal, that I have not been the
in<U+017F>trument to procure you this <U+017F>ight of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> be<U+017F>ides your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
without <U+017F>ome little By-concernment; and that is, a
reque<U+017F>t that both <U+017F>he and I make to you, that you and <hi>Cleomedon</hi>
have an interview in this room, that you embrace one the other
in our pre<U+017F>ence, and, if it be not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, become good friends,
as your fair Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e and my <U+017F>elf are.</q>

of the obligation <U+017F>he laid upon him; <q>I am very much troubled,
Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould not make trial of the

find more difficulty, then there can be in that which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
to me; for the friend<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> is a thing, whereof
the purcha<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o advantageous, that I cannot entertain the
offer you make me of it, otherwi<U+017F>e then as a recompence you
are plea<U+017F>ed to allow me, and not as a puni<U+017F>hment that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
upon me. I may adde to this, that he hath put a late obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon me, which ought to have a greater influence on my

much more than my life amounts to, <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge
the liberty of my Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, an effect of the relief <U+017F>he received

than it had been in a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e well couched, and actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the greate<U+017F>t recollection. The pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Vrinoe</hi>

the greate<U+017F>t favour he could expect from her, <U+017F>he could not deny
it him in <U+017F>o favourable an opportunity, and that e<U+017F>pecially after
a <U+017F>eparation, which had cau<U+017F>ed her to bewaile his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e with <U+017F>o

the reflections <U+017F>he made on it, and looking on him in the
mo<U+017F>t amorous manner that could be, with tho<U+017F>e very eies which

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:97242:153"/>
night before, <hi>Candace</hi> would needs have her to be pre<U+017F>ent at
the arrivall of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and being a little a<U+017F>hamed that <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>uffered her to withdraw into the clo<U+017F>et, <U+017F>he called her, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to participate of their conver<U+017F>ation as <U+017F>he had done
of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between her and <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
and under<U+017F>tand, how <hi>Artaban</hi> had e<U+017F>caped the fury of tho<U+017F>e
waves into which he had ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince that in all likelihood
the relation he was to entertain them with would not be <U+017F>o long
but that he might well go through it before <hi>Cleomedon</hi> came in.
<hi>Candace</hi> made her an<U+017F>wer, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould gladly hearken to any
thing wherein <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf concerned, and after <U+017F>he was
<U+017F>et down by her; <hi>Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aies Artaban to her, <hi><U+017F>ince that there
are but few daies <U+017F>ince my falling into the Sea, I <U+017F>hall not need many
words to acquaint you with what hath happened to me from that
time, and <U+017F>hall not abu<U+017F>e your attention long with an account of
things of little con<U+017F>equence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not without <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on, <hi>continued he, <U+017F>peaking to Candace,</hi>
that you <U+017F>aid you were concerned in my <U+017F>afety, or at lea<U+017F>t I may
well <U+017F>ay that you have contributed very much thereto, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that I am not a little obliged to you for it. <hi>To me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Queen, <U+017F>omewhat a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at what he <U+017F>aid?</hi> Even to
you, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> more then any other; and had it not been
for that generous action which you did in <U+017F>etting <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> <U+017F>hip
on fire, that action, I <U+017F>ay, which carried in it a more <U+017F>hining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>tration
of your vertue then the fire you kindled on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I had infallibly lo<U+017F>t a life, which I could not long have made
good again<U+017F>t the violence of the waves, being armed all over,
my buckler hanging about my neck, and being at too great a
di<U+017F>tance from the <U+017F>hore to recover it by <U+017F>wimming, even though
I had had nothing of armour about me. Their weight had once
already forced me to the bottome, where I had rolled my <U+017F>elf
for <U+017F>ome time upon the <U+017F>and, when by the violence of a Billow
I was again brought up to the top of the water, where, as good
fortune would have it, I met with a plank, halfe burned, of
<hi>Zenodorus's</hi> ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, which <U+017F>truck again<U+017F>t my head, and, not long
after, touched again<U+017F>t my hand. Though my condition was <U+017F>uch
that I had but little knowledge or apprehen<U+017F>ion left, yet made I a
<U+017F>hift to do that, which they <U+017F>ay is naturall to all men in the like
extreamity, which is, to fa<U+017F>ten on any thing they can: and <U+017F>o,
embracing the plank, which was thick and heavy, I did <U+017F>o well
with the help of it that I got my head above water, and had the
liberty to breath; in<U+017F>omuch that, by degrees, I got it under me,
in <U+017F>uch a manner, that it bore me up, with the help of my legges,
which I moved to and fro, as if I were <U+017F>wimming, the be<U+017F>t I
could. But I was, withall, <U+017F>o weary, <U+017F>o much troubled with the
water I had <U+017F>wallowed, and <U+017F>o loaden with my armour, that I could
not hope to e<U+017F>cape with that help alone, though I endeavoured with
all the remainder of my <U+017F>trength, to force the plank towards the
<U+017F>hore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:97242:154"/>
Being in this extremity, it plea<U+017F>ed the gods to direct certain
Fi<U+017F>her-boats whereof there are a many upon that coa<U+017F>t, towards
the place where I was, which was not very far from the <U+017F>hore.
Tho<U+017F>e that were in them taking notice of the gli<U+017F>tering of my
head-piece, and perceiving the top of my plume of feathers all
wet, imagining what the matter might be, came up with one
of their boats to my relief, and indeed it came ju<U+017F>t at the point
that I <U+017F>tood very much in need of it, and was reduced to my
la<U+017F>t <U+017F>hifts. They took me into their boat, di<U+017F>armed me, and at
the <U+017F>ame time made me ca<U+017F>t up the <U+017F>alt water I had drunk, and
when they <U+017F>aw I had a little recovered my <U+017F>elf they took me
a<U+017F>hore and brought me to one of their cottages. There was I
forced, by rea<U+017F>on of the hard<U+017F>hip I had undergone, and the
<U+017F>ad condition I was in to re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf for <U+017F>ome houres,
as being <U+017F>o <U+017F>pent, that I was hardly able to <U+017F>tand on my
Legges.</p>
                     <p>I had not been there long ere the memory of my misfortunes
began to torment me, and thereupon repre<U+017F>enting to my <U+017F>elf how
that I left the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e under the power of a cruell Pyrate, and
that I was without men, without ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, and knew not any way
how to relieve her, my grief came upon me with <U+017F>o much violence,
that I was in a manner re<U+017F>olved to go and <U+017F>eek, in the bowells of
the Sea that death, which I had with <U+017F>o much difficulty e<U+017F>caped;
and certainly I think, that, had I not been prevented by tho<U+017F>e
good people, I <U+017F>hould have executed that fatall re<U+017F>olution;
but indeed my weakene<U+017F><U+017F>e was with all <U+017F>uch, that it was
ea<U+017F>ie for them to keep me on a <U+017F>orry bed whereon they
had ca<U+017F>t me, and where I had already pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away <U+017F>ome
houres.</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>hall not trouble you Madam, <hi>continued he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to</hi> Eli<U+017F>a <hi>alone,</hi> with a repetition of all tho<U+017F>e words, which
fell from me, during the violence of my grief; and you may
judge by the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, that there was, in the effects it produced,
but very little moderation. The night was now drawn neer,
when having recovered my <U+017F>trength and <U+017F>pirits in <U+017F>ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,
I called for my cloaths which the Fi<U+017F>her-men had taken
off to be dried, and began to find my <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch a condition,
that I would not by any per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions be kept there any longer,
when good fortune, being then my Friend, directs to the
cottage where I was, a certain man, whom I knew to be
<hi>Telamon,</hi> a per<U+017F>on that accompanied me in the quality of an
E<U+017F>quire. I immediately called him by his name, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
E<U+017F>quire, tran<U+017F>ported with joy runs to me, and embracing
my knees, a<U+017F>ked me thou<U+017F>ands of times by what miracle I had
e<U+017F>caped; but in<U+017F>tead of an<U+017F>vvering him, I pre<U+017F>ently a<U+017F>ked him
vvhat vvas become of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e? <hi>Telamon,</hi> perceiving
with what earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e I pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed that que<U+017F>tion to him <U+017F>everall
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97242:154"/>
times; <q>My Lord, <hi><U+017F>aid he to me,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the Pirate, by the
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his men, was taken up out of the water, and
brought into the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, finding him<U+017F>elf in a po<U+017F>ture able
enough to pur<U+017F>ue the de<U+017F>igne he had undertaken, as having
been immediately recovered out of the water, he gave orders
to be <U+017F>et a<U+017F>hore at a certain place he appointed to them, and
leaving the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e under the guard of his Lieutenant, he
left the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell with a <U+017F>elect number of his men, to <U+017F>eek out,
as they <U+017F>aid, a per<U+017F>on that had made an e<U+017F>cape the night
before, after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>et his ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell on fire; he commanded his
Lieutenant to have a care of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and to expect
his return at a place where he appointed him. For my part,
having not the patience to <U+017F>tay any longer in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell, I
thought it my be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to leave it, with a re<U+017F>olution to
give you all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I could if <U+017F>o be I found you capable
of any, or to take <U+017F>ome order for your enterrement, in ca<U+017F>e I
<U+017F>hould have found your body ca<U+017F>t up any where on the<U+017F>e
<U+017F>hores. Whereupon I came away with the Pirates, with
<hi>Zenodorus's</hi> leave, after I had ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf at his feet begging
his permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to look after the body of my Ma<U+017F>ter, to do it
the la<U+017F>t honours it were capable of.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>So that it <U+017F>eems then, <hi><U+017F>aid I interrupting him,</hi> my Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e
is yet about the river, where <U+017F>he is to expect the returne of
the Pirate, and that <hi>Zenodorus</hi> is come a<U+017F>hore upon this coa<U+017F>t,
and is not yet returned to his <U+017F>hips.</q> 
                        <q>I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, My
lord, <hi>replied he,</hi> that he is not yet returned, and that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved,
by what I have under<U+017F>tood, to be<U+017F>tow all the next day
to find out the per<U+017F>on that is e<U+017F>caped from him, and that it
is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he <U+017F>hould have met with her <U+017F>ince we came
a<U+017F>hore.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This account of <hi>Telamon</hi> filled me again with new hopes, as
re<U+017F>olved, that if I could meet with the Pirate, what number
<U+017F>oever of men he might have about him, I would either die
in the engagement with him, or force him to returne the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, out of a certain confidence, that either gods or men
might afford me <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to carry on my enterpri<U+017F>e.
In order thereto, knowing that we were not far from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
where might ea<U+017F>ily be procured all things that were
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, <hi>I</hi> gave <hi>Telamon</hi> <U+017F>ome of the jewells <hi>I</hi> ordinarily
carried about me, and which the Fi<U+017F>hermen had not, as good
Fortune would have it, taken out of my cloaths, when they
dried them, and commanded him to make all the ha<U+017F>t he
could to the City, and buy two hor<U+017F>es, charging him, by all
meanes, to make choice for me of the be<U+017F>t he could meet
with all, what rate <U+017F>oever he might be <U+017F>et at. To which
having further enjoined him to bring them me a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could, and to give notice that night to the Praetor
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97242:155"/>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> of the arrivall of the Pirates upon the coa<U+017F>t,
and the carrying away of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, I di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Telamon,</hi> with the<U+017F>e orders, took his way towards <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
while I remained, with <U+017F>ome little hope to do <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
among the Fi<U+017F>her-men, who would needs force me to
take what poor entertainment they could afford me; and
certainly; that nights re<U+017F>t was no more then nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for me,
to recover my <U+017F>trength, and put me into a condition to be
able to deale with tho<U+017F>e enemies which <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But why <U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>pin out my relation to <U+017F>uch a length?
In a word, the next day about an houre after Sun-ri<U+017F>ing, <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>aw <hi>Telamon</hi> coming with two hor<U+017F>es. So that having put on
my Armour and be<U+017F>towed <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e jewells I had left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Fi<U+017F>her-men, I got up on the better of the hor<U+017F>es,
which I found, much to my content, very fit for my turn;
and having under<U+017F>tood from <hi>Telamon</hi> that the Praetor had
notice given him, and was <U+017F>ending out ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to the relief
of the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, I re<U+017F>olved to make a <U+017F>earch all about <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
During all that day, it ran <U+017F>till in my thoughts, that
the onely way for me to relieve you, Madam, was, to meet
with <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and to become ma<U+017F>ter of his liberty as he was
of yours; and I thought it <U+017F>o much the more likely to be
effected, in regard that <hi>Telamon</hi> had a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that, the better
to find out the per<U+017F>on he was in que<U+017F>t of he had divided his men
into four parties, and con<U+017F>equently had but very few about him.</p>
                     <p>I thought <U+017F>it in the fir<U+017F>t place to ride up and down the
<U+017F>hore and to vi<U+017F>it the woods, and all the places thereabouts,
e<U+017F>pecially wherever I ob<U+017F>erved the track of any hor<U+017F>e. I had
<U+017F>pent in this manner the be<U+017F>t part of the day to no purpo<U+017F>e,
when cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing through a plea<U+017F>ant valley, and perceiving a little
rivulet, which took its ri<U+017F>e from a <U+017F>pring that was not far
off, the thir<U+017F>t I then was in, occa<U+017F>ioned as well by rea<U+017F>on of
the heat of the day, as the heavine<U+017F><U+017F>e of my armour, obliged me
to alight, and to come to the <U+017F>pring, where happened that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which you may have had an account of from <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
<U+017F>ince you have already <U+017F>een him. <hi>'Tis very true,</hi> replied the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e Eli<U+017F>a, <hi>we have <U+017F>o, and under<U+017F>tood all the particulars
of your combat; and I knew not how to forbear blaming you, for
being <U+017F>o ready to give</hi> Cleomedon <hi>occa<U+017F>ion to come to blowes, <U+017F>ince
you had no ground to hate him, nor did pretend any thing to the
Queen of</hi> Ethiopia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Madam, <hi>replies Artaban,</hi> you may be plea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>afely to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf as of nothing but truth, that the condition I was in
then was <U+017F>uch, that I had not any intention to engage <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to <U+017F>ight; but calling to mind the la<U+017F>t words I had <U+017F>aid to
him at our parting, wherein I made a confident brag, that
I <U+017F>hould one day be in a condition to mea<U+017F>ure a weapon with
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97242:155"/>
him without any prejudice to him, I thought my <U+017F>elf obliged
to put him in mind of it, out of a fear he might attribute
that forgetfullne<U+017F><U+017F>e to any want of courage, and yet I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
all I could to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e it in <U+017F>uch termes, as could not
have provoked him to fight, had he not been as forward as my
<U+017F>elfe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Artaban,</hi> having briefly run over tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages
which <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> had related before, acquainted them with what
had happened to him <U+017F>ince <hi>Candace's</hi> being carried away in their
<U+017F>ight the <U+017F>econd time; his engagement with <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> crue;
his retreat to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and the abode he had made
there, to their meeting at <hi>Tiridates's</hi> tomb.</p>
                     <p>He had ju<U+017F>t made an end of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when <hi>Clitia</hi>
came to give them notice that <hi>Cleomedon</hi> was upon the Terrace,
and immediately after, he comes into the room with an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and maje<U+017F>tick deportment. He had hardly acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
of his <U+017F>alutations to the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es, when <hi>Artaban,</hi> who
would needs do, with an obliging grace, whatever he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
he ought to do, comes up to him, and <U+017F>aluting him with
a civility animated by all the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of a reall greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
<U+017F>oule; <q>Generous Cleomedon, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> I have forborn
too long from rendring you that which all men acknowledge
to be your due. Since you have overcome that unju<U+017F>t repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which I had to do it, as well by the admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
you are Ma<U+017F>ter of, as by a late demon<U+017F>tration of your

                     <p>With the<U+017F>e words, the<U+017F>e two great per<U+017F>ons embraced one
another, upon the commands of the two Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es (the re<U+017F>pect
they had for them not permitting them to take that liberty in
their pre<U+017F>ence) and a little after, they looked one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a mutuall admiration, and were both equally <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as to the Friend<U+017F>hip which they had contracted. <hi>Candace</hi>
who was infinitely plea<U+017F>ed with it, <U+017F>poke to them whatever
<U+017F>he thought might any waies confirm them therein; and <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi>
who was extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which <U+017F>he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a perfect union between tho<U+017F>e two great men. But
they might very well have <U+017F>pared their endeavours to that
purpo<U+017F>e; for the behaviour of the<U+017F>e two great <U+017F>oules was <U+017F>o
mutually ingenuous and cordiall, that there was <U+017F>uch a prefect
con<U+017F>onancy between their words and thoughts, that it might
be <U+017F>aid, their friend<U+017F>hip was truely con<U+017F>ummate before they
had in a manner made the fir<U+017F>t overtures thereof.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e foure illu<U+017F>trious per<U+017F>ons, all <U+017F>atisfied, though with
<U+017F>ome inequality, would have fallen either together, or <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
into <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had not <hi>Candace</hi> be thought
her <U+017F>elf that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was not gone to bed, out
of an expectation to hear from them, and if <U+017F>he had not had
a great de<U+017F>ire to make her acquainted with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> that night.
Upon that reflection, having taken the Prince a little a<U+017F>ide (and
at the <U+017F>ame time left <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> with <hi>Artaban</hi> in an affectionate and
plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e) <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered to him her de<U+017F>ires, that he

who<U+017F>e prudence it were not un<U+017F>afe to commit things of the
greate<U+017F>t importance, and repeated to him all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es
which <U+017F>he had entertained her with, to prepare her
thereto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> very willingly conde<U+017F>cended to the propo<U+017F>ition of
<hi>Candace,</hi> as having already found it no <U+017F>mall difficulty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
him<U+017F>elf from <U+017F>o amiable a Si<U+017F>ter, and having forborn it
upon no other account than the <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had for the
Queen. <hi>Candace</hi> would have <U+017F>ent word to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> of it; but
<U+017F>he was a little troubled that <hi>Artaban</hi> <U+017F>hould be pre<U+017F>ent, as not
conceiving, that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> would, before him, declare a thing,

the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery whereof would infallibly co<U+017F>t him his life.
She acquainted him with her thoughts to that purpo<U+017F>e, and
advi<U+017F>ed with him what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be taken to have
things <U+017F>o carried as that <hi>Artaban</hi> might not be pre<U+017F>ent at that

know him <U+017F>o well, as that I would tru<U+017F>t him with <U+017F>omething
more precious than my life, and therefore, <U+017F>ince it is your plea<U+017F>ure
we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover my <U+017F>elf to her,

                     </p>
                     <p>All that were pre<U+017F>ent were infinitely plea<U+017F>ed with the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
clearne<U+017F><U+017F>e which <hi>Ca<U+017F>ario</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and <hi>Artaban,</hi> who
had heard the words, and ea<U+017F>ily imagined the occa<U+017F>ion on
which they were <U+017F>poken, willing to returne him an an<U+017F>wer,
not unworthy the good opinion he had of him; <q>I mu<U+017F>t
needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> that this demon<U+017F>tration of
your genero<U+017F>ity is very great, wherein you are content to
make a di<U+017F>covery of your <U+017F>elf to me, which, among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
of who<U+017F>e faith you were doubtfull, might prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to your <U+017F>afety; and I receive, with the re<U+017F>entment
I ought, a confidence, whereto I have not any waies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
you. But that you may be <U+017F>atisfied, that I am not
ab<U+017F>olutely unworthy of it, and that you need not fear I
<U+017F>hould abu<U+017F>e it, now that you have a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me of your
friend<U+017F>hip, I am to let you know, that, even during that
time, wherein I had the greate<U+017F>t aver<U+017F>ion for, nay, in the
time of youth, which is not ordinarily over-apt to keep a
<U+017F>ecret, I have known your name and birth, and that you will
not tell me any thing I know not, when you <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover your
<U+017F>elf to the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e your Si<U+017F>ter to be <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> the <U+017F>on of <hi>Caefar</hi>
and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Artabans,</hi> little expected by <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi>
rai<U+017F>ed in him <U+017F>ome a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, and might have put <hi>Candace</hi> into
<U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Eli<U+017F>a,</hi> had <U+017F>he not immediately called to mind
to <U+017F>ome words which <hi>Artaban</hi> had <U+017F>aid to her, when they
met at <hi>Tiridates's</hi> Tomb, whence <U+017F>he might have imagined,
that the birth and true name of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> were not unknown
to him. The Prince, upon this new expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip,
could not but admire the great courage of <hi>Artaban,</hi>
who, notwith<U+017F>tanding the <U+017F>trange aver<U+017F>ion he had ever di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
towards him, and that in an age which is not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97242:157"/>
to the moderation of the mo<U+017F>t violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, had
<U+017F>lighted the opportunity he had to prejudice his enemy, and
ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>ecrecy towards him, which he would not,
without <U+017F>ome difficulty, have found, even among his friends.
And certainly his a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment had been the greater at this
kind of proceeding, if the<U+017F>e characters of an elevated <U+017F>oule
had been le<U+017F><U+017F>e familiar to him, and if he had not found
in him<U+017F>elfe an inclination to do the like towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, he thought it but ju<U+017F>t to let <hi>Artaban</hi> know
what e<U+017F>teem and acknowledgment he conceived at <U+017F>o gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a carriage, and looking on him with an action, which in
<U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed what his thoughts were employed
about; <q>I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> that all things
are admirably great in you, and that it will be a great
inju<U+017F>tice in fortune, if <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>e you not above Kings, <U+017F>ince
they are things you can pull down when you plea<U+017F>e.
There are few per<U+017F>ons certainly would have made <U+017F>o little
advantage as you have done, of a di<U+017F>covery, which might
have proved <U+017F>o prejudicial to me in the world; but there are
yet fewer would have effected tho<U+017F>e great things which are in
you the accompli<U+017F>hments of your generous beginnings. But,
may I pre<U+017F>ume to a<U+017F>k you, by what adventure you <U+017F>hould
come to the knowledge of that which all the World was
ignorant of?</q> 
                        <q>A young man that had <U+017F>ometime been a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of yours, <hi>replied Artaban,</hi> and who <U+017F>ince, as I have been
informed, was killed in one of the battles which you fought
in <hi>Nubia,</hi> having for me a very particular friend<U+017F>hip revealed
that <U+017F>ecret to me, and there needed no more then the illu<U+017F>trious
characters I ob<U+017F>erved in your per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>atisfie me that he
told nothing but what was truth.</q> 
                        <q>If tho<U+017F>e characters are able
to work that effect, <hi><U+017F>aid Cae<U+017F>ario to him,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs imagine
you to be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of the gods; and though you are not plea<U+017F>ed
to derive any recommendation from a birth, which you do not
<U+017F>tand in need of to make you equal to the greate<U+017F>t Princes that
are, yet can I hardly be per<U+017F>waded but that yours is of the mo<U+017F>t
eminent.</q> 
                        <hi>Artaban</hi> would have made <U+017F>ome mode<U+017F>t return to this
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom <hi>Candace</hi> had <U+017F>ent
for, comes into the room, the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es having not thought it fit

him<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>The room, upon her coming into it, <U+017F>eemed to be filled with a
new light, which dazled both <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> and though
one of them had <U+017F>een her that very day before, and that the other
were her brother, and had <U+017F>pent his childhood with her, and that,
to <U+017F>ay better, they were both of them prepo<U+017F><U+017F>ed by a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97242:157"/>
which till then had not permitted them to imagine anything in
point of beauty comparable to <hi>Eli<U+017F>a</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> yet could they
not <U+017F>mother the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment which they conceived upon this
<U+017F>ight, nor but acknowledge, though with <U+017F>ome confu<U+017F>ion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance,
that all the beauties upon earth ought to give place to

the bloud and merit of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, in<U+017F>pired him with, could
upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight hardly forbear making di<U+017F>coveries thereof;
but upon <U+017F>econd thoughts he re<U+017F>olved to proceed after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner, and to make that adventure contribute <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to the diver<U+017F>ion and entertainment of tho<U+017F>e that were
pre<U+017F>ent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was hardly gotten into <hi>Eli<U+017F>as</hi> chamber, ere word was

her own, and that having left the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he thought
not fit to depart the lodgings till he had wi<U+017F>hed her a good night.
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> was going to <U+017F>end the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger back again with word

her that there was none had the lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of him, and
that <hi>Cleomedon</hi> was too much engaged by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he
had received from him to deny him the opportunity to <U+017F>ee

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> having done what the Queen de<U+017F>ired of her,

conceived <U+017F>he ought to have ob<U+017F>erved towards two <U+017F>uch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

the account had been given her of their gallant actions.
She looked on them one after another, with a certain
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, as not knowing any one in the World whom
<U+017F>he could think comparable to them, but onely her own
<hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were going to fall into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when there

<hi>Cleomedon,</hi> was it, that he was mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at; and, having

I have not certainly any account to give you of him, nay,
which is more, I never know him. But I may haply have

And that you may be the <U+017F>ooner convinced, ob<U+017F>erve well

him a long time with much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e. It was about the
tenth year of their age that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> departed from <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and about the fourteenth of his own, <U+017F>o that, by rea<U+017F>on, as
well of the infancy of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which (more remarkably then in any other degree of
mans age) happens in the countenances of men between that
of fourteen, and that of four and twenty, which was then the
age of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> it might well happen, that the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and
the Prince her Brother, could not, upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, di<U+017F>cover
the face of their Brother, in that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> who<U+017F>e <U+017F>peech,
proportionably to the re<U+017F>t, was altered, by growing bigger
<U+017F>ince their <U+017F>eparation. Yet was not all this alteration <U+017F>o great,
nor their memories <U+017F>o weak, but that after what <hi>Cleomedon</hi> had
<U+017F>aid, and the particular ob<U+017F>ervation which he had obliged
them to make, they would have known the Prince, had they
not been carried away with the general opinion, that he had
departed this World. Nay, after they had well con<U+017F>idered
his face, they, in a manner, knew him; but that di<U+017F>covery
had no further effect on them, then to force out certain
<U+017F>ighes; whereupon the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
after <U+017F>he had looked on <hi>Alexander,</hi> to <U+017F>ee whether he
was of the <U+017F>ame opinion: <q>I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge, <hi><U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he to the Prince,</hi> that I find abundance of re<U+017F>emblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your countenance, and that of a Prince, with whom
my Brother and my <U+017F>elf were brought up, and one that
might have been much about your age, if the gods had
thought fit to have continued him in life and health, and to
pre<U+017F>erve him again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e powers, by which he received an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
death.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>I am al<U+017F>o very much <U+017F>atisfied, <hi>added Prince Alexander,</hi> that
if out Brother <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> were living, he might be very like
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97242:159"/>
the brave <hi>Cleomedon.</hi> And thought that from the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, which was that of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> when he dyed, to
that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> which <U+017F>eems to be greater by nine or ten
years, there happens more alteration, both in the bulk and
countenances of men, then in all mans life be<U+017F>ides, and that
it might be withal granted, that time may in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure
have worn away, out of our memories, tho<U+017F>e Idaeas, which
cannot be expected otherwi<U+017F>e then imperfect in the minds
of children, <U+017F>uch as we were then; yet can I not call them
to my remembrance, without a certain conceit that I find
them again in <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and imagining to my <U+017F>elf, that, if
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> were now alive, there would be a very great re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between them. Nay, I am much inclined to believe,
from the great hopes that were conceived of him, and the
glorious bloud that ran in his veines, derived from illu<U+017F>trious
ance<U+017F>tors, that this re<U+017F>emblance might have reached to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of courage, and that he would have thought it a di<U+017F>honour
to come too far <U+017F>hort of that <U+017F>tupendous man, whom it was his
glory to imitate in all things.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The mode<U+017F>ty of the <U+017F>on of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> made him blu<U+017F>h at the<U+017F>e
obliging expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the <U+017F>on of <hi>Anthony;</hi> whereupon, looking
on him with a <U+017F>miling countenance, <q>It is but ju<U+017F>t indeed I
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer any thing, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> from a Prince to
whom I am obliged for an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that pre<U+017F>erved my life.
But <U+017F>ince you and the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra</hi> are plea<U+017F>ed to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

your mother, and that her indulgence towards me was as
great as what <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed towards him; that as he, <U+017F>o I
al<U+017F>o left you to <U+017F>eek out my <U+017F>afty in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> after the
downfall of your hou<U+017F>e; That I was born as well as he of
an unfortunate Queen, and am <U+017F>on to the greate<U+017F>t that ever
was of mankind; and, in a word, I am <U+017F>o extreamly like
him, that I might even in <hi>Alexandria</hi> pre<U+017F>ume to own
the name of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> if by <U+017F>uch an acknowledegment I

any thing <U+017F>he could have taken away from him, and rai<U+017F>ing

                     <p>When the fir<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>trations of this happy reacquaintance

THe fortunate meeting with a Brother, <U+017F>uch as
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> was, had rai<U+017F>ed in the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>atisfaction, as, <U+017F>ince the imaginary
infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> <U+017F>he had not been capable
of, whence it came, that <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over that
night with more delight, and took more re<U+017F>t
than the precedent. Now, as the be<U+017F>t part of the night was
<U+017F>pent ere <U+017F>he lay down, <U+017F>o was it accordingly very late ere <U+017F>he
awoke in the morning, in<U+017F>omuch that tho<U+017F>e who knew not any
thing of her long <U+017F>itting up, would not have a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>lept <U+017F>o long, had they not imagined that
the trouble and hard<U+017F>hip <U+017F>he had gone through, for <U+017F>ome
daies before, might require a more than ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a common ob<U+017F>ervation, that, it is ordinarily at our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the morning, we make the mo<U+017F>t naturall reflections on
the conditions and accidents of our lives. She accordingly had
no <U+017F>ooner opened her eies but the Idaea of her late adventures
pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf to her remembrance, and as <U+017F>he was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
good nature, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ympathy which her meeting with
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ario</hi> had rai<U+017F>ed in her mind, was the fir<U+017F>t effect that was
produced there. Her thoughts were, with no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>atisfaction,
taken up with that fortunate rencounter, as looking on it as a
thing extreamly advantageous, to find a Brother, whom <U+017F>he
thought dead <U+017F>o many yeares before, changed into a Brother <U+017F>o
great, <U+017F>o amiable, and <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, as well for his vertue, as
the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his actions. She reflected on the noble acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of his life, the <U+017F>trange Fortunes he had run through, and
fixed her con<U+017F>ideration on the pre<U+017F>ent po<U+017F>ture of his affaires,
which in all probability was <U+017F>uch as promi<U+017F>ed him a <U+017F>afe harbour
again<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e tempe<U+017F>ts whereby he had been to<U+017F><U+017F>ed up and
down for the <U+017F>pace of <U+017F>o many yeares, and <U+017F>eemed to be an e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>hment,
<U+017F>uch as gave him not any occa<U+017F>ion to envy that of
his Ance<U+017F>tors. The con<U+017F>ideration of her Brothers concernments
had that effect on her which it might be expected they might
have on the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter in the world, and <U+017F>truck her thoughts
with <U+017F>o much delight, that for <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>he could hardly make
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97242:163"/>
any reflection on her own: but at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could not keep them
off any longer, but they mu<U+017F>t needs do a violence to her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Idaea of her unfortunate <hi>Coriolanus</hi> pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf
to her in the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een him the day before.
Her fir<U+017F>t imaginations repre<U+017F>ented him to her in that terrible
po<U+017F>ture, wherein he had forced out of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell tho<U+017F>e that
fought for her deliverance: but there being not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in this, as in the reflection on the other accidents that
<U+017F>ucceeded it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon quitted it, and imagined to her <U+017F>elf a
<U+017F>ight of the Prince in that mortall <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e wherein he was upon

                     <p>During the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant intervalls <U+017F>he opened her <U+017F>oule to give
admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to that joy, which, of a long time before, could never
have the lea<U+017F>t entertainment there, but it was at the <U+017F>ame time
very much abated, by a cold reflection on the mi<U+017F>erable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which that Prince was reduced, as having lo<U+017F>t the
Kingdomes he had conquered, and being deprived of all <U+017F>upport
and relief in the world, through her inflexibility towards him.
The<U+017F>e reflections, equally divided between grief and joy, drew
many a <U+017F>igh out of her brea<U+017F>t, and this was the entertainment
of her thoughts, all the time <U+017F>he lay in bed after her awaking, and
while <U+017F>he was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing.</p>

and who, as well as the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had lain

prudence and genero<U+017F>itie, yet did <U+017F>he not think it fit to tru<U+017F>t him
with the <U+017F>ecret of another, though <U+017F>he had with her own, and
<U+017F>o made not the lea<U+017F>t mention to him of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ario,</hi> though <U+017F>he had

comes and engages my heart with the <U+017F>ame armes, whereby

grief I conceived thereat, had <U+017F>o cankered my <U+017F>oul, that I was not
able to entertain tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and clemency
of the King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> with the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of gratitude.
However I pretended to be extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible thereof, as I ought
to have been, of a favour I <U+017F>hould not have expected, and I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with my liberty, the other effects of the magnificence of
that Prince, with tho<U+017F>e demon<U+017F>trations which might well per<U+017F>wade
him that I was not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible thereof. I went a-board with a <U+017F>oul
half bur<U+017F>t with grief, and I carried with me into the <U+017F>ea an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grown <U+017F>o violent, through the change of my fortune, that
there was nothing able to afford me any <U+017F>atisfaction. And yet I
am apt to imagine that my grief would have been <U+017F>atisfied in being
onely a torment to my self, without producing any effects preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the fortune of my Conquerour, if <U+017F>omething of chance,
and the <U+017F>ollicitations of other per<U+017F>ons had not furni<U+017F>hed me witl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the occa<U+017F>ions to do it, and that at a time wherein my <U+017F>ufferings
were not aggravated by any de<U+017F>ign of revenge.</p>
                        <p>The third day after my departure I was overtaken by a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
that came after me from <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and he that was Commander
of it being come aboard mine, to give me a vi<U+017F>it, was known to
me, to be a per<U+017F>on of very great quality among the <hi>Moors,</hi> named
<hi>Theocles,</hi> who<U+017F>e Father had had under King <hi>Juba,</hi> the father of
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> the greate<U+017F>t places in the Kingdom, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of greate<U+017F>t importance. But it happening upon the death
of King <hi>Juba,</hi> that <hi>Theocles</hi> revolted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <U+017F>ided very
particularly with me, as having not the lea<U+017F>t remainder of love
for the royal bloud, and that further he had expected till the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue
of the war, without declaring him<U+017F>elf for his Prince, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
part of the <hi>Moors</hi> had done, young <hi>Juba,</hi> coming to the Throne,
had accordingly <U+017F>lighted him, though he had not any way di<U+017F>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him, nor taken away any thing he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of, and in
the di<U+017F>tribution of the Governments and charges which he be<U+017F>tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on tho<U+017F>e whom he thought mo<U+017F>t worthy, and had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97242:166"/>
mo<U+017F>t affection towards him, he conceived him<U+017F>elf not at all engaged
to prefer <hi>Theocles,</hi> who<U+017F>e preten<U+017F>ions were great, <U+017F>uitably
to his quality, and the high rank his Father had lived in before
him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theocles,</hi> thinking him<U+017F>elf hardly dealt with, and taking it very
impatiently that his <U+017F>overaigne <U+017F>hould prefer other per<U+017F>ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, <U+017F>uch indeed as were inferiour to him in birth, but much
more con<U+017F>iderable than he, by their <U+017F>ervices and their fidelity to
their Prince, would needs leave <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and lurk among the
enemies of his King, and bring over with him among the Romanes
his re<U+017F>entments and de<U+017F>ires of revenge. So that having taken <U+017F>hip
the <U+017F>ame day that I departed, the third after, he comes up to me,
and coming out of his own ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell into mine, he gave me a vi<U+017F>it,
making the greate<U+017F>t expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions he could of the affection he had
for me. Now this man being he that of all the <hi>Moores</hi> I had held
the greate<U+017F>t corre<U+017F>pondence with, and his di<U+017F>contents being not
unknowne to me, I was extreamly glad to meet with him, and
having under<U+017F>tood from him, that the re<U+017F>entments he had again<U+017F>t
his Prince were the occa<U+017F>ion why he left the Country to follow
me, and to go along with me to <hi>Rome,</hi> this con<U+017F>onancy of thoughts
made me the more confident of him, and rai<U+017F>ed in me a certain
affection for him, and engaged me to promi<U+017F>e him all the friend-and
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, among<U+017F>t the Romanes, that I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly help
him to.</p>
                        <p>Thus re<U+017F>olved we continued our voyage together, and in the
<U+017F>ame ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell; though we made his to follow us, and that very day
<hi>Theocles</hi> acquainted me at large with all I knew not that related
to his affaires, and di<U+017F>burthened him<U+017F>elf of all that lay upon
his heart; but with <U+017F>o much aggravation and animo<U+017F>ity again<U+017F>t
his Prince, that, though I were really his enemy, and well plea<U+017F>ed
to meet with a man that loved him not, yet could I not in my
Soule approve the procedure of his Subject, and that one that
had no ground given him of di<U+017F>content. However, I di<U+017F><U+017F>embled
the apprehen<U+017F>ion I had of it, as thinking it not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him in that exa<U+017F>peration, again<U+017F>t a man I loved not: and <U+017F>o
mutually communicating our re<U+017F>entments one to another we kept
on our voyage, and, having very good weather, came at la<U+017F>t to
<hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium,</hi> where we landed. Here it was that I thought fit to
make <U+017F>ome abode, to make <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>covery what po<U+017F>ture my
affaires were in at <hi>Rome;</hi> and knowing well enough that the
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Mauritania</hi> happened partly through my fault, as having
not onely by tyranny and mi<U+017F>-government, but al<U+017F>o by the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I had given the Souldiers to do them thou<U+017F>ands of injuries,
given the <hi>Moores</hi> occa<U+017F>ion to ri<U+017F>e in the behalf of their Prince,
and partly by rea<U+017F>on of my neglect of preventing that revolt in
the fir<U+017F>t eruptions thereof, and, by that negligence, given <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi>
lea<U+017F>ure to fortifie, and put him<U+017F>elf into a condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>cend
the Throne, which he would have found very much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97242:167"/>
to do, had I u<U+017F>ed all the diligence I ought to <U+017F>mother that
evill at its fir<U+017F>t breaking forth; the con<U+017F>cience I had of this truth
troubled me extremly. By which put into a feare of the di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> whom a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable as that of two great
kingdomes might very much exa<U+017F>perate again<U+017F>t me, and not
doubting but that there were a many per<U+017F>ons about him both
very ready, and very likely to do me any ill office, I thought
it no prudence to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> till I had before been a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what I was either to hope or feare upon my coming
thither.</p>
                        <p>To that end I <U+017F>ent one of my men with Letters to tho<U+017F>e
Friends whom I had at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein I intreated them to <U+017F>end
me word truely and without flattery how I <U+017F>tood in the favour
of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and what entertainment I was to expect from him,
after the misfortune that had happened to me. The me<U+017F><U+017F>enger
got to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <U+017F>ome few daies after returned thence with
<U+017F>ome of my Friends; who came to <U+017F>ee me at <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium,</hi> and
the<U+017F>e did not onely heighten the di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> was in before, but
withall told me po<U+017F>itively, that there was no coming for me to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where I was extreamly ill <U+017F>poken of, till I had in <U+017F>ome
mea<U+017F>ure vindicated my <U+017F>elf; that the Emperour was prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed
with an opinion very di<U+017F>advantageous to me; and that if I did
not employ certain powerfull per<U+017F>ons that had much intere<U+017F>t in
him; there was not onely very <U+017F>mall hopes I <U+017F>hould ever recover
my former fortune, but they thought there was no great <U+017F>afety
for my per<U+017F>on, and accordingly advi<U+017F>ed me, till the tempe<U+017F>t were
laid by <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons I <U+017F>hould employ to do it, to continue at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<U+017F>ium,</hi>
where I had the advantage of the <U+017F>ea if I <U+017F>hould be put to
any extremity.</p>
                        <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, made to me by per<U+017F>ons whom I could not any
way <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, and who<U+017F>e Friend<U+017F>hip I had great experiences of,
put me to more than ordinary di<U+017F>tractions, in<U+017F>omuch that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
not to leave <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium;</hi> or look at <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
indignation were appea<U+017F>ed. To effect that, I writ a large
<hi>Manife<U+017F>to,</hi> in order to my ju<U+017F>tification, wherein I laid down all
the rea<U+017F>ons that made any way for me, and endeavoured to elude
all accu<U+017F>ations that were put up again<U+017F>t me, and having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it to my Friends they returned to <hi>Rome</hi> to <U+017F>et on work all
tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who we were in hopes might prevaile any thing
with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch as had mo<U+017F>t power and authority
with him. I dur<U+017F>t not expect any thing from either <hi>Octavia</hi> or
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> as being not ignorant that there had ever been a very
great friend<U+017F>hip between that Prince and the King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
I had as little confidence of the mediation of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom I
had ever ob<U+017F>erved an enemy to tho<U+017F>e Governours, who by their
mi<U+017F>carriages had exa<U+017F>perated the nations they were to governe
again<U+017F>t them, and <U+017F>o thought it my onely cour<U+017F>e to addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf

                        <p>I thereupon imagined, that my Friends, by the meanes of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi>
might <U+017F>et the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e on work who could do any thing

to u<U+017F>e their utmo<U+017F>t endeavours. They departed in order to the

hath not <U+017F>et you at Liberty, and treated you with <U+017F>uch

<U+017F>hould do him all the favour you could with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> in relation

<hi>Mauritania,</hi> <U+017F>o that there is not any commerce between us and
that Country, and that as things <U+017F>tand at the pre<U+017F>ent there's

And though it may be thought <U+017F>omewhat unlikely

both made him forget his <hi>Love,</hi> and that in the condition he is

could no way better effect it than by making a peace, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the alliance of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> of whom he might expect the former

difficulty to make <hi>Cleopatra</hi> <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his in<U+017F>idelity, for that I

no <U+017F>mall jealou<U+017F>ie of what we would per<U+017F>wade her to. By
this intrigue, I <U+017F>hall not onely turne that love which <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
hath for <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> into a higher degree of aver<U+017F>ion for him,
which is the onely rub that lies in my way to happine<U+017F><U+017F>e: but

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:97242:169"/>
by making him believe that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to
<hi>Julia,</hi> whom he loves, and looks on as de<U+017F>igned for him, is no
le<U+017F><U+017F>e perfidious to him then to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> And by that means,
I <U+017F>hall deprive our enemy of a friend, who<U+017F>e intere<U+017F>t with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
hath hitherto been the greate<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>tacle I have had to <U+017F>truggle

he will have the greate<U+017F>t indignation, and mo<U+017F>t irreconcileable
hatred that can be again<U+017F>t him. So that, to arrive to the felicity
I aim at, and to make my revenge the more compleat, I <U+017F>hall not
be oppo<U+017F>ed either by the love of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> or the friend<U+017F>hip of

boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e to propo<U+017F>e it to you, whether it were not fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<U+017F>ome other per<U+017F>on rather then <hi>Julia,</hi> <U+017F>o not to draw on you
the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure and intere<U+017F>t of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom we mu<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>ibly
engage again<U+017F>t us, by demanding of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> a per<U+017F>on whom he is
in love with, and that is de<U+017F>igned for him. By this demand,
<hi>replies Tiberius,</hi> we break the friend<U+017F>hip that is between <hi>Marcellus</hi>
and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> which it concerns me mo<U+017F>t of any thing to do;
But we do not thereby any way injure <hi>Murcellus,</hi> and you do
not run the hazard of encurring his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, (though you
may well be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that your party <U+017F>hall not be weaker then his,
after the union of our intere<U+017F>ts, and con<U+017F>idering what you
may expect from our hou<U+017F>e) for, as it is not hard for you to
imagine, there is little likelihood that this per<U+017F>onated Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y
of <hi>Theocles</hi> from <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> <U+017F>hould any way prejudice <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
or that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> <U+017F>hould prefer the allyance of that <hi>African,</hi> his
enemy, before that of his Nephew, whom he loves no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then
if he were his own <U+017F>on, and de<U+017F>ignes to be his <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>or. No
doubt, all he will do, will be to laugh at the extravagance of
<hi>Juba's</hi> demand, but though the effect it will have upon him, will
<U+017F>ignifie nothing, in <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> it will do all that
I expect it <U+017F>hould: <U+017F>o that I am in <U+017F>ome hopes to enjoy <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
long before the truth be di<U+017F>covered. And if ever it
<U+017F>hould come to light, I promi<U+017F>e you, that through the power of
the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, who will be ab<U+017F>olutely for us, we <U+017F>hall reconcile
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:97242:170"/>
all, it being to be pre<U+017F>umed that the Emperour will not be much
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at an artifice, which hath no de<U+017F>ign in it, but that of
a<U+017F><U+017F>uring me of the enjoyment of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and is not prejudicial
to any but his greate<U+017F>t enemy.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the<U+017F>e, <hi>Tiberius</hi> added a many other rea<U+017F>ons to encourage
me to engage in his de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>o that there needed not much to
enflame the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition I was already in to <U+017F>erve him, into a re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do any thing he would have me, and by his own natural
eloquence, and the inclination I had of my <U+017F>elf to be per<U+017F>waded, he
took off all the difficulties I could make to my <U+017F>elf when he fir<U+017F>t
made his propo<U+017F>ition to me.</p>
                        <p>After I had reiterated the prote<U+017F>tation I had made to him, we
called <hi>Theocles,</hi> to whom <hi>Tiberius</hi> repeated all tho<U+017F>e things he had
<U+017F>aid to me, and without any difficulty brought him to a re<U+017F>olution
to undertake any thing, which he the <U+017F>ooner was per<U+017F>waded to,
as well by rea<U+017F>on he was naturally mi<U+017F>chievous, and revengefull,
but withal very indi<U+017F>creet and incon<U+017F>iderate, as by the hopes he
was put into by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of great fortunes and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances among
the <hi>Romans.</hi> At la<U+017F>t he re<U+017F>olved to endeavour any thing <U+017F>hould
be propo<U+017F>ed to him, and made no difficulty to per<U+017F>onate the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F><U+017F>adour
of his King, and to take all his in<U+017F>tructions from <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
We <U+017F>tayed together all that day, and the be<U+017F>t part of the night,
to take all the order requi<U+017F>ite in our de<U+017F>ign, and when we had
<U+017F>etled all things, and thought our <U+017F>elves fully in<U+017F>tructed, <hi>Tiberius</hi>
departed from that hou<U+017F>e to go and endeavour my peace with
<hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> having de<U+017F>ired us not to <U+017F>tir thence till we had heard
from him; but with as much <U+017F>ecrecy as might be, lea<U+017F>t there
<U+017F>hould be any <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of our interview. We accordingly <U+017F>taid
there as he had ordered us, while in the mean time <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a full di<U+017F>covery of his de<U+017F>ign to the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented
to her, that all the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of his life con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the
hope he was in to enjoy the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleopatra. Livia,</hi> who
who had a very great tenderne<U+017F><U+017F>e for him, after <U+017F>ome few difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were <U+017F>atisfied, engaged in our de<U+017F>ign upon you, and promi<U+017F>ed
him all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances <U+017F>he could afford him to effect it. He thought
it not fit to make the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covery of it to his brother <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi>
as knowing him to be a Prince of a candid and open di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition,
and con<U+017F>equently would not have approved tho<U+017F>e artifices, <U+017F>o that
all the per<U+017F>ons acquainted with, and concerned in our plot, were
onely <hi>Livia, Tiberius, Theocles,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf. For as to the per<U+017F>ons
we were to make u<U+017F>e of, we ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded them to what we
would have had all others to believe. <hi>Livia</hi> <U+017F>ollicited my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
into the Emperours favour with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>oon di<U+017F>pelled tho<U+017F>e clouds of reproaches and accu<U+017F>ations which
my adver<U+017F>aries had rai<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t me; and yet <U+017F>o ordered all things,
that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was not any way <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to have any hand in it,
pretending, that what <U+017F>he did, was upon the importunity of <U+017F>ome
of my friends, who were per<U+017F>ons of very con<U+017F>iderable quality in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97242:170"/>
                           <hi>Rome.</hi> So that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <hi>Tiberius</hi> under<U+017F>tood that I might have
acce<U+017F><U+017F>e to the Emperour, he <U+017F>ent to me by a tru<U+017F>ty per<U+017F>on, even the
very <U+017F>ame that had accompanied him in the interview, that I <U+017F>hould
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and without any fear prepare my <U+017F>elf to put in
execution what we had undertaken. We departed thence, <hi>Theocles</hi>
and my<U+017F>elf, and got thither much about the <U+017F>ame time as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and equipage, which we had <U+017F>ent for to <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium;</hi> but
before I pre<U+017F>ented my <U+017F>elf to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> we had another <U+017F>ecret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and having under<U+017F>tood from him how <U+017F>trong
our party was, by rea<U+017F>on of the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>es being of it, he further
acquainted us, how that he had in his hands the great <U+017F>eal of the
Kings of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and the order he had taken for the liveries
of the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adours, and for all other things that were requi<U+017F>ite
to our de<U+017F>ign. The next day, I waited on the Emperour, who,
<U+017F>uitably to the hopes that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had put me into, entertained
me with abundance of courte<U+017F>ie, imputing my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e to
fortune onely, and <U+017F>eeming to be <U+017F>atisfied with the rea<U+017F>ons which
had been given him in order to my ju<U+017F>tification. And though he
di<U+017F>covered nothing <U+017F>o much in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as the violent aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
he had for <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> yet did I <U+017F>till give him the greate<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
imaginable, celebrating his valour, and acknowledging
the extraordinary civilities I had received from him, in <U+017F>uch terms
as ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered that I was far from being his enemy. For thus
had <hi>Tiberius</hi> and my <U+017F>elf ordered the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e to be carried, it
being re<U+017F>olved that <hi>Theocles</hi> and I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak well of him every
where, <U+017F>o to take off all <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion men might conceive of any evil
de<U+017F>ign that we might have again<U+017F>t him. The fir<U+017F>t time I was
brought to the Emperour, I gave him onely an account of my own
affairs, as al<U+017F>o of tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Mauritania;</hi> but in the <U+017F>econd au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
I had, which was when all things were ready and
ripe for <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s de<U+017F>ign, I had <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him
about <hi>Theocles</hi>'s commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and demanded audience for
him.</p>
                        <p>But here Madam, and you my Lord, continued <hi>Volu<U+017F>ius</hi> looking
on <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> I am now come to that part of my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, being to give you an account of things you are
but too well acquainted with already, will accordingly be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>ome
to you. For you know as well as my <U+017F>elf how we were
entertained by <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> as al<U+017F>o with what contempt he looked on
the <hi>Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y</hi> of <hi>Theocles,</hi> and in a word, all the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
of our negotiation. You al<U+017F>o be<U+017F>t know what influence our
de<U+017F>ign had upon your <U+017F>elves, in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure an<U+017F>wering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> yet <U+017F>o, Madam, as that, to his misfortune
and my unhappine<U+017F><U+017F>e, he made not that advantage thereof he was
in hope it might have produced, <U+017F>ince that though you cea<U+017F>ed to
love a Prince whom you conceived incon<U+017F>tant to you, yet did it
not occa<U+017F>ion the lea<U+017F>t change in you as to what thoughts you had
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> nay, on the contrary, the aver<U+017F>ion you had had for
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:97242:171"/>
him, <U+017F>eemed to be far greater then it was before, upon this accident.</p>
                        <p>At this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age <hi>Volu<U+017F>ius</hi> made a little <U+017F>top, as if he had gone
through the fir<U+017F>t part of his relation; and <hi>Marcellus</hi> perceiving, that
the Prince<U+017F>s, having <U+017F>ummoned all the forces of her re<U+017F>olution and
con<U+017F>tancy, to keep up her <U+017F>pirits at this reiteration of her cruel
afflictions, was, neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e, forced to give pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to certain
tears, doing him<U+017F>elf a little violence to avoid expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ame
weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e; <q>It is but too true, <hi><U+017F>aid he to volu<U+017F>ius,</hi> that your bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
combination produced effects but too deplorable, and that
if the crafty <hi>Tiberius</hi> made no advantage of it, through the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice
of the gods, who have ever a puni<U+017F>hment for <U+017F>uch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
de<U+017F>ignes; he drew neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e this <U+017F>atisfaction from
it, that he filled our <U+017F>ouls with a mortal grief, and that it did
me more mi<U+017F>chief then you expected it <U+017F>hould, in regard of that
<U+017F>trange influence it had on the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the uncon<U+017F>tant
<hi>Julia,</hi> which it might have had on that of the generous <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
Tis <U+017F>he, <hi>Volu<U+017F>ius,</hi> whom you have not yet ju<U+017F>tified, though you
have a<U+017F><U+017F>ured us of the fidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and though <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and your <U+017F>elf have over-reached us to the prejudice of that
poor Prince, who, you tell us, had not really <U+017F>o much as thought
of <hi>Julia;</hi> yet hath that unmindfull Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e appeared <U+017F>uch
upon that occa<U+017F>ion as <U+017F>he had done upon diver<U+017F>e others before,
and the feigned expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the love and pretended de<U+017F>ign
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> drew from her very earne<U+017F>t ones of the refluxe of
that affection which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ometimes had for him. Ah, my
Lord, <hi><U+017F>aies Volu<U+017F>ius, rea<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,</hi> entertain not any
<U+017F>uch thought, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, if you dare credit a man
acknowledging him<U+017F>elf guilty of <U+017F>o great a cheat, that <hi>Julia</hi>
hath <U+017F>hewn her <U+017F>elf upon this emergency, no le<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>tant then
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and that <U+017F>he entertained with abundance of contempt
what we would have per<U+017F>waded her to, as to the affection of
<hi>Coriolanus.</hi> The gods are my witne<U+017F><U+017F>es that I have not in the
lea<U+017F>t contributed to the occa<U+017F>ions of your jealou<U+017F>ie, but was told
by <hi>Toeocles,</hi> after he had received orders from the Emperour to
leave <hi>Rome</hi> within <U+017F>ome few daies, that <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who had made
him his ab<U+017F>olute creature, and had promi<U+017F>ed him a <U+017F>ecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
though he <U+017F>aw him but very privately, and that in publick
he pretended not the lea<U+017F>t acquaintance with him, would needs,
out of an extraordinary <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>tion of malice, have him give you
<U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion of jealou<U+017F>ie, the more to enflame the re<U+017F>entment
you might have again<U+017F>t the King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> This was to be
done by the means of one of <hi>Julia's</hi> women, who, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by pre<U+017F>ents, was to give him admittance two nights
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively, into the lodgings of that Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o to put you
into an imagination that he had <U+017F>ecret conferences with her.
But he hath prote<U+017F>ted to me, with many imprecations, that he
never <U+017F>aw the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, and that he had not <U+017F>poken to any but
that onely woman, who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Acilia,</hi> if I mi<U+017F>take it not, with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97242:171"/>
whom he had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over <U+017F>everal hours in the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es Wardrobe,
and whence he never came but at <U+017F>uch hours, as there mu<U+017F>t needs

it after your departure, hath <U+017F>ufficiently cleared her <U+017F>elf in

for my own part, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that during the repre<U+017F>entation of
all this pretended infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed nothing

<hi>Rome</hi> without taking any leave from us, and mu<U+017F>t further let
you know, that, according to my apprehen<U+017F>ions of it, you cannot
any longer ju<U+017F>tly charge with lightne<U+017F><U+017F>e a Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, who, in your

of my Fortunes which I had lo<U+017F>t, with the government of
<hi>Mauritania.</hi> He put me into <U+017F>ome hopes, that, by the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of <hi>Livia,</hi> I might be entru<U+017F>ted with other employments,
not inferiour, or le<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderable, then that, nay haply with the

got me to do any thing in the de<U+017F>ign, wherein I was to <U+017F>erve him.
But, when he perceived that the artifices he had made u<U+017F>e of, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
not his expectation, and that though they had proved <U+017F>o
fortunate as to <U+017F>atisfie you both of the infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
and con<U+017F>equently de<U+017F>troy or divert the affection you have had for

not minding my concernments at all, or the great hopes he had,

no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfaction. However, at the fir<U+017F>t I took all things with
abundance of patience, as not thinking it very <U+017F>trange, that the
di<U+017F>traction <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in, which was <U+017F>uch as made him le<U+017F><U+017F>e care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of that earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e which he had before expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to do me
all the favours I could expect from him. But when I <U+017F>aw
that his coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e encrea<U+017F>ed more and more, and that the
Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e did me not any good office with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> I began
to be troubled, and to give entertainment to that remor<U+017F>e
which ever attends guilt, when a man reaps not the benefit which
had encouraged him to the commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a crime.</p>
                        <p>However <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought fit, out of policy, to flatter me <U+017F>till
with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>light remainders of hope, and held it no prudence to
make an ab<U+017F>olute breach with me, out of a fear that the di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
I might conceave thereat, <U+017F>hould engage me to di<U+017F>cover the
truth of what had pa<U+017F>t. Upon the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations was it, that he,
being prodigal enough of his kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e and care<U+017F><U+017F>es, when there
is any thing of concernment to him<U+017F>elf, entertained me with civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<U+017F>uch as, in appearance, were the mo<U+017F>t obliging in the World.
But I perceived that in effect, he thought but little of me, and
minded me no more then as a complice, in the ba<U+017F>e trick he had
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:97242:172"/>
put upon you, and one that he could gladly have wi<U+017F>hed out of
the World, <U+017F>o to be rid of a fear of being <U+017F>ometime or other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.
His carriage was not the <U+017F>ame towards <hi>Theocles,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be a per<U+017F>on of mi<U+017F>chievous inclinations, and one fit to
be put upon any enterpri<U+017F>e, he had held him in a very fair corre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
to be made u<U+017F>e of in a de<U+017F>ign he had, and to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
as I have told you, to per<U+017F>wade Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> that the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Julia</hi> treated privately with him upon the negotiation,
he was <U+017F>ent thither upon, from <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> When the Emperour
had <U+017F>ent him an order to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> he <U+017F>ent him to a hou<U+017F>e of his
own, within a daies journy from the City, and there kept him <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
till the time of his departure, which was within few daies
after. You know how he left <hi>Rome,</hi> in a manner alone, without
any attendance, and went his waies, <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>curely, that it was not
known what de<U+017F>ign he was gone upon, nor what way he had taken
at his departure. He gave out, <U+017F>ome daies before, (as I al<U+017F>o heard
my <U+017F>elf) that his intention was to find out <hi>Coriolanus</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t
of his dominions, and to be revenged by his death, for the wound
he had received from him, <U+017F>ince the Emperour had denied him all
other waies of <U+017F>atisfaction, and thought not fit to tru<U+017F>t him with
the command of that naval army which he had <U+017F>ent again<U+017F>t him,
under the conduct of <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> and I was confirmed
in the confidence I had that he was gone away upon that re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when I under<U+017F>tood that he had taken <hi>Theocles</hi> along with
him, who was well acquainted with the Country, and might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
very much facilitate the execution of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e.</p>
                        <p>The departure of <hi>Tiberius</hi> put me into no <U+017F>mall a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment,
as being a thing that came not within my expectation, for I found
my <U+017F>elf, by that means, much to my di<U+017F>comfort, deprived of that
little a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which I was as yet in hopes to receive from him.
That which put me into a greater nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it, was, that, by the
concernment I had in <hi>Theocles</hi>'s negotiation, I had drawn upon me
your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, my Lord, with that of all your hou<U+017F>e, and that
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, which are the mo<U+017F>t powerful of the Empire, and
again<U+017F>t which I could not hold out long, but by the intere<U+017F>t of
<hi>Livia.</hi> Not my Lord, that I ever received any di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie either
from your <U+017F>elf or the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e, or that you did me any ill office
that ever I could hear of; but it was not hard for me to take
notice that you were all but little plea<U+017F>ed with me, and I was
not ignorant that you were in a capacity to do me a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure
whenever you had a mind to do it. For your part, my Lord, you
<U+017F>oon put me out of that fear, by your departure <U+017F>ome few daies
after <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which was almo<U+017F>t after the <U+017F>ame manner, and, as
mo<U+017F>t people were of opinion, with the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ign; but the
Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Octavia</hi> <U+017F>taid behind, as al<U+017F>o the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es your Si<U+017F>ters,
and diver<U+017F>e other per<U+017F>ons of great credit with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> who were
all very much di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied with me. <hi>Livia</hi> and <hi>Dru<U+017F>us</hi> were indeed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:97242:173"/>
able to counterballance that credit of theirs; but <hi>Livia</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
me no longer, when <hi>Tiberius</hi> once forbore his <U+017F>ollicitations
on my behalf, and <hi>Dru<U+017F>us,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of a more then orninary vertue,
finding haply little inclination to any <U+017F>uch thing in me, and having
at my fir<U+017F>t coming conceived a prejudice again<U+017F>t me, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed not
the lea<U+017F>t friend<U+017F>hip towards me.</p>
                        <p>Thus was I, in a manner, di<U+017F>carded by all, little e<U+017F>teemed by
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> who had not entertained me but upon the mediation of
<hi>Livia,</hi> and abu<U+017F>ed by tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw me fallen, through my own
negligence, from that noble employment, and favour of fortune
wherein I <U+017F>eemed to have been <U+017F>o well <U+017F>ettled. My ancient friends,
nay my own relations began to <U+017F>light me, and not to endure my
company without <U+017F>ome violence; <U+017F>o that in<U+017F>tead of continuing in
the hopes I had conceived to be re<U+017F>tored to my former condition,
I found my <U+017F>elf in a probability to wa<U+017F>t away my life, not onely in
the condition of a private man, but withal, in that of one of the
mo<U+017F>t unfortunate of mankind. The reflection I made on this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

tho<U+017F>e regrets in my <U+017F>oul, which I might well conceive for the abu<U+017F>e
I had done to <U+017F>o great a Prince, and made me look on my pre<U+017F>ent
fortune as a vi<U+017F>ible effect of Heavens ju<U+017F>tice, whom I had incen<U+017F>ed
again<U+017F>t me, by an unrea<U+017F>onable de<U+017F>ire of revenge, and the carrying
on of a ba<U+017F>e and unworthy project. I made all the friends I could
for <U+017F>everal employments, which were all denied me, though they
were <U+017F>uch as I might well pretend to; and I found at la<U+017F>t that
there was no living for me in <hi>Rome,</hi> but with the conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dangerous <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, which I was <U+017F>truggling with when <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> left
<hi>Rome</hi> to go that va<U+017F>t progre<U+017F><U+017F>e he intended through the Empire,

which kept me fa<U+017F>tened to my bed in a manner ever <U+017F>ince that time,
and during which there have happened very <U+017F>trange and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
e<U+017F>pecially in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which, upon the ab<U+017F>ence of
its valiant Prince, who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence might have maintained it again<U+017F>t
all the World, is fallen under the power of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> Hearing
this news at <hi>Rome,</hi> grief <U+017F>eized me afre<U+017F>h, as reflecting on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
I had been fed with by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to be re<U+017F>tored to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if ever it were reduced. At la<U+017F>t, after a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I made a <U+017F>hift to leave my bed, much about two
months <U+017F>ince; and conceiving, that change of air, might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<U+017F>omewhat to the recovery of my health, I departed from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and went to <U+017F>pend <U+017F>ome time in certain hou<U+017F>es I had <U+017F>till
left me in <hi>Italy.</hi> When I was grown to <U+017F>ome competency of
<U+017F>trength, I would needs take a further progre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and after I had
<U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in vi<U+017F>its among my friends, (if I may <U+017F>ay that in my
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:97242:173"/>
misfortune I had pre<U+017F>erved any) I went to a certain hou<U+017F>e belonging
to <hi>Mummius,</hi> di<U+017F>tant from <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium</hi> about an hours riding.
There had I <U+017F>taid two daies, when, by <U+017F>ome that belonged to <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
who went almo<U+017F>t every day to <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium,</hi> I under<U+017F>tood
that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was newly arrived there. I was a little <U+017F>urprized
at that news, nay, <U+017F>o far, that I was in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence what cour<U+017F>e I
<U+017F>hould take, as not knowing whether it were then a fit time for
me to waite on him, to put him in mind of the promi<U+017F>es he
had made to me, and to acquaint him with the <U+017F>ad condition
I was reduced to, or <U+017F>it down in the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion I was of that he
had ab<U+017F>olutely forgotten me. But at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome little <U+017F>cantlings of
hope, that he would in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure perform what he had
promi<U+017F>ed, encouraged me into a re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>ee him. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
I went to <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ented my <U+017F>elf to him, at
a time, that in all probability he was not much taken up with
any thoughts of me. Tis generally known what a great ma<U+017F>ter
he is in the art of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, yet could he not <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e
him<U+017F>elf at my fir<U+017F>t appearance, but that I could ea<U+017F>ily perceive
he was <U+017F>omewhat at a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee me there, and that I was not
the welcome<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on in the World to him. But after a while
recovering him<U+017F>elf and his artifices, he entertained me with
abundance of <U+017F>eeming obligation, even to the making of a
many excu<U+017F>es to me that he had left <hi>Rome</hi> without giving
me notice of it, and <U+017F>wearing that that injury, (if it were
any) was no more then he had done to all the World be<U+017F>ides,
tho<U+017F>e onely excepted whom he had taken along with him, and
that he had concealed his de<U+017F>ign from all, that <U+017F>o it might not be in
the power of any to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Finding him in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture of civility towards me, I thought
it a fit time, in plain terms, to acquaint him with the mi<U+017F>erable
condition I was then in as to point of fortunes, and did <U+017F>ilently
reproach him with a certain ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e, in that he had for<U+017F>aken
me, after I had upon his account engaged my <U+017F>elf in an action,
which had rai<U+017F>ed me enemies among the mo<U+017F>t powerful per<U+017F>ons
about the Emperour. I al<U+017F>o took occa<U+017F>ion to put him in mind of
the promi<U+017F>e he had made me for my recovery of the government
I had lo<U+017F>t, if it came within the power of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi>

needs put him into, and affirming that he <U+017F>till per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the <U+017F>ame
re<U+017F>olutions, he told me that the rea<U+017F>on of his <U+017F>tay at <hi>Brundu<U+017F>ium,</hi> was,
to learn by tho<U+017F>e that he had <U+017F>ent to <hi>Rome,</hi> in what place he might
meet with the Emperour, who, as he had under<U+017F>tood, was <U+017F>o far
gone in his progre<U+017F><U+017F>e as into <hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> out of a de<U+017F>ign he had to vi<U+017F>it
the Provinces of the Empire. That as <U+017F>oon as his people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
his re<U+017F>olutions were to put to <U+017F>ea again to overtake
<hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>'s Court, where he promi<U+017F>ed me to endeavour all
that lay in his power with him and the Empre<U+017F><U+017F>e to re<U+017F>ettle me
in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> in the <U+017F>ame condition I had been in before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="342" facs="tcp:97242:174"/>
Seeing him in this humour, though I dur<U+017F>t not be over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his promi<U+017F>es, I entreated him that he would be plea<U+017F>ed
to take me along with him in that voyage, and give me leave once
more to try, whether I could recover my <U+017F>elf out of the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of my fortunes by his protection and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. <hi>Tiberius</hi>
entertained that reque<U+017F>t with a countenance wherein it was vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he thought me a trouble to him. Yet dur<U+017F>t he not deny
it me, out of a fear, as I have had good ground to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine
<U+017F>ince, lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>appointment might oblige me to
di<U+017F>cover the combination and the de<U+017F>igne we had to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
you; which it <U+017F>eems he was very loath <U+017F>hould take any
aire, though he had not made that advantage thereof which
he expected. He therefore was content I <U+017F>hould accompany
him, in<U+017F>omuch that having <U+017F>ome three daies after received from
<hi>Rome</hi> the account he expected, and the accommodations he
had <U+017F>ent for, in order to his retinue, I went aboard, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
taking along with me but a <U+017F>mall number of <U+017F>ervants
that had attended me to <hi>Mummius</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>o we directed
our cour<U+017F>e towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither he had under<U+017F>tood that
the Emperour was to come within a <U+017F>hort time, and to make <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>tay there.</p>
                        <p>I had forgot to tell you, that I found <hi>Theocles</hi> with him, in
very good terms, as to matter of tru<U+017F>t and intimacy, which I was
at fir<U+017F>t very glad to <U+017F>ee: but not many daies after I perceived that
the good inclinations which that Barbarian had <U+017F>ometimes
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to me, were in a manner lo<U+017F>t, and that I was much more
an eye-<U+017F>ore to him then to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> I under<U+017F>tood from both,
that they had been in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to endeavour, by any
means they could, the death of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> it being, it <U+017F>eems,
the judgement of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he might compa<U+017F><U+017F>e it any
way what<U+017F>oever, without any prejudice to his honour, after
the treatment he had received from that Prince in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the cour<U+017F>e he had taken to be <U+017F>atisfied of him by other waies, if
the Emperour had thought it good to be<U+017F>tow on him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the naval army which he had de<U+017F>ired. They further
told me, what trouble it was to him that he had not met with
him in his own Kingdom, and that after they had <U+017F>ought him up
and down in others the next to it, he thought it be<U+017F>t to take
his way back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of an imagination he
might be <U+017F>ecretly returned thither to <U+017F>ee the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though I was no friend to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as I think I had <U+017F>ufficiently
made it appear, yet this per<U+017F>idiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Theocles</hi> could I not
but conceive a horrour at, perceiving it to be <U+017F>uch as egg'd him
on to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e the death of his Prince; and this troubled me <U+017F>o
much, that I could not forbear di<U+017F>covering it to him, <U+017F>o far as
that I could not any way approve of it. It was no doubt an
imprudent action in me, and the Barbarian conceiving him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:97242:174"/>
di<U+017F>obliged, not onely forbore all further corre<U+017F>pondence with
me, but rai<U+017F>ing <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions in <hi>Tiberius</hi> of me, he had ever and
anon private conferences with him, which I mu<U+017F>t not be admitted
to, and accordingly gave me occa<U+017F>ion to mi<U+017F>t ru<U+017F>t there was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a-brewing again<U+017F>t me.</p>
                        <p>Thus we kept on our voyage which proved pro<U+017F>perous enough,
till that ye<U+017F>terday we landed upon this river, at a little City
which is di<U+017F>tant about three houres riding from this place, <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
it <U+017F>eems, being unwilling to come up into the port of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> out of a de<U+017F>igne, as he told me, to come into the
City undi<U+017F>covered. In order to that re<U+017F>olution he told us that
we mu<U+017F>t be divided into <U+017F>everall parties the better to avoid going
in <U+017F>uch a number and equipage as might occa<U+017F>ion any di<U+017F>covery,
and thereupon ordered me to go before with <hi>Theocles,</hi> <U+017F>even
or eight of his men and onely two of mine, a<U+017F><U+017F>igning <hi>Theocles</hi> a
place in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where it was appointed we <U+017F>hould all meet
at night. We got on hor<U+017F>eback (I all this time not having the
lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of the wicked de<U+017F>igne they had upon me) and rode
a good way di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of indifferent things, the di<U+017F>tance which
was between <hi>Theocles</hi> and my <U+017F>elf being not come to that
height as to hinder us from di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing together. At la<U+017F>t
being come into a wood, which from the river <U+017F>ide reaches
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>tadia into the neighbour-hood. <hi>Theocles</hi> began to rip
up the former di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we had together <U+017F>ome daies before,
concerning the <U+017F>ervice he would have done <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
he had undertaken to be the death of his own Prince;
and told me that he very much wondred, I <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>approve
his proceeding, being guilty of an action that was no better,
and had my <U+017F>elf engaged him in a cheat; which he had never
been drawn into but by my advice and encouragement. Though
I might well imagine that <hi>Theocles</hi> fell not upon that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
but with a de<U+017F>igne to quarrell with me, and find a pretence
without infamy to <hi>Tiberius</hi> to put in execution what they had
ba<U+017F>ely plotted again<U+017F>t me, yet did I not reflect on it <U+017F>oon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and accordingly could not forbear telling him, that
there was a va<U+017F>t difference between an action wherein we had
been jointly engaged (though truely con<U+017F>idered, it were very
horrid) and the de<U+017F>igne to murther a King in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and that there was the greater difference between
tho<U+017F>e two actions, in regard of us by as much as that I was
a <hi>Romane</hi> and he a <hi>Subject</hi> to <hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This barbarous wretch, who, what an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>oever I had made,
would have found the pretence he was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be tran<U+017F>ported with indignation at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
drew his <U+017F>word and ran at me with all the fury he could. I
<U+017F>hould have been but little frightned at his action, if all tho<U+017F>e
that were about him had not done the like, and with the <U+017F>ame
labour <U+017F>atisfied me, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had not be<U+017F>towed that guard
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97242:175"/>
on me but to give me my death. Of my two men, the more
affectionate lo<U+017F>t his life at my feet, and the other frightned
<U+017F>aved him<U+017F>elf by getting into the wood, <U+017F>o that I was forced
to <U+017F>tand alone to the fury of tho<U+017F>e cruell Butchers, who came
about me and gave me two great wounds. No que<U+017F>tion, but a
thou<U+017F>and more had followed to di<U+017F>patch me out of this world,
and I <U+017F>aw it was to no purpo<U+017F>e to think to lengthen my life by a
fruitle<U+017F><U+017F>e re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, when it plea<U+017F>ed Fortune to direct into that
part of the wood a man armed all over, mounted on a very
<U+017F>tately hor<U+017F>e, and attended onely by an E<U+017F>quire. He made a little
halt to <U+017F>ee what was done, and perceiving he had but little
time to loo<U+017F>e, if he would <U+017F>ave my life, after he had anticipated
his coming by a great outcry, and in few words reproached my
enemies with ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e and cowardice, he ran in among them with
a fury to which nothing can be compared, and having with the
<U+017F>hock of his hor<U+017F>e overthrown the fir<U+017F>t he met within his way,
he <U+017F>et upon the re<U+017F>t with <U+017F>uch eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e as <U+017F>hewed he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
daunted at their number. And whereas they, as well as I,
had no other armes then their <U+017F>words, he <U+017F>pent very few blowes
which either carried not death along with them, or made tho<U+017F>e
they met with uncapable of fighting any longer. <hi>Theocles</hi> a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
at this miraculous relief, and perceiving there was no
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility to make an end of me till he had rid his hands of
the <U+017F>tranger, endeavoured with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his men to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him. But as it happened, he ran upon his own death, for
that valiant man having received upon his buckler the blowes
he made at him, ran him clear through the body, and <U+017F>o he
fell down to the ground, and immediately breathed his la<U+017F>t.
His companions were but weak in their endeavours to revenge
his fall, and finding them<U+017F>elves reduced to one halfe of the
number they made at fir<U+017F>t, and that by the <U+017F>ame hand, they
were quite di<U+017F>couraged, and placed all their <U+017F>afety in their
flight.</p>
                        <p>Finding my <U+017F>elf re<U+017F>cued in that manner from tho<U+017F>e unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enemies, though very much weakened by the two wounds
I had received, I made a <U+017F>hift to come nearer my deliverer,
to give him thankes for his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and it happened at the
<U+017F>ame time, that he, feeling him<U+017F>elf very much heated, either
by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>ultrine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, or the action he had
been in, put up the vi<U+017F>our of his head-piece to take in a little
fre<U+017F>h aire. I had hardly fa<U+017F>tened my eies on his countenance,
but I was in a manner dazzled by the lu<U+017F>tre and goodline<U+017F><U+017F>e
of it, and thereupon looking on him a little more earne<U+017F>tly,
I knew him to be that per<U+017F>on to whom <hi>I</hi> had been <U+017F>o cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,
the valiant King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould repre<U+017F>ent to you the confu<U+017F>ion I
was in, to find my <U+017F>elf obliged for my life to a Prince whom
<hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely abu<U+017F>ed and to <U+017F>ee that Fortune <U+017F>hould, after
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97242:175"/>
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a manner, direct to my relief that per<U+017F>on from whom
of all men <hi>I</hi> had lea<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to expect it. An adventure <U+017F>o
unexpected could not but tie up my tongue for a while, and
<U+017F>tifling the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> intended to di<U+017F>burthen my <U+017F>elf of by
way of acknowledgement for the deliverance <hi>I</hi> was obliged to
him for, I <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till before him, mute, immoveable, and in
the po<U+017F>ture of a man whom an exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of remor<U+017F>e had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all confidence. And it was certainly from my remor<U+017F>e,
rather than any fear, that this proceeded, as not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the injury <hi>I</hi> had done him, was come to his knowledge;
but if <hi>I</hi> was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee him, he was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e to meet
with me, and calling me to mind by the idaea's he had <U+017F>till in
his memory of my countenance, and haply confirmed by the
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment he ob<U+017F>erved in it, he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till, as well as my
<U+017F>elf, like one lo<U+017F>t in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence and irre<U+017F>olution. At la<U+017F>t, the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which produced that effect in him being much different
from that which had put me into <U+017F>o great di<U+017F>turbance, he <U+017F>oon
recovered him<U+017F>elf, and having viewed me with much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tne<U+017F><U+017F>e
then before; <q>Are not you Volu<U+017F>ius, <hi><U+017F>aid he to me,</hi>

before they had condemned me with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>everity;
and that they <U+017F>hould both of them have debated the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e a
little on my behalf, again<U+017F>t apparences uncertain enough. How
do I acknowledge my <U+017F>elf obliged to the gods that they have
ordered things <U+017F>o, as that, before my death, I may let them know,
I have not been perfidious either to my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e or my Friend,

by <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars</hi> wrath, whereto I <U+017F>hall expo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf without the
lea<U+017F>t fear, after I have offered up to my ill fortune a victime
which I am obliged to <U+017F>acrifice to her. That after that action,
whatever may be the event of it, I <U+017F>hall endeavour to forbear

With tho<U+017F>e words reaching forth his hand to me, he bad me fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;
and having commanded his Squire to help me up on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
again to come for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in order to the cure of my
wounds, he took another way, and left me, much more troubled

                        <p>Being gotten on hor<U+017F>e-back again by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his Squire,
I took my way towards this City, much about the <U+017F>etting of the
Sun, and came into it before it was quite dark, <U+017F>o weakened, that
I was hardly able to <U+017F>tand. As to what hath pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ince, I <U+017F>hall

from a real repentance I now make to you, may in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure

too important, and too too deplorable for me to hope any pardon
from you, though I have obtained it from him, who hath been
the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ufferer thereby, and whom I had offended mo<U+017F>t;
but I fear me, I have received my puni<U+017F>hment from tho<U+017F>e that

injured, or that his wounds troubled him, he would not make any

apprehen<U+017F>ions were tho<U+017F>e of joy, and that neither of them could,
without being infinitely glad, entertain the news, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
had ever been a con<U+017F>tant lover, and a faithful friend, and that
they could not any longer doubt of that innocence which
they <U+017F>o much wi<U+017F>hed. They looked one upon another during this
fir<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ion, and in their countenances expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed their

were onely tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons in the chamber, <U+017F>he gave them a brief
